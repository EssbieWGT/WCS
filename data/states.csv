The survey, released Thursday, also finds political anxiety barely moved over the last six months, even as partisans remain deeply split in how they view public institutions and national politics.
“Mail voting in Virginia isn’t going anywhere, at least in the near term, which seems to be fine with most Virginians,” said Harry Wilson, interim director for the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College. “They are also happy to have a photo ID requirement, though it isn’t clear how that squares with mail voting.”
Large majorities of Virginians support requiring a government-issued photo ID (82%), automatically registering eligible citizens (66%) and allowing any voter to cast a ballot by mail (65%). Views on “ballot harvesting,” which allows a person to collect and submit the completed ballots of others, remain mixed: A small majority (53%) opposes banning the practice, while 43% support a ban.
More respondents say absentee ballots increase turnout and make elections more accurate (55%) than say they lead to falsified or miscounted ballots (42%).
 Trump and Youngkin ratings

The poll shows Virginia residents continue to give low marks to President Donald Trump. His job disapproval rating rose to 63% — higher than in the October survey — and his favorability rating declined seven points, though it remains close to typical levels recorded in past Roanoke College polling.
Asked how best to describe Trump, the plurality selected “criminal” (30%), followed by “leader” (23%), “disruptor” (18%), “fascist” (16%) and “visionary” (11%). Those views split sharply along party lines.
“Democrats and Republicans continue to view things, almost everything, through a different lens,” Wilson said. “Their levels of political anxiety and descriptions of Trump remain relatively steady if vastly different.”
Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s numbers remain steady. Just weeks before he is set to leave office, his job approval stands at 54%, roughly in line with his average throughout his term. His favorability rating (50% favorable, 40% unfavorable) is also largely unchanged from August.
Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger enters office with the strongest showing of the three, recording a 56% favorable rating — her highest mark in the Roanoke poll — and 33% unfavorable.
 Partisan divides and the political climate

A majority of Virginians say they trust the federal government to do what is right only sometimes (56%) or never (25%). Yet 58% believe ordinary citizens can influence Washington. Most (59%) say their side has been losing more than winning on important issues.
Nearly half of respondents (49%) say they are dissatisfied with how the federal government is working, while 27% say they are angry — the highest combined level of discontent since 2017, though only slightly above the May measurement. 
A majority (53%) believes the country’s best years are behind it; 44% say the best years lie ahead. And 61% say the federal government makes their life worse, compared with 35% who say it makes their life better.
The poll’s political anxiety index stands at 81.26, down eight points since May — a small shift that masks wide partisan gaps.
Democratic anxiety rose dramatically from May 2024 (-10.39) to November 2024 (101.77) and now sits at 155.42, nearly identical to where it stood in May 2025 (153.36). 
Republican anxiety followed the opposite arc last year, falling from 166.59 in May 2024 to 13.52 in November 2024, and has remained steady this year (-30.10 in May and -34.13 in November).
The index continues to track closely with which party controls the White House and Congress.
 Trust in polling and the media

A small majority of Virginians (54%) say they trust the polling industry a great deal (10%) or some (44%). But skepticism remains, as 30% trust pollsters “not very much,” and 14% don’t trust them at all. A majority (56%) believes pollsters slant their results to fit their own views, while 40% believe pollsters try to measure opinions accurately.
A plurality of respondents has limited (40%) or no (23%) trust that the media report the news fully, accurately and fairly — nearly identical to results in November 2024. 
Wilson pushed back on assumptions about partisan or ideological slant.
“Lastly, while some (or even many) of you may not believe it, all reputable pollsters attempt to measure opinion accurately and don’t slant the results to fit our views,” he said. 
Three-fourths of Virginians (74%) say the country is on the wrong track — the most negative view in two years — while half (50%) say the commonwealth is moving in the right direction, roughly unchanged since August.
The Roanoke College Poll was conducted by IPOR between Nov. 9 and Nov. 14, 2025. The 819 interviews included random telephone calls and texts to 450 Virginians and 369 responses drawn from a proprietary online panel. 
The survey’s weighted margin of error is 5.25%.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-04 14:30:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,A new bold plan aims to help more Jackson third graders read on grade level,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/04/jps-third-grade-reading-plan/,A new Jackson Public Schools initiative aims to help more third graders improve their reading skills.,"Michael Cormack felt like he’d been punched in the stomach. 
In May, Jackson Public Schools’ deputy superintendent was at his desk in the district’s central office, with the most recent third grade reading test results spread in front of him. As he thumbed through the papers, which showed that just over half of the students tested passed the state assessment on the first try, the knot in his stomach grew. 
He realized he had to do something — immediately. Within weeks, Project 75 was born. 
Project 75 is a reading initiative with an ambitious goal: to boost the percentage of third graders in JPS who pass the state assessment on the first attempt from 55% to 75%. Cormack presented his plan for Project 75 to the school board in August, but the initiative kicked off in earnest in mid-November. 
It’s a bold leap, but based on the data about students’ ultimate success rate, Cormack believes it’s possible. 
In 2013, state lawmakers passed the Literacy-Based Promotion Act aimed at increasing reading proficiency. The legislation put a historic amount of money and resources toward the goal and established a third grade reading “gate.” To get promoted to fourth grade, students have three tries to pass, or score 3 out of 5 or higher, on the reading portion of the state English Language Arts assessment.
Students have increasing success with each attempt. This past year, about 70% of JPS third graders ultimately scored high enough to move to the next grade, 15 points lower than the statewide average. 
“What that indicates to me is that there is some latent knowledge that scholars activate, and there’s a level of seriousness and intensity once we get the initial scores back,” Cormack said. “But what we want to do is to tap into those energies early to ensure that out the gate, the performance is strong.”
Largely thanks to the literacy act, the percentage of Mississippi’s fourth graders scoring advanced or proficient on the National Assessment of Education Progress has steadily grown, going from last in the country to ninth. But a closer look at the data reveals districts that still struggle, including Jackson. 
Cormack, whose background includes K-12 teaching and leading the Barksdale Reading Institute, reviewed hundreds of files for every student who failed the state reading test last year. The documents arrived by milk crate this spring, after being reviewed by school-level administrators.

What he found was, in many cases, students were not getting the targeted support they needed. 
At the start of each school year, JPS teachers assess students to identify their strengths and weaknesses. That test helps teachers determine students’ specific instructional needs to improve their weakest academic areas. 
However, in practice, that tailored instruction wasn’t always happening. 
“We know exactly where our students need help,” Cormack said. “So why can’t we do it?”
Project 75 aims to close those gaps by giving students targeted, tiered, thorough support. The plan involves seven strategies that center around data, district-wide coordination, professional development, monitoring and focused student learning.
Some action items include scheduling standing meetings with school leaders and staff to review data and adjust teaching, tracking student progress, offering more professional development for teachers on the science of reading and assigning struggling students to the district’s most successful teachers. 
Project 75 also includes an afterschool component for second graders and third graders who need extra help.
LaRoy Merrick, principal of Walton Elementary School, said some parts of the plan were already being implemented ahead of the fall start date. Early in the year, for example, school leaders identified their students who struggle the most with reading, grouped them together and ensured they received one-on-one help from a reading interventionist in a small setting.
Merrick also realized that his special education teachers — whose students are in the school’s bottom 25% of readers — needed to learn how to teach reading, so he sent them for training.
In preparing for the Project 75 kickoff, Galloway Elementary staff reviewed absenteeism rates, discovering that some of their least proficient readers were also regularly missing school, Principal Natasha Simmons said. 
Simmons said she’s impressed upon her staff the importance of the goal in front of them. 
“They’re going to have to do an obsessive amount of reading to pass that test,” Simmons said. “So we’re attacking this in a number of ways.”
The stakes are high. Research shows that reading is fundamental to academic success throughout schooling, which correlates with career success, financial security and better health outcomes. 
“It can create a snowball effect,” Cormack said of reading. “When scholars are retained, we also know they enter a higher risk category for not successfully graduating high school. That’s not a reality that we want to live with, so we know the urgency of getting this right.”
The initial impact of Project 75 won’t be revealed for months, until the third graders take the state reading test in May. But if the district falls short, Cormack is sure of one thing. 
They’ll keep trying.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/07060702/school-bus-1-scaled.jpg,,,2025-12-04 09:56:38.171520

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas accountant stole $400,000 from his family, transferred it to a fake ranch, then used the funds to pay for construction of his new home.
Quintin Flanagin was a certified public accountant in northwestern Kansas, and his family members were clients at his firm. In January 2022, Flanagin added Middle Finger Ranch to one of his personal banking accounts, according to federal court documents.
That January, he began an 8-month scheme, funneling money through checks and wire transfers into the Middle Finger Ranch, swindling more than $400,000. He wrote six checks, many of which contained false memo lines attributing the stolen money to farm operations, the court documents said.
When Flanagin’s family discovered discrepancies in their accounts, he created fabricated flow charts and blamed others for the fraudulent checks, said federal prosecutor Ryan Kriegshauser in a news release from the Kansas district’s U.S. Attorney’s Office.
“The name of Mr. Flanagin’s fictitious ranch speaks for itself,” Kriegshauser said. “After stabbing his family in the back, Flanagin lied to their faces.”
A grand jury indicted the 45-year-old Colby resident in June 2024 after investigations by the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and the FBI. He pleaded guilty earlier this year to one count each of wire fraud, bank fraud, false statements and money laundering. He was sentenced Wednesday to four years in federal prison.
“In his hubris, Flanagin thought he could outsmart federal investigators and forensic accountants,” Kriegshauser said. “He was wrong.”
Stephen Cyrus, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Kansas City Field Office, said Flanagin’s sentencing reflects the severity of the case and how seriously the FBI takes financial fraud.
“Mr. Flanagin was entrusted with a fiduciary duty to protect the financial interests of the victims in this case,” Cyrus said. “Instead of acting with integrity and in the interest of his clients, the defendant used his position to personally benefit from the scheme.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P7251374-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-04 09:56:38.171520
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-04 14:21:47+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,AG’s suit against Meta hits the SJC,Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/courts/ags-suit-against-meta-hits-the-sjc/,"The case, scheduled for oral argument Friday morning, puts Massachusetts at the center of a debate over Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from lawsuits over user-generated content.","TWO YEARS AGO, Attorney General Andrea Campbell took Meta – Mark Zuckerberg’s monolith that owns Facebook and Instagram – to court over claims that its platform designs and features exploit children and keep them hooked on addictive content. On Friday, the Supreme Judicial Court will be the first state high court in the nation to consider whether those platform designs are shielded by a law protecting publishers from being sued over the content of their websites.
The case, scheduled for oral argument Friday morning, puts Massachusetts at the center of a debate over Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The court will consider whether the 1996 federal law that protects internet companies from lawsuits over user-generated content extends to claims about platform design.
Campbell filed the lawsuit in Suffolk Superior Court in October 2023, joining a bipartisan coalition of 42 attorneys general who sued Meta in an array of federal and state courts. The Massachusetts complaint alleges that Meta violated state consumer protection law and created a public nuisance by deliberately designing Instagram with features like infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications, and “like” buttons to addict young users, then falsely represented the platform’s safety to the public. The company has also been reckless with age verification, the AG argues, and allowed children under 13 years old to access its content. 
Suffolk Superior Court Judge Peter Krupp denied Meta’s motion to dismiss the case in October 2024, writing, Meta’s statements about its safety “are belied by its internal data showing that Instagram addicts and harms children. Meta had repeatedly deprioritized youth well-being to increase revenue.” 
The case is before the high court because Meta wants to challenge Krupp’s ruling that it was not entitled to immunity – a procedural move that bumped the case up to the SJC even though the lower court has not decided its merits.  The state’s complaint relies heavily on Meta’s own internal research, which allegedly showed the company understood Instagram’s features were harming teenagers but concealed this knowledge to maximize profits. According to Campbell’s lawsuit, Meta secretly utilizes design features that “deliberately exploit and capitalize off young users’ unique vulnerabilities” and overcome their ability to self-regulate time on the platform.  The complaint alleges that young Massachusetts users are induced into using Instagram for multiple hours a day, often instead of homework or sleep, in an addictive manner they cannot self-regulate.  Research cited in the lawsuit shows that for adolescents, mental health steeply declines after one hour of daily social media use. As hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts teenagers actively use Instagram, the lawsuit alleges the website’s practices have burdened Massachusetts school systems and added to health care expenditures.   
“This addiction, according to Meta’s own data, has caused widespread mental and physical harm to children,” the AG’s office wrote. “The Commonwealth has been left to grapple with the extent of that harm.”  Meta argues that Section 230 bars the entire case. The law states that “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” Courts have broadly interpreted this to protect websites from lawsuits over content posted by users.  In its filings, Meta argues that its products are fundamentally based on third-party content.  For that reason, the company says, its platform features and design cannot, on their own, be held responsible for any problematic behavior related to use of the platforms.   
Simply put, it wrote, “if there were no videos to play, there would be no ‘autoplay.’ Nor does the Complaint allege how users would be addicted to Instagram if there was no content on the service. Regardless of Meta’s publishing choices, if Instagram had no content, and instead displayed a blank screen upon loading, no one would use it, nor could possibly claim that they were addicted to the service.” 
Meta’s argument extends beyond user content. The company contends that Section 230 also protects its editorial choices about how to organize and present that content, including through design features like notifications, infinite scroll, and autoplay. Meta further argues the First Amendment bars claims targeting its content moderation policies and algorithms.  Judge Krupp rejected these arguments. The issue at hand included false statements that Meta made about their safety, he said, which would not be the type of content protected by Section 230. The design and moderation choices are also fair game, Krupp said, because the state “is principally seeking to hold Meta liable for its own business conduct,” not content posted by third parties.  “The Commonwealth alleges that Instagram’s features in and of themselves, regardless of their associated content, cause its young users to become addicted to the platform,” Krupp wrote.  Meta appealed to the SJC, challenging the denial of its Section 230 defense.  
“The evidence will demonstrate our commitment to supporting young people,” a Meta spokesperson wrote after the ruling. The company recently announced new “Teen Accounts” on Instagram, a protected experience that automatically limits who can contact teens and the content they see.  Justices on Friday will consider two questions, the first of which is whether the high court should be considering the appeal at all. A legal doctrine allows parties to appeal if they are denied immunity they think they are entitled to by law, so the question that the SJC will consider for the first time is whether Section 230 creates an immunity from suit and therefore whether Meta can appeal the lower court’s denial to bring the question before the SJC. 
But the philosophical meat of the suit is whether Meta is actually immune from the consumer protection and public nuisance lawsuits because of Section 230.   The case has attracted significant attention from free speech advocates. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) and TechFreedom both filed amicus briefs urging the court to reverse Krupp’s ruling and affirm Meta’s immunity from lawsuits over the design of its platforms.  
Campbell’s argument is part of a long history of panic over unfettered speech, argued FIRE in its brief. People can make choices about how they want to consume their entertainment and information, they note, and young people are no more at risk of being overwhelmed by the style of social media than literary figures of old were by books. 
“The Commonwealth is concerned that the speech is too powerful,” it wrote. “They think minors are like Don Quixote, transfixed by stories and ideas. This problem, however—if it’s a problem—is not for the Commonwealth to fix. Under the First Amendment, the strong effects of speech are an inherent part of speech—not a ground for regulation.”  
Law professors Jane Bambauer and Eugene Volokh argued in an amicus brief that social media platforms create expressive products and their features “stem from constitutionally protected decisions about where, when, and how speech is communicated.”
Campbell’s office argues that Meta’s attempt to distinguish between content moderation and design features creates a false distinction. The state contends that, just as Meta may curate posts through content moderation policies, it may approve of and encourage speech through design features that are separate from the third-party content itself. 
Campbell argues that “by designing and using addictive design features on Instagram to exploit children’s psychological vulnerabilities,” Meta falsely represented that its features were not addictive and in fact prioritized youth health and safety.  The Massachusetts case is one of several challenging Section 230’s reach.  
In October 2024, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, overseeing multidistrict litigation in California involving more than 30 states, rejected Meta’s motion to dismiss similar claims. However, no state supreme court has yet ruled on whether Section 230 shields social media companies from lawsuits targeting platform design.  Massachusetts is part of a bipartisan effort led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti. Thirty-three states joined the federal lawsuit, while nine states, including Massachusetts, filed in their own state courts. 
In an amicus brief filed in the Massachusetts case, the coalition of attorneys general wrote that Meta’s attempts to ask higher courts to wade in on the immunity question “and expand the scope of Section 230 have the potential to sow confusion among the courts.” They noted that Meta has universally lost, in part or in full, in its motions to dismiss based on the publishers’ immunity.  As Campbell put it in announcing the lawsuit in October 2023, “based on its own internal research, Meta knew of the significant harm these practices caused to teenage users and chose to hide its knowledge and mislead the public to make a profit.”  The SJC’s ruling could determine whether that alleged knowledge and those choices are subject to state consumer protection laws, or whether Section 230 places them beyond the reach of state enforcement.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pemberton.johnadamscourthousejpg-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C641&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-04 09:56:38.171520

On Friday, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will hear arguments in a pivotal one, centered on whether the Commonwealth can continue to pursue its case against Meta, the tech giant that owns Facebook and Instagram.  
Attorney General Andrea Campbell has accused Meta of designing their platforms to be addictive for minors, while falsely representing to the public that they prioritized youth health and safety. Meta is hoping to escape the lawsuit not by defending itself on the merits, but by arguing that a federal law known as Section 230 means that the company should be pre-emptively immune from legal challenges over how it designs its platforms. 
How to hold social media companies accountable for their effects on our children, health, and safety continues to be hotly debated, while the companies themselves argue they bear no responsibility whatsoever for what happens on their platforms.  
Over the last few years, state attorneys general and private litigators across the country have been prosecuting a set of these cases against Meta. One of the lawsuits recently revealed a trove of internal documents that depict Meta’s corporate culture as one of callous disregard for the health and safety of our children. 
Section 230 says that courts cannot treat tech companies as the “publisher” of user-generated content. Ever since the law was passed in the 1990s, tech companies have tried to convince courts that Section 230 immunizes them from liability for any activity that can be characterized as “publishing”—which, the companies argue, encompasses almost everything they do.  
The companies have met with varying degrees of success. But with the advent of sophisticated, highly designed platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, courts have increasingly rejected Big Tech’s characterization of Section 230 as a broad immunity shield. 
And for good reason. As we explained in an amicus brief we filed in the Supreme Judicial Court with various non-profits and legal scholars, Congress didn’t intend Section 230 to be a catch-all, get-out-of-jail free card for Big Tech. It was meant to serve the limited but important purpose of preventing companies that host user-generated content online from facing unlimited liability for harm caused by that content—particularly when that liability is tied to a company’s choice to moderate the content on their platforms.  
If companies had to ensure that their platforms were completely free from any content that could carry legal liability, they would be forced to either abandon content moderation, extensively monitor and censor user speech, or stop hosting user-generated content altogether, creating what we refer to as “the moderator’s dilemma.” All of these choices are bad for the online speech environment, which is why Section 230 prohibits forcing companies into the dilemma.  
Holding Meta—and other tech companies—accountable for designing their platforms to be addictive for kids does not force Meta into the moderator’s dilemma. Our brief explains how the platform features at the heart of the Commonwealth’s case—things like infinite scroll, autoplay, the timing and batching of push notifications, and other tactics borrowed from the gambling industry—have nothing to do with content moderation; they are designed to elicit a behavior on the part of the user that furthers the company’s own business goals.  
You don’t have to take our word for it. We examined companies’ patents, describing in their own words these goals—such as extended use or increased return visits—that are independent of the user-generated content displayed. We also detailed how Meta could choose alternative designs that mitigate the harm to kids without touching any user-generated content. 
In short, applying Section 230 in this case would not protect online speech at all. The only effect would be to further incentivize Meta to disregard user safety as it designs its products to maximize profits.  
Section 230 serves an important purpose. But that purpose is not served by applying it in this case. Not giving Meta Section 230 protections won’t break the internet. It won’t even mean that Meta is automatically liable. All it would mean is that the victims of real harm that might have been facilitated by an online company’s own design choices would have their day in court, something they deserve to have.

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
California, whose unemployment rate has been at 5% and above for the past couple of years, is likely to see a weak job market through at least early next year, according to the winter UCLA Anderson forecast published this week. 
Authors of the longtime economic forecast cited continued uncertainty around tariffs, deportations and federal funding as factors.
Based on year-over-year data through August, the economists said weak or declining jobs growth affected construction, nondurable goods manufacturing, retail, and leisure and hospitality. Business services jobs, which include professionals in the tech industry, lawyers, accountants and architects, fell in the following major regions: Silicon Valley, San Joaquin Valley, Sacramento and the Delta, San Diego and the Inland Empire. 
The sectors that showed job growth in the past year — state and local government, education, health care and social services, and farms — could shrink in 2026 because of budget constraints, federal funding cuts or deportations, the economists said. 
Possible bright spots include aerospace and artificial intelligence. But “for the California economy to grow faster than the U.S. economy, as it is accustomed to doing, durable goods manufacturing, including aerospace and technology-laden sectors, will have to rebound strongly,” the economists wrote. They added that the state and nation have seen a decline in manufacturing jobs, and “the timing of a turnaround in this sector remains uncertain.”
Based on what happened after mass deportations from 2008 to 2014, the forecast’s authors said they expect continued deportations to have a negative effect on the California economy both in terms of decreased local consumption and a drop in other employment. That’s because jobs of immigrants lacking permanent legal status and those of U.S.-born workers can be complementary. 
“For example, home building could be delayed because of a reduction in skilled roofers,” the economists wrote.

Reporting unlawful federal conduct to CA

Californians who witness potentially unlawful conduct by federal agents can report what they saw to the state via a new online portal unveiled Wednesday.
As President Donald Trump’s administration continues its crackdown on immigrants — at times deploying plain-clothes, masked federal immigration enforcement agents — California Attorney General Rob Bonta is urging residents to report “excessive force, unnecessary detentions and unconstitutional searches.”

Bonta, at a press conference: “Over the last 10 months we’ve seen troubling reports coming from communities across California, including unmarked, military-style vehicles and individuals detained in ways that resemble abductions and kidnappings more than lawful arrests. Californians are scared and they’re right to question whether federal agents are respecting the law.” 

Bonta added that while reporting an incident helps the state “monitor and address” potential misconduct, it will not prompt any particular or immediate response from state authorities. 
More on CA and Trump: On Tuesday Bonta said that California, along with 21 other states, secured a preliminary injunction to block the Trump administration from refusing Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood. 
In the ruling, the federal judge sided with the states’ arguments that Trump’s policy change was an unconstitutional “retroactive condition that … could not have anticipated when (states) joined Medicaid,” and that the costs to states to comply with the policy “constitute an irreparable harm.” The ruling provided the Trump administration seven days to file and appeal.

California, Santa Clara County and the city of San Francisco are suing the Trump administration over policy changes it issued last month, which shifts federal homelessness funds in a way that decreases money for permanent housing, writes CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall.
The lawsuits argue that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development illegally bypassed Congress’ authority when it enacted new rules prohibiting jurisdictions that are applying for a piece of a $4-billion federal homelessness fund from spending more than 30% of their grant on permanent housing.
Most experts agree that permanent housing is one of the most effective ways to solve homelessness. Last year, California communities won more than $683 million in federal homelessness funds, 90% of which went toward permanent housing projects. Those projects currently house tens of thousands of people, who may become homeless again due to the rule change, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. 
HUD Secretary Scott Turner in a statement last month said the changes are aimed at “stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis … and incentivized never-ending government dependency.” 
This is the 47th lawsuit California filed against the second Trump administration.

CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: California’s poorly performing public school system lacks accountability because its governing structure includes overlapping bits of authority that undermine cohesiveness. 
The idea that California can be powered solely by solar, wind and hydro is unrealistic, and in order to really meet its climate goals the state needs nuclear power, writes Leonard Rodberg, professor emeritus of Urban Studies at Queens College, City University of New York.

Amnesty International, a humanitarian group spanning 150 countries, alleged in 48-pages that the federal Krome North Services Processing Center and — to a far greater degree — the state-run Everglades site the DeSantis administration calls “Alligator Alcatraz” have engaged in practices that could violate international law.
They’ll send their report to Congress and the United Nations later this week, demanding an independent investigation into the centers, the organization said.
The Florida governor’s office and the Department of Homeland Security deny wrongdoing and the existence of any non-compliant standards at the facilities. They insisted the report was a “fabrication” or a “hoax” that could rile up anti-ICE sentiment.
“We were all shocked and horrified by what we saw,” Amy Fischer, Amnesty’s executive director for Refugee and Migrant Rights, told the Phoenix. She toured Krome with five colleagues in September and interviewed four detainees, all of whom had previously been held at the Everglades site.  
None of them has a final removal order, the report says. 
Their accounts paint a disturbing picture of extended solitary confinement at Krome, a 2-by-2-foot punishment “box” — compared to a lion’s cage at a circus — complete with shackles in the Everglades, and poor medical conditions at both South Florida centers.
One detainee claimed there was a death at the Everglades site, although it “went unreported” because “there’s no way to know what actually happened to the person because we’re not registered in ICE’s system.”
Amnesty only toured Krome. ICE denied its request to tour the Glades County Detention Center, which also houses immigration detainees, and the Florida Division of Emergency Management never responded to its tour request, the report says.
They didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment, either.
The Phoenix was unable to independently verify the four men’s stories. Amnesty’s report kept them anonymous, aside from their nationalities and immigration status.

‘Alligator Alcatraz’
Florida under Gov. Ron DeSantis firmly cemented its status as the leading anti-undocumented immigration state in July after President Donald Trump flew to the heart of the Everglades to celebrate the opening of the nation’s first state-run migrant detention center: Alligator Alcatraz.
The sprawling, former training airport, now rife with industrial tents, can hold up to 3,000 detainees at a time in caged areas. And it hasn’t been without its controversies.
Lawsuits from Democrats, environmentalists, and activist groups have decried a lack of transparency surrounding humanitarian conditions, who is being detained, and environmental consequences.
Past reports have claimed the facility is flood-prone with poor food and features a “box” used for punishment. 
Amnesty International claims that’s all true.
“People ended up in the ‘box,’ just for asking the guards for anything,” a Venezuelan man identified as an asylum seeker told Amnesty. “I saw a guy who was put in it for an entire day.”
“One time, two people in my cell were calling out to the guards telling them that I needed my medication,” a Chilean migrant said. He recounted how he was arrested by ICE while driving to the doctor for a case of pneumonia before being jailed in Walton County for three days. 
He was bused to the center around 9 p.m. on a Friday, shackled until 4 a.m. without “any food or water,” he added.
“Ten guards rushed into the cell and threw them to the ground. They were taken to the ‘box’ and punished just for trying to help me,” he continued. “Any time that anyone demanded that our rights be respected, they were punished.”
Fischer told the Phoenix that the “box” resembled a lion’s cage at a circus, standing at just two-feet tall by two-feet wide. She said shackles are attached to its floor, and that it was kept in the “hot Florida sun.”
“People have to stay there for hours shackled and denied food and water as a form of punishment,” she said. “Amnesty’s analysis, based upon the use of the box, we have found that it meets the definition of torture under international law.”
“It’s a copy of Guantánamo,” a Cuban man identified as an asylum seeker told Amnesty. He was detained there for 11 days. “The conditions are inhuman.”
Thirty-two people are locked in a 1,000 square foot “cage” inside of a tent holding eight cages, the report says. There are three toilets per cage with cameras affixed above them, although another Cuban migrant said the toilets were frequently clogged “and s*** overflowed from them.”
They claimed staff would keep the bright “stadium lights” on 24/7.
The report alleges other malfeasance, including “racism,” lengthy delays in medical attention, and migrants getting just minutes to speak with their attorneys on a collect-call phone. 
‘Fabrications’ and a ‘hoax’
The Florida governor’s office and the Department of Homeland Security vehemently pushed back on Amnesty’s allegations in statements to the Phoenix. They contended it contains fabrications that could stir up violent animosity toward immigration officials.
“​​Another day and another hoax about Alligator Alcatraz,” wrote DHS Assistant Director Tricia McLaughlin. “Nearly every single day, my office responds to media questions on FALSE allegations about Alligator Alcatraz. The media is clearly desperate for these allegations of inhumane conditions at this facility to be true.
“Feces are not overflowing in the toilets. Just like no one has died,” she continued. “These types of smears are directly contributing to our officers facing a 1,153% increase in assaults against them. 
“Here are the facts: Alligator Alcatraz does meet federal detention standards. All detainee facilities are clean. Any allegations of inhumane conditions are FALSE. When will the media stop peddling hoaxes about illegal alien detention centers and start focusing on American victims of illegal alien crime?”
A Los Angeles Times investigation suggests that figure overstates the seriousness of the problem. However, a sniper targeted a Dallas ICE facility in September, opening fire on agents and migrants alike. Two detainees were killed. On July 4, a group of suspects launched a coordinated attack on the Prairieland ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Texas, using fireworks to lure officers into an ambush.
DeSantis’ press secretary, Molly Best, echoed McLaughlin in her statement to the Phoenix.
“This ‘report’ is nothing more than a politically motivated attack,” she said. “None of these fabrications are true. In fact, running these allegations without any evidence whatsoever could jeopardize the safety and security of our staff and those being housed at Alligator Alcatraz.”

‘Amounts to torture’
The Everglades site wasn’t the only center Amnesty believes to have violated international standards.
At Krome in western Miami, the report details an ICE-led tour throughout parts of the federal detention center. 
One section they entered was the solitary confinement ward. ICE officials told Amnesty that the minimum duration for solitary confinement is 24 hours and that the maximum is 30 days, though that can be extended, the report says.
One man held in solitary confinement put a sign through the metal flap in the door reading, “Help Me. I’m on Hunger Strike.” He had a broken hand, and ICE told the researchers he was being held there because of his hunger strike. 
“The man showed Amnesty his bruised and mangled hand and said he had been waiting 37 days to receive medical attention,” the report says. 
“As the man was describing his injuries, an ICE official repeatedly and violently slammed the metal flap against the injured man’s hands and forced Amnesty International out of the solitary confinement area, stating, ‘This is a detained population. They can be dangerous. Allow security to do their jobs, also he’s not on a hunger strike. He ate yesterday and today.’”
Because the United Nations considers solitary confinement in excess of 15 days to amount to “torture,” Amnesty found that the detention conditions at Krome “do not comply with international human rights law and standards.” 
“Individuals are held in unsanitary and overcrowded conditions, face prolonged or arbitrary solitary confinement, lack adequate access to legal counsel and medical care, and experience treatment that collectively amounts to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment,” the report says.
“The use of prolonged solitary confinement at Krome and the use of the ‘box’ at “Alligator Alcatraz” amount to torture or other ill-treatment.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224536667.jpg,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

Gavin Newsom is a longtime ally of the tech industry. Asked about its leaders’ rightward shift, he downplayed the moves while still offering some criticism.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom is a longtime ally of the tech industry. Asked about its leaders’ rightward shift, he downplayed the moves while still offering some criticism.


Despite watching one after another of his state’s tech titans head to the White House to seek President Donald Trump’s favor, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday he doesn’t begrudge the industry’s rightward swing — mostly.
“It’s very situational with a lot of these guys,” he said when asked about tech businessmen going to “the other side.” “They are and they aren’t … I don’t see it as as big a shift as perhaps others do.”
His comments at a New York Times finance summit underscored the governor’s balancing act with the tech industry, even as his relationship with its major businesses has been strained by Trump this year. Though he has excoriated law firms and universities for “selling out” to Trump administration demands this year — even threatening to pull state funding from California universities that sign certain agreements with the president — Newsom has walked a finer line when it comes to tech. 
“I think it’s a little bit more, I don’t want to say the word transactional, but it’s fiduciary,” he said of tech leaders’ decisions to curry favor with Trump . 
Newsom, who was San Francisco mayor in the 2000s, has long been close with tech leaders. As governor, he counts on the industry’s outsized gains to keep a massive state budget balanced. As a possible 2028 presidential contender, he could find Silicon Valley’s deep-pocketed donors helpful. 
The relationship has made Newsom a reliable politician in the industry’s corner as lawmakers in his own party increasingly push for regulations on social media and its effects on children, data centers’ use of environmental resources and artificial intelligence’s proliferation into workplaces, adolescent relationships and daily life. 
While Newsom has signed some of those bills, particularly ones in which advocates negotiated with tech companies, he’s also vetoed several out of concern that overregulating a nascent industry would drive it out of state. And he’s vehemently opposing a proposed wealth tax that would undoubtedly touch tech executives. 
Tech titans cozy up to Trump
That’s been the case this year despite Silicon Valley’s increasing coziness with Trump, whom Newsom has criticized for threatening industries with tariffs to extract concessions and demanding loyalty from private business executives. The relationship has affected California in a number of ways, from Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s aggressive pursuit of federal firings and cost-cuttings earlier this year to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff’s suggestion that Trump send the National Guard to San Francisco, precipitating a nervous few days in October as the president moved to start immigration raids there. Benioff later walked back his statements and Trump said he relented after talking with him and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.
Peter Leroe-Muñoz, a senior vice president at the industry group Bay Area Council, praised Newsom for nevertheless understanding “the value of the innovation our member companies produce.”
“While the governor may not always agree with innovation companies and how they choose to operate or conduct themselves, at the end of the day the governor recognizes that we all have a stake in the success of California and so not cutting off ties or undermining those industry players is in the long term success of the Golden State,” Leroe-Muñoz said last month. 
“There needs to be levels of ethics that are demanded of these leaders.” Gov. Gavin Newsom, referring to tech leaders who make deals with Trump
Still, Newsom offered some criticism of the industry’s relationship with Trump on Wednesday, calling it “self-dealing” that the president’s AI and crypto czar David Sacks, along with many other investors and chipmakers, have reportedly been in line to profit from Trump’s AI directives. 
“There needs to be levels of ethics that are demanded of these leaders,” he said. “That entire ecosystem has benefited from it. California has benefited from it. But I do not think it’s healthy for capitalism.”
And he called Apple CEO Tim Cook’s ability to strike a deal with Trump to get tariff exemptions for critical parts of the iPhone supply chain “by definition, crony capitalism.”
“How about the farmers and ranchers in California, how about all the small businesses that can’t pick up the phone and get an exemption on their tariffs?” Newsom said. “It breaks my heart.”
But he acknowledged Cook was serving his shareholders: “Do I begrudge that? Yes. Do I begrudge him? Not as much.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/080725-Newsom-Tech-AI-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

Spencer Cox holds a press conference to present his budget proposal at the Salt Lake County Library in Kearns on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Thanks to tax cuts from the “one, big, beautiful” law, Utah won’t collect about half a billion dollars of income tax revenue in coming years — about $300 million in 2026 and $200 million in 2027. 
That’s according to Gov. Spencer Cox’s proposed budget unveiled Wednesday, which gives lawmakers a suggested roadmap to consider ahead of their 2026 legislative session, scheduled to begin Jan. 20. Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature typically doesn’t put finishing touches on the budget until the final days of the 45-day session, which will conclude in early March. 
Cox’s $30.7 billion budget proposal is notably less than the $30.8 billion budget the 2025 Utah Legislature adopted for the current fiscal year — which Cox said during his budget announcement at a Salt Lake County library in Kearns reflects a “flat year, for sure.” 
Though he said Utah has benefited from a growing economy, federal changes to tax policy within Congress’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act means Utah won’t collect about $500 million in corporate and individual income tax revenue during the 2026-2027 fiscal year that it otherwise would have without those tax cuts.

“We are complying with those changes, and we immediately adopt those changes in our state without changes coming from the Legislature,” Cox said, adding “we’re pleased to announce” a roughly $300 million “tax decrease” for Utah taxpayers in 2026. 
“That’s less revenue coming into the state, which means that we are holding things flat,” Cox said. 
The Trump administration’s tax cuts come at a time when Utah state leaders had already spent years chipping away at the state’s income taxes. Over the past five years, the Utah Legislature and Cox have approved a series of tax cuts that have resulted in a cumulative loss of $1.4 billion in revenue every year. 
Most of those cuts have come from knocking the state’s income tax rate down several pegs. The most recent reduction approved earlier this year brought the rate down to 4.5%. 
Under the Utah Constitution, the vast majority of Utah’s income tax revenue must be used to fund public education. As the Legislature has approved repeated income tax rate cuts, education advocates and others have expressed concerns about foregoing funding that could otherwise be used to bolster the state’s schools or other programs eligible for the funds. Utah’s per-pupil spending rank is consistently among the lowest in the nation.

But Republican legislative leaders have defended the cuts as necessary to keep Utah “competitive” with other states that have lower tax burdens. They’ve also argued in favor of allowing Utahns and businesses to keep more money in their pockets to help foster economic growth while balancing responsible government spending. 
Because of the federal tax cuts, Cox said he’s not recommending legislators pursue yet another income tax rate reduction during the 2026 session — though he did propose setting aside $2.5 million to expand the state’s child tax credit to families with children up to 3 years old. 
The governor’s budget office estimates that expanded child tax credit would provide an additional average benefit of about $220 to an estimated 11,100 families. 
That’s the only tax cut Cox is proposing this year. It remains to be seen what legislators will do and whether they’ll listen to his recommendations — or keep up with their pattern of incrementally slashing the state’s income tax rate. 
5 years after failure, Utah lawmakers haven’t taken another stab at tax reform. When will they?

When asked if he would support another state income tax cut in addition to the federal tax cuts if the Legislature approves one, Cox told reporters, “We haven’t had any direct conversations about anything above and beyond that.”
“Again, it’s a tight year,” he said, though he noted that he’s supported the tax cuts approved over the last five years. 
More broadly, though, the governor reiterated a point he’s made repeatedly in the past — encouraging lawmakers to consider holistic tax reform before continuing to chip away at the state’s income tax rate. 
“I’ve said before, if we want to get rid of the income tax, I would support that,” he said. “But it’s impossible for us to get rid of the income tax and still function as a state government. So what are we going to replace that with?”
However, in his budget proposal, Cox does call on the Legislature to pursue property tax reform — or policies to “right-size the property tax burden distribution between residential and commercial properties.” 
A legislative audit last year found Utah homeowners are carrying a disproportionate share of the state’s property tax burden because assessors find it more difficult to correctly determine the value of commercial property, resulting in a “tax shift” from one sector to another.
Even though the “flat” revenue year meant Cox’s administration had to say no to plenty of requests, the governor’s budget proposal outlines a list of priorities he wants lawmakers to consider. 
Here are some highlights from the governor’s budget proposal:
Education
For public education, Cox is recommending $654.2 million next fiscal year. That includes, according to his budget proposal:

$191.4 million for a 4.2% increase to the weighted pupil unit, which is the per-pupil rate used to calculate how much money each school should receive. 
$80 million for paraeducator grant programs, including $60 million for “targeted behavioral interventions in K-3 classrooms” and $20 million for reading support in elementary schools that have not met the statewide proficiency benchmark of 70% of third graders reading at grade level. 
$53.4 million safe learning, including $50 million for public schools to make “necessary safety upgrades” and $3.4 million for higher education institutions to “enhance campus safety.” 
$5 million to expand Promise Partnership Utah, an organization meant to build connections to support student success. 
$500,000 for a literacy campaign. Along with private donors, Cox said the campaign will put out ads and billboards meant to “remind people how important it is to read.” 

Utah first lady Abby Cox also spoke at the governor’s budget proposal announcement, saying they decided to hold Wednesday’s news conference at a library to showcase the importance of reading and literacy and how social media has created a “big hole” that needs to be filled with books.

After Wednesday’s budget announcement, the first lady read a book to a room full of children at the library. 
“It’s not unconnected to social media. The issues that we’re having with literacy is a direct result of us not reading and children not having access to books and not being read to,” Abby Cox said. 
As part of the governor’s continued push against social media and its damaging impacts to children, Cox’s budget proposal also calls for “taking action to hold social media companies accountable for the costs associated with” harmful effects of social media, including impacts to mental health of Utahns. 
Cox said he’s “hopeful” the Legislature will pass a “bell-to-bell” ban on cellphones in classrooms after stopping short of an all-day ban earlier this year. 
Homelessness 
Cox recommended the state use $25 million in one-time money and $20 million in ongoing money to help fund a new 1,300-bed homeless campus, while focusing that funding specifically on “homelessness and criminal justice high utilizers.”
The controversial project has been envisioned to help Utah be a “pilot” state to fulfill President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” 
Though the campus plans are still being formulated, the state’s top homeless leaders and Cox have expressed support for increasing capacity for people who are civilly committed — or court ordered into mental health treatment. 
Utah Gov. Cox proposes millions for homeless campus while also hoping for federal funds

They have also envisioned an “accountability center” or a “secure residential placement facility” for substance abuse treatment as an alternative to jail, where people who are “sanctioned” to go there would not be able to leave voluntarily. 
That project — not expected to be built until some time in 2027 — is also projected to cost much more than what the governor included in his budget, to the tune of at least $75 million to build and north of $34 million a year to operate. 
When asked about that funding gap, Cox said other partners, including local governments, “are going to have to play a role in that.” He’s also hoping by partnering with the Trump administration, Utah could get an infusion of federal funds to help with the campus. 
“Because of the government shut down, we haven’t made as much progress as we had hoped, but (those conversations) are ongoing,” Cox said, adding that state leaders have been reaching out to federal officials “because we believe that with the changes that are being made to some of those funding streams around homelessness, that this is the perfect project for the federal government to get involved, that it can be a model for the nation.” 
Trump’s executive order encourages cities and states to enforce stricter anti-camping laws, expands power to involuntarily treat and civilly commit people experiencing homelessness, and directs federal officials to end support for “Housing First” strategies, an approach to homelessness that prioritizes providing housing while offering — but not requiring — treatment. 
“We want to make Utah the worst place to camp on the street, and the best place to get help and support,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “This budget recognizes that homelessness is complex, and solving it requires long-term commitment, community partnership, and a willingness to act boldly on behalf of those who need help the most.”

Acknowledging the campus will entail a “long-term effort,” Cox said he also included $5 million in his budget proposal for The Other Side Village, a master-planned tiny home community in Salt Lake City meant for people transitioning out of chronic homelessness.
“We know that these investments will pay great dividends for our state,” Cox said. “We want to make sure people are not camping on our streets, are not making life dangerous for people who want to take their kids out … and we want to get services to those who are struggling with addiction and mental health.” 
Water
The governor has also recommended $53.8 million in “continued investments” for water infrastructure and conservation. That includes: 

$6.2 million for dam safety upgrades.
$5 million for the Great Salt Lake long-term water program, which will “cover water leases while building on $50 million in federal funding, $200 million in pledged private investment and the Great Salt Lake 2034 Charter.” 
$5 million to extend the Colorado River Demand Management Pilot Program to “keep Utah in the driver’s seat, and to minimize disruptions to agricultural production” as changes to water use in the Colorado River Basin loom due to drought, litigation and policy changes. 
$2.5 million for Utah’s Agriculture Voluntary Incentive Program, which helps farmers and ranchers to adopt sustainable practices like upgrading irrigation systems or improving nutrient management.

Other priorities
The governor has also recommended: 

$290.3 million for state employee compensation, a 2.6% cost of living adjustment for state employees, additional pay increases based on performance, and increased funding for health and dental insurance. 
$7.6 million for reduced-price school lunch, which reflects a three-year commitment to cover the National School Lunch Program’s reduced-price category. 
$5 million for the Utah National Guard, including $3.4 million for recruitment and retention bonuses and $1.6 million for tuition assistance. 
$3 million for domestic violence and sexual assault victim services, including $2.1 million for the Utah Office of Victims of Crime, and $886,000 for the Department of Health and Human Services to continue access to services including crisis intervention, shelter, therapy and case management. 
$1.8 million to fill funding gaps for Meals on Wheels, a program that provides more than 159,000 meals to seniors.

“The purpose of this is to let [Mohler] and just generally UA’s administration, know that this is not a popular move,” Omorose Emwanta, Leftist Collective at UA secretary, said in an interview Wednesday. “We do not think the basis for this suspension is sound and we want to reinstate it. I think they underestimated how valuable and popular these magazines are.”

On Monday, UA officials told members of Alice and Nineteen Fifty-Six that their publications would be suspended to remain compliant with a memo released over the summer by Attorney General Pam Bondi. The memo made non-binding recommendations on compliance with anti-diversity, equity and inclusion policies supported by the Trump administration.
Alex House, an associate director of communications at UA, said in a statement Tuesday the suspension of both magazines was to “ensure all members of our community feel welcome to participate in programs that receive university funding from the Office of Student Media.”
Other student organizations have spoken out against the university’s decision to shut down the publications.
“Nineteen Fifty-Six is not just a magazine but it is a beacon of light and one of the absolute greatest parts about our university,” the UA Afro-American Gospel Choir said in a statement posted to Instagram Wednesday. “There are no words that truly encapsulate how we truly feel. But we are incredibly saddened by this news. Their work has been imperative in telling our stories and the work they’ve done in front and behind the scenes does not go unnoticed.”
While both magazines were focused on specific demographics, there were no restrictions on who could contribute and work for the publications. Bondi’s memo did not provide specific guidance on student-run media serving particular communities.
The news of the suspension has gained national attention including an article in The New York Times.
A petition to reinstate the magazines was started on MoveOn saying the suspension of both publications “is a testing ground for the government and the current administration to see how far they can push.” As of Wednesday afternoon, it had over 2,100 signatures.
The University of Alabama has been removing spaces for marginalized groups on the campus for the past year and a half following passage of SB 129 in March 2024. The bill bans publicly-funded diversity, equity and inclusion programs as well as “divisive concepts.”
In August 2024, the university shut down the Safe Zone, a space for LGBTQ+ students, and a dedicated space for the Black Student Union, citing SB 129. In a filing in a federal lawsuit brought against the university by UA students and professors over the moves, attorneys for the school argued that reopening the spaces would constitute “unlawful discrimination,” citing the memo from Bondi. 
Attorneys for students and educators challenging SB 129 rejected the assertion, saying the memo was non-binding and said the spaces were open to all students regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation.
House said in a statement Tuesday that staff at the university “hope to work with students to develop a new publication that features a variety of voices and perspectives to debut in the next academic year.”
Emwanta said a new magazine isn’t what students want.
“A lot of people have cultivated audiences and communities and creative teams around both magazines and scrapping them to make something new and different is just not something that people are really, honestly looking for,” she said.

,California,2025-12-04 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s education leadership mishmash makes it hard to know who’s accountable,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/california-education-leadership-mishmash/,Experts say there are too many confusing layers in state and local education governance. The governor should hire the state's schools chief.,"California’s public school system, which purports to educate nearly 6 million students ranging from 4-year-olds in transitional kindergarten to near-adults preparing to graduate from high school, is in a world of hurt.
Its students perform poorly in national tests of academic achievement, some local school districts flirt with insolvency as unions press for raises to offset spikes in living costs, politicians wrangle over money while issuing a steady stream of mandates and demands and — on top of everything — nobody knows who is accountable for outcomes.
The lack of accountability stems from the construction — in layer after layer — of overlapping bits of authority that undermine cohesive governance. 
The governor, the state school board he or she appoints, an elected state schools superintendent, the Legislature, locally elected school boards and their superintendents, elected county school superintendents, elected county boards of education and the courts all have input.
When things are going well, such as an upward spike in test scores, there’s a rush to claim credit. But when problems arise, everyone involved points to someone or something else.
Finally, a prestigious collection of education experts is blowing the whistle. Policy Analysis for California Education, a consortium of education faculty at five major California universities, this week issued a detailed report on the lack of effective governance in education, how it evolved and how it might be improved.
“California’s education governance system is a complex network of agencies and entities designed to serve the most diverse and expansive TK–12 population in the United States,” the PACE report declares. “This system incorporates state, regional, and local levels of authority, each tasked with specific responsibilities and oversight. At its core, the structure seeks to balance statewide education goals with local control and accountability. However, its complexity often results in overlapping responsibilities, fragmented authority, and challenges in ensuring streamlined decision-making.
“The need to strengthen California’s education governance has never been more urgent,” PACE concludes. “Schools are grappling with deepening inequities, persistent opportunity gaps, and the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on student learning and well-being. At the same time, the federal government’s retreat from its traditional role in civil rights enforcement, accountability, research and evaluation, and oversight places even greater responsibility on states to lead. California must take bold and strategic steps now to ensure that its governance systems are not only coherent and efficient but also equity centered, transparent, and responsive to student needs.”
While the report advocates a wide rearrangement of responsibilities among the system’s many players, its most fundamental reform would place the governor at the top of the revised organizational chart while converting the elected state superintendent of public instruction into an ombudsman and independent critic, rather than the operational head of the state Department of Education.

The department would be managed by an appointee of the state Board of Education, whose members are named by the governor.
Reimagining the superintendent of public instruction as an independent evaluator and advocate for students “presents promising opportunities to strengthen systemwide accountability,” PACE says, “but it also introduces important trade-offs.” PACE questions if the office could still be influential if it lacks implementation authority.
The need to streamline authority and accountability in California’s school system is self-evident. A state that prides itself on being in the forefront of social progress still tolerates an education governance system created in the 19th century, one that has been augmented piecemeal with little thought about consequences and that prevents California’s voters and parents from really knowing who to hold accountable for obvious shortcomings.
That lack of clarity protects failure from exposure and inhibits successful programs from being duplicated. 
The PACE report’s proposed changes might not work. Giving the governor more authority might backfire. But we won’t know if we don’t try it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/052125_Paradise-School-Mental-Health_MG_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

(Photo courtesy Clark County)This story is the second in a series on the connections between housing instability and child welfare. This project was supported by the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s National Fellowship and Fund for Reporting on Child Well-Being.
It was a little after 4 a.m. on a May morning when Victoria left the homeless encampment she was staying at near Russell Road on the border of Henderson in order to catch a bus to Help of Southern Nevada. 
Victoria, who is using her first name for privacy, had just entered her third trimester while living on the streets and was desperate to find a safe place, somewhere inside. 
She knows better than anyone the consequences that could come from being unsheltered with a baby and how it could lead to having a child removed by the child welfare system. Eight years earlier, while experiencing homelessness and addiction, she got pregnant with her first child. Unable to remain sober and housed, she eventually lost parental rights before her son turned 2.
“I already lost one kid to the system,” Victoria said. “This was my second chance to get right and not lose another child to the system.”
After an hourlong bus ride, she arrived at the Help of Southern Nevada office on Flamingo Road.
The nonprofit, which offers a variety of housing and homeless resources, hosts a weekly drop-in event every Thursday for people needing on-the-spot assistance. Outreach workers from the nonprofit had previously encouraged Victoria to come in for help. Now she was ready.
Though she wanted to find housing, she was worried no place would take her along with the father of her unborn child. 
“There’s not very many programs out there that are willing to take non-married people like me and him,” she said. 
To her surprise, case workers had just the solution: a Clark County-operated non-congregate shelter specifically designed for families.
Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Clark County used federal relief dollars to convert six older motels and hotels into noncongregate shelters. Four facilities serve adults without children; two serve adults with children. 
Dubbed “La Quinta” after the motel chain that previously operated at the location, the main noncongregate facility for unhoused people with children has become a lifeline for families living on the streets or on the verge of homelessness, especially those families dealing child welfare cases. 
The program was in such demand, the county opened an additional facility for families this year, which has remained full. 
“I feel like the need is always going to be there, because we’re offering something that’s safe, stable and can keep a family together,” said Brenda Barnes, social services manager with Clark County.
Housing instability can be deeply interconnected with Nevada child welfare

In the early days of its transformation from motel to family shelter, officials noticed the facility also presented opportunities to reunify families who were dealing with the child welfare system. For some families who have their children removed, housing can be the last barrier to reunification. 
Opening the facility, “gave us a place where, if housing was the only factor to reunify and get kiddos back with their parents safely, we were able to kind of make that plug,” Barnes said. 
It has since been used as an option to steer people away from child welfare altogether. 
The family shelters run by the county have served 1,823 families – roughly 4,000 children –  since opening in 2021. 
Data provided to Nevada Current showed 1,050 of those families have previous referrals with the child welfare system, of which 258 referrals stemmed specially from homelessness or inadequate housing. 
County officials estimate the family shelters have diverted 1,838 children – roughly 875 families – from entering the child welfare system and prevented them from being removed from caregivers and parents. 
It costs roughly $1.4 million a month to run the two family specific shelters. 
During an interim legislative committee hearing in 2024, state lawmakers were told the first three years of operations resulted in the county saving $32 million in child welfare costs.  
At the hearing, Barnes told lawmakers the “return on investment” was believed to be greater than the estimates. 
At the time the county had diverted close to 1,600 children from the system at the time. By doing so, the county estimated it saved Child Haven, a campus where children removed from their families stay, roughly $10 million in operational costs.
At the 2024 legislative hearing, Barnes reiterated all estimates were “based on not a full comprehension but an overview of what it costs to run a child haven as a facility and what it costs to have children in foster care.”
The bigger accomplishment is keeping families whole instead of removing children. 
“You can’t put a price on the reduced amount of trauma by opening these doors,” Barnes said. 
Filling a void
The 2024 Southern Nevada Point-in-Time count, a yearly snapshot of the number of people experiencing homelessness on any given night, found 7,906 people were unhoused in January of that year. Roughly 20% of the entire homeless population – around 1,500 – were families with children.  
The number is likely an undercount yet still higher than previous years. 
The 2022 homeless count found 516 families with children.
“It stood out in opening these facilities that we were offering a service that wasn’t available in the community,” Barnes said.
The first family shelter the county opened was a converted Rodeway Inn in December 2021 with 150 rooms. In less than a year the facility was “bursting at the seams,” Barnes said, adding that the county had to transition to a new location the following year. The Rodeway was repurposed to serve adults without children.
The former La Quinta, which has 251 rooms, has served 1,553 families since it opened in 2022. The additional location that opened this year, which has 150 rooms, has served 270 families.
“I feel like if we were to open another facility, would we fill it? Probably. Absolutely,” Barnes said. “It doesn’t mean that those families are currently unsheltered. It just means that we’re providing a resource that meets their unique needs a little bit better than their opportunities before.”
Coming to La Quinta
Victoria, 41, first began experiencing homelessness in 2013 after both her mother and grandmother died in the same year. 
She had struggled with mental health issues and addiction since she was 16, but being unhoused after the death of her family exacerbated her substance abuse and “I just lost myself.” 
“People really don’t get it. It’s really a sickness. It’s really a disease,” Victoria said. “It’s not as easy as people think. People say, ‘Oh, you can quit if you want to.’ The person has to be willing to quit at that time. You can’t force a person into recovery.”
When she found out she was pregnant with her first son – years before La Quinta opened – she also struggled with finding housing and addiction services.  
“They say there’s so much help for us pregnant women but there’s really not,” she said. 
Victoria gave birth while struggling with homelessness. While her newborn son inspired her to maintain sobriety for a time, she eventually fell back into addiction and wound up homeless once again. 
Her son was removed from her care when he was 18 months old. Life began to spiral after she lost her parental rights. 
“After I lost my son and everything, I just went on a rollercoaster,” she said. “I didn’t care anymore.”
Victoria spent the next few years moving from encampment to encampment. She tried drug treatment programs, but nothing would stick.
Then, earlier this year, another unhoused woman Victoria knew from a nearby encampment became pregnant. Not long after, Victoria began mirroring the same symptoms. “I thought it was just sympathy symptoms,” she said. 
Victoria was in fact pregnant for a second time. Traumatized by losing her first child to the child welfare system, she said she began trying to stop using drugs. She had been sober a little under a month by the time she arrived at La Quinta.
“I lost my first son because of my own actions and my own decisions in life,” she said. “Choosing to do my drugs and not putting my son first, that’s my biggest regret.”
Not all people who stay at La Quinta have been experiencing homelessness chronically like Victoria.  
Shay, a mother of three using her first name to maintain privacy, also sought housing resources. Shay was evicted from her apartment in July and didn’t know where she and her children would stay.. 
She worked a part-time security job with an inconsistent work schedule. At the beginning of the year, she fell behind bills and couldn’t pay her $1,100 rent. 
She sought housing assistance from other nonprofits around town and thought she would qualify for rental assistance. It never materialized. 
Then the eviction notice came. Two days after her eviction hearing this summer, she and her three kids, 9, 8 and 4, were locked out of her house. 
“I was feeling like I should just quit, like it was pointless,” she said.

Barnes said similar stories of evictions have played out among people staying at La Quinta
The legacy of the pandemic, unsteady employment, increased rental costs and other factors can create a “domino effect” leading to eviction notices, Barnes said. 
The county does not consistently track the number of people entering La Quinta who have been evicted. But the county was able to provide a snapshot from July that showed 27 of the 77 families referred to La Quinta that month had recently been evicted. 
“Our observations are consistent with national trends showing that rising housing costs and the end of temporary eviction protections have contributed to increased housing instability,” said Jennifer Cooper, a spokeswoman for Clark County.
A family member told Shay about Help of Southern Nevada. Though she met with a case worker and did a housing assessment, Shay wasn’t sure it would lead to anything. 
“By the time I even got to the bus stop, they had called me and told me that they found housing for me,” she said.
She and her three kids could stay at La Quinta. 
‘Sometimes it takes a few tries’
While Shay was able to stay at La Quinta for several weeks before transitioning to another housing program, Victoria and her partner – who she refers to as her husband – were eventually asked to leave La Quinta. Though it stung, Victoria admitted it was their fault for violating the property rules.
All residents have to sign an occupancy agreement that outlines mandatory case management, welfare and room checks. Alcohol and controlled substances aren’t allowed on the property.
“We have to keep those to ensure we maintain a safe environment,” Barnes said.
Victoria’s husband brought in a marijuana vape pen, though she maintains it was empty.
Barnes said even if people violate rules, they are usually given warnings before being asked to leave. Even then, there is a chance to come back to La Quinta. 
“We’re not a one-stop shop or a one-chance you’re out place,” she said.  “There’s always an opportunity that if you couldn’t follow the rules that we could re-evaluate. People come into this system of care multiple times, and that’s okay. Sometimes it takes a few tries.”
After leaving La Quinta, Victoria contacted her previous case worker with HELP of Southern Nevada, who was able to get her into another housing program. Victoria signed the lease to her unit, and then an hour later went into labor. 
The average length of stay at Clark County’s family shelters is 117 days, according to data provided to the Current. County officials noted one family stayed for more than a year and a half. 
While housed in the facilities, families meet with case managers, which can make referrals for other housing programs in the community or the Housing Choice Voucher program, commonly known as Section 8.
Housing vouchers are hard to get and qualifying for them can be a multi-month process. At the end of it, there is no guarantee people will find a place to live. 
Housing vouchers also have stringent requirements on income limits and the type of places people can live. 
And the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban and Development requires environmental reviews and housing inspections “just to make sure families aren’t put into places that really end up in slum lord situations,” Barnes said. “They want to make sure they are appropriate and safe units.” 
Another ongoing challenge is finding landlords willing to accept those vouchers, Barnes said. Nevada, like most states, doesn’t have any laws prohibiting landlords from turning away potential tenants who will be paying rent with public assistance. 
The time to move someone from the family shelter to permanent housing could “have been cut shorter if we had landlords willing to rent to voucher holders,” Barnes said. 
“We can exit families into permanent housing if it was affordable for them to live in,” she said. “And families want to. Families don’t want to stay in La Quinta forever.” 
Though the county has been able to find a solution to stabilize some unhoused families, the road to permanently housing them isn’t easy. 
Barnes said it will continue to be a challenge “until we can (contain) the cost of living and have a decent wage for families to live off of and have affordable places for them to rent that aren’t in the worst parts of the cities.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Courtyard.jpg,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

Dec. 3, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Doctors and parents urged legislators on the Michigan Senate Health Policy Committee Wednesday to pass a bill, put forward by state Sen. Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores), that would require insurance companies in Michigan to cover treatments for two pediatric autoimmune neurological disorders. 
The disorders, known as PANS (Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome) and PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal Infections), were described by Bruce Goodman, an advocate with the Michigan PANS and PANDAS Alliance, as “a form of sudden onset brain inflammation that occurs in children.” 
“It occurs when an infection or environmental trigger causes the child’s immune system to mistakenly attack healthy brain tissue,” Goodman explained. “The results can be dramatic and terrifying, severe OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder], ticks, eating refusals, emotional regression, debilitating anxiety and cognitive decline that appear almost out of nowhere.”
Goodman explained that this very situation had happened to his granddaughter, Una. “She went to bed as a regular, happy 5-year-old. She woke up in the morning with severe OCD,” he said. 
Central in the testimony was a treatment known as intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG. In Una’s case, after she was treated with IVIG, she recovered. 
Eight parents of children diagnosed with PANS/PANDAS testified about how intravenous immunoglobulin treatments drastically improved their children’s symptoms or brought them into remission — but all of those families also faced either delays or denials of the treatment from their insurance companies. 
IVIG treatment is used only in the most severe cases, if antibiotics or other treatments fail, but insurers regularly delay or deny treatments — sometimes in the middle of a course of therapy. 
“No family should have to watch their child fall apart because the insurance company says no, even when all the doctors say yes,” said Michelle Stackpoole, whose son developed PANS — with symptoms including tics, OCD, anxiety, self injury and severe behavioral regression — after contracting COVID-19 in 2021.

Gary Driscoll’s 15-year-old daughter developed PANS/PANDAS after a strep infection, with her symptoms getting so bad that she lost the ability to walk. Because insurance denied intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, the family paid $22 thousand out of pocket — and her symptoms resolved within days. 
“Families should not have to choose between financial ruin and watching their child lose their childhood,” Driscoll said. 
Sixteen other states have passed laws similar to Hertel’s bill, Goodman said, noting that in both Arkansas and Colorado, a child with PANS/PANDAS committed suicide, spurring passage of the law. 
“In Michigan, we are way behind the times,” said Dr. Susan Youngs, who said that she has treated over 300 children with PANS/PANDAS in her time as a doctor. 
Sen. Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores) listens to testimony from parents on his bill, SB 447. Dec. 3, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
For the first eight years of her career, she said, she almost universally got insurance approvals for patients with PANDAS/PANS. But in recent years this has changed dramatically, and in the last five years, cases are almost universally denied or delayed. 
“Let’s be clear, there’s not a difference in opinion between doctors on this issue,” Youngs said. “Skilled, knowledgeable doctors who actually treat PANS patients all agree that IVIG is life changing for this disease.”
The committee only took testimony at Wednesday’s hearing, and did not vote on Hertel’s legislation, which seeks to amend the Michigan Insurance Code, mandating coverage by private insurers.

AI does not reward size. It rewards small teams who can move quickly, learn fast and adapt.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bernie Gracy:  AI can be Vermont’s advantage.","This commentary is by Bernie Gracy. He is a technology executive who splits his time between Hollis, New Hampshire  and Averill, Vermont,  where he also serves as president of the Averill Lakes Association.



Last month I attended my second “Rumble in the Kingdom” pitch competition — the annual gathering where entrepreneurs, students, technologists, community leaders and outdoor-industry innovators come together in the Northeast Kingdom to compete for seed funding. In a packed house, cheered on by friends and neighbors, these founders made the most of their five-minute pitches.
What struck me over the past couple of years was the shape of the business ideas. The entrants weren’t Silicon Valley clones chasing scale for scale’s sake. They were grounded in solving real problems in the real economy — housing, food systems, health care access, nonprofit infrastructure, outdoor recreation and creative services.
These were practical and community-oriented ventures — the exact kinds of companies that stand to benefit the most from AI if it is deployed thoughtfully.
A startup building high-performance prefab homes can use AI to model energy efficiency and reduce material waste.
A food cooperative can forecast demand, cut spoilage and better connect with local producers. A drone and photography studio can automate editing, mapping and client proposals.
An outdoor recreation business can predict visitor traffic and optimize inventory before the busy season.
Even a nonprofit platform can match local needs to donors more quickly and with far less administrative burden.
None of this replaces the human relationships that define these companies. It simply gives small teams the capabilities once reserved for organizations ten times their size.
And that’s the point — AI may be the first major economic shift where Vermont’s scale is an advantage, not a limitation. AI does not reward size. It rewards small teams who can move quickly, learn fast and adapt. 
Contrary to the daily headlines about AI-driven layoffs, this is not about replacing Vermont workers. It’s about giving small, mission-driven businesses the analytical, operational and marketing capabilities that used to belong only to large companies — without changing who they are. 
For many of these startups, AI can collapse a century of structural disadvantage as it rewards teams and team members that are agile and entrepreneurial, able to wear multiple hats, and collaborative and grounded in trust and community values.
Large companies must unwind layers of complexity to adopt AI — Vermont companies do not have that burden. Moreover, Vermont has a unique opportunity to show the country what “human-scaled AI” looks like — a future where technology strengthens communities instead of hollowing them out; where innovation supports stewardship; and where rural economies lead instead of lag.
Rumble on!

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)State officials say a federal agency review found 21 noncitizens have cast ballots in Indiana elections, along with 165 noncitizens who registered to vote in the state.
Those figures were included in an announcement Wednesday from the offices of Attorney General Todd Rokita and Secretary of State Diego Morales about the settlement of a lawsuit in which they sought to force the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to verify the citizenship of more than 585,000 registered Hoosier voters. 
It was not clear how many of those voter registrations had been reviewed by the federal agency and when the illegal voting was alleged to have occurred.
In 2024, Indiana had 4.8 million registered voters and just under 3 million, or 62%, voted in that year’s general election. The Hoosier state has one of the lowest voter turnouts in the country.

Rokita and Morales, both Republicans, filed the lawsuit in April, seeking to force federal review of the voter list after the agency did not do so during then-President Joe Biden’s administration when first requested in October 2024 — just weeks before that year’s presidential election.
Rokita said in a statement that the settlement “delivers the federal access we’re entitled to under law, allowing the Secretary of State to swiftly remove ineligible voters from the rolls and fortify our system against future risks.”
“From day one, many individuals dismissed our work as a ‘witch hunt’ — but the facts speak for themselves: non-citizen voting is real here in our state, and even one illegal ballot undermines the trust we are told to have in our election processes and even the Republic itself,” Rokita said.
Rokita’s office did not answer questions from the Indiana Capital Chronicle about how it had confirmed the instances of noncitizens registering to vote and casting ballots — and whether any legal action against those people was being sought.
The announcement said the ballots had been wrongly cast in “recent elections” but did not provide additional information.
Morales spokeswoman Lindsey Eaton said the review “includes voters in 2024 and past elections. It’s based on statewide voter history.”
It is illegal under both Indiana and federal law for noncitizens to vote in elections.
Actions criticized as voter intimidation
Voting-rights advocates previously denounced as attempted voter intimidation the request from Rokita and Morales for review of the nearly 600,000 registrations by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — which is housed within the homeland security agency.
The Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, which is representing several Indiana groups in legal challenges to state election law changes, criticized the actions by Rokita and Morales.
“Hoosiers who have become U.S. citizens are needlessly harmed by these efforts. This preliminary information from USCIS has not been verified,” the organization said.
Eaton said the secretary of state’s office “believes information received from USCIS is accurate and we will provide more information concerning referrals to law enforcement in the near future.”

That requested review covered about one in eight people on Indiana’s voter rolls, involving those who registered without providing a state-issued form of identification.
Indiana was among four Republican states agreeing in the lawsuit settlement filed Friday to help the Trump administration gain access to state driver’s license data through a nationwide law enforcement computer network seeking out alleged noncitizen voters.
Under the agreement with Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is required to continue its development of a program capable of scanning millions of state voter records for instances of noncitizen registered voters.
Morales announced in September that his office had identified a noncitizen living in Vigo County who alleged had registered to vote in 2018 and cast ballots in six elections.
That case was referred to county and federal prosecutors, but it was unclear whether any legal action has been taken as those offices did not immediately reply Wednesday to messages seeking an update.

It is whether the care needed to survive one is available in the communities where the state requires it to continue (krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images).Across much of rural Missouri, pregnancy begins with distance. In many counties, the nearest hospital that still delivers babies can be close to an hour away.
According to the 2024 March of Dimes report, 51% of Missouri counties are now classified as maternity care deserts, offering no obstetric clinicians or birthing hospitals. A 2025 analysis by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform found that less than half (41%) of U.S. rural hospitals still offer labor and delivery services.
Hospitals are closing these units because insurance companies and Medicaid do not reimburse enough to cover the cost of births, causing already struggling rural facilities to lose money. When these units close, families lose local prenatal care, clinicians who know them and the infrastructure that stabilizes emergencies. High-risk pregnancies become harder to monitor. More births occur in emergency departments or outside hospitals. Preterm birth rates rise.
In counties where chronic illness, limited transportation and poverty are already widespread, the loss of maternity care makes healthy pregnancies even harder to achieve. 
Over the last decade, Missouri has experienced a steady decline in maternity units and hospital services, especially in rural areas. 
More than 40% of births in Missouri are covered by Medicaid, and many patients rely on clinics and community health centers when hospitals close. Medicaid reimburses for contraception and pregnancy care, but not for abortion. That leaves legal rights disconnected from the services people need to use them.
Labor and delivery services are often among the first cuts when a hospital is trying to stay open. In parts of southeast Missouri, patients must travel across county lines or out of state for obstetric care.
These access barriers compound Missouri’s pregnancy-related mortality rate of 32 deaths per 100,000 live births and show how geography and limited access worsen clinical risk. Black women in Missouri face a pregnancy-related death risk about 2.5 times that of white women. Women living in micropolitan counties had the highest pregnancy-related mortality ratio, nearly 40 deaths per 100,000 live births. 
Mental-health conditions, including substance use disorders, are among the leading causes of pregnancy-related deaths in Missouri. Most pregnancy-related deaths occur after birth, often months into the postpartum year. 
The state’s Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review Board determined that every mental-health–related death was preventable. Overall, more than 80% of pregnancy-related deaths in Missouri were considered preventable.
The same counties that lack maternity units also lack psychiatrists, psychologists, and addiction treatment programs.
Missouri earned a D grade from the March of Dimes for preterm birth. About 11% of babies in the state are born preterm. The latest data shows that 6 infants die per 1,000 live births. Missouri continues to rank among the worst performing states for infant mortality. These outcomes reflect a system where maternity care has deteriorated faster than the policies meant to support it.
During this period of shrinking access, Missouri also moved through years of reproductive policy instability. After the United States Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, Missouri’s trigger law took effect and banned most abortions. The only exception was a narrowly defined medical emergency provision that functions as an affirmative defense. Physicians can be investigated or prosecuted first and must justify the decision later.
In 2024, Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment recognizing a right to reproductive freedom, but legal protections did not change the underlying conditions that have driven maternity unit closures. They did not rebuild maternity units, reopen labor wards, or restore prenatal and postpartum care where it was lost. 
The legal landscape changed repeatedly, and clinical practice and patient access changed as a result. Hospitals and clinics revised policies in response to litigation, and patients were sometimes delayed, transferred or told to wait until symptoms worsened.
Many Missourians now face delays in getting their first prenatal appointment, and that visit may require an hour-long drive each way. If severe pain or bleeding begins, the nearest emergency department may not have an obstetrician on site. Patients may be stabilized and transferred or directed to seek care elsewhere.
If a pregnancy becomes dangerous, clinicians must navigate both medical risk and a changing legal environment that governs emergency care in Missouri.
The distance between pregnancy and care in Missouri is no longer just a matter of miles. It widens if you are Black, low income, rely on Medicaid or lack transportation. It widens if you live in a maternity care desert, face untreated mental health conditions or addiction or are a teenager or single parent without support. 
The question in Missouri is no longer whether people have control over a pregnancy. It is whether the care needed to survive one is available in the communities where the state requires it to continue.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gettyimages-2211388790-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 07:56:16.177540

But the dispute is likely not over. The gun rights advocacy group suing to overturn the ban says it will appeal. And whether restrictions like Washington’s are constitutional may eventually be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Washington’s law doesn’t prohibit owning assault weapons, just their manufacture, importation, distribution or sale. The term “assault weapon” is defined in the law, including with a list of specific firearm models, such as AR-15s.
The Silent Majority Foundation, along with gun sellers in Moses Lake and Ephrata and individuals, sued over the ban in 2023 in Thurston County Superior Court. They say it violates the state constitution that protects the right to bear arms.  
The state attorney general’s office countered that policymakers can still regulate uniquely deadly weapons disproportionately used in mass shootings. These guns aren’t suited for self-defense, the state argued. The Silent Majority Foundation disagreed, arguing that the firearms in question are widely owned and so should have constitutional protection. 
Lawyers for the state said assault weapons aren’t covered by the state constitution, which states “the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself, or the state, shall not be impaired.” 
Thurston County Superior Court Judge Christine Schaller sided with the state last month.
“This is another strong affirmation that our state’s gun violence prevention laws are both constitutional and effective,” Alliance for Gun Responsibility CEO Renée Hopkins said in a statement. “Assault weapons have no place in our communities, and Washington has been clear about that.”
The Silent Majority Foundation says this won’t be the final say on Washington’s law. 
“The words of the Washington Constitution, which provide that the right to bear arms shall not be impaired, must mean something,” Rob Waites, operations director for the Pasco-based organization, said in an email.
Federal judges in western and eastern Washington have also denied preliminary challenges to the state law. But those cases have been paused in anticipation of an appeals court ruling on California’s assault weapons ban that could have precedence for Washington. 
Meanwhile, an East Coast appeals court with a conservative majority is considering the future of New Jersey’s ban. Over the summer, another appeals court upheld Connecticut’s assault weapons prohibition. 
Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices have expressed interest in taking up a case on assault weapons bans, but the high court declined to hear such a case this year. The Bellevue-based Second Amendment Foundation recently urged the court to take up its challenge to a local assault weapons ban in Cook County, Illinois. 
Washington is one of 10 states that ban semiautomatic firearms classified as assault weapons. For years during his time as attorney general, Gov. Bob Ferguson pushed for the law in the wake of a shooting at a Mukilteo house party that killed three teens and injured another.
The federal government banned the manufacture of assault weapons in 1994, but allowed the prohibition to expire after 10 years. 
The Silent Majority Foundation also took on the state’s ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines. So far, the group has failed to overturn that law, with the state Supreme Court upholding it this year. The organization has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review its case. 
The foundation was formerly led by Pete Serrano, an unsuccessful Republican candidate for state attorney general last year. In August, President Donald Trump named Serrano interim U.S. attorney for Washington’s Eastern District. The Senate has yet to confirm Serrano to the permanent post amid opposition from Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray. 
Waites noted Serrano isn’t affiliated with the foundation while he’s serving as U.S. attorney.
The state is sure to face more legal challenges on its gun laws, as its new permit-to-purchase system takes effect in 2027. Lawmakers passed the controversial policy this year.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ar15s-1024x890.jpg,,,2025-12-04 07:56:16.177540

(Stock photo by Joe Sohm/Getty Images)An unusual coalition that includes business groups, environmental activists, and New Jersey’s ratepayer advocate is urging lawmakers to reject a legislative proposal that would see residents pay for the construction of a new nuclear power plant years before it begins sending energy to the grid.
The bill, introduced last month during the final weeks of the Legislature’s current session, would add a mandatory charge on every ratepayer’s electricity bill to cover 5% of the projected construction costs of a to-be-constructed nuclear plant generating at least 1,100 megawatts of electricity.
The measure’s opponents warn that the bill, sponsored by Sens. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex) and John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester), would shift risk from the plant’s developers to residents who could ill-afford further rate increases after a steep hike this summer that will be followed by another price spike next June.
“There are going to be people after this bill who aren’t going to be able to afford their electric bill,” Brian Lipman, director of the state’s rate counsel division, which advocates for utility customers before the state’s energy regulators, told the Senate’s energy committee Monday.
The advanced nuclear development charge would add between $22 and $55 to residential ratepayers’ monthly bills, Lipman said, and consumers would likely pay that charge for at least a decade before a nuclear plant actually comes online. Lipman called that framework unprecedented.
The plan would lead some to pay as much as $6,600 over the next decade for a plant that will not have produced any electricity.
As written under the current version of the bill, ratepayers would pay those subsidies in perpetuity.
“I don’t think any of us intend that this credit is something that’s going to be paid by our grandchildren for, say, the 80-year expected life of the facility,” said Abe Silverman, an energy research scholar at Johns Hopkins University.
The committee advanced the bill in a 4-1 vote. Sen. Parker Space (R-Sussex) voted no.
Though New Jersey’s ratepayers fund utilities’ infrastructure investments through their utility bills, utilities are only permitted to recoup the cost of their investments after projects go into service.
Industrial and commercial customers who use large amounts of power and almost exclusively procure their electricity from off-grid third-party suppliers would face far steeper costs, said Steven Goldenberg, counsel for the New Jersey Large Energy Users Coalition.
“When Brian says that the average residential ratepayer will see the rates increase $55 a month, that is huge,” Goldenberg said. “But when it gets translated to my people, we’re talking five figures every month.”

Board of Public Utilities President Christine Guhl-Sadovy, the only person to speak in favor of the bill during Monday’s committee hearing, argued that private firms need subsidies to secure U.S. Department of Energy loans that could cover as much as 80% of a nuclear project’s costs.
Energy markets could not support private investment in new nuclear plants despite recent and looming price rises, she said, at least not without ratepayer support.
“Even conservative estimates for load growth make a strong case for building new nuclear generation. We have a responsibility at the BPU to ensure reliable and affordable utility service. If the state does not invest in new generation, electricity will continue on the path of being unaffordable,” she said.
Opponents said the risk to ratepayers is too great.
Provisions in the bill would allow developers to seek and obtain, as-of-right, ratepayer dollars to help pay for cost overruns not exceeding 20% of a project’s forecasted costs, and developers are permitted to seek ratepayer funds for larger increases with approval from the Board of Public Utilities.
The state would be hard-pressed to deny requests for larger cost overruns, especially those that come years into a project’s development, Silverman said. Those requests would put regulators in a difficult position: Pay more, or kill a project for which ratepayers have already supported with hundreds of millions — or even billions — of dollars.
Nuclear plant cost overruns aren’t unheard of, and they can be significant. Two nuclear units completed in Georgia in 2023 saw their cost balloon from a projected $14 billion to a realized $31 billion. Some estimates peg the cost as high as $37 billion. The units went online more than six years behind schedule.
The Georgia plants’ construction was the first the country saw in decades. Guhl-Sadovy argued the lessons learned there would prevent similar overruns in New Jersey.
“A lot of mistakes, I think, were made and recognized, and changes have been made,” she said. “We would not anticipate those kinds of cost overruns.”
The bill would not require developers of a project completed on time to fully return the ratepayers’ investment. Though the bill mandates developers return at least some revenue to ratepayers, it would allow the Board of Public Utilities to negotiate how much.










There are going to be people after this bill who aren’t going to be able to afford their electric bill.


– Brian Lipman, director of the state’s rate counsel division


Some detractors warned against imposing additional costs on ratepayers before the state studies what types of energy generation best fit its needs.
Others warned New Jersey wouldn’t see the full benefits of cost reduction from subsidized new generation because that power would be sold on PJM Interconnection’s 13-state grid, spreading its benefit to states outside of New Jersey.
There’s no guarantee that subsidized nuclear plants could even participate in PJM. The U.S. Supreme Court found a 2011 New Jersey program that sought to underwrite the construction of new gas plants by guaranteeing they earn a set amount in energy markets unconstitutionally infringed on federal regulatory authority.
“This bill does almost the same thing,” Lipman said in written testimony provided to the committee.
Others cautioned the bill should not move before Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill takes office.
Energy policy was a major focus of her campaign, and adding $55 in fixed monthly costs could doom her pledge to freeze energy rates once she’s inaugurated on Jan. 20.
“I don’t think that we should be working, moving forward on comprehensive reform or any kind of major investment in new generation in front of Mikie Sherrill taking her seat,” said Dena Mottola Jaborska, associated director of New Jersey Citizen Action. “She did make this a signature issue in her campaign, and I do feel like six weeks is not enough time.”
It’s not clear whether the bill will reach Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk before he leaves office, or if he would sign it if it does.
The bill had no Assembly companion as of Wednesday, and the Senate version did not appear on the agenda for the Senate Budget Committee’s Monday meeting.
Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex), the bill’s prime sponsor, appeared to suggest the measure could see changes.
“Is this a controversial bill? Yes. Do we have any solutions for the future of New Jersey? Not really. Has the discussion started? Yes, it has,” he said.

The Missouri School Modernization Task Force’s performance incentive working group completed its final meeting Wednesday before it presents recommendations to the larger group in January. The three other working groups have at least one more meeting each before their recommendations are finalized and become public.
Providing financial incentives for school districts to improve student achievement is a new concept, with few states using outcome-based funding models. But under an executive order from Gov. Mike Kehoe, Missouri may be poised to try the concept.
A memo from the nonprofit Aligned, an education-policy group focused on workforce development, noted that the idea of incentives had “potential” but could be a source of inequity. The brief, written by Aligned’s Kansas Director of Policy and Research Eric Syverson, looked at a program in Arizona that gave additional funding to high-performing schools. 
“Most dollars flowed to already advantaged schools,” he wrote, noting that Arizona lawmakers shut down the program in 2024.
Creating equitable incentives was a key focus of the working group’s meeting Wednesday, as members questioned whether their plan served all students across the state.
The framework the group is pursuing gives extra funding to districts when students reach achievement levels or hit growth targets in the areas of early literacy, middle school math and language arts and college and career readiness. A committee would be formed to articulate precise targets.
The program would be funded through a separate line item in the state budget, with a target funding level of $50 million, according to draft recommendations.
One part of the plan split the panel, though, as members debated whether or not the performance of certain student groups should have higher awards for schools. Kari Monsees, the state education department’s semi-retired finance chief, proposed a larger bonus when English-language learners, low-income students and those in special education reach performance targets. His recommendations were based on the group’s prior meetings, not necessarily the opinions of the state education department.
Chris Vas, a senior director with the Herzog Foundation, questioned why some students’ performance would trigger higher funding than others.
“We are basically telling students that certain students, we care more if they grow than others,” he said. “And that’s where (schools) will put their focus.”
The state gives additional funding for schools to educate students in these groups, Vas said, saying that any additional resources needed should come through the formula that funds schools rather than an incentive program.
Monsees said he worried that removing the boost would hurt districts with a greater population of low-income students and English-language learners.
“It is possible that the weightings (in the formula) are never going to be enough to meet the needs and close those gaps in every case, so having the extra incentive still could provide additional value,” he said.
Michael Podgursky, an economics professor at the University of Missouri–Columbia, said the program could be a source of inequity without the extra funding for dedicated student groups. Eliminating this piece would cause “a disproportionate share of the bonus funding will go to wealthier school districts,” he said.
The group based its model off of Tennessee’s outcome-based incentives, which doubles financial incentives when economically disadvantaged students hit performance targets.
Tennessee is in its third year with its current funding model, including the performance incentives. Monsees spoke to Tennessee’s education finance officer, who said the state has seen growth in achievement but also had numerous factors leading to this improvement.
“Not a lot of states have done this type of incentive type work, so we’d be among a small number that would be heading down this path,” Monsees said. “There is going to be a lot to be learned, both by our own state and by continuing to study others.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090925_monsees1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-04 06:57:30.690286

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The bill would also allow those already sentenced to life as a juvenile the opportunity to appeal and adjust their sentences after serving 15 years for crimes that didn’t involve murder and at 20 years for those who were convicted of homicide.
Two U.S. Supreme Court rulings (Miller v. Alabama, 2012, and Montgomery versus Louisiana, 2016) have held that life without parole for a juvenile comes under the category of cruel and unusual punishment. The Court has found that youth shouldn’t be held to the same level of accountability as adults because they are not psychologically or emotionally as mature and their brains are not fully developed.
According to an April 2024 report by the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth, “Unusual & Unequal: The unfinished business of ending life without parole for children in the United States,” 28 states have banned juvenile sentences of life without parole (JLWOP):
“The scientific understanding that young people have limited decision-making abilities and impulse control informed widespread, rapid rejection of JLWOP in state legislatures, the Supreme Court, state courts, and the court of public opinion. Declaring that youth is ‘a mitigating factor’ that must be considered by sentencing judges in Miller v. Alabama (2012), the U.S. Supreme Court held that life without parole is disproportionate for the vast majority of youth.”
Nikki Olson, founder and executive director of Wisconsin Alliance for Youth Justice, is one of the advocates pursuing the legislation in Wisconsin.
“Their liberty was taken away before they even had full rights because they were kids,” she said of juveniles sentenced to life. “We are talking about people who weren’t even 18, who couldn’t legally smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or couldn’t even drive without their parents’ permission. They couldn’t sign contracts or be on a jury or vote in society. We understand that kids are fundamentally different. The science says kids are fundamentally different. The Supreme Court says they are fundamentally different. We would like Wisconsin law to reflect that as well.”
Two past Republican sponsors of the proposed Wisconsin legislation are Rep. Todd Novak and Sen. Jesse James.

“Ending juvenile life without parole in Wisconsin is not just about reforming our justice system; it’s about restoring hope, potential and the promise of a future for our youth,” Novak has said. “This would also ensure that Wisconsin remains in compliance with the United States Supreme Court precedent.”
Sen. James has also gone on the record endorsing the bill. “The science is clear: brains are still developing. They cannot fully comprehend the extent of their actions,” James said. “For example, how is a 15-year-old supposed to understand life without parole when that sentence is literally quadruple the entire time they’ve been alive. People can grow; people can change, especially when their brains are still forming. Juveniles deserve a second chance.”
According to Sen. James’ office, the bill will be reintroduced as soon as the Department of Corrections (DOC) provides data on how many people currently incarcerated in Wisconsin  would be eligible to apply for a sentence adjustment if the bill is passed. The advocacy group Kids Forward puts the number somewhere north of 100.
Sen. James was asked whether his Republican colleagues known for supporting tough-on-crime legislation would also back the bill.
Sen. Jesse James (Screenshot via WisEye)
“As legislators, we introduce legislation with the hope that it’ll pass,” he said. “It is a part of our job to advocate for our bills and highlight the potential benefits and positive impact of the legislation with supportive research. Last session was my first time authoring this bill, and I’m still learning new information about this issue myself. We unfortunately didn’t get the opportunity to have a public hearing on this bill in the Senate last year, so myself and other advocates have not had the chance to testify in support and provide that background and context to members of the Senate.”
Convicted as a juvenile, serving life as an adult

Zachary Reid, 33, incarcerated at the New Lisbon Correctional Institution, has been in prison for 17 years. He is serving a life sentence, but he can apply for extended supervision after serving 40 years. If there isn’t a change in the law or Gov. Tony Evers doesn’t offer him a commutation or pardon, Reid is looking at another 23 years of incarceration.
If the bill does become law, Reid said he would apply at his 20-year mark, and he would be granted a hearing for a sentence adjustment.
The current language of the bill says the hearing should consider “relevant information” including “expert testimony and other information about the youthful offender’s participation in any available educational, vocational, community service, or other programs, the youthful offender’s work reports and psychological evaluations, evidence of the youthful offender’s remorse and the youthful offender’s major violation of institutional rules, if any.”
In 2008, when Reid was 16, he was charged with killing his father. Then, in 2009, a Winnebago County trial jury convicted him of first degree  intentional homicide, and he was given a life sentence which he began to serve in Waupun Correctional Institution when he turned 17.
Reid continues to contend that the death of his father was not intentional but an accident and that  Reid was defending himself from his alcoholic, abusive father, who was wielding a knife and making threatening gestures. Reid claims he choked his father with the intention that his father would pass out, not die.
But Reid also admits he did some things after his father’s death that he shouldn’t have, such as placing the body in the trunk of his father’s car instead of reporting the death immediately to the police.
 At 16, Reid said, he was a very immature young person, often in trouble, using drugs, not attending school, and stealing, making many poor decisions.
“At that age, you think you’re an adult; you think you know everything,” he said. “Those things adults tell you to do, some certain things, and you think you know better. And I was guilty of all the same types of thoughts like that, of just thinking that I really knew what was best for my life.”
When Reid was arrested in October of his junior year of high school, he had not attended very many days of class, a trend of skipping school he had started as a sophomore.
“And I just thought I didn’t have to prove anything to anybody, like, I know this stuff,” he said. “Why do I have to prove to a teacher that I know? Just an ignorant way of thinking and really low maturity level compared to how I am now. I look back, and I just kind of shake my head a lot of the time. There’s just a lot of the stuff that I did, and on top of it, I was doing drugs and drinking. At the time, I was already binge drinking. I started drinking really bad when I was 15, and it really picked up even more when I was 16, because my grandmother passed, and I used it as basically a reason to implode. And so the combination of being immature and the drugs and drinking, I was making a lot of really poor decisions.”
At Waupun, Reid could have been a prison statistic with an attitude and gotten into drugs and gangs and trouble, but instead he decided to take a different path by learning to weld and machining and later to crochet and donate items to charities. He was transferred to New Lisbon, where he continued to work as a welder and machinist, and then five years ago, he began training dogs that assist the blind.

“We do basically high-level obedience training, preparing the dogs to be able to go to harness school, where they learn the actual skills of working with a blind person or visually impaired person, to basically give them back their life, to be able to get them out of their house and be able not to be stuck there,” he said.
In prison, Reid said, he’s applied himself to learn new skills and gain an education.
“I have valuable skills that Wisconsin needs right now, you know, like welding and fabricating is a really in-demand training, even the machining,” he said. “Like I can run a mill, a lathe, you know, that type of stuff. I’ve gotten two vocational certificates since I’ve been here. I got an electromechanical service technician certificate. It’s also part of a pre-apprenticeship program through the Department of Workforce Development. I’m actually a certified professional dog trainer, like I got that through Chippewa Valley Technical College. I just finished my associate’s degree earlier this year, so I have an Associate of Science through Milwaukee Area Technical College.”
Reid also intends to pursue a bachelor’s degree from Marquette University in peace studies.
“I contribute to society right now in the environment I’m in, so I have no doubt that I can contribute in a meaningful way out there,” said Reid.
Since he has been in prison, Reid claims he has only received two conduct reports or complaints, one in 2010, his first year in prison, and another in 2016 for a tattoo.
Not many 33-year-old men have to wake up every day and live with the consequences of an action they took as a 16-year-old.
“Most of the time I try to just, kind of like, live in the right now,” he said. “I know it’s kind of like, you hear that phrase a lot, like live in the now type of stuff. I try to do that to the best of my ability as a coping mechanism, because, dwelling, obviously, on what happened and everything like that, like it was my dad, you know, so to me, I think it’s even a little bit more burdensome than for most of these people in that, I mean, my intent wasn’t to kill him. I was trying to just get him to stop attacking me in the situation we were in, and he passed away. So it’s like it’s not only just the guilt of taking a life, but it’s like I was so drug-addled or whatever it was, but it’s like I failed in that moment, like that was my failure.”
In-prison testimonies
At a future hearing to have his sentence adjusted, Reid would likely hear from others who would offer endorsements.
Patricia Muraczewski provided the dog training for the residents in New Lisbon and worked with Reid for two years. She was impressed by his work ethic and character and believes Reid should be considered for an early release.
“He was a member of the Paw Forward team of inmates who train dogs for the visually impaired,” she said.  “Mr. Reid was extremely diligent in class attendance and was very serious in acquiring and understanding the methods needed to train each dog that he was partnered with.  He had a very relaxed demeanor and got along with all of the other teams.  Even though there were frustrations at times with new instructors and conflicting material, he never expressed any anger.”
She added, “Over the course of my time in New Lisbon, never was Mr. Reid disrespectful and he never broke any rules or overstepped his position.” 
“Of all of the inmates I had worked with during that time, in my opinion, he was the inmate most likely to be successful when released and least likely to reoffend,” she said, adding,“During the four years this program has been in existence at New Lisbon none of the men that have been released have reoffended.” 
Brandon Horak knew Reid as a fellow resident at Waupun and later at New Lisbon. Horak had been sentenced to 10 years of incarceration for felony murder in the commission of an armed robbery after he set up a drug dealer for a robbery that resulted in the murder of the dealer.
“I wasn’t in a good state of mind,” he said when he first entered Waupun and met Reid.  “I had just been sentenced to 10 years in prison, so I met him in Waupun and he ended up encouraging me to get a job, so we worked in the laundry room together for a year and a half or two years. He encouraged me to get into school, and I didn’t want to do any of this stuff, so he was a really big influence on my life.”

Both Reid and Horak left Waupun and then later met up again in New Lisbon, where Reid had begun training dogs, and Horak said he noticed that Reid had lost a defensive, protective shield that many residents carry in amaximum security prisons like Waupun.
“I asked him why he didn’t care if someone stole something from him, which is obviously a big no-no in prison, and he said the dog program had changed his life and he had something to live for,” said Horak.
Even though Horak wasn’t officially in the dog program, Reid taught Horak what he had learned, and after he left prison, Horak set up his own dog training business based on Reid’s mentoring, a business called EDU Training.
“We train dogs in people’s homes, and to be honest, it was all thanks to Zach,” he said.
Out of prison, Horak often reaches back to Reid and his cellmate for advice on working with client pets.
“I’ve never been back to jail,” Horak said “I have a full-time job. I own a business. I do all this stuff, and I honestly do not believe I would have been able to do it without his (Reid’s) help. I just talked to him last week and he always tells me, ‘You better be doing good out there.’”
In prison, Horak said, he saw many people released and then come right back. Because of that, he doesn’t automatically believe everyone deserves leniency. Still, he says, Reid isn’t one of those who should be in prison and he believes he could do more good on the outside.
Engaged to be married 
Reid and his fiancée Samantha, got to know each other as pen pals in 2013, and that developed into a relationship in 2018. In 2019, they became engaged. In 2024, she moved from Florida to Wisconsin to be closer to Reid.
“The only reason we’re not married right now is that we’re hoping to get him out one day,” said Samantha, “so we can have just a normal marriage out here, versus having a marriage done or a wedding ceremony done inside the prison.”
Samantha said she has been communicating with Reid since they were both in their early 20s, and she’s seen him mature over the years.
“But just even in the last maybe five years, it’s just blown up like he has just matured and wants to do so much good,” she said. “ … He loves that he can actually make a difference, and he’s done other charity programs that even the prison doesn’t offer. He crochets hearts for suicide prevention.”
She said it recently occurred to her how much Reid is trying to do good for others and also maintain a relationship with her from prison.
“That is work, too, to just step up and almost religiously call somebody regularly, and never let me down, and to take care of me with all this distance,” she said.
If the legislation is passed, Samantha says that Reid would be the “poster child for this bill.”
“It’s like he went out of his way to get welding experience,” she said. “He went out of his way to do charity work. He went out of his way to do all these wonderful things over the years. And I mean, just since I’ve known him, he’s grown and matured. He’s checking off every box he can possibly check off, and could prove that over the course of 17 years, like he is not that person [that he was at 16], and look at all these good things he is doing and all the things he could contribute to society, and right now we’re just warehousing him. We’re wasting all these taxpayer dollars housing somebody that is very clearly not a threat.”

Credit: Courtesy of CBS SolarThousands of Michigan families were preparing to save on their energy bills this year through local Solar for All projects, including affordable housing complexes in Oakland County to rural communities in the Upper Peninsula. Those plans are now on hold after federal officials announced they would cancel the program, even though the funds were already distributed and projects were underway.
The Michigan Attorney General is right to challenge this reversal. At stake isn’t just funding, it’s fairness. The sudden halt means uncertainty for families expecting lower bills and for small businesses counting on steady work. Michigan had received $156 million to bring affordable, reliable energy to 18,000 households across the state and drive investment in the state’s clean energy workforce—all now in limbo.
With so many clean energy tax credits repealed under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” it’s vital to protect programs like Solar for All, which ensure the benefits of the clean energy transition reach people of all income levels.
 While solar adopters have grown more diverse, they still tend to be more affluent because rooftop solar is largely limited to individuals who own their own homes. Solar for All was created in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act so that low-income, rural, and disadvantaged communities could access clean, affordable, and reliable solar energy.

In Michigan, the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) has already awarded $13.9 million in grants to fund pilot programs for projects like installing solar on homes serving low-income and formerly homeless seniors in Oakland County and building rooftop solar for households with residents who rely on electric medical devices in the Upper Peninsula. All of the projects were designed to deliver at least a 20% reduction in household electricity costs for the participants while supporting local job growth by connecting solar installers and maintenance workers to new opportunities. EGLE Director Philip Roos estimated that the program would have created 700 high-quality jobs across the state.
None of this, unfortunately, is all that surprising. Sudden funding reversals have become a recurring pattern under the second Trump administration, often followed by court challenges and reinstatements. In fact, Solar for All contracts were frozen briefly before a federal judge ordered a reinstatement in April. The same happened with the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which was eventually restored after a judge rejected the Department of Transportation’s efforts to cancel the program. In its press release unfreezing NEVI grants, the DOT acknowledged that it couldn’t withhold funding that was already approved by Congress. “We will respect Congress’ will,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.
Solar for All seems to be following the same trajectory. It, too, was a congressionally approved program with federal funding already appropriated. But unlike previous attempts that stopped funds from going out, the Trump administration is trying to rescind money it has already disbursed. Even if Nessel’s office can get Solar for All funds reinstated, damage from the chaos, uncertainty, and paused work will have already been done.
As electricity bills continue to rise, no one disputes that we need more energy generation to keep up with demand and maintain affordability. But the way we achieve that goal matters. Halting programs that make energy cleaner and more affordable for working families is the wrong approach. Likewise, pulling the rug out from under workers and small businesses that rely on these programs will only lead to volatility in our local economies and undermine job security. We need policies that bring reliable, affordable energy to Michiganders without leaving anyone behind. And that means supporting programs like Solar for All.
Michigan has a rich history of innovation. That includes everything from manufacturing to mobility to energy. But innovation requires consistency. When programs like Solar for All are disrupted midstream, the real costs fall on families, workers, and small businesses. We need stable policies that keep energy affordable, create local jobs, and ensure that every Michigan community can share in the benefits of a cleaner, more reliable future.

(Getty Images)Indiana school officials are warning that the state’s new property tax overhaul is pushing districts into an unprecedented financial squeeze — which dozens of Hoosier superintendents say is already forcing staff cuts, delaying maintenance and increasing the likelihood for other reductions. 
Their concerns are at the heart of a new statewide survey released Thursday by the Indiana Coalition for Public Education, first published by the Indiana Capital Chronicle. 
The report highlights how Senate Enrolled Act 1 is reshaping local school budgets just months after its passage.
The survey — completed by 148 of the state’s 290 traditional public school corporations — found that 95.3% of Indiana districts expect SEA 1 to negatively affect their funding in 2025, and 99.3% expect impacts in future years.
Concerns cut across geography and school size. Large suburban districts worried about their ability to accommodate growth without operational dollars, while small rural districts said they face “existential threats” in the form of potential staff layoffs, school consolidations and the reduction of essential services if operational funding continues to shrink.
Urban districts additionally said long-standing structural disadvantages make them especially vulnerable to revenue compression, noting that dense populations, aging buildings and higher concentrations of high-needs students leave them with fewer ways to absorb shrinking tax collections.
Story continues below.
ICPE_2025-School-Funding-Report
 
For many superintendents, the financial strain isn’t a future concern, but a problem already unfolding inside their buildings. 
Survey responses were kept anonymous in ICPE’s published report.
One superintendent described being unable to cover even the most basic operating costs, saying their district’s finances had reached the point where “I cannot pay my utility bill,” and warned that rising gas, electricity and insurance costs are outpacing any funds available to cover them.
Another district leader said the combined effect of inflation and the property tax cap changes mean their operations fund is shrinking each year while costs climb. 
“The negative impacts of SEA 1 cannot be overstated,” the superintendent wrote, adding that “uncontrollable cost increases in utilities, transportation and insurance cannot be addressed adequately” under the new levy limits.
Indiana schools depend on local property taxes to fund essential services like custodial work, transportation, facility maintenance and bus purchases — areas where costs have risen sharply in the last decade.
SEA 1 decreases the taxable assessed value available to school corporations through expanded deductions that phase in through 2031. Although the law was intended to provide tax relief to property owners, superintendents emphasized in the survey that it has weakened the financial foundation for operating public schools.
Several respondents pointed to a mismatch between what’s expected of schools and the dollars they receive. 
One rural superintendent reported that their district had “a history of doing more with less,” but that the law’s projected reductions in the operations fund would soon make it “very difficult to simply run school.”
A suburban superintendent separately noted that long-range financial planning has become nearly impossible because “constantly changing regulations” leave districts unsure how much revenue they will receive from one year to the next.
Cuts ripple across classrooms, buildings and school services
The survey found that 65.3% of Indiana districts that responded have already reduced or will reduce support staff, and 55.8% have already reduced or will reduce teaching staff.
Combined with the districts that are considering reductions, more than 90% reported that cuts to staffing or facilities are on the table.
In write-in responses, superintendents said they’re postponing or canceling bus purchases, scaling back technology upgrades, holding off on building repairs, and in some cases, preparing for building closures. 
A suburban superintendent described a list of cost-saving measures large enough to reshape daily school operations — including the possibility of a four-day week, scaling back HVAC use to the minimum tolerable levels, and even “closing playgrounds if funds do not support adequate repairs after inspections.”
A different rural leader said their district would soon need to choose between raising tens of millions through a referendum or cutting what is, for many rural districts, a critical service.
“We have no choice but to either pass an operating referendum or eliminate transportation,” the superintendent wrote.
Others emphasized in the survey that cuts now reach well beyond the classroom. 
One superintendent said increased legislative mandates have made it impossible to balance budgets responsibly, emphasizing that “it’s impossible to ‘do more with less’ when everything else continues to increase in cost.”
Another superintendent detailed how their district’s operations fund will be less than $450,000 by 2028 — falling below the $600,000-per-year utility bill.
Superintendents express frustration
In addition to widespread reports of fiscal stress, other remarks captured anger and exhaustion among school leaders who said the state has placed them in an “impossible” position. 
Multiple superintendents stressed that Indiana has simultaneously increased schools’ responsibilities and expanded alternative education models that draw funds away from traditional districts while restricting the revenue streams that public schools rely on to meet those obligations.
One rural superintendent called the situation “a manufactured crisis.”
Another expressed disbelief that state lawmakers embraced referendums as the state’s new funding pressure valve while working to defeat those same measures locally.










The negative impacts of SEA 1 cannot be overstated.


– survey response from an unnamed Indiana school superintendent


“I’m shocked that the politicians made us a referendum state and now one of them actively tried to defeat all referendums,” the superintendent wrote. “You can’t make that make sense.”
A different superintendent wrote that policy shifts have pushed them to consider leaving the state altogether: “I’m seriously considering working as a superintendent in another state. The continuing changes in legislation keep moving the goal line.”
Many survey respondents said they feel the burden now falls on local voters to keep basic school functions afloat. 
Leaders in 90% of urban districts and 84.8% of suburban districts said they’re considering or pursuing operating referendums. 
“No district should need to run a referendum to adequately pay for expected services in the community,” one suburban superintendent wrote. “Any school below the ‘average’ per pupil funding continues to fall further and further behind.”
What schools need — and expect
When asked what funding increase would be needed to provide the services their communities expect, respondents offered percentages ranging from 2% to 20%, with an average of 7.6% — far above the increases approved by lawmakers in the most recent state budget. 
The 2025 state budget increased K-12 tuition support by roughly 2% each year of the biennium.
Several superintendents said the increases championed by lawmakers don’t reflect the true cost of new mandates.
“When you give a 2% increase but force us to pay for curricular material out of (the) Education Fund, that is NOT new money,” one superintendent wrote. “That is a 0% increase.”
Some school leaders said the only workable solution would be a reversal of the property tax changes themselves. An urban superintendent wrote that their district might survive if lawmakers acted quickly.
“If SEA 1 was completely repealed,” the local official wrote, “we could make it work.”
Others were less hopeful, pointing to projections that show continued enrollment declines, rising costs and a shrinking property tax base that will leave districts competing for scarce dollars.
“It continues to cost more to run a corporation,” said one rural superintendent, “but we continually lose funding streams to make it happen.”

Following the death of Rep. John Eklund, Wyoming politicians move quickly to fill the vacancy before the 2026 budget session.
The post Three candidates selected to fill Eklund’s legislative seat appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—Following the death of Rep. John Eklund, R-Cheyenne, on Nov. 14, Wyoming politicians had to act quickly to fill the vacancy before the 2026 budget session kicks off in February.
Because Eklund was a Republican whose district, House District 10, was wholly located within Laramie County, the Laramie County Republican Party was tasked with nominating three candidates to succeed Eklund.
Monday evening, party officials selected Sharon Fain, Justin Fornstrom and Ron Rabou.
The three were selected by a ballot of Laramie County GOP precinct committee members following a brief introduction and Q&A portion, where candidates were given 30 seconds to answer questions predetermined by the party.

Now, it is up to Laramie County commissioners to decide which of the three will be the new representative for HD 10. Commission Chairman Gunnar Malm announced Tuesday evening that the selection meeting will begin at 3:30 p.m. Saturday in the Commissioners’ Board Room, located on the third floor of the Laramie County Governmental Complex, 310 W. 19th St. Commissioners will interview each of the three finalists, then deliberate and pick one of them to fill the open seat.
When the commissioners, along with Platte County commissioners, were involved with this process in August to replace Sen. Darin Smith following his resignation, one of their primary concerns was selecting someone with a thorough understanding of property taxes.
While Commissioner Troy Thompson said this is certainly important for a candidate to understand, his top priority is identifying someone who will be there for the commission and pick up when he or any of their constituents call.
“I think that’s more important than anything else,” he said.
“We have three really good candidates that came out of the party meeting last night, and all three would be exceptional.”
Sharon Fain
Fain decided to pursue the vacant seat largely because she felt she could best serve eastern Laramie County through her experience in business and economic development.
In her letter to the Laramie County GOP requesting consideration, Fain wrote that she believes in “defending private property rights, advancing responsible and limited taxation, and ensuring that Wyoming’s agricultural producers and legacy energy industries can thrive without unnecessary interference.”
Fain has experience in energy and public policy, as well as a commitment to agriculture.
“The residents deserve responsible and experienced leadership in the state House,” she told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle Tuesday. “With Rep. John Eklund’s passing, these are big boots to fill.”
Early in her career as a television news producer in Oklahoma, Fain was asked to relocate to Baghdad, Iraq. Instead of moving to the other side of the globe, she and her husband, Greater Cheyenne Chamber of Commerce President/CEO Dale Steenbergen, decided to relocate to Laramie County, where they’ve lived for the last 20 years. The couple maintains a sixth-generation purebred Gelbvieh cow-calf operation.
“The opportunities here are limitless, but we all need to work together to ensure that we have a financially stable future for Wyoming,” she said.
Now, she serves as the external affairs and marketing vice president for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming, and serves on the board of the Wyoming Congressional Award Council following a career of more than 16 years in energy communications, crisis communication, business development and strategic communications in Wyoming.
When asked Tuesday about what her priorities would be if selected to serve in the Legislature, Fain told the Tribune Eagle there’s a need to evaluate property taxes and have continued conversations about economic drivers for the state to diversify the economy to eliminate or lessen the impacts of the traditional boom-and-bust cycle.
When Sen. Taft Love, R-Cheyenne, was selected by county commissioners to fill the seat made vacant by Smith’s resignation, the most common point of discussion was property taxes.
Fain said that to address the decrease in funding due to property tax cuts, there needs to be a healthy discussion at the state level about the impacts these decisions have on communities’ ability to provide safe and reliable services.
“The health and safety of our communities are critical, and we need to ensure that we are addressing all of these issues before making such decisions that impact the day-to-day lives and safety of our communities,” she said.
Justin Fornstrom
Fornstrom is a lifelong resident of Laramie County and the current mayor of Pine Bluffs, where he graduated high school before earning a degree from the University of Wyoming in 1995.
He primarily considers himself a farmer and owns an agricultural operation with his brother, Mark. The pair also owns other commercial businesses in the area.
When asked why he put his name in to fill the vacant seat, Fornstrom said he’s motivated by a sense of loyalty to his state and to his area.
“John Eklund was a great man and a great public servant, great legislator,” he said. “I just wanted somebody [to succeed him] who would be an advocate like he was for agriculture and Laramie County and for the whole state.”
If Fornstrom is selected, he said he will resign from his post as mayor of Pine Bluffs, and the current council members will select someone to temporarily fill the vacancy until the next election cycle in 2026.
Fornstrom said that, if appointed, he is well aware he would be joining the House around two months before the 2026 budget session kicks off. Since it’s a budget session, he said developing and passing a responsible budget would be his top priority.
He said his other priorities include being a strong advocate for Wyoming’s agriculture sector and natural resources, as well as supporting Wyoming’s legacy energy sector. Fornstrom also noted he wants to pursue avenues to diversify Wyoming’s economy.
“I strive to be a good leader, and I enjoy listening to people and debating the issues. I hope that interest and skill set would serve me well in moving forward here,” he said.
When asked about property taxes, Fornstrom said his more than 16 years serving on a county fire board and his more recent experience as mayor gave him a thorough understanding of the issue.
“I am concerned that, currently, we are taking the approach that we were just reducing property taxes without any real, well-developed plans for how we backfill that money,” he said. “Government can probably afford to tighten their belts a little bit, but these are pretty drastic cuts, and more proposals for cuts are on the way, whether it be by the ballot or by the Legislature.”
Ron Rabou
Rabou is a fifth-generation Wyomingite and operates an organic farm near Albin. He said one reason he decided to pursue the vacant state seat was that Eklund was a friend of his, and he saw this as an opportunity to continue his legacy, while also giving back to the community that supported him as he and his wife operated a business and raised a family in the area.
“It’s an opportunity to serve the community that has blessed us for so many years, and in a place where we’ve raised three boys, and a chance to continue to lift up the community out here and continue to serve what’s treated us so well over all these years.”
In addition to being a local businessman and more recently pursuing energy technology opportunities in the form of carbon capture, utilization and sequestration, Rabou serves on many volunteer boards in the community.
He has previously been elected to the Laramie County Community College Board of Trustees, where he served as chairman, and served on boards for Wyoming Agriculture in the Classroom, Cheyenne Arts Council, the Purple and Gold Legacy Foundation, the American Society of Agriculture, the University of Wyoming Dean’s Advisory Board and currently serves as UW’s national representative for the Council for Agricultural Research, Extension and Teaching.
“I think that experience helps,” he said. “I think that certainly listening is one of the most important skills all of us can have, and certainly will be a major player in how I would legislate and lead in this position.”
Rabou said he will let this philosophy of listening drive his policy decisions, noting that it is a little premature for him to note what his top priorities would be as a state politician when asked Tuesday.
“I want to listen to what’s important to the people out here, and my mission will be to carry their best interest forward,” he said.
When asked for his position on property taxes, Rabou noted he is for limited government, but acknowledged there is still much to learn, absorb and understand, again leaning on his philosophy of listening to and representing constituents.
“Whatever issues are facing the Legislature, I certainly know [property tax] is a big one. I think that it’s important to really get both sides and as much perspective as possible before one actually dials in on what an actual solution would be, or what side of the fence you would be on,” he said.

Lifts will be turning at Jackson Thursday and Targhee Friday. A warm and dry November has delayed the season's start. 
The post December snow helps Wyoming ski areas begin to open appeared first on WyoFile .","Ski lifts will begin to run Thursday in northwestern Wyoming — marking the official opening day of a season delayed by a mild and dry November. 
Wyoming’s largest resort, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, will launch its 60th season with three lifts running. Neighboring Grand Targhee resort will follow with its opening day on Friday. 
Elsewhere across the state, managers are hoping for assistance from Mother Nature. December has ushered in snowfall and colder temperatures across Wyoming, but for resorts that don’t have snowmaking infrastructure, like Antelope Butte in the Bighorn Mountains, there’s still a little ways to go. 
Storms brought about 4-6 inches of snow this week, Antelope Butte Guest Services Manager Tim Brown said Wednesday, but “there’s still grass poking up through the snow.”
November was drier and balmier than normal in Wyoming. Temperatures were as much as 10-15 degrees Fahrenheit warmer for much of the month, according to the National Weather Service Office in Riverton.

Some people likely enjoyed the mild sunny days, but the weather stymied snowmaking and other preparations for skiing. Jackson Hole Mountain Resort originally planned to open last Friday. White Pine near Pinedale moved its original Dec. 5 target to Dec. 12. Snow King in Jackson will open its scenic gondola on Friday but hasn’t announced when skiing will begin. 
For skiers antsy to get on the slopes, here are opening updates and projections for Wyoming’s resorts. 
Antelope Butte
This small ski area, located off of U.S. Highway 14 between Shell and Sheridan, has a target opening day of Dec. 19. Temperatures at the 8,400-foot-base-elevation mountain started dropping starting in late November, and this week’s weather bodes well. “It’s been coming down pretty regularly for the last 24 to 48 hours,” Brown said Wednesday. 
Jackson Hole Mountain Resort 
Three lifts — Teewinot, Apres Vous and lower Sweetwater — will be open to skiers Thursday at the state’s most high-profile resort. Crews have been making snow, and natural storms have helped fill in the base, with 2 new inches reported Wednesday morning. The mountain reports some 34 inches of natural snowfall mid-mountain so far, but cautioned skiers that “early-season conditions still exist, and all guests are advised to stay out of closed areas and look for hazards.” 
The resort hopes to announce additional terrain or lift openings the second week of December. 
Area skiers are heartened by weather forecasts, which call for a 100% chance of snow in the Jackson region this weekend. 
“What is certain is snowfall, what isn’t certain is how much,” The Bridger-Teton Avalanche Center said in a Tuesday posting. “The forecast area could receive over 2 inches of snow water equivalent and over 30 inches of snow by Monday morning.”
Grand Targhee 
The northwestern Wyoming resort, which sits near the Idaho border, will open Friday with two lifts. “The last few days have provided us the necessary conditions to make some snow off the Shoshone lift,” the resort announced Tuesday, thanking its snowmakers and groomers for their efforts. The mountain also cautioned skiers about thin spots until the base gets filled in. 

Hogadon Basin Ski Area posted this on Facebook Nov. 25. “Round 1 of snowmaking for the 2025-2026 season has started!” the post read. (Screengrab)

Hogadon Basin Ski Area 
The slopes of Hogadon Basin Ski Area were still brown in mid-November, but Casper’s weather plunged toward winter in the last week. Casper experienced a record-breaking low on Saturday of -15 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Weather Service, and also received a few inches of snow this week. 
The mountain plans to open its beginner area on Dec. 13, Ski Area Superintendent Ryan Butler said Wednesday. Snowmaking crews had exhausted the water supply by Wednesday, he said. Once it recharges they will resume. 
Meadowlark Ski Lodge
Meadowlark Ski Lodge, which sits in the southern Bighorn Mountains, doesn’t typically announce its opening date weeks in advance, co-owner Holly Jones said Wednesday. Opening day is too dependent on the whims of Mother Nature. 
Instead, Jones said, management waits until the mountain is ready, then updates Facebook. “We post it online, and then everybody shows up to ski,” she said. 
The two-lift mountain, which sits off of U.S. Highway 16 between Ten Sleep and Buffalo, has some base coverage, and snowmakers are making more under the lifts, she said. Though reluctant to pinpoint a date, Jones said the aim is to be welcoming skiers by Dec. 15. 
Pine Creek 
This small family-operated resort near Cokeville isn’t quite ready to open, operations director Alicia Etcheverry told WyoFile in an email Wednesday. But it typically gets lifts turning by mid-December. 
“It all depends on snow levels and right now we are waiting on a couple more good storms,” she wrote. “We have around a foot of snow and the cold temps are helping preserve it.”
The resort will update its website when it has an opening set.

Snow King Mountain
Snow King Mountain Resort in the town of Jackson will open its scenic gondola and its “Cowboy Coaster” Friday, but isn’t quite ready for snowsports on its 500 acres. “Skiing and boarding soon to follow!” reads its website. 
Snowy Range
Snowy Range in southeastern Wyoming plans to open Dec. 12. This week’s storm brought a blanket of fresh snow on Wednesday and temperatures in the teens. The National Weather Service is forecasting more snow this weekend. 
White Pine 
White Pine, a two-lift resort outside of Pinedale, also moved its opening date back from an original target of Dec. 5 to Dec. 12. In addition, the mountain announced it will offer a new Thursday-through-Sunday schedule this season. Snow looks likely Friday night.

Our disagreements, regardless of how trivial or necessary, are becoming ever more bitter, writes columnist David Romtvedt.
The post The home I would come home to appeared first on WyoFile .","According to the United Nations’ 2025 World Urbanization Prospects report, Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, has displaced Tokyo as the most populated city in the world. With 42 million residents, Jakarta’s population is about the same as that of Canada’s. The report also notes that 45% of the world’s 8.2 billion human inhabitants live in cities.

Opinion

I’ve just returned from the Basque Country, where people always surrounded me. I mostly walked everywhere — 3-5 miles a day on packed streets where, when it rained, we engaged in a kind of umbrella war jockeying for space on the wet sidewalks. My trip home took 27 hours — two bus rides, three airplanes, three airports, and finally a car trip from the airport in Wyoming. 
I was worn out and happy to be home, to be welcomed back to silence and space. The Basque Autonomous Region — Euskadi, where I usually spend a month or so each year, has an area of 2,800 square miles and a population of 2.2 million. Johnson County, Wyoming, where I live for the rest of the year, has an area of 4,175 square miles with a population of 8,500, about half of whom live in Buffalo, the county seat.
While I was out of the country, a neighbor contacted my wife to say that she loves the columns I write, even though she mostly disagrees with what I say. This is a generous comment reflecting the degree to which we are acquainted with one another in small towns. But it’s also a statement that’s becoming increasingly rare, as our disagreements have become ever more bitter. Our social discourse has been degraded by social distance — digital interaction rather than face-to-face — and by living among strangers, both of which seem to encourage vulgarity, aggressive hostility, personal animosity, self-interest, and perhaps most alarming, an inability to imagine the lives of others, to feel what others feel.
One marker for this lack of feeling is seen in the Trump administration’s murder of suspected drug traffickers in international waters — no arrests, no charges, no due process, no trials. Our government announced that certain people were drug traffickers and ordered them murdered.
While I don’t know if they were responding specifically to this, seven members of Congress, all with military and intelligence backgrounds, released a video in which one of them, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly said, “Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders.” Kelly, a former Navy fighter pilot and astronaut, was referring to the U.S. Military Code of Justice and the U.S. Manual for Courts-Martial, which state that the military requirement to obey orders “does not apply to a patently illegal order, such as one that directs the commission of a crime.”
The response to Kelly’s statement from retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who served as U.S. commander of Basic Training, was that the order to refuse illegal orders, first stated for recruits in George Washington’s Continental Army, is given to all recruits to this day and is an expectation placed on all military personnel. But that was not President Donald Trump’s response. The president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Kelly and the others had engaged in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” The president also reposted another Truth Social user who wrote, “HANG THEM.”
Secretary of War (Defense) Pete Hegseth initiated a Pentagon investigation into Kelly, citing the Military Code of Justice. Kelly, seemingly with some degree of humor, said, “He’s going to prosecute me under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for reciting the Uniform Code of Military Justice … It’s almost like you can’t make this shit up.” Kelly’s fellow Arizona senator, Ruben Gallegos, said Kelly “was doing his duty and just reminding people about their rights as service members.” Gallegos added, “And Secretary Hegseth … fuck you guys.”
These two little linguistic intrusions — “you can’t make this shit up,” and “fuck you” are revealing tics. How is it that we’ve come to accept this language in public discourse and in print? How is it that we’ve abandoned what we formerly saw as respect for those with whom we disagree and now see as weakness? Or am I wrong and the inclusion of this formerly unacceptable language simply reveals how strongly our lines are drawn, how pressured we are, how much we feel we can only make our point if we present it in the most extreme way possible?
And what about my neighbor saying she loves reading my columns even though she disagrees with what I say? I see her there at her kitchen table reading calmly and patiently. In response to her generosity, I can only say thank you. This is the home I would come home to.

Jeffrey Rawlings had prepared a “cute speech” for Tuesday’s “Be a Light Gala,” the annual fundraiser for the N.C. Coalition to End Homelessness.
But Rawlings, a senior analyst for homeless services for the City of Durham and a coalition board member, said the times called for something different, so he scrapped the “cute speech” in favor of a more direct message.
“We are under attack. The people that we serve are under attack,” said Rawlings, referring to Trump administration policies that he and other advocates for people experiencing homelessness believe are harmful.
Rawlings, who has twice experienced homelessness, said the Trump administration is attempting to “criminalize what we do and to make us do it a different way.”
“I will say this with absolute honesty: Housing First is not perfect, but it’s the best thing out there,” Rawlings said. “There’s not anything better.”
Rawlings was referring to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) dramatic shift away from the Housing First model, which prioritizes immediate access to permanent housing without preconditions such as sobriety or enrollment in drug treatment. 
The Trump administration is making deep cuts to funding for long-term housing and redirecting it to transitional housing with mandatory work requirements and treatment for addiction. 
HUD announced last month that it would change its focus, shifting two thirds of the $3.9 billion Continuum of Care (CoC) grants program to transitional housing and other short-term interventions for people experiencing homelessness. The program is the largest federal grant program specifically for assisting people experiencing homelessness. Much of that money has been used for years for permanent housing or subsidized rents for formerly homeless people. 

Advocacy groups claim the policy change will push more than 170,000 people into homelessness, some 3,000 of them in North Carolina. On Monday, they sued the Trump administration over the move, asking a federal judge to block it. 
The lawsuit was filed by the National Alliance to End Homelessness in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. It names the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and HUD Secretary Scott Turner as defendants.

Latonya Agard, executive director of the NC Coalition to End Homelessness, shared news about the legal efforts to “stop the madness” with those attending the coalition’s “Be a Light Gala,” which was held virtually this year on Giving Tuesday.
“The NCCEH and so many of our partners are part of the fight to resist that,” Agard said.
The coalition receives state and federal dollars but can only use private donations for advocacy work, Agard told those attending the fundraiser.  
She cited the coalition’s success this year in helping to stop bills supported by Republicans in the General Assembly that advocates for people experiencing homelessness contend would have been “disastrous.” The coalition and its partners testified against the bills in legislative committees in both chambers.
One of them, House Bill 437, would have made homeless shelters operators responsible if drugs were sold or delivered outside of their facilities. It passed the state House, but stalled in the state Senate.
Rep. Heather Rhyne (R-Lincoln) said at the time that such a law is needed because the state’s homeless population is under regular threat from dealers seeking to sell them controlled substances.
“By making homeless shelters drug-free zones, we reduce the opportunity for these criminal elements to further victimize the homeless while holding operators of these facilities accountable,” said Rhyne, a bill cosponsor. 
But Agard said it could have forced shelters to close. 
“They [service providers] would have been fined, they faced potential felony charges because they couldn’t control what people were doing outside of their premises,” Agard said.
Another example, Agard said, was a controversial bill to ban public camping that would have criminalized people experiencing homelessness “for simply not having a home.” House Bill 781 would have prohibited unauthorized camping on public property. It also stalled in the Senate.
A bill co-sponsor, Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph), said leaders of local municipalities came to him looking for guidance in handling homelessness. Biggs insisted the bill doesn’t criminalize homelessness as some critics contend.
“It addresses the use of public property for camping and sleeping without prohibiting homelessness,” Biggs said in April. “It does create clear guidance. We need guidance.”
H781 also passed the House but stalled in the Senate – in part, Agard said, due to the coalition’s testimony about it.
“Those were two huge wins, and this organization was part of the effort to bring people together, to craft a narrative that was compelling, and to use evidence, to use facts to show that these things are wrong,” Agard said.
“We can’t do that kind of work without funding that is not tied to federal policies or state policies, or any of those restrictions,” Agard said. “We need funds that will allow us to continue to do the hard work of standing in solidarity with people experiencing homelessness, speaking truth to power and ensuring that we are a voice for equity.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image-1.png,,,2025-12-04 06:57:30.690286

(Photo by Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Environmentalist groups and some Cameron Parish residents are disgruntled after Louisiana officials recently gave the go-ahead for construction of a liquified natural gas export facility after a state judge suspended the project.    
Judge Penelope Richard of the 38th Judicial District Court, which includes Cameron Parish, suspended Commonwealth LNG’s permit last month in response to a lawsuit from the Sierra Club. She ruled the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy hadn’t considered the effects of climate change, the high density of gas export facilities already in the area and the disproportionate impact of pollution on nearby communities when it approved the permit. 
The state agency then issued updated reasons Nov. 18 for approving Commonwealth’s permit, allowing the project to move forward. Officials again determined the proposed benefits of the project “outweigh the costs” of its environmental impact on Southwest Louisiana’s coast and communities. 
“Economic benefit outweighing all of these things is frustrating to me,” said John Allaire, a Cameron Parish resident who lives within 30 miles of three existing LNG export facilities and six more planned or under construction. “The economic benefits of their facility outweigh flooding me out, outweigh the commercial fishing industry, outweigh the eastern black rail, outweigh protecting our cheniers … I don’t agree with that. How much is enough?” 
The Department of Conservation and Energy’s new permit approval was based on an “independent analysis” of documents from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Those agencies considered the effects of climate change, environmental justice concerns and the cumulative impacts of multiple LNG facilities within a small area. All reached the same conclusion that the project’s benefits overshadow its costs. 
Environmental groups staunchly disagree with the decision to reissue the permit.
The Sierra Club said in a statement through its managing attorney, Eric Huber, that the permit was approved “without any notice to the plaintiffs or the public,” who he said learned about it through the news reports. Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade, also plaintiffs in the lawsuit, declined to comment.  


Let us know what you think...


 

Sierra Club attorneys are reviewing the latest permit approval to decide whether they will take further legal action. By reissuing the permit, the state Department of Conservation and Energy “continues to neglect its responsibility to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans,” their statement said.
In its new reasons for approving the permit, Conservation and Energy officials determined it was in the “best interest of the state” not to delay in reassessing the permit as reason for their speedy decision. This is, in part, related to the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda, which calls for further expansion of industries like liquified natural gas. 
The agency also justified its use of these external documents rather than doing its own research by citing the federal government’s decision to abandon its environmental justice analysis tools, following an executive order from President Donald Trump the day after he took office in January. 
Benefits cited in the state’s permit approval include job creation. Commonwealth estimates it will employ an average of 800 construction workers per month, with a peak of 2,000, over the three-year period. Half of all these construction employees are expected to come from Cameron and Calcasieu parishes, according to the document. 
The permit approval explanation did list downsides to the project, including the destruction of around 90 acres of coastal wetlands in Cameron Parish. State officials accounted for this, saying “these wetland impacts would be mitigated and would not have a significant cumulative impact on environmental justice communities.”
Community advocates like James Hiatt, director of nonprofit For a Better Bayou, question whether the state is acting in the best interests of its residents.  
“The job is not to expedite permits and do whatever corporations want. Their job is to protect national resources, the public good, the public interest,” Hiatt said, citing ongoing issues in Cameron Parish with rapidly eroding coastal land and disproportionately high pollution levels in communities closest to the LNG export sites.
The Commonwealth LNG facility will be built 750 feet away from Allaire’s property line, he said, adding that he feels Cameron Parish won’t see enough of the economic benefit from these facilities to make up for all of the drawbacks. 
 “They keep saying, ‘Well, it’ll be mitigated by economic benefit to the community,’” he said. “But come on down here and see where the economic benefit to the community is. It’s not here.”

“We are interested in continuing this fight to end deportation flights,” Aurora Unidos organizer Yoselin Corrales said after the meeting. “We’re passionate about supporting individuals and immigrants in our community that are being abused and harmed by this administration. We know that Key Lime Air is complicit, and so we are looking to bring the fight to them, and looking for as much information as we can gain for the campaign against their company.”
Corrales said Fronapfel approached protesters during a November demonstration at the airport, saying he “supported what we were doing and would protect our ability to do so.”

Key Lime Air’s headquarters are at the Centennial Airport through a sublease with jetCenters of Colorado. The airline’s operation of ICE flights was first reported by Colorado Newsline in October. Two of its planes frequently fly routes between known ICE hubs, including in Texas, Louisiana and Florida, according to a Newsline analysis of publicly available flight tracking data.
The company flew 83 ICE flights in September and 192 in October, according to Human Rights First’s most recent ICE Flight Monitor Report. It is part of a growing network of companies, such as Avelo and GlobalX, that provide domestic immigration enforcement flights as the Trump administration ramps up mass deportation efforts.
Organizers acknowledge that airport leadership have little power to stop Key Lime Air’s immigration-related activity.
“The Centennial Airport is not going to be able to kick Key Lime Air out. They’re not going to be able to end the abuses that ICE is causing. But each blow that we strike to these entities puts a delay to what ICE is capable of doing,” Corrales said. “Anything that we can do to slow that process down until we can find longer term solutions is the goal.”
Human Rights First documented 109 total immigration enforcement flights — across all the airlines ICE uses — out of Denver between January and October. In April, the U.S. Coast Guard operated at least three immigration enforcement flights from Centennial Airport.
Cliff Honeycutt, Key Lime Air’s CEO, previously wrote in a text message that he can’t discuss private charter operations.
Organizers plan to attend and submit public comment at an upcoming Arapahoe County Public Airport Authority Board of Commissioner’s meeting.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In the wake of business tax cuts and dried-up federal stimulus funds, Tennessee Comptroller Jason Mumpower is predicting a tough budget for fiscal year 2026-27.
Mumpower, who chairs the funding board that sets the budget growth rate each year based on economic forecasts, told the Lookout he believes it will be “the tightest budget year the Lee administration has experienced” in nearly eight years.
“There’s so many demands for money and resources,” said Mumpower, a former Republican lawmaker. “Prioritization is going to be the word of the year.”
Yet Republican lawmakers are pushing for an increase in funding for the state’s new private-school voucher program, which cost $144 million this year. 
Gov. Bill Lee also wants to add to the 20,000 students receiving $7,300 to attend private schools. The state has declined to say how many of recipients were enrolled in private school already, though 66% were expected to come from private schools.
With a difficult budget year looming, Finance and Administration Commissioner Jim Bryson urged department heads to trim their budget plans by 1% as they made presentations to the governor’s staff in November. Lee, though, told reporters he didn’t know anything about Bryson’s request.
Prioritization is going to be the word of the year,” says Tennessee Comptroller Jason Mumpower of the state budget.
Nearly every department requested funding increases.
The Department of Safety and Homeland Security is seeking an $84 million increase in its budget for next year, including more than $43 million to hire Tennessee Highway Patrol officers. The Department of Correction is seeking an $85 million increase, which includes $13 million more to pay CoreCivic, a private company that runs four state prisons.
Two years after dialing back the economy’s growth rate to reflect negative growth, the funding board recently set the figure for fiscal 2026-27 to fall between 2.25% and 2.35%, which would bring the state $450 million more in revenue.
Mumpower described the state’s economy as “very resilient” but noted the federal stimulus funds are gone and projected growth is below the 3% inflation rate. 
“Obviously, our purchasing power is impaired by that inflation rate,” he said.
Rep. John Ray Clemmons of Nashville said Democrats have been warning of a coming financial crisis for years and accused Republicans of running the state “off the fiscal cliff.”
“Reckless spending programs, endless corporate handouts and rampant fiscal mismanagement, combined with irresponsible revenue cuts that made our state even more reliant on fluctuating sales tax revenues, have resulted in an impending budget crisis,” Clemmons said.
Republican lawmakers approved two straight years of business tax reductions and a three-year tax rebate in 2024 that initially cost the state $1.5 billion initially, $7.4 billion over the next few years. 
Changes came after the Department of Revenue said the state could run into “significant legal risk” because of challenges to the property measure in the state’s franchise tax. State officials never identified any litigation, and some lawmakers said the move was simply good policy.
Tennessee has a AAA bond rating with Moody’s Analytics, a financial company in New York, Yet a Moody’s analyst described Tennessee’s economy as “treading water”, mainly because of tariff increases and federal job cuts. Sixteen states have economies that are expanding, according to the report, while 22 are in a recession or facing “high risk” for a recession.
Tennessee Correction Department requests $13M pay increase for embattled private-prison operator

House finance committee Chairman Gary Hicks said he met with Moody’s Analytics in October and its representatives never mentioned that the state was “treading water.”
Hicks said revenues are starting to “normalize” after two years of federal stimulus injections during the pandemic era.
“Which means we’re going to have to be more efficient in how we run government,” Hicks said. “I’m not real worried about that just yet. The economy’s always changing and it always will.”
Moody’s asked about the state’s business tax reductions, but Hicks said the state showed how it went about the business tax cuts “deliberately.” He said the state put itself in a good position by using “recurring” dollars, revenue projected to come in every year, for “non-recurring” expenditures, items that won’t have to be funded each year.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The University of Arkansas in Fayetteville has identified more than 100 scholarships to be modified to comply with laws related to race and diversity, and at least one donor has ended his financial support as a result. 
A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that it’s unconstitutional to use race as a selection criterion in university admissions prompted the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees to approve a resolution in January to review and modify scholarship endowment funds to comply with applicable law. 
The resolution directed campuses to use “permissible modifications that honor as closely as possible donor intent,” such as having significant financial need, being a first-generation college student, hailing from a geographic area that is less well-represented or having a record of overcoming challenges. 
“The goal of the changes is to ensure that donor intent can be carried out to the greatest extent possible and that University of Arkansas students with demonstrated need can continue to benefit from these generous gifts for years to come,” UA System President Jay Silveria said in a letter to trustees.  
As of late November, the majority of donors had been notified, but the process remains ongoing, said John Thomas, director of media relations and core communications.  
“Most donors contacted recognize the University’s obligation to make revisions given changes in the legal environment, including the Supreme Court’s Students for Fair Admissions decision,” Thomas wrote in an email. “If donors wish to discuss refined modifications, we are open to discussing that with them, but the bottom line is that scholarships must be compliant with legal requirements.”  
Higher ed institutions have been grappling with how to comply with an increasing number of federal and state directives and rules aimed at dismantling initiatives related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in recent years. The institutions’ resulting actions have sometimes led to a loss of programs.
The University of Alabama, for example, suspended publication of two magazines Monday, claiming they were out of compliance with federal DEI guidance. In late October, the Equal Protection Project requested a federal civil rights investigation into the University of Central Arkansas over 10 scholarships that the group argued “discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin and/or sex in violation of Title VI and Title IX.” The EPP began in 2023 as an arm of the Legal Insurrection Foundation, a conservative-leaning advocacy group.
Bill to prohibit discrimination passes split Arkansas House panel after much public opposition

The complaint, filed with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, “helps illustrate the risks that the University of Arkansas has been proactively seeking to prevent through the revision process,” Thomas said.
Documents the Advocate obtained through a public records request show that in July 2025, the University of Arkansas’ review also considered two new laws passed by the Arkansas General Assembly during this year’s legislative session. Act 116 of 2025 prohibits preferential treatment based on “race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in matters of state employment, public education, or state procurement.” Meanwhile, Act 340 of 2025 prohibits requiring adherence to a philosophical viewpoint or requiring the submission of diversity-related statements.  
With regard to sex-based scholarships, Thomas said some “distinct considerations” apply based on Title IX regulations, but generally any prohibitions would apply equally to both men and women. 
“The issue here is that if there is a sex restricted scholarship in support of an academic unit, there is an exception under the Title IX regulations through which the scholarship can be awarded, but only if it is grouped with a larger set of scholarships, with the recipients chosen without regard to sex,” Thomas said. “The sex-restricted scholarship can then be matched to a qualified recipient.”
This only applies to a small number of existing, older scholarships, he said.
Revoked support
According to emails the Advocate obtained through a public records request, four scholarships were identified for modification within the University of Arkansas’ Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design, including the Andrew A. Kinslow and Russell W. Kirkpatrick Diversity Award for Design Excellence. 
Kinslow, an architecture school alum and the scholarship’s benefactor, said he first learned university officials were considering changing his scholarship through an informal conversation about a year ago. He received a formal email about potential modifications on Oct. 10.
Ten Commandments displays prompt scholarship cancellations, teach-in at University of Arkansas

That same week, Kinslow learned Ten Commandments posters were being installed on the university’s Fayetteville campus to comply with another new state law, and decided to end his financial support by cutting the U of A out of his will and discontinuing his two scholarships. 
The Andrew A. Kinslow Interior Design Scholarship awarded $1,000 to a 3rd or 4th year student from Arkansas interested in commercial design. Applicant criteria is not included on that same scholarship website for Kinslow’s $1,500 diversity scholarship. However, according to a document on the architecture school’s website, the scholarship was awarded to 2nd through 5th year students with a 3.0 grade point average who demonstrate financial need and consideration was “given to students who demonstrate commitment to diversity and inclusion.”
Kinslow said he started the diversity scholarship a few years ago “to do more to help the students.” The Arkansas native, who now lives in Oklahoma, said he was surprised by notification that the scholarship needed to be changed because it refers to diversity generally instead of something specific, like a racial quota. 
“It was open in that it was to encourage diversity of all kinds and that includes people from small towns, it includes people from inner cities, it includes people from not necessarily race-based, but just more that whole thing of exposure to all sorts of people,” Kinslow said. 
“…I couldn’t understand why anybody would be against that, and that was when we had talked about pulling it because if it can’t be what we want it to be, why are we doing it?”
When he owned his own architecture firm, Kinslow said his 75 employees had a wide range of ethnic and religious backgrounds, which was good for the company. 
“It was a very diverse group, and we felt like that was one of our strengths in being able to pair people with clients that would relate more to that architect or designer,” he said. 
The firm never had racial quotas, according to Kinslow, who said they simply hired the most qualified person and sometimes that was a person from an underrepresented group.

“I think what we were trying to do was to make sure that we were interviewing everyone who applied and then picking the best person from that group,” he said. “And it just happened at different times that that was who that was.”
As a “strong believer” in the separation of church and state, Kinslow said the installation of the Ten Commandments at the university was “the final straw” that solidified his decision to cease his financial contributions, which he was already considering because of the issues with his diversity scholarship. 
In a Monday email to the architecture school, Kinslow said he had not received formal notification from anyone at the university acknowledging his termination of the scholarships or the gift in his will. Kinslow said he still had not received a response as of Wednesday. 
Once funding for a scholarship has been provided, a gift is considered complete and is not refundable, Thomas said. 
“Completed gifts are not returned by the University of Arkansas Foundation, but are used to continue to benefit students, as closely as possible in line with the donor’s intent,” he said.
Kinslow provided money for his scholarships on an annual basis and said he would not do so moving forward, even if the Ten Commandments law is repealed “because it never should have happened.”  
The U of A alum said he is still considering other organizations where he can direct the financial support he is rescinding from the university.

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)Groups providing critical services to West Virginia foster care children, including driving them to see their biological parents, are calling on Gov. Patrick Morrisey and the Human Services secretary to immediately halt a new transportation documentation policy, saying it’s excessive, redundant and “forcing some providers to discontinue services.”
The mileage log policy change followed Morrisey’s executive order to weed out wasteful spending in state government. It resulted in state Department of Human Services officials finding numerous “unusual discrepancies” with Socially Necessary Services providers’ mileage.
There are nearly 6,000 children in the state’s overwhelmed foster care system. Multiple Socially Necessary Services providers support these children by transporting them to visits with their biological parents, siblings and grandparents. Often, providers’ goal is to support family reunification. Providers also provide safety services where children are present in the home and a safety concern has been identified.
DoHS notified the state’s service providers on Oct. 30 that they were now required to provide a mileage log for every mile utilized across the state beginning Nov. 1. Providers said the requirement is “labor-intensive administrative work without compensation” that will result in billing delays. 
“Your Socially Necessary Services provider community urgently requests the West Virginia Department of Human Services to immediately pause a well-intentioned, but inefficient transpiration policy,” several providers wrote in a letter to Morrisey and DoHS Secretary Alex Mayer on Nov. 13. 
“With a workforce already strained to the breaking point, we urge the state to remember that our first duty, providers and leadership alike, is to protect the children of West Virginia,” they said.
The mileage log requirement followed Morrisey’s executive order — issued on his first full day in office — that called for efficiency in state government. The order called on agencies to identify wasteful spending. 
Morrisey’s office did not respond to a request for comment. 
Angelica Hightower, spokesperson for DoHS, said the department “takes the stewardship of valued taxpayer dollars extremely seriously” and has been reviewing service provider payments, including Socially Necessary Services.
“Through this review, DoHS identified that transportation costs accounted for approximately 35% of all [Socially Necessary Services] spending, and numerous mileage invoices reflected unusual discrepancies,” Hightower said.
“To better understand the spending in this area, DoHS implemented a verification process reflecting what our own staff follow when traveling in their official capacity,” she continued. “This change results in [Socially Necessary Services] providers now submitting mileage logs that include start and end locations and total miles traveled, which are reviewed before payments are issued.”
Socially Necessary Services providers said the new requirement created the fourth time that they have to document information related to their work, and services have already been previously authorized by the state. The state contracts with a vendor, Acentra, to provide prior authorization for SNS services.
In their letter to Morrisey and Mayer, Socially Necessary Services providers stressed that good providers were committed to stopping fraud.
“We have a vested interest in ensuring limited dollars are spent appropriately,” they wrote. “The new policy doesn’t accomplish that goal and makes delivering critical services to children untenable. It is unclear how redundant documentation prevents fraud … This new policy doesn’t focus on providers exceeding authorizations, it merely requests the information be provided again.” 
The letter noted that the DoHS has had issues with Acentra working with the state’s online PATH portal — an information technology system for both users and providers with child welfare programs in the state. The state has spent more than $300 million creating PATH, and it still doesn’t work properly.  
“ … The consequence of those issues should not be more bureaucratic hurdles for providers,” they wrote. 
Socially Necessary Services providers proposed that DoHS use Acentra for its intended purpose of gatekeeping mileage. If a provider’s mileage exceeds the up to 3,000 mile limit for a three-month period, the SNS community suggested that the department determine if more mileage needs to be approved or suspend services to review potential problems. 
“We find ourselves in the dark, left to manage the consequences of poor decision making,” providers wrote.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A key U.S. senator raised questions Wednesday about whether former car dealership magnate Lee Beaman is fit to serve on the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors.
Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told the panel that Beaman’s qualification is that of a “Trump loyalist and 2020 election denier,” in reference to his support of President Donald Trump and claims that the presidential election of 2020 was stolen, a matter that has been debunked.
Whitehouse said Beaman signed a letter asking state lawmakers to appoint phony electors to overturn the election and noted he received a “Freedom Award” from Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, which supports the fossil-fuel industry. 
“When the ask comes to raise customers’ rates by backing away from clean energy, it’s a safe bet whose back he’ll have,” Whitehouse said.
In addition, Beaman is a landlord for several Republican members of Congress at a Capitol Hill rowhome, including U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Whitehouse said, along with U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee. Critics have questioned whether the arrangements meet disclosure and ethics requirements.
The nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics found wrongdoing in an Ogles campaign finance report, with Beaman serving as treasurer at the time, and planned to subpoena the congressman to testify. But that has been stalled since Johnson took over the speakership, Whitehouse said.
At public hearing, Knoxville residents push back on privatization of Tennessee Valley Authority

U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee introduced Beaman at the committee hearing, with Blackburn touting his “decades of experience in business leadership, community service and organizational governance,” as well as leadership in the beverage industry for 35 years in Tennessee and Georgia, according to a knoxnews article. Work in those TVA service areas gives Beaman “first-hand familiarity with the communities, the people, the economic conditions and the operations needs of this region,” Blackburn said.
The full Senate will take a final vote on the nominations of Beaman and four other men to fill TVA posts that became vacant after Trump fired Biden appointees, leaving the board unable to reach a quorum for decisions.
Asked Wednesday about his views on the importance of nuclear energy to TVA’s future, Beaman said, “I think nuclear power generation is the future of power in the United States and probably around the world,” according to the Knoxnews report.
Similarly to the other four nominees, Beaman told the committee he opposes privatizing the federally-owned utility, saying, “TVA is more uniquely, appropriately operated as a government entity.”
U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Memphis Democrat, called for the committee to reject Beaman’s nomination, saying he has no experience in the energy and utilities industries, in addition to lacking “sound judgment” and independence. Instead, most of his career has been in automotive sales, beverage distribution, real estate holdings and political fundraising, Cohen said.
“Nothing in Mr. Beaman’s record reflects the expertise necessary to provide informed oversight of such a complex public utility,” Cohen said in a statement.
The congressman also said Beaman acknowledged he was encouraged to pursue the TVA seat because of the “ongoing race for energy to feed AI-driven demand for data centers.” Cohen said Beaman holds equity stakes in businesses depending on AI integration, including energy-intensive computing, raising questions about a potential conflict of interest.
Beaman is a member of the Belmont University Board of Trustees, returning to the post after a leave of absence related to a divorce and accusations of sordid behavior by his ex-wife. 
He did not return a call requesting comment on the Senate hearing.

Current federal policies barely chip away at the buildup, with only 0.08% of public lands treated with prescribed fire. A rate far below the accumulation of vulnerable fuels on public lands in the mountain states.
The U.S. Forest Service manages 193 million acres, and 80 million acres need to be restored. Accounting for all management practices, like selective logging and prescribed fire, it will take 40 years to restore the forests needing remediated today. This does not account for the millions of acres that will become vulnerable in the future. It is little wonder that catastrophic wildfires continue to burst from this ever-growing logjam.
Balance of Idaho’s state wildfire suppression fund drops to $15 million after 2025 season

The bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act (HR 471 and S.1462), moving quickly through Congress, has the potential of ending this logjam. The strategy of the act authorizes more forest management tools and accelerates projects, lowering the frequency of deadly forest fires in the western United States.
In January, House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (AR) testified on the act saying: “FOFA codifies emergency authorities used by both Democrat and Republican administrations to increase the pace and scale of management. Without these tools, completing a single forest management project takes three to five years. With them, land managers can act immediately.”
The Fix Our Forests Act creates these changes through four titles, attempting to solve this crisis with a solution whose breadth matches the problem. Below are some of the act’s policies that could remediate this government-created tinderbox:

Designates Fireshed Management Areas, which consist of the top 20% of firesheds for wildfire risk exposure based on threat to communities, municipal watersheds, and vegetation type.
Establishes the Wildfire Intelligence Center to assess and predict fire and provide data related to each fireshed and increase public interface to improve community wildfire resilience.
Expands collaborative tools to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health by extending stewardship contracts from 10 to 20 years, increasing project scale from 3,000 to 10,000 acres, and utilizing grazing.
Reforms and streamlines the litigation process.
Prioritizes prescribed fire as a management tool and expedites the environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act.
Adopts vegetation management and reforestation efforts that improve wildfire resiliency.

2024 saw more acres burned than the five- and 10-year averages, with large fires (100+ acres in timber and 300+ acres in grass) accounting for less than 2% of fires nationally. However, 37 of these large fires were over 40,000 acres. Averaging over 136,000 acres per fire, these 37 large fires accounted for more than 50% of the almost 9 million acres burned in 2024. The complexity and threat of large fires will never be treated by the small efforts of 3,000 acres. Increasing the project scale of expedited projects to 10,000 acres may be enough to control the deluge.
The federal government’s slothfulness in managing fuels on federal land extends beyond potential wildfire threats. In post-fire landscapes, fire remediation on federal lands is minimal and hindered by litigation. Oregon’s 2020 Labor Day wildfires burned more than 1 million acres, consuming about 280,000 acres of federally managed lands. Less than 3% of this federal land received treatment to remove snags to improve safety from falling trees and prevent future reburns, which sterilize the land.
The Fix Our Forests Act’s efforts to increase the size and scope of projects are only possible because the legislation reins in the litigious abuse of special interest groups. Without changing existing environmental protections, the act will provide much-needed flexibility, expediting projects through the review processes. No longer will special interest groups be able to assert unilateral control over the process when fire-threatened communities are begging for prevention tools.
Our forests have outgrown small management projects and the weaponization of litigation to stop needed projects. Millions of acres of overgrown forests need a policy of this magnitude. Expanding the size and length of stewardship contracts and increasing the ease with which projects can be approved are needed steps in collaborating with private industry to increase the resiliency of American forests.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“It is a unique bill that has a lot of emotion and nuances to it,” said Rep. Chuck Wichgers (R-Muskego), describing a bill to give local law enforcement the power to disable or destroy drones. Speaking to the Assembly Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety on Wednesday, Wichgers said that the bill would give “the bare minimum protection” for both the public and police as global drone technology continues to rapidly evolve.
Although current state law prohibits the use of weaponized drones, the devices are not actually defined in statute. Wichgers’ bill would define a weaponized drone as one which “is equipped with a taster, firearm, flamethrower, chemical, or explosive device.” 
Wichgers cautioned that “we can easily complicate this bill,” especially given the growth of drone technology around the world. Over the last two decades, drones have gone from being scarcely heard of outside military settings to becoming household objects. The U.S. military’s infamous Reaper and Predator drones, some of which are the size of small planes, have long been used in combat for reconnaissance and lethal strikes. Today, however, the same small and cheap quad-copter drones used by photographers, landscapers and children are being outfitted with explosives for kamikaze-style attacks on armored vehicles on Russian and Ukrainian battlefields, where an estimated 70-80% of casualties are caused by drones.
“It’s beyond fascinating,” Wichgers  said of “this is a big and global issue.” Wichgers told committee members that “we need to start getting language in statute,” since only certain federal agencies currently have the authority to down weaponized drones. “This bill allows Wisconsin law enforcement to mitigate a threat posed by a weaponized drone by detecting, tracking and identifying the drone and then intercepting, disabling, or in a worst case scenario, destroying the drone.” 
In order to protect public safety,  Wichgers said  that “these powers should be extended to local law enforcement.” He added that the federal government provides grants to help mitigate drone threats, as well as $500 million set aside for fiscal year 2026-27, as part of the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” “The difficulty is that law enforcement should not have to waiver if there is an immediate threat for a drone that is weaponized or carrying a load that is harmful to the public,” said Wichgers. “Our airspace needs to be safe, just like we’re safe on our roads.” 
A quickly moving goalpost 
The bill was requested by the Police Chief Association of Waukesha County, Wichgers said. “State law must be enacted that is responsive to current and future needs as best as we can determine them in order to prevent harm and protect our communities,” he added. 
Committee members chimed in with a variety of questions. Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) joked about farmers using weaponized drones to eliminate sandhill cranes consuming crops. Wichgers brought up  his own examples, including nervous neighbors calling the police to check out roofers who might be using drones for survey work, or a drone being used at a concert to drop fentanyl on people who then overdose in the crowd. “Right now the police would say, ‘Sorry, the Wisconsin Legislature is dragging their feet on passing a law that gives me permission to disarm that drone that’s a threat, we’ll have to wait till next session,” said Wichgers. 
Dan Thompson, chief of the Waukesha Police Department, told the committee,  that “drones carry contraband, surveillance equipment or worse, weaponized payloads” and that the technology can “present a unique danger that demands an immediate intervention.” 
The chief’s comments prompted Rep. David Steffen (R-Howard) to seek clarification that under the proposed bill a drone does not, in fact, need to be weaponized, and that law enforcement only need to “reasonably suspect” that it could pose a public safety threat in order to shoot it down. Sortwell said that the bill’s language seemed broad. 
Sortwell questioned whether as the bill is written, shooting down a drone could be justified at any time. Legislative counsel said, “I don’t know that I can really answer that.” Sortwell shot back, “The fact that you can’t say ‘no’ is troubling.”

(Photo courtesy of Dana Chorpenning)Carol Olson, believed to be the first woman to serve as a North Dakota governor’s chief of staff and lead the state Department of Human Services, died Sunday in Colorado, one day after celebrating her 77th birthday.
Olson was active in North Dakota Republican politics for decades, leading successful campaigns for governors and other statewide officials.
“She was a trailblazer, no doubt about it,” said Republican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, who hired Olson to run his campaign for governor in 2000. “Everybody always knew she was a person you could count on. She was tough, but had a huge heart.”
Former Gov. Ed Schafer said Olson was active in state politics when he met her at the state Republican convention in 1988. He said Olson, the former campaign manager for Republican U.S. Sen. Mark Andrews, was the only name that kept coming up when he asked his confidants who should run his gubernatorial campaign in 1992.
Though Republicans dominate North Dakota politics today, that wasn’t always the case. The Democratic-NPL Party held the governor’s office from 1961-81 and again from 1985-92. 
Olson also ran Schafer’s successful reelection campaign in 1996. 
“We pretty much upended everything the Democrats had done for years and years and years, and changed the directional trajectory of the state to where it is now,” Schafer said. 
Schafer appointed Olson to be his chief of staff during his first term. During his second term, he appointed Olson to run the Department of Human Services, a position she held from 1997 to 2012. Schafer said he believes she was the first woman to hold both positions in North Dakota.
Olson loved being the workhorse behind the political scene, said Kirsten Ziuchkovski, Olson’s youngest daughter.
“She never really liked being in the spotlight, but always putting somebody in the spotlight,” Ziuchkovski said. 
Olson knew how to run a grassroots campaign, said Dana Chorpenning, Olson’s oldest daughter.
“She really understood what it meant to reach every single person in North Dakota and to put out a message that everyone could get behind,” Chorpenning said. 
Although she was known as a good campaign manager, Olson also loved her work with the Department of Human Services, Hoeven said.
“Not only the people there, but the work, helping people. She really liked that,” Hoeven said.
Olson retired in 2012 and moved to Colorado Springs to be closer to her two daughters and six grandchildren.
A celebration of Olson’s life will be held in Bismarck next summer, with a location and time to be announced. Olson requested her ashes be spread over Lake Sakakawea, a place where the family spent countless days and nights with a shared love of the North Dakota outdoors.

Set to air on Mississippi Public Broadcasting at 7:30 p.m., the documentary, “Eyes on Mississippi,” shares its title with Minor’s long-running newspaper column. The nearly one-hour film offers an in-depth look at Mississippi civil rights history through the lens of Minor’s reporting.  
Directed and produced by Ellen Ann Fentress, a journalist and former colleague of Minor, the documentary draws on 24 different historical archives and over 40 hours of footage from interviews of Minor by Fentress. The documentary was first released in 2015 and has since been partially re-edited with new archival material from MPB. 
A portrait of Minor and his dispatches from the front lines of the Civil Rights Movement, the film offers viewers a trenchant look at how journalism and race relations intersect.
“I think this is very auspicious timing for this story to come out,” Fentress said at a documentary screening in Jackson on Tuesday. “We need this story and the relevance of honest journalism and truth-telling. Telling truth to power could not be important than it is right now.”  
Minor covered Mississippi politics for over 70 years, from 1947 until his death in 2017. He earned professional accolades and awards for his gutsy reporting of civil rights violence and the political and social forces that drove it. 
Minor offers an inside view of landmark stories such as the murder of civil rights workers in Neshoba County and the trial of Willie McGee, both of which captured national attention for their window into the racist violence and unequal justice system that infected the Jim Crow South.
The documentary features interviews with figures such as civil-rights leader Myrlie Evers and former Gov. William Winter, the latter calling Minor “our own interpreter of who we are as a state.”
Minor came to Mississippi as the one-man bureau reporter for the New Orleans Times-Picayune. In the years that followed, he documented and explained Mississippi’s society for countless others, including fellow journalists across the nation.
A native of Hammond, Louisiana, Minor was a Tulane University journalism graduate and a World War II Navy combat veteran.
When Fentress decided to make the film, she said that while the film’s title, Eyes on Mississippi, was the name of Minor’s column, it also was his strategy – that “the fastest route to change was to get the unvarnished facts of the struggle out. The more eyes on Mississippi, the more the pressure for transformation.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The number of local law enforcement agencies in Tennessee that have entered partnerships with the federal government to enforce immigration law has risen to 54.
In recent weeks, sheriff’s departments in Hancock, Lincoln, Madison, Marion, Van Buren and Unicoi counties have signed onto so-called 287(g) agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, according to a federal database.
These largely rural counties join a growing list of Tennessee police, sheriffs and constable districts entering into such agreements. Two state agencies – the Department of Correction and Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which operates the Highway Patrol – have also partnered with ICE to crack down on immigration violations in Tennessee, where immigrants without legal status are estimated to represent 2.2% of the population.
Tennessee is among the states seeing the most rapid proliferation of the immigration agreements since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.
Tennessee partnerships with ICE multiply as feds offer $14B in incentives nationwide

Local law enforcement entities may enter into one of three separate tiers of cooperative agreements with the federal government.
They include a “jail enforcement” model that gives local officials the authority to investigate the immigration status of individuals who are already incarcerated. Tennessee law already requires local jails to cooperate with ICE to verify the immigration status of individuals coming into custody.
The “warrant service officer” agreement allows jailers to make arrests on behalf of ICE of individuals already in custody.  
A “task force” model gives local and state law enforcement officers the authority to make immigration arrests as part of their day-to-day policing.  It is the most expansive delegation of immigration enforcement powers of the three models.
Thus far 19 Tennessee counties and the Tennessee Highway Patrol have entered into task force agreements.  
Gov. Bill Lee and the Tennessee General Assembly have offered incentives for partnerships through  $5 million in grants to participating agencies.
The federal government has also offered what it characterized as ‘unprecedented reimbursement opportunities’ to participating agencies.
The reimbursements include salary, benefits and overtime reimbursements for each trained officer, laptops, cell phones, up to $100,000 toward the purchase of agency vehicles and bonuses ranging from $500 to $1000 per officer for the “successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE and overall assistance to further ICE’s mission to Defend the Homeland.”

National Guard/Facebook)Last week two West Virginian National Guard members were tragically shot in an apparently targeted attack during their deployment in Washington, D.C. One of them, a 20 year old named Sarah Beckstrom, died from her injuries. 
The alleged shooter came here from Afghanistan in 2021 after the American withdrawal from the country.  
Now the shooting of the two West Virginians is being used as a catalyst for the latest phase of the presidential administration’s xenophobia and inhumane immigration enforcement. Our state continues to be caught up in the president’s influence and serves as a microcosm for what has happened to the country this year. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey, and other West Virginia elected officials, keep trying to hammer home that the members of the guard who remain in D.C. are there because they volunteered to be.
The fact of the matter is that they’re there because the governor authorized the deployment months ago and still wants our people to be there, despite a recent federal court ruling that the deployment is illegal. A Kentucky or Florida National Guard member can’t just go and volunteer to be deputized to “combat crime” in a place without their governor’s consent. 
One of the worst parts of this tragedy is that there was never a true need for our guardsmen to be there in the first place. There was not a true crisis in Washington, D.C. that necessitated them. If the conditions in D.C. are really that bad, we should be treating it as an epidemic all over the country. 
Imagine if the president, Congress and governors wanted to throw resources that would actually address poverty, homelessness, hunger and crime. 
But no one wants to do that. Instead, Morrisey sent West Virginians as a political stunt to appease the president and bolster his future political prospects, all while setting the stage for possibly worse deployments and occupations in “democratic” states and cities in the future. 
He even fought for the deployment of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington, D.C. when West Virginia groups sued. 
The National Guard members in D.C. were hardly combatting crime. They’ve picked up trash, scooters, and on Thanksgiving they distributed food. According to CNN who interviewed guardsmen in D.C. and their relatives back in September, “one father of a Guardsman joked that this is like a vacation for his son.”
To be clear, none of those things are bad in and of themselves, but they’re bad uses of West Virginia National Guard resources. Things like that could be done in West Virginia. People are hungry here. We have illegal dumping in our forests and around our rivers. Our cities have litter. 
The Charleston-Gazette Mail reported that the National Guard no longer has a role in southern or northern West Virginia even though there are still things to do regarding recovery from this year’s flooding. 
This terrible situation encapsulates a year in which President Donald Trump has captured institutions left and right. At nearly every step of the way, Morrisey, our Legislature and our attorney general have stood behind him. As grants that would improve West Virginia have been cut, as federal employees in the state have been fired, as programs for coal miners and black lung disease have been attacked, and as environmental protections have been rolled back, West Virginia politicians have not pushed back. 
Instead, we get calls for thoughts and prayers. 
Everyone deserves to be kept in our thoughts. But right now what we need isn’t your prayers, Governor. We need your political courage to stand up for West Virginians and not cater to the every-changing whims of the president. Put West Virginians first, not your higher political ambitions.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For the first time, state housing officials will take an active role in gathering data for the annual census of Rhode Island’s unhoused population likely in late January.
The Executive Office of Housing will be the lead coordinator of volunteers who fan out across the state to conduct the yearly Point in Time Count, a responsibility handled by the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness for the past 16 years.
The state’s role in the federally-mandated count previously has been indirect — mostly looking over the coalition’s published numbers upon their release and allowing employees to go out and help with the census.
As the housing office continues to consolidate housing governance across Rhode Island, spokesperson Emily Marshall said the state can now support the count in a more direct way.
“Because the count is primarily conducted by these outreach teams, this new leadership role allows the state to strengthen and coordinate the effort in a more impactful and unified way,” Marshall said in an emailed statement.
The state’s new role doesn’t mean the coalition is ceding its authority in overseeing the yearly snapshot of how many unhoused people are in Rhode Island on a given winter’s night. 
Indeed, the organization will remain in charge of the state’s portion of the Homeless Management Information System through the end of 2028 under an agreement approved by the state’s Continuum of Care board on Nov. 6. The role requires the coalition to clean, validate, analyze, and submit the estimate of Rhode Island’s unhoused population to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
But the coalition is still without many key players in that data management. Susan Gutner, the chairperson of the organization’s board of directors, told Rhode Island Current that the coalition is in the midst of searching for a new data analyst and data liaison.
That’s on top of the ongoing search for a new executive director after Kim Simmons left in early September after a little more than two years on the job.
​​Gunter, who is serving as interim executive director, declined to say why Simmons left.
“I can tell you that we are actively engaged in the search for an executive director and it is going really well,” she said in a recent interview.
Gunter referred any comment on the upcoming Point in Time Count to the Executive Office of Housing, but noted that the coalition has “always worked in partnership” with the state.
“There’s absolutely no change there,” she said.
The coalition has been in charge of Rhode Island’s Homeless Management Information System since 2009.
No firm date yet
The Point in Time count documents the number of individuals experiencing homelessness on a given night during the coldest time of the year — a time when people are more likely to use shelters. The counts, which are done across the country, are used by HUD to determine federal funding for states and organizations to manage their response.
HUD is responsible for setting the date a state holds the count, often in late January. But when Rhode Island’s volunteers will go out next year has yet to be made public.
Laura Jaworski, executive director of the Warwick-based nonprofit community development corporation House of Hope, said partner organizations like hers typically get a sense of when the date will be in late summer or early fall.
“Because of the shutdown, who knows if we’re still going to stick by that January date,” she said.
A HUD spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Rhode Island’s 2026 Point in Time date. Marshall told Rhode Island Current the state expects the date to be some time in the last two weeks of January.
This year’s census was held on Tuesday, Jan. 21 — a day when the temperature hovered around 18 degrees in Providence. There were at least 2,373 unhoused individuals across the state that night, representing a 2.8% decrease from the record high of 2,442 in 2024.
R.I. homelessness is down, but more people are out in the cold? New data says it’s true.

While the overall number of homeless individuals was down, volunteers found more were people outside that night than in a shelter. To remedy that issue Gov. Dan McKee’s administration in late October committed over $1.7 million in grants to municipalities and nonprofit service providers to expand Rhode Island’s network of warming centers and emergency shelters.
The state has had some issue with how the coalition has counted in the past. Rhode Island Housing Secretary Deobrah Goddard in a recent interview said volunteers used the coalition’s call center that was used for shelter referrals to see who may have been outside after the initial count was done, a practice that was allowed during the pandemic but no more.
“That’s not consistent with HUD guidelines,” Goddard said.
As of Oct. 1, the state no longer uses that hotline for shelter referrals.Instead, those seeking shelter must now go through the state’s new regional access points, walk-in centers across Rhode Island set up to connect people with housing and other services.
While the coalition deferred comments about the Point in Time Count, Jaworski was quick to defend the organization’s methodology, which she said is vetted and approved annually by the Continuum of Care board before it’s submitted to HUD.
“They’re following the guidance and letter of the law of what can and cannot be used,” she said. “I would find it hard to believe they were including numbers we cannot use.”
Having faulty numbers, she said, could impact how much grant money the federal government allocates to the state toward its response in addressing homelessness. Though even that now is in question as the Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on the funding — changes that face two separate lawsuits in Rhode Island’s federal courthouse.
Any issues with the methodology would mainly reflect on the organizations that go out to shelters and encampments that night.
“And there’s no lying or miscounting that we’ve been a part of,” she said.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)In an unhinged video this summer, Danielle Jurinsky, a former Aurora City Council member, blamed the Democratic Party for the firebomb attack on peaceful demonstrators in Boulder who called for the release of hostages in Gaza. Through tears, she angrily singled out Jewish leaders in the state, such as Gov. Jared Polis and Attorney General Phil Weiser, and said that as Democrats they were not really Jewish but part of a “demonic cult.”
The shocking performance was just one example of Jurinsky’s cuckoo style of public service, which strictly adhered to the MAGA themes of leadership: outrage, grievance and, above all, attention.
She achieved more attention for herself last year than even she could have imagined when she became the primary spreader of the lie that Venezuelan gangs had “taken over” whole parts of Aurora, Colorado. This falsehood brought undeserved disrepute to the city, but it also prompted a visit by a virulently anti-immigrant presidential candidate. Donald Trump soon led a campaign rally in Aurora, where he repeated lies about immigrants in the city and gave Jurinsky a turn at the mic.
She was clearly thrilled to be in the MAGA limelight. But it’s reasonable to say her constituents were less enthusiastic.

Last month, Aurora voters sent this Trump acolyte packing. Moreover, progressive city council candidates swept the races and flipped a longtime conservative majority. Conservative Steve Sundberg, known for making racist ads for his sports bar, was also booted from office.
Dave Perry, longtime editor of the Aurora Sentinel, in a column after the election captured how toxic city hall had become while Jurinsky and Sundberg were in the majority.
“In more than 30 years of covering Aurora politics, and almost 40 years as a journalist, I’ve seen some stuff. But I’ve never seen anything as dangerously weird as what Jurinsky and Sundberg inflicted on the state’s third-largest city,” Perry wrote. He added this hopeful note: “The Aurora City Council has a chance now to evolve and ensure that no matter how difficult city politics become, it’s never permitted to devolve into an organization that becomes a bigger threat to the community than the challenges they’re elected to solve.”
That process began this week. On Monday, the new Council members were sworn in, and the body immediately began to “undo harm caused by the previous council,” as one of the members put it. This included reversing restrictions on the ability of members of the public to address the Council.
Recovery from Trumpist madness in Aurora exemplifies a pivot that appears to have nationwide force. On Tuesday, a self-described “MAGA warrior” won a special congressional election in Tennessee, but the Democrat lost by just 9 percentage points in a district that historically favored Republicans by more than 20 points and Trump won last year by 22 points.
Democratic candidates throughout the country triumphed so consistently on Election Day last month that even Trump acknowledged it was a drubbing for the GOP.
The spread between Trump’s average approval and disapproval ratings in recent weeks has never been so wide — 39% approve of the president’s job performance, and 59% disapprove. These figures coincide with increasing consumer prices, inhumane and lawless immigration enforcement, fallout from the recent federal government shutdown, allegations that top military officials have committed war crimes, impending health care cost spikes, signs that Trump is physically unfit to carry out presidential duties, brazen acts of corruption, and other national developments that create a sense of dystopia.
Aurora offers some hope.
During her speech at the Trump rally last year, Jurinsky made a brash declaration. 
“Make no mistake of it, folks,” she said. “They can threaten me, they can try to silence me, they can lie about me, they can do whatever they want. I’m not going anywhere.”
But residents of Aurora showed that they could make a destructive figure like Jurinsky go away. They are a model for the country.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) With the clock ticking, Attorney General–elect Jay Jones filed a motion this week asking the Virginia Court of Appeals to extend the commonwealth’s deadline to appeal a recent ruling that struck down the state’s background-check law for private firearm sales. 
The request — if granted — could buy more time for Virginia to mount a legal defense and potentially restore the law.
Under state law, the commonwealth had until Dec. 1 to file a notice of appeal after the Wilson v. Hanley decision. Because outgoing Attorney General Jason Miyares did not pursue the appeal, the right to challenge the ruling would have expired — potentially leaving the background-check requirement for private sales dead.

Jones’s motion asks that the deadline be extended to Jan. 30, 2026.
“Virginians demanded an attorney general who will stand up for their safety, and that’s exactly what I’m doing,” Jones said in a statement. “Background checks save lives and are essential to keeping guns out of dangerous hands. This motion protects Virginia’s ability to appeal this ruling, defend our laws, and keep our communities safe from gun violence.”
In October, a Lynchburg-area circuit court struck down the universal background-check law, holding that it ran afoul of both state and federal statutes — particularly as they apply to 18- to 20-year-old adults. 
The law, enacted by Democrats in 2020 as part of a sweeping gun-safety package and effective on July 1 that year, had applied to nearly all firearm transfers. 
Under federal law, licensed dealers cannot sell handguns to buyers under 21; yet state law allows those same 18- to 20-year-olds to legally possess handguns. By requiring all private transfers to go through licensed dealers and the federal background-check system (NICS), the law effectively denied those adults any legal way to acquire a handgun, advocates say.
In his decision, Judge F. Patrick Yeatts declined to address the constitutionality of background checks generally. 
Instead, he found the statute’s structure so flawed that the entire law had to be struck down. He noted that the commonwealth could attempt to craft a revised law that treats all age groups equally — an approach used in other states such as Nevada, which mandates minimum ages carefully calibrated to avoid similar legal traps.
Supporters of the 2020 law — part of a broader post-2019 gun-control push — had argued that universal background checks were a commonsense way to close the “private sale loophole.” With the law now enjoined statewide, attention has turned to whether the legislature will attempt to rewrite it.
 Pushback from gun-rights advocates

But not everyone welcomes Jones’s intervention. 
Virginia Citizens Defense League President Philip Van Cleave dismissed the court filing as improper. 
“Hopefully the request will be turned down since Jones has no authority until mid-January after he has been sworn in. The current attorney general is the one who counts,” Van Cleave said in an email.

He added, “Interesting that Jones, who was fantasizing about murdering someone and wishing death on that person’s children, is now suddenly concerned with saving lives” — a reference to a revelation publicized ahead of the Nov. 4 election that Jones, in 2022, sent violent text messages to a Republican lawmaker in which he mused about the death of then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children. 
Van Cleave also questioned the premise behind universal background checks. 
“I’ve seen no statistics to indicate that universal background checks have saved any lives. The vast majority of criminals don’t submit to background checks,” he said. 
Meanwhile, Rooz Dadabhoy, president of Rally Virginia — a group describing itself as “the home of the modern Republican woman” — reacted sharply on X, formerly Twitter. Dadabhoy accused Jones of mounting “an assault on the Second Amendment BEFORE he even takes office.” 
Referring to the same text message scandal, she wrote: “Jay Jones himself shouldn’t even be able to own a gun because he clearly has deranged, violent fantasies.” 
She added that the move comes amid an effort by Democrats to hold firearm retailers liable for crimes committed with guns they sell — even if those sales comply with state law. “Virginia Democrats are absolutely coming for your right to ‘keep and bear arms,’” she declared.
 Virginia at a crossroads — as are other states

The legal battle unfolding in Virginia reflects a broader trend. 
As courts scrutinize fine print and statutory conflicts, universal background-check laws in several states may be vulnerable — especially where federal age restrictions collide with state-level firearm rights. 
Experts say the ruling and Jones’s appeal — if successful — could serve as a blueprint for other states seeking to restore or defend similar statutes in the post-New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen era. That 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision struck down New York’s restrictive concealed-carry permitting system and held that modern gun laws must be consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.
For now, Virginia’s background-check law remains in limbo. 
If the Court of Appeals grants the extension, the state will have until Jan. 30 to decide whether to press its case — and critics and advocates alike are bracing for the next round in what could be a defining legislative battle over gun policy and constitutional rights.

Inflation is making it more expensive to grow Christmas trees, with costs for things like labor and fertilizer rising. But Ryan Clouse, president of the Virginia Christmas Tree Growers Association, said a larger supply than usual will likely hedge against steep price hikes.
“The input costs have gone up, but I think a lot of what the big growers are doing is just trying to make sure they can market their trees,” he said.
Fewer Christmas trees were harvested and planted during the 2008 recession, which led to a shortage for the better part of a decade. Growers planted more to close the gap, but it takes seven to ten years for those trees to be ready to sell. Now, growers have trees they need to move.
Competition can keep costs low, or it can raise prices, Clouse said.
If an area has many tree lots, growers may keep prices lower to sell more trees. In another scenario, if a grower charges $50, but another grower down the street is charging $100, the first grower may decide they can charge a bit more and still stay competitive, Clouse said.
“There’s a lot of factors that go into the pricing, but I’d say this year is probably going to be a little higher than the past years,” he said.
In Hampton roads, consumers may be able to keep costs down by buying a locally grown Christmas tree.
“We haven’t gone up in two years,” said Heath Boomer of Boomer Family Christmas Tree Farm in Virginia Beach. “We’re doing $15 a foot, and nothing lower than five feet.”
George and Lisette Piccillo of Back Bay Christmas Trees in Virginia Beach said they’re also charging $15 a foot. Michael Bedell, a newer grower across the border on Knotts Island, N.C., said he’ll charge the same.
Boomer said he’s able to keep prices low by saving on labor costs.
“It’s me, it’s my wife, it’s my two girls,” he said. “We’re the ones that work it out here.”
 Coastal Christmas trees 

Growing Christmas trees in Hampton Roads is not a common venture. Only two species can thrive in the region’s sandy, hot and salty climate: Virginia pine and white pine.
Both trees have longer needles compared to mountain-grown species to deal better with heat, said George Piccillo.
And both trees have their perks, Boomer said.
White pines have a blueish tint and are fluffy, which is perfect for hiding lights, Boomer said. But they can’t hold heavy ornaments as well as Virginia pine’s stronger branches.
Virginia pines are yellow-green in hue and grow more quickly than white pines, which can make them more difficult to maintain.
Boomer said he has to prune Virginia pines twice a year, otherwise they’ll get “a little squirrely.”

And in what Boomer calls a funny coincidence, all of the region’s Christmas tree growers are connected to local schools. Boomer teaches history at Ocean Lakes High School. The Piccillos are retired schoolteachers and spent their entire careers in the area. Bedell started growing Christmas trees when he was a social studies teacher and is now assistant principal at Kellam High School.
The academic calendar complements the Christmas tree maintenance calendar, Bedell said.
“It’s nice, if you are in education, because you have your summers off,” he said, adding that pruning happens in June and July, and it takes at least an entire week from sunup to sundown.
All three of the local farms have trees ranging in size, from baby seedlings to taller mature ones. Christmas trees have to be at least 5 feet before they’re cut and sold, Boomer said.
It takes white pines and Virginia pines five to seven years to reach 6 feet. In that time, the trees may endure winds, heavy rains, drought, heat, pests and disease.
Overall, this year’s growing season along the coast was a good one, Boomer said, noting summer wasn’t too hot and the trees got plenty of water.
Not all growers in the state can say the same. Those along the Shenandoah Valley dealt with water issues in 2025 — either too much or too little, said Clouse, who owns Clouse’s Pine Hill Farm in Winchester County.
“We experienced record rain in May, June, middle of July, and then the spigot shut off,” he said.
Drought is especially hard on seedlings, Clouse said, and flooding can suffocate the roots.
Fraser firs are a popular type of tree often called the “Cadillac” of Christmas trees. Excess water makes these mountain-grown trees susceptible to root rot, he said. It’s caused by a pathogen called Phytophthora, which is contagious and can spread to other fir trees.
“You can transfer that on your pruner,” he said. “You can transfer it on your wheels, on your tractors, so there’s just any number of ways that you can acquire that.”
Once the pathogen is present, it can only be managed, Clouse said.
Virginia’s coastal Christmas tree growers have a different set of issues to deal with, Boomer said.
“One thing we deal with, being so close to the ocean, is a thing called salt spray,” Boomer said. “That’s the scariest thing is those northern winds, and the salt comes off the water, and it can burn the northeast side of trees.”
The redheaded pine sawfly eats Virginia pine needles as a caterpillar and can cause substantial damage. Poor drainage from the region’s sandy soil can drown trees.
Another challenge is demand, Boomer said.
“Christmas is moving up,” he said. “Everybody wants a tree sooner and sooner.”
But once a tree is cut, its time is limited, Boomer said.
His tips for making a Christmas tree stay green long into January?
Wait until after Thanksgiving, cut it fresh and put it in water immediately, he said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s signature law of his second term provides vastly more benefits to the rich Ohioans than to any other group, and it also takes more away from Ohio’s most vulnerable families than most people might realize, a new analysis says.
This summer, congressional Republicans passed — and Trump signed — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and it was controversial.
It extended tax cuts he signed in 2017. The extension provides $1 trillion to the richest 1 % of Americans over the next 10 years. At the same time, it cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid funding and nearly $200 billion in food assistance over the same period.
But an analysis by Policy Matters Ohio said that if you examine the details, the legislation is even worse for poor and middle-class Ohioans. 
Referring to Trump’s signature law as H.R. 1, it noted that many of the least popular cuts are delayed until after the 2026 midterm elections, and others are obscured in other ways.
“This smoke-and-mirrors approach to promoting H.R. 1 was partly possible because many of the budget’s largest cuts are just plain hard to understand — and there are a lot of cuts coming from a lot of different directions,” it said.
For example “… Congressional leaders chose to dramatically reduce revenues states rely on to finance their share of Medicaid, to fund Medicaid expansion, to weather budget short-falls and to expand services,” the Policy Matters report said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“States will now be responsible for a higher burden of health care costs due to H.R. 1’s restrictions on these revenue streams.”
One way the Trump law will do that is by phasing down “state directed payments.” 
Those are payments states can instruct Medicaid managed-care providers to make to cover certain expenses. 
H.R. 1 also prohibits states from increasing provider taxes or creating new ones. 
Those two measures will take away between $6.5 billion and $13 billion over the next decade to fund the state’s Medicaid expansion, the report said. 
The expansion provides health coverage to 770,000 Ohioans and has cut the state’s uninsured rate in half.
In June, Gov. Mike DeWine signed a budget containing a provision that would end Ohio’s Medicaid expansion if the federal government funds less than 90% of the cost. 
That’s a real possibility in light of the cuts buried in the law Trump signed this summer.
“In short, Congressional leaders chose to dramatically reduce revenues states rely on to finance their share of Medicaid, to fund Medicaid expansion, to weather budget short-falls and to expand services,” the Policy Matters report said. 
“States will now be responsible for a higher burden of health care costs due to H.R. 1’s restrictions on these revenue streams.”
Huge numbers of Ohioans also could lose federal food benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance, or SNAP, program.
The state got an idea of the effects of such a loss last month, when Trump decided to delay food benefits during the partial government shutdown. 
Many Ohio food pantries reported record demand during the resulting crisis.
The bill he signed this summer will take away an estimated $416 million a year in food assistance to needy Ohioans. 
Given that the average recipient gets just $6.17 per day from the program, the loss will be felt by many.
Ninety two percent of adult SNAP recipients under 65 are either working, in school, ill and unable to work, or unable to because of caregiving responsibilities. 
Most others can only receive three months of benefits in a three year span unless they can show that they’re either working or receiving 80 hours of job training each month. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act removed exceptions for the homeless, people between 55 and 64, people living in areas with high unemployment, parents whose youngest child is 14, veterans and former foster youth.
“The Urban Institute estimates that 717,000 Ohio families will lose some or all of their SNAP benefits under the administration’s megabill,” the Policy Matters report said.
In addition, states will now face gigantic charges if their error rates in processing SNAP benefits aren’t reduced to what some experts see as unrealistic levels.
Ohio lawmakers will be faced with the prospect of finding money elsewhere if many thousands are to avoid going sick or hungry, or both, the report said. 
It added that the General Assembly has a poor track record in such matters.
“In Ohio, state legislators have created an increasingly inequitable tax system over the last two decades, costing the state $12.8 billion in lost annual revenues per year (largely through cuts to income taxes) as of 2024,” it said. 
“This lost revenue amounts to almost half of the tax revenue collected by Ohio for its General Revenue Fund in fiscal year 2024.”

(Getty Images)Lawmakers in both Concord and Washington, D.C., spent much of 2025 debating cuts and changes to Medicaid, the nation’s public health care program for low-income people and those with disabilities. Now, state lawmakers are preparing to debate how to implement the changes in 2026.
When they passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act over the objections of their Democratic counterparts, congressional Republicans instituted a series of changes to Medicaid. Most notably, they created a work requirement and mandated Medicaid enrollees work 80 hours per month to receive coverage. Because Medicaid is a program run jointly by the federal and state governments, the bill requires each state to formulate a system to implement these work requirements.
New Hampshire Republicans have already begun this process in a series of House committee meetings.
Lawmakers will have to determine how the state verifies whether Medicaid enrollees are working enough to meet the requirement. Rep. Jim Kofalt, a Wilton Republican, has proposed the state ban self-attestation and require documentary evidence as an amendment to 2025’s Senate Bill 134. If that change is adopted, enrollees would be required to document their work schedule rather than simply tell the government they’re working.
Kofalt also proposed an amendment that would require enrollees to work for three consecutive months in order to gain Medicaid eligibility. However, he and his colleagues backed away from the three-month look-back after discussions with Medicaid Director Henry Lipman.
State Republicans have also filed legislation to direct the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services — which is responsible for operating the state’s Medicaid program — to follow the federal government’s new work requirements rather than apply for a federal waiver to create state guidelines.
“Currently we have Medicaid requirements in state statute that have not been implemented,” Kofalt said during a November legislative work session. “They are different from the federal requirements. What we really want to do is go with the federal requirements for a number of reasons. That’s going to be better, faster, financially viable.”
Republicans argue Medicaid should be reserved for those who either cannot work or those who are working. The requirements include exemptions for people with disabilities and medical issues that prevent them from working, though critics question whether states will be able to handle the bureaucracy necessary to determine who is eligible for those exemptions.
In implementing the work requirements, Republicans will be attempting to avoid past mistakes. In 2018, New Hampshire created a 100-hour-per-month Medicaid work requirement. However, a month after the rule went into effect, then-Gov. Chris Sununu paused the requirements because only 8,000 of the 25,000 people subject to the requirement had completed the necessary paperwork to document their hours. The remaining roughly 17,000 Medicaid recipients were set to lose coverage, even after the state had spent more than $130,000 on outreach efforts to teach enrollees about the new requirements.
Democrats have long pointed to what happened in 2018 as evidence that work requirements, because of the large bureaucracy required to manage them, will revoke coverage from people who actually do work. They point to a number of studies, including research compiled by the Brookings Institution, that suggest work requirements don’t increase employment, as many Republicans claim.
A group of Democrats led by Nashua Rep. Laura Telerski, the House Democratic deputy leader, is filing a bill that would direct Health and Human Services to “identify the impact of Medicaid changes on New Hampshire residents’ access to health care.” The bill is still being drafted by legislative staff.
In addition to work requirements, New Hampshire Republicans enacted several changes to Medicaid on the state level. In a plan spearheaded by Gov. Kelly Ayotte and amended by House and Senate Republicans, some Medicaid enrollees will have to pay a fee of up to $270 per month in order to keep their coverage. This was done as a cost-saving measure.
The final enacted version of this plan will require enrollees making 100% of the poverty line or more to pay between $60 to $100 per month, depending on the size of their families; enrollees making at least 255% of the poverty line will be required to pay $190 to $270 monthly. For reference, that means a family of three earning $59,962.50 is set to pay $233 a month under this new law, based on 2025’s poverty level guidelines. A family of three earning $26,650 will pay $90 a month under the law.
Democrats have lambasted the premiums as cruel and likened them to an “income tax on the poor.” Ayotte has defended the premiums by pointing out that New Hampshire’s eligibility requirements are broad compared to other states.
Indeed, New Hampshire has the fourth (tied with Connecticut) most expansive Medicaid income eligibility requirements for children among U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as of January, the most recent data available, according to KFF.
Ayotte also proposed increasing the portion of prescription costs, or copays, that enrollees are responsible for. Starting in January, Medicaid recipients are set to pay $2 or $3 for their prescriptions instead of the previous copay of $1.
Democrats are now trying to reverse these changes. Senate Bill 484, sponsored by Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, a Nashua Democrat, would repeal the 2025 provisions that enacted the premiums and copays. A proposed bill in the House, sponsored by Telerski, that is also still in the drafting phase seeks to similarly stop the two Medicaid changes from going into effect.
“Far too many Granite Staters are skipping care because of the cost,” Portsmouth Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, the Senate minority leader and a co-sponsor of the bill, said at a press conference in late September before the bill language was released. “Our plan caps out-of-pocket costs and repeals Gov. Ayotte’s Medicaid income tax that taxes working families hundreds of dollars a month.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/medicaidumbrella-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 05:56:49.196770

(Getty image)Just because a good idea came from the other political tribe doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea. 
For example: The 2001 No Child Left Behind law did states a huge favor by providing the resources to build massive information systems that school districts just couldn’t afford. The data helped educators pinpoint successes, failures and inequalities. Sadly, the bill demanded that schools meet statistically impossible benchmarks or face specific harsh consequences for the failure to do so. 
In that same bill, though, were mandates and money for “Reading First,” designed to clear away debunked Whole Language and Balanced Literacy to make way for science-of-reading techniques. Sadly, educators rejected Reading First, mostly because it was associated with Republicans. If only the education industry embraced retooling reading instruction 25 years ago, America’s dismal reading proficiency would be in a far better place, especially among urban kids. 
Let’s not make a similar mistake again.
Buried inside the deeply troublesome federal law called the “Big Beautiful Bill Act” is an opportunity called the Educational Choice for Children Act. Its virtues are hard to see because it’s wrapped in language offering students vouchers to private school. For Rhode Island’s powerful anti-school-choice advocates, that’s a hard “no.” Families who vote with their feet reduce the districts’ market share of students’ per pupil expenditure and the number of unionized jobs.
But private-school vouchers are not mandated. Not even expansions of choice are mandated. 
In fact, the Republican budget reconciliation package specifies that the money can pay for certain big-ticket items. Like tutoring, technology, after-school programs, transportation, dual enrollment in higher education and services for students with disabilities, among others.
That’s a lot. Researchers studying the effects of the federal pandemic money found that tutoring is hands-down the best technique for improving academic outcomes, especially among struggling performers. 
Similarly, Rhode Island can’t begin to meet the demand for after-school programs. Parents and kids would be ever so grateful for more. Dual enrollment? Supports to special needs kids? What’s not to like?
Rejecting the money throws the baby out with the voucher bathwater, just as we did with Reading First. 
We badly need to start putting kids’ needs first, before protecting adults.
Here’s how the law works: States must agree to participate, or not. Already three states have said yes (Nebraska, Tennessee and North Carolina) and three no (Wisconsin, Oregon and New Mexico), splitting along predictable partisan lines.
Participating states offer local nonprofits the opportunity to become “Scholarship-Granting Organizations.” Think: organizations like Family Services, Children’s Friend or Progresso Latino. They would start accepting donations in 2026 for services to be delivered in 2027.
Individual taxpayers can donate up to $1,700 per year, and take a 100% federal tax write-off, which is an unprecedented, dollar-for-dollar tax break. The donation cap came down from $5,000 and earlier, $10,000. Corporations cannot donate at all. The money flows through nonprofits directly to students or programs like tutoring, with any necessary collaboration, but not interference of the government nor its school systems. 
Governors must decide to join or not. Governors seem always to be in campaign mode and often make decisions contrary to the public good to get themselves elected. Will Gov. Dan McKee sign on and be clear how the money would help student-oriented programs thrive? Or will he turn down the opportunity to demonstrate partisan solidarity with those who dislike school choice? 
Unless you have money to leave the public system, charters are the only form of choice in Rhode Island. Even before the pandemic, families nationally and locally were leaving district schools for community-created personalized learning environments like learning pods, micro-schools, home-schooling. The Act would like to accelerate those choices but again, we don’t have to. 
Internationally more than 80% of the worlds’ school systems have funding mechanisms that blur any division between public and private. Those countries just want the kids to be well educated. Our leaders need to get real about demonstrating the same objective.
Actually, I’m no fan of private school vouchers because public tax money becomes invisible inside private compounds free of public accountability.
So the challenge is to look past the voucher/choice noise and sign up for the free money that will help the ocean of students who need tutoring, after-school engagement, special needs help and so on. 
Right now, this opportunity is up to the governor. Let’s not keep making the same tribal prejudice mistakes. Clearly, we’d have to keep our eye on this program so we get genuinely good public services.
But for once, state leaders, focus on the public good. Take the money and run.

Medicare, the public health insurance for older Americans, is piloting a new prior authorization program powered by artificial intelligence that some physicians fear will result in more denials and delays in medical care for patients. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) A Medicare pilot program will allow private companies to use artificial intelligence to review older Americans’ requests for certain medical care — and will reward the companies when they deny it.
In January, the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will launch the Wasteful and Inappropriate Services Reduction (WISeR) Model to test AI-powered prior authorizations on certain health services for Medicare patients in six states: Arizona, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington. The program is scheduled to last through 2031.
The program effectively inserts one of private insurance’s most unpopular features — prior authorization — into traditional Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older and those with certain disabilities. Prior authorization is the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding.
Adults over 65 generally have two options for health insurance: traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Both types of Medicare are funded with public dollars, but Medicare Advantage plans are contracted through private insurance companies. Medicare Advantage plans tend to cost less out of pocket, but patients enrolled in them often must seek prior authorization for care.
AI-powered prior authorization in Medicaid Advantage and private insurance has attracted intense criticism, legislative action by state and federal lawmakers, federal investigations and class-action lawsuits. It’s been linked to bad health outcomes. Dozens of states have passed legislation in recent years to regulate the practice.
In June, the Trump administration even extracted a pledge from major health insurers to streamline and reduce prior authorization.
“Americans shouldn’t have to negotiate with their insurer to get the care they need,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a June statement announcing the pledge. “Pitting patients and their doctors against massive companies was not good for anyone.”
Four days after the pledge was announced, the administration rolled out the new WISeR program, scheduled to take effect in January. It will require prior authorizations only for certain services and prescriptions that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has identified as “particularly vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse, or inappropriate use.” Those services include, among other things, knee arthroscopy for knee osteoarthritis, skin and tissue substitutes, certain nerve stimulation services and incontinence control devices.
The companies get paid based on how much money they save Medicare by denying approvals for “unnecessary or non-covered services,” CMS said in a statement unveiling the program.
The new program has alarmed many physicians and advocates in the affected states.
AI vs. AI: Patients deploy bots to battle health insurers that deny care

“In concept, it makes a lot of sense; you don’t want to pay for care that patients don’t need,” said Jeb Shepard, policy director for the Washington State Medical Association.
“But in practice, [prior authorization] has been hugely problematic because it essentially acts as a barrier. There are a lot of denials and lengthy appeals processes that pull physicians away from providing care to patients. They have to fight with insurance carriers to get their patients the care they believe is appropriate.”
CMS responded to Stateline’s questions by providing additional information about the program, but offered few details on what the agency would do to prevent delays or denials of care. It has said that final decisions on coverage denials will be made by “licensed clinicians, not machines.” In a bid to hold the companies accountable, CMS also incentivizes them for making determinations in a reasonable amount of time, and for making the right determinations according to Medicare rules, without needing appeals.
In the statement announcing the program, Abe Sutton, director of the CMS Innovation Center, said the “low-value services” targeted by WISeR “offer patients minimal benefit and, in some cases, can result in physical harm and psychological stress. They also increase patient costs while inflating health care spending.”
A vulnerable group
Dr. Bindu Nayak is an endocrinologist in Wenatchee, Washington, a city near the center of the state that bills itself as the “Apple Capital of the World.” She mainly treats patients with diabetes and estimates 30-40% of her patients have Medicare.
“Medicare recipients are a vulnerable group,” Nayak told Stateline. “The WISeR program puts more barriers up for them accessing care. And they may have to now deal with prior authorization when they never had to deal with it before.”
Nayak and other physicians worry the same problems with prior authorizations that they’ve seen with their Medicare Advantage patients will plague traditional Medicare patients. Nayak has employees on staff whose only role is to handle prior authorizations.
More than a quarter of physicians nationwide say prior authorization issues led to a serious problem for a patient in their care, including hospitalization or permanent damage, according to the most recent report from the American Medical Association.
And some patients are unfairly denied treatment. Private insurers have denied care for people with Medicare Advantage plans even though their prior authorization requests met Medicare’s requirements, according to an investigation from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published in 2022. Investigators found 13% of prior authorization denials were for requests that should have been granted.
But supporters of the new model say something must be done to reduce costs. Medicare is the largest single purchaser of health care in the nation, with spending expected to double in the next decade, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent federal agency. Medicare spent as much as $5.8 billion in 2022 on services with little or no benefit to patients.
Congress pushes back
In November, congressional representatives from Ohio, Washington and other states introduced a bill to repeal the WISeR model. It’s currently in committee.
States try to rein in health insurers’ claim denials, with mixed results

“The [Trump] administration has publicly admitted prior authorization is harmful, yet it is moving forward with this misguided effort that would make seniors navigate more red tape to get the care they’re entitled to,” U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington Democrat and a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a November statement.
Physician and hospital groups in many of the affected states have backed the bill, which would halt the program at least temporarily. Shepard, whose medical association supports the bill, said that would give CMS time to get more stakeholder input and give physicians more time to prepare for extra administrative requirements.
“Conventional wisdom would dictate a program of this magnitude that has elicited so much concern from so many corners would at least be delayed while we work through some things,” Shepard said, “but there’s no indication that they’re going to back off this.”
Adding more prior authorization requirements for a new subset of Medicare patients will tack on extra administrative burdens for physicians, especially those in orthopedics, urology and neurology, fields that have a higher share of services that fall under the new rules.
That increased administrative burden “will probably lead to a lot longer wait times for patients,” Nayak said. “It will be important for patients to realize that they may see more barriers in the form of denials, but they should continue to advocate for themselves.”
Dr. Jayesh Shah, president of the Texas Medical Association and a San Antonio-based wound care physician, said WISeR is a well-intentioned program, but that prior authorization hurts patients and physicians.
“Prior authorization delays care and sometimes also denies care to patients who need it, and it increases the hassle factor for all physicians,” he told Stateline.
Shah added that, on the flip side, he’s heard from a few physicians who welcome prior authorization. They’d rather get preapproval for a procedure than perform it and later have Medicare deny reimbursement if the procedure didn’t meet requirements, he said.
Prior authorization has been a bipartisan concern in Congress and statehouses around the country.
Last year, 10 states — Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming — passed laws regulating prior authorization, according to the American Medical Association. Legislatures in at least 18 states have addressed prior authorization so far this year, an analysis from health policy publication Health Affairs Forefront found. Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have passed laws regulating the use of AI in health care.
But the new effort in the U.S. House to repeal the WISeR program is sponsored by Democrats. Supporters worry it’s unlikely to gain much traction in the Republican-controlled Congress.

– Dr. Jayesh Shah, president of the Texas Medical Association


Shepard said his organization has talked with state and congressional representatives, met with the regional CMS office twice, and sent a letter to CMS Director Dr. Mehmet Oz.
“We’ve looked at all the levers and we’ve pulled most of them,” Shepard said. “We’re running out of levers to pull.”
Venture capital jumps in
CMS announced in November it has selected six private tech companies to pilot the AI programs.
Some of them are backed by venture capital funds that count larger insurance companies among their key investors.
For example, Oklahoma’s pilot will be run by Humata Health Inc., which is backed by investors that include Blue Venture Fund, the venture capital arm of Blue Cross Blue Shield companies, and Optum Ventures, a venture capital firm connected to UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare. Innovaccer Inc., chosen to run Ohio’s program, counts health care giant Kaiser Permanente as an investor.
Nayak said she knows little about Virtix Health, the Arizona-based private company contracted by the feds to run Washington state’s pilot program.
“Virtix Health would have a financial incentive to deny claims,” Nayak said. “It begs the question, would there be any safeguards to prevent profit-driven denials of care?”
That financial incentive is a concern in Texas too.
“If, financially, the vendor is going to benefit by the denial, it could be a problem for our patients,” Shah said. He said that Oz, in a webinar presentation on the new program, assured physicians that their satisfaction and turnaround times would be metrics that Medicare would factor into the tech companies’ payments.

Free.,"Most ACA marketplace users can’t afford potential increases, poll shows",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/most-aca-marketplace-users-cant-afford-potential-increases-poll-shows,,"WASHINGTON — Americans who purchase their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are bracing for a steep rise in costs next year that many say they will not be able to afford, according to a poll released Thursday by the nonpartisan health organization KFF.Nearly 60% of enrollees surveyed could not cover the costs of a $300 annual increase in their premiums, while an additional 20% said they couldn’t afford a $1,000 jump in prices per year. About 90% of those polled said it would be somewhat or very difficult to afford health insurance within their budget if they could no longer purchase a plan through the ACA marketplace.

The spike in prices is predominantly due to the end-of-year expiration date for enhanced tax credits for ACA marketplace plans. Republicans in Congress have so far declined to extend the subsidies, while Democrats shut down the government in an unsuccessful attempt to continue the credits.While increases would vary considerably based on location, income and plan type, a Sept. 30 KFF analysis projected individuals’ annual premiums would rise between around $350 and more than $1,800.Open enrollment for ACA marketplace plans began in many states on Nov. 1 and will run through Dec. 15 for most Americans, giving little time for Congress to broker a deal before the ability to purchase a plan for next year closes.No progress on negotiationsThe Senate is expected to vote next week on a Democratic bill to extend the subsidies, though that legislation appears unlikely to get the 60 votes needed to advance in the Republican-controlled chamber. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee held a hearing this week to explore short- and long-term options to bring down health care costs, but senators on that panel didn't reach a clear consensus. KFF President and CEO Drew Altman said in a statement the “poll shows the range of problems Marketplace enrollees will face if the enhanced tax credits are not extended in some form, and those problems will be the poster child of the struggles Americans are having with health care costs in the midterms if Republicans and Democrats cannot resolve their differences.”The KFF poll showed only 9% of marketplace enrollees have a lot of confidence that Republicans in Congress will address rising health insurance costs, with 24% saying they had some confidence, 25% saying they didn’t have much confidence and 42% responding they had no confidence in GOP lawmakers on that particular issue.Blame falls to TrumpACA marketplace enrollees would predominantly fault President Donald Trump if their overall health care costs, including premiums, co-pays and deductibles, were to increase by $1,000 next year, though Republicans and Democrats in Congress would share nearly as much blame, the survey found.Thirty-seven percent would place the responsibility with Trump, while 33% would cite GOP lawmakers and 29% would fault Democrats with the rising costs.Those numbers fluctuate significantly depending on a person’s political affiliation, with 65% of Republicans saying they would blame Democrats, while 20% would credit Republicans in Congress and 14% would fault Trump.Forty-four percent of people who identified as independents said they would blame Trump, while 32% said they would cite Republicans in Congress and 23% said they would fault Democrats.Among Democrats, 49% would blame Trump, 46% would credit congressional Republicans, with the remainder would fault members of their own party.KFF conducted the survey of 1,350 people between Nov. 7-15. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for the full sample, with a plus or minus 6 percentage points margin of error for political party affiliation questions.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-04 06:57:30.690286
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-04 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Harding High’s progress marks turning point for Bridgeport schools,Reginald David,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/04/bridgeport-harding-high-school-turnaround-status/,Harding High is no longer on the state's list of lowest-performing schools. Staff and students say the changes are palpable.,"Warren Harding High School’s transformation was on full display at this year’s pep rally as students streamed through the halls just before the event. The atmosphere was calmer than in years past, and Principal Vernon Thompson said that shift reflects the deeper work that helped the school move off the state’s turnaround list, meaning the school has met specific improvement goals and is no longer considered one of the state’s lowest-performing.
For the first time in years, Harding is now a focus school. This means the school has made progress, but still receives targeted state support to help students with higher needs continue improving, placing it a step above turnaround status and on a clearer path toward sustained achievement.
Thompson said the school’s progress began with changing how staff responded to student behavior. Instead of relying on removal or punishment, the school built a system that treats behavior as something connected to students’ needs and well-being. Harding expanded partnerships with mental health providers like Effective School Solutions and LifeBridge, which gave students access to clinical support during the school day.

Thompson said this approach helped students stay in school and helped staff address the root causes of disengagement. “When you look at behavior as clinical instead of punitive, you can actually heal,” he said. “That is when you start to see change.”
The shift in climate allowed teachers to spend more time focusing on instruction. Thompson said teachers had long been pulled in two directions, trying to teach while managing chronic disruptions. As hallway culture improved, teachers were able to reconnect with professional development, coaching and more consistent classroom expectations.
The school has tracked improvements in chronic absenteeism, graduation rates, ninth grade on-track data, and failure rates, which Thompson said are among the indicators the district reviews when monitoring progress.
Harding’s improvement is part of a broader shift across Bridgeport schools. Barnum, Roosevelt, and Madison schools all exited state lists of underperforming schools this year after sustained academic gains. Bassick High School has also shown growth in its graduation rates. District leaders say these changes signal that progress is possible when schools have consistent leadership, community partnerships, and targeted support.
The district as a whole has been receiving state intervention for nearly a year. Last January, the Board of Education voted to allow the state to intervene in the Bridgeport Public Schools by providing a “technical assistance team,” required training for district board members and having the state approve the district’s permanent hire for superintendent.

At Harding, teachers say the changes are real. English teacher Amanda Palmer said this is the first time in years she has seen sustained stability among the staff. She said teachers feel anchored by clearer expectations and stronger support for students who are struggling. “Students are responding to structure that is built on consistency and care,” she said. “You can feel that people want to be here, and that makes a huge difference.”

Palmer said she has stayed at Harding because she believes the work is moving in the right direction and because she feels the staff is finally pulling in the same direction.

The academic culture has also shifted, according to English teacher Leah Rosen. She said more students are taking advanced courses and advocating for themselves. “Students have a stronger sense of what they can do,” she said. “They walk into class expecting to learn, not expecting conflict. That is a real change from a few years ago.”

Rosen said she sees students pushing themselves more and taking pride in gaining skills they once felt were out of reach.

Students say they have felt the changes directly. Some describe the building environment as stricter and more structured. Fewer students roam hallways and teachers enforce rules more consistently. For many students, this shift has raised expectations for themselves.
Rebecca Bristol, a senior, said she regularly used to show up “mad late,” sometimes 30 minutes into the school day. This year she says she takes her time in school more seriously. “I know I have to get there. I cannot be slipping up. I am here to get my education.”
Other students acknowledge that the increased structure can feel overwhelming at times, but they also describe a stronger network of support. Senior David Basnueva said he struggled with stress during his junior and senior years and leaned on a school social worker who helped him manage the pressure. A teacher connected him with a summer college preparation program that he said changed how he viewed his own potential. “If you go out of your way to talk to people here, you build a network,” he said. “Harding actually gave me opportunities I do not think I would have had otherwise.”
Students say the school’s culture has shifted in ways that feel more communal and less chaotic. Junior Jazlee Montalvo said Harding has become a place where students feel comfortable with one another and are encouraged to explore interests beyond academics. She pointed to a health teacher who also coached the volleyball team to a national competition.
She also raised a persistent concern for students: transportation. With many students relying on public buses, late arrivals remain a challenge. “More reliable transportation would make it easier to get here and make school more enjoyable,” she said.
Teachers say the improvements they see inside the building still depend heavily on whether students can get there on time and ready to learn. The school has expanded early college opportunities and career programming, but students cannot benefit if they walk through the door already overwhelmed, Assistant Principal Matthew Corcoran said.
“We have the pieces in place,” he said. “What students need is stability outside the building too. When that happens, everything inside becomes more effective.”

Corcoran said the consistency in leadership has also mattered. “Having a principal who stays, who sets expectations and sticks to them, has been important for building trust,” he said.
Thompson said student feedback is central to maintaining the school’s momentum. Students have asked for more school events, more spaces to celebrate academic success and more extracurricular opportunities.
The school has responded by building out activities, finding funding for student experiences and doing what Thompson calls small things that make students feel valued, including providing pre-game meals prepared by a local chef for athletes before state competitions. “We may not have all the dollars, but we find a way to make students feel as special as they are,” he said.
Teachers say those gestures matter. Rosen said students notice when the school recognizes their accomplishments. The culture shift feels sustainable because it is rooted in relationships rather than shortcuts, Palmer said. 
The question now is whether the district and state will maintain long-term support. “We can keep building, but it will take continued investment,” Corcoran said.
Thompson said the school still faces significant challenges, especially around trauma that students carry from outside the building. Many ninth graders enter high school already behind in credits or facing family or community stress. “Trauma is not going anywhere,” he said. “The question is how we respond to it and how we make education accessible even when students are facing serious challenges.”
And even with its progress, Harding still has work ahead. The school continues to support a large population of students with higher needs, and leaders say long-term improvement will depend on consistent resources, strong attendance and stability in students’ lives outside the building. At the same time, the school is expanding academic opportunities.
Thompson said the long-term goal is to build a school community that students will trust beyond their own graduation. “When my students become parents, I want this to be a place they are comfortable sending their children,” he said.
Students who will graduate this year say they already see that vision taking shape. Bristol said a teacher helped her discover an interest in accounting and pushed her to pursue programs like the Young Entrepreneurship Program, offered by Bridgeport Caribe Youth Leaders, which is aimed at Bridgeport high schoolers interested in entrepreneurship. “I want to do accounting because of my teacher,” she said. “I learned so much, and she helped me with everything.”
As the school prepared to gather for its pep rally, students said the celebration felt like more than a school spirit event. For some, it represented pride in a building that has changed around them and pride in the progress they have helped create. Thompson said the transformation is ongoing, but the shift in culture is already clear. “Out of our love, we build structure,” he said. “So our students can build success.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1125_SR_HardingTurnaround_386-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 05:56:49.196770

Getty Images.Now-defunct Eastern Gateway Community College in Steubenville, Ohio, allegedly mishandled more than $17 million in federal student aid before closing in 2024, according to State Auditor Keith Faber. 
Faber recently released an audit of Eastern Gateway Community College’s finances from July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023.
Forty-four issues were in the report including unauthorized expenses, financial reporting errors, issues with financial aid, and accounting problems, among others.
The audit said many of these issues led to the college’s financial issues and ultimate closure. 
Eastern Gateway closed in the fall of 2024 after financial and legal troubles.

“This goes beyond sloppiness and honest mistakes,” Faber said in a statement. “The public should be outraged.”
The auditors are questioning all of Eastern Gateway’s Title IV Pell disbursements during fiscal year 2022-23, which total $17.28 million.  
“An institution’s record-keeping practices are paramount to ensuring a proper administration of Title IV programs,” according to the audit. 
“The college failed to provide adequate source documentation … hindering a thorough review of the college’s distance education programs, including evidence that students commenced attendance.”
The college’s former chief financial officer and controller did not make a monthly reconciliation of all accounts which “led to inaccurate reporting in the annual financial statements,” according to the audit. 
“The college was unable to identify, assemble, analyze, classify, and record its transactions correctly or to document compliance with finance related legal and contractual requirements,” according to the audit. 
The audit revealed a lack of policies that led to unauthorized expenses and financial reporting errors. 
There was no list of who had access to the college’s credit cards. The college had an Amazon account used to make purchases, but there was no policy for the account. There was no travel rental car policy, “which was a significant part of the college’s travel expenses,” according to the audit. 
The college opened a PayPal account in June 2023, but there was no policy for use of the account. 
“There is no evidence that the former chief financial officer and former controller approved or otherwise knew about college’s PayPal account,” the audit said. 
Some of the other issues in the audit include: 

The former chief financial officer did not get a certificate of estimated resources or certify the total funds from all sources available for expenditures to the county auditor. 
The college’s former board of trustees did not adopt a formal appropriation measure, meaning the expenses the college’s former chief finance officer and former controller made violated state law. 
Documents to show compliance with federal programs, including TRIO and adult education grants, were “incomplete and inconsistent and based on unreliable data systems,” according to the audit. 
The college did not form a records commission and public records were not properly handled, violating the state’s open records law.
The former board of trustees authorized a $13.6 million bond issue to pay for a Youngstown parking garage even though demolition costs would exceed the property’s value. 

Ohio’s Special Investigation Unit is continuing to investigate the college. 
The U.S. Secret Service, the Ohio State Highway Patrol’s Computer Crimes Unit, the Ohio Narcotics Intelligence Center, the Columbus Division of Police, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, and Ohio’s Special Investigation Unit all executed a search warrant in January 2024 related to the investigation.
Eastern Gateway Community College had campuses in Steubenville and Youngstown, and it mainly served students in Trumbull, Mahoning, Columbiana, and Jefferson counties.  
The college was placed on probation by the Higher Learning Commission in November 2021.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)A national progressive political action committee endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner on Wednesday, the latest signal that the political novice’s campaign to replace Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins does not appear to be hindered by his controversial past remarks. 
The endorsement from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a political action committee associated with progressive movements, comes weeks after Maine and the rest of the country gained a more complete picture of the veteran and oyster farmer’s time before deciding to run for national office. 
In Reddit posts, Platner previously made sexist, racist, homophobic and other offensive statements. He also had a tattoo that resembled a Nazi symbol, a connection he denied knowing until recently, that he’s since covered. 
Some other political figures that the Progressive Change Campaign Committee has previously endorsed include Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Maxwell Alejandro Frost of Florida, and Jasmine Crockett of Texas.
Endorsements for the Senate race are now stacking up. 
Gov. Janet Mills, who officially entered the primary race days before the controversies were first reported, launched her campaign with the financial backing of national Democrats, specifically a joint fundraising committee between her team and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee called “Maine Senate Victory 2026.”
EMILY’s List, the nation’s largest resource for women in politics, has endorsed Mills, the two-term governor and former attorney general. Prominent political figures have as well, including Democratic governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. Former candidates for U.S. Senate Daira Smith-Rodriguez and Dan Kleban also suspended their campaigns to endorse her.
‘Washington need not apply:’ How Mainers are evaluating controversy-laden Graham Platner

In addition to Platner’s new endorsement Wednesday, he has the support of organized labor — United Auto Workers, Maine State Nurses Association, and International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers — as well as a coalition of Democratic youth-focused groups. Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has also endorsed him.
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee also on Wednesday released results from a poll conducted on the group’s behalf that has Platner leading Mills in the Democratic primary by 20 points.
The poll, conducted by progressive firm Z to A research on behalf of the partisan group, captured 845 likely Democratic primary voters who submitted responses between Nov. 14 through 18, with a margin of error of ±3% for all midterm voters and ±3.4% for Democratic primary voters. 
Respondents were recruited into an online survey instrument through texts from a voter file sample of likely midterm voters — a method that runs the risk of missing older voters. 
Mills declined to comment on the poll and endorsement. 
This poll follows an October survey from the University of New Hampshire conducted as Platner’s controversies were first being reported, which also had Platner leading Mills.
“It’s amazing to see what it feels like on the ground being reflected directly in a poll like this,” Platner said during a press call. “This I think just lays clear what our theory is, which is that we are not going to defeat Susan Collins running the same exact kind of playbook that we’ve run in the past, which is an established politician, supported by the power structures, supported by Washington, D.C.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 04:56:13.233313

One triple citizen disagreed, warning that this would be a mistake.
The United States of America is often called a melting pot of culture and ideas. Dr. Brian Edmiston said it’s for good reason.
“You’ve got people who have experience from other countries who can compare,” Edmiston said.
Born in Northern Ireland, he automatically gained dual citizenship with the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.
But he emigrated to the United States in the 1980s and became a U.S. citizen two decades ago.
Now, the triple citizen is a professor at The Ohio State University.
“I wanted to be fully participant in the work of living in this country,” Edmiston said. “I have family who live in Britain, I have family in Ireland, and I go back and forth between both countries.”
We asked if he considers himself an American.
“Yes, definitely,” he responded. “I consider myself an American because I pledged allegiance to the U.S. Constitution and was very pleased to do that.”
But if Edmiston is so pleased to be a citizen of the U.S., Ohio College Republican leader Gabe Guidarini said he and other dual citizens should prove their allegiance.
“If you’re an American, you’re an American citizen — you’re only an American citizen,” Guidarini asserted.
He is supporting Moreno’s new legislation. The Colombia-born lawmaker introduced a bill that would outlaw dual citizenship.
“If you’re going to come to this country and use our resources and seek the American dream, then that has to be a full-term commitment to the American dream,” Guidarini said. “Otherwise, how can we trust you?”
The college student said dual citizens should denounce their other citizenships, just like Moreno did when he became a U.S. citizen at 18.
“Existing law allows certain United States citizens to maintain foreign citizenship, which may create conflicts of interest and divided loyalties,” the legislation states.
“It is in the national interest of the United States to ensure that United States citizenship is held exclusively.”
The senator was unavailable for an interview, but provided a statement:
“It was an honor to pledge an Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America and ONLY to the United States of America!” Moreno said. “Being an American citizen is an honor and a privilege — and if you want to be an American, it’s all or nothing. It’s time to end dual citizenship for good.”
Guidarini claimed that dual citizens “exploit” the system by spending money in their other country.
We asked how it’s possible to police people’s money — referencing how the U.S. would need to track citizens’ spending habits, as well as how American businesses have factories that are out of the country.
“It’s not about policing people’s money, it’s about making sure that America is the sole commitment,” he responded.
He said that if it’s just transactional, like a business from China investing in the U.S., that is different than a dual citizen taking money earned from their job and sending it to relatives out of the country.
We asked if he had seen dual citizens exploiting the system, to which he responded that college students with visas — a temporary pass to stay in the U.S. and not full citizenship — will get a local job and not participate in the American economy.
“I think that there should be a bare minimum commitment here to where, if you’re coming to America, if you’re using our services, if you’re using our taxpayer dollars… your financial advancement should also be for the collective benefit of America,” Guidarini said. “You should not be able to simply use America’s resources and take it to your country where you came from.”
These are non-arguments, Edmiston said.
“I see no conflict between being a citizen of three different jurisdictions,” Edmiston said.
We asked how he would feel if there was a choice that he had to make, choosing between his three different citizenships.
“I don’t know… It’s upsetting,” he responded. “Loyalty is not something that is unitary, and it’s not exclusionary.”
This is a way to make all immigration, but specifically legal immigration, more difficult, he added.
“I legally emigrated here and went through the process and was proud to do that,” the professor said. “This is putting people into categories, saying, ‘These are the real Americans.'”
And for Edmiston, his three passports tell a story — one that exemplifies the American dream.
“You should be encouraging people to stay, not pushing them out, not giving them a false choice,” he said.
The United States won’t be better off, he said, if the melting pot runs dry.

Two years ago, the Biden administration announced $7 billion in funding for a nationwide network of hydrogen hubs meant to kickstart production of the alternative fuel.

(Millennium Reign Energy)This story was originally published by Canary Media.

Two years ago, the Biden administration announced $7 billion in funding for a nationwide network of hydrogen hubs meant to kickstart production of the alternative fuel.


Now, the Trump administration has cast doubt over the future of the program — including the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, or ARCH2, which features projects in Ohio.


Despite the turbulence, industry leaders said they see a bright future for hydrogen in Ohio.


“We’re building businesses in this state regardless of that federal funding,” said Bill Whittenberger, executive director of the Ohio Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Coalition, at the group’s 2025 symposium, held Oct. 27 and 28 at the Honda Heritage Center in Marysville, Ohio. In his view, federal funding ​“makes things go a little faster, [but] there’s a strong business case for all the things we’re doing here.”


Many see hydrogen as necessary for decarbonizing hard-to-electrify operations, such as steel and glassmaking, as well as some transportation sectors.


Today, however, few industries use the fuel at a meaningful scale — and very little low-carbon hydrogen is available.


The Biden administration’s hub initiative meant to change that by bringing down the cost of low-carbon hydrogen, which can be produced with renewable energy, nuclear power, or natural gas with carbon capture and storage.


The initiative sparked detailed planning for dozens of projects throughout the hub regions. In Ohio, proposals took on different shapes: One developer wanted to use solar power to make hydrogen for buses in Stark County, while another planned to derive the fuel from a chemical plant’s waste stream. Still others looked to expand storage and refueling operations in central and northeastern Ohio.


The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act also created a lucrative federal tax credit for clean-hydrogen projects, an incentive that successful lobbying preserved through the end of 2027 in Republicans’ massive budget bill signed into law in July. But even with this federal support in place, the nascent industry has been on shaky ground. Some high-profile green-hydrogen projects were already floundering before this year.


The Trump administration’s October cancellation of federal dollars for two of the hubs that focused on hydrogen from renewable energy raised urgent questions about the viability of many hydrogen ventures nationwide.


The fate of the other five hubs remains uncertain. Last month, their names appeared on a leaked Energy Department list alongside a note to ​“terminate,” but the DOE has not confirmed their status.


Still, conference attendees emphasized, some hydrogen projects are moving forward in Ohio.


There’s the plan from American Electric Power’s Ohio utility to power data centers with fuel cells, for example. It’s part of a broader AEP partnership with Bloom Energy to acquire up to 1 gigawatt of fuel cells to help the giant computing facilities get online faster.


“Speed to power trumps all other things,” said Amy Koscielak, a senior business development leader for AEP.


At the outset, though, the systems planned in central Ohio for Amazon Data Services and Cologix Johnstown will run on natural gas. Eventually, AEP has said, they could switch to run on hydrogen.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Earlier this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio green-lit plans for AEP’s Ohio utility to provide the systems’ output exclusively to those customers, although appeals are pending.


Hydrogen also features in vehicle offerings from American Honda Motor Co. Although its hybrid cars that can use either hydrogen or battery electric power are built in Marysville, most of them go to California.


In general, battery-powered electric vehicles are probably the best option for ​“small mobility,” said Gary Robinson, vice president of sustainability and business development for the company. Indeed, hydrogen cars remain niche at best. But ​“trucks, buses, industrial equipment — all of those things, in our opinion, are perfect candidates for hydrogen,” Robinson said. The company is exploring shipping and aviation as other potential markets for fuel cells.


Ohio also has a few projects looking to harness electrolysis — a process that uses electricity to separate water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity that feeds into electrolysis is clean, the resulting hydrogen is clean too.


Dayton-based Millennium Reign Energy supplied electrolyzer equipment to provide initial fill-ups for the fuel-cell hybrids that Honda has made in Marysville since last year, and it has provided fueling equipment to other locations in the United States and abroad. The company plans to add two fueling stations for its Emerald H2 network in the Dayton area by April, CEO Chris McWhinney told Canary Media.


Plug Power also relies on electrolyzers to produce its hydrogen. The 28-year-old company’s first big order back in 2007 was for fuel cells to power pallet trucks at a Walmart distribution center in Washington Court House, Ohio, said Mike Ahearn, vice president for North American service. He did not talk about projects the company would do as part of ARCH2, if it moves ahead, but he did describe work outside of Ohio.


Plug Power remains on track to start construction next year on a wind-powered hydrogen plant capable of producing around 45 tons per day in Graham, Texas. ​“We are on a good trajectory,” Ahearn said, adding that the company’s goal is to turn a profit next year — something it hasn’t done yet over its almost three decades in operation.


Independence Hydrogen, another ARCH2 project-development partner, concentrates on local hydrogen production and distribution. While federal funding remains uncertain, the company still hopes it can move ahead with the Ohio project that would be part of the hub.


The company’s method of making the alternative fuel doesn’t fit neatly on the ​“hydrogen rainbow” that indicates whether production relies on renewable energy or fossil fuels.


Rather, the source would be an industrial waste stream from the INEOS KOH plant in Ashtabula, Ohio. The plant makes potassium hydroxide and other chemicals, and releases a waste stream that is almost all hydrogen. Independence Hydrogen would basically ​“clean up” the gas by removing water and other impurities and then compress it for transport.


But ​“I need an offtaker,” said William Lehner, chief strategy officer for the company. ​“We would love to provide that project.”


Indeed, most companies at last week’s symposium would love more customers, but it’s unclear how quickly interest in the alternative fuel will ramp up if federal funding for ARCH2 and other hydrogen hubs remains in limbo and if tax incentives aren’t extended further.


The DOE’s ​“hydrogen shot,” launched in 2021, aimed to scale up the production of clean hydrogen and cut its cost to $1 per kilogram — an 80% reduction — by 2031. While developers would still cover at least half the project costs at the hubs, federal grants would have reduced total expenses and let them charge customers less for their hydrogen. The hope was that the lower prices would stoke demand.


The Trump administration’s actions to dismantle decarbonization policy also raise questions about clean hydrogen’s future. Without sticks that punish greenhouse gas emissions or carrots that make zero- and low-carbon fuels cheaper, a lot of projects face a difficult road ahead.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)What do we owe one another?
This strikes me as one of the most important questions facing Kansans and Americans today. When our family, friends and neighbors pursue a harmful course, do we offer them unthinking affirmation or do we push back and challenge them for the harm they inflict? Do we insist on responsibility over rationalization?
This comes to mind because of two recent regional stories that have riveted readers from coast to coast. One was the arrest of Coldwater Mayor Joe Ceballos on voter fraud charges. The other was the failing grade given to University of Oklahoma student Samantha Fulnecky for a lousy essay. Her case has nonetheless ignited a firestorm of conservative grievance, including an unhelpful Twitter post from Kansas gubernatorial candidate Jeff Colyer.
In each case, those following the news face a disquieting choice — sympathize or scrutinize.
If you choose to scrutinize, does that make you somehow complicit in our fractured public debate? If you choose to pat participants on the head and say you feel their pain, do you let them off the hook? To put it brutally simply: Do we tell others the truth or dispense comforting lies?
I’m a professional opinion editor and columnist. You probably know where I stand. I believe that public officials, public policies and the public as a whole should be challenged when warranted. That doesn’t mean I’m judging anyone’s soul, or saying anyone is a good or bad person. It means that people make bad choices and I write about them. Perhaps, if enough people take my words to heart, they will make better ones.
You can watch this dynamic play out in the case of Fulnecky, an OU pre-med student. She wrote a reaction essay to a scholarly article about “gender typicality, peer relations, and mental health.” Her instructor gave the junior 0 points out of a possible 25, saying the piece “does not answer the questions for this assignment, contradicts itself, heavily uses personal ideology over empirical evidence in a scientific class, and is at times offensive.”
In pre-social media days, you would usually have to take both parties’ word in such conflicts. In our modern era, however, the campus chapter of Turning Point USA posted Fulnecky’s assignment directly to Twitter.
“Women naturally want to do womanly things because God has created us with those womanly desires in our hearts,” she wrote. “The same goes for men.”
That’s subpar. Rather than demonstrating genuine engagement with the article, the student filibusters about her religious beliefs. And rather than take her instructor’s reaction to heart and acknowledge her shortcomings, Fulnecky sought martyrdom by running to a campus conservative organization.
I’m an old-fashioned kind of person. I thought universities were meant to challenge students, not coddle them.
Or as conservative writer Richard Hanania snarked: “You have to pass students who only cite religious faith for their opinions now or they’re victims of discrimination.”
As for the mess in Coldwater, I’ve had my say. I’ve heard from folks in the area and understand how personally those words landed. My column wasn’t intended to harm anyone. However, I wanted to provoke a twinge of discomfort — perhaps in the way that Fulnecky’s teacher wanted her to contemplate complex issues. I’m not sure how anyone learns otherwise.
In my four-plus years of doing this job, I have tried to walk the line between empathizing with individuals and spotlighting harmful actions and beliefs. I have tried to focus on the fact that every one of us can choose to do better. We can choose to change and lift one another up rather than push one another down. 
That requires confronting tough truths and committing to introspection.
I will never — in the stories mentioned above or any others to come — offer comforting platitudes. Neither should you. The fact is, our fellow Kansans don’t always want to do the right thing. Sometimes they ignore pressing needs. Sometimes they just behave terribly.
It doesn’t do any of us any good to pretend otherwise.

Over the weekend, an article by a financial advisor named Michael Green made headlines in a number of prominent media sources. 
In this article, Green argues that the federal poverty line for a family four shouldn’t be $32,000 as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services designates it, but should instead be $140,000.
Green comes to this conclusion by collecting average costs for a range of goods and adding them up. 
This is similar to the approach taken by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Amy Glasmeier in her Living Wage Calculator. 
Her number for Ohio comes out to $38.47 per hour, which equals about $80,000. So considerably more than the federal poverty line, but considerably less than what Green comes up with.
There are reasons to be skeptical about this approach to measuring poverty. 
A central question here as a former philosophy undergraduate and a current poverty analyst is “what is poverty?” 
Whether we’re thinking about poverty as a measure of absolute deprivation connected to some sort of sense of biological needs or if we’re seeing it as a measure of relative deprivation connected to social needs, using average expenditure on a wide range of goods as the sole determinant of the threshold is a problematic way to define poverty.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The most widely-accepted measure of poverty by poverty researchers is the Supplemental Poverty Measure. 
This is a poverty measure that uses spending as a baseline for its measurement, but instead of using average spending as the baseline, it measures how many households are below a certain percentage of average spending. 
Its threshold for a family of four in 2024 was about $39,000. So still considerably higher than the $32,000 of the official poverty threshold, but far below the MIT and Green calculations.
In the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international organization for development of economic policy, poverty is defined at 50% of median household income. 
This is a handy measure when measuring across countries due to simplicity, and also captures the essence of practical poverty policy across countries: how many people fall far from the norm when it comes to household resources. 
Using this measurement, a poverty threshold for Ohio would be about $36,000, half of the median household income at $72,000.
How do we make sense of these different measures? Is the poverty threshold $32,000, $39,000, $80,000, or $140,000? 
As a policy analyst, my answer to this question is this: which of these actually fit with our understanding of how poverty works in the United States? 
If you surveyed people at $75,000, would they, on average, consider themselves to be living in poverty? 
If not, then an $80,000 poverty threshold is defining that family into a financial position they don’t consider themselves to be in. Moreover, $140,000 stretches the definition of poverty to absurdity.
Another test: what is the point of the poverty measure? 
According to the Census Bureau, there are 1.2 million Ohio residents living under the official poverty threshold and 1.1 million Ohio residents under the supplemental poverty threshold. 
If the goal of poverty policy is to help the people who need it most, shouldn’t this population of one million plus warrant more attention than the over 9 million who make under $140,000?
Poverty measure is an inexact science. 
But widening the scope of poverty to include four out of five U.S. families is a great way to miss out on the plight of those struggling the most in the state. 
Measurements like relative poverty measures or the Supplemental Poverty Measure give policymakers a much clearer picture of poverty than summing average costs of goods across society.

(Courtesy of American Association of University Professors)The University of Nebraska Board of Regents should immediately cancel the Dec. 5 vote on Chancellor Rodney D. Bennett’s proposed $27.5 million budget cuts to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL).
Approving this questionable plan is not fiscal prudence. It is institutional self-harm with long-term consequences for Nebraska’s educational system, economy and communities.
Chancellor Bennett frames these cuts as “necessary for survival,” but this hides the central issue: The crisis
facing UNL is not financial. It is a crisis of confidence and shared governance. The UNL Faculty Senate underscored this with a 60-14 no-confidence vote in the chancellor’s leadership.
Warning from governance: Stop the cuts
The Academic Planning Committee (APC) — UNL’s official body responsible for reviewing budget reductions to protect academic integrity — formally recommended not implementing these eliminations.
The APC found the proposal is rushed, relying on incomplete, inconsistent data, and concluded bluntly: “We do not have a spending problem on this campus; we have an investment problem.”
Despite this recommendation to pause the process and explore revenue-generating alternatives, the administration is forcing a vote on a plan judged academically destructive by its own governance body.
Over the past six years, UNL has absorbed more than $75 million in cuts, yet the deficit persists. This chronic contraction is compounding the issue. Institutions do not cut their way to growth. They invest their way to stability.
Threats to UNL’s mission and Nebraska’s future
Since 1869, UNL has provided high-quality, affordable public education. The proposed cuts undermine this mission by raising student costs and eliminating foundational programs, thereby shrinking the state’s workforce pipeline.
The economic consequences are clear: the University of Nebraska generates $10 in economic activity for every $1 of state investment. Weakening UNL undermines one of Nebraska’s most
powerful economic engines.
Direct harm to agriculture and workforce
The proposal would significantly damage agricultural research and Nebraska Extension by consolidating essential departments:

Entomology
Plant Pathology
Agricultural Economics
Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication

These units are crucial to rural communities and producers who rely on UNL experts for guidance on crop disease, yield, and economic issues.
The plan also dismantles programs vital to Nebraska’s workforce, including:

Educational Administration
Statistics
Textile and Merchandising
Earth and Atmospheric Sciences

Eliminating these programs drains the state’s talent pipeline and harms long-term competitiveness.
Loss of talent and research ambitions
The proposal eliminates 51 faculty positions outright and offers buyouts to 69 senior faculty, totaling 120 UNL educators—representing over 1,200 combined years of teaching, research and service — gone permanently.
The consequences are unavoidable:

Larger class sizes and reduced course availability.
Longer times to earning degrees and less advising and mentorship.
Reduced research capacity.

Students—already facing a 12% tuition increase over three years—would pay more for a diminished degree. This also undercuts UNL’s goal of rejoining the Association of American Universities (AAU), signaling a retreat from top-tier research.
A better path is possible: Delay the vote
There is no emergency requiring the dismantling of decades of progress in a single morning. This decision requires due diligence. The NU Board of Regents has a fiduciary and moral responsibility to protect Nebraska’s flagship university.
Approving permanent cuts of this magnitude—without transparent data, authentic campus engagement, and against the recommendations of the APC and Faculty Senate risks a
serious failure of responsible governance.
There are alternatives that should be pursued:

Identify administrative efficiencies instead of academic eliminations.
Pause non-essential capital projects.
Invest in modern, evidence-based enrollment and retention initiatives.
Collaborate with faculty experts to develop sustainable revenue strategies.

The APC explicitly recommended a delay to allow for a more thoughtful, sustainable, and strategic planning process.
Nebraska’s future depends on a strong, vibrant flagship campus.
The proposed cuts would weaken UNL’s academic core, diminish statewide economic growth, undercut agricultural innovation, and harm student success for years to come.
We hope that the board listens to the public and its own people and cancels the Dec. 5 vote. It can replace that move with a transparent, inclusive, data-driven planning process that protects UNL and the state’s people it serves.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWhen the Georgia Supreme Court handed Pete Skandalakis a steaming pile of horse manure, he did what any reasonable person would do in such a situation: He disposed of it as quickly and efficiently as possible, recommending that all remaining state criminal charges against President Trump be dropped.
He was right to do so.
The job had landed in Skandalakis’s lap after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who had initially filed those cases, was disqualified from handling them. The duty of deciding how to proceed thus devolved to Skandalakis as head of the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia. His decision means that all criminal cases filed against Trump for his conduct after the 2020 election, state or federal, have now become moot. No jury will ever hear the evidence and pass judgment on what occurred, leaving the final verdict to history.
According to some, however, the decision by Skandalakis means that Trump has been vindicated of the charges against him, and that is emphatically false.
In a letter explaining his decision, Skandalakis does conclude that the evidence against some of Trump’s 18 co-defendants in the case was too weak to justify prosecution. In his judgment, for example, there was no evidence that the “false electors” indicted by Willis had acted with criminal intent, a conclusion that seems correct. Skandalakis suggests instead that those electors had been honestly misled by Trump attorneys and advisors, and that if any criminality is involved, they are to blame.
However, in discussing his decision not to pursue charges against Trump, he makes no suggestion of innocence or weak evidence. Instead, his argument is grounded in sheer practicality.
“Never before, and hopefully never again, will our country face circumstances such as these,” Skandalakis writes. “The case is now nearly five years removed from President Trump’s phone call with the secretary of state, and two years have passed since the grand jury returned charges against President Trump and the 18 other defendants. There is no realistic prospect that a sitting president will be compelled to appear in Georgia to stand trial on the allegations in this indictment.”
“And even if, by some extraordinary circumstance, President Donald J. Trump were to appear in Georgia on Jan. 21, 2029 — the day after his term concludes — an immediate jury trial would be impossible.”
In fact, given the inevitable appeals and delays, “bringing this case before a jury in 2029, 2030, or even 2031 would be nothing short of a remarkable feat.”
Skandalakis also makes clear his belief that a conspiracy to overturn the election may very well have been underway, but it was a conspiracy hatched and carried out in Washington, D.C., not in Georgia, and thus any prosecution of those responsible is a federal, not a state, responsibility.
“Contesting an election is not unlawful,” he writes. “Both Congress and state legislatures have long recognized this principle and have enacted detailed procedures to permit such challenges. However, the strategy conceived in Washington, D.C. to contest the 2020 presidential election quickly shifted from a legitimate legal effort into a campaign that ultimately culminated in an attack on the Capitol, undertaken to prevent the vice president from carrying out his ministerial duty of counting the electoral votes.”
That campaign, he writes, bore evil fruit:
“But for this plan to use the fraudulent elector certificates to disrupt the congressional certification on Jan. 6, 2021, law-abiding citizens in Georgia, misled by campaign attorneys, some of whom were themselves misled, would not have served as Republican electors or cast electoral votes for the Republican candidate…
“But for the plan to stop the electoral count, President Trump’s phone call to the secretary of state would have been merely the conversation of a losing candidate struggling to accept defeat…
“And but for the plan driven by select individuals meeting in Washington, D.C., we would not have Fulton County grand juries selectively determining who should be charged with providing false statements to legislative committees convening on state Capitol grounds. Nor would we have had individuals encouraged by the false cries of voter fraud to harass and threaten an innocent poll worker,” a clear reference to Ruby Freeman.
As I said, that is not a vindication.
Some of our fellow Americans are trying to rewrite history, trying to convince us that we did not see what we all saw happen, that those who perpetrated a conspiracy against our democracy are in fact the victims of a conspiracy. Fifty years from now, I’m afraid, Americans will still be debating the events surrounding Jan. 6, much like some today still debate the JFK assassination or even the moon landing. It’s important to remember and pass down the truth.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DSC0413-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 01:56:39.141827

He also gutted the Office of Civil Rights, which helps enforce disability law.","In summary
Trump has cut funding to Medicaid, which pays for many services for students with disabilities. He also gutted the Office of Civil Rights, which helps enforce disability law.


Sleep is a rare commodity at Lindsay Crain’s house. Most nights, she and her husband are up dozens of times, tending to their daughter’s seizures. The 16-year-old flails her arms, thrashes and kicks — sometimes for hours.
But these days, that’s not the only thing keeping Crain awake. The Culver City mother worries about how President Donald Trump’s myriad budget cuts could strip their daughter of services she needs to go to school, live at home and enjoy a degree of independence that would have been impossible a generation ago.
“Every family I know is terrified right now,” Crain said. “We still have to live our everyday lives, which are challenging enough, but now it feels like our kids’ futures are at stake.”
Trump’s budget includes nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which funds a wide swath of services to disabled children, including speech, occupational and physical therapy, wheelchairs, in-home aides and medical care. All children with physical, developmental or cognitive disabilities – in California, nearly 1 million – receive at least some services through Medicaid.
Meanwhile, at the U.S. Department of Education, Trump has gutted the Office of Civil Rights, which is among the agencies that enforce the 50-year-old law granting students with disabilities the right to attend school and receive an education appropriate to their needs. Before that law was enacted, students with disabilities often didn’t attend school at all.
“We have a delicate web of services that, combined, support a whole child, a whole family,” said Kristin Wright, executive director of inclusive practices and systems at the Sacramento County Office of Education and the former California state director of special education. “So when the basic foundational structure is upended, like Medicaid, for example, it’s not just one cut from a knife. It’s multiple.”
Republicans have also suggested moving the office of special education out of the Department of Education altogether and moving it to the Department of Health and Human Services. Disability rights advocates say that would bring a medical – rather than a social – lens to special education, which they described as a major reversal of progress.
Trump has chipped away at other rights protecting people with disabilities, as well. In September, the U.S. Department of Transportation said it would not enforce a rule that requires airlines to reimburse passengers for damaged or lost wheelchairs. Trump has also repeatedly used the word “retarded,” widely considered a slur, alarming advocates who say it shows a lack of respect and understanding of the historical discrimination against people with disabilities. It’s all left some wondering if the administration plans more cuts to hard-fought rights protecting people with disabilities.
Fewer therapists, less equipment
The Medicaid cuts may have the most immediate effect. People with developmental disabilities typically receive therapy, home visits from aides, equipment and other services through regional centers, a network of 21 mostly government-funded nonprofits in California that coordinate services for people with disabilities. The goal of regional centers is to help people with disabilities live as independently as possible.
More than a third of regional centers’ funding comes from Medicaid, which is facing deep cuts under Trump’s budget. The money runs out at the end of January, and it’s unclear what services will be cut.
Schools also rely on Medicaid to pay for therapists, equipment, vision and hearing tests and other services that benefit all students, not just those with disabilities. In light of state budget uncertainty, it’s not likely the state could backfill the loss of Medicaid funding, and schools would have to pare down their services. 
Uncertain futures
For Lelah Coppedge, whose teenage son has cerebral palsy, the worst part is the uncertainty. She knows cuts are coming, but she doesn’t know when or what they’ll include.

“I go down this rabbit hole of worst-case scenarios,” said Coppedge, who lives in the Canoga Park neighborhood in Los Angeles. “Before this happened, I felt there was a clear path for my son. Now that path is going away, and it’s terrifying.”
Coppedge’s son, Jack, is a 16-year-old high school student who excels at algebra and physics. He loves video games and has a wide circle of friends at school. He uses a wheelchair and struggles with speech, communicating mostly through eye movements. He’ll look at his mom’s right hand to indicate “yes,” her left hand for “no.”
Coppedge and her husband rely on a nurse who comes four days a week to help Jack get dressed, get ready for bed and do other basic activities. Medicaid pays for the nurse, as well as other services like physical therapy. Even though Coppedge and her husband both work and have high-quality private health insurance, they could not afford Jack’s care without help from the government.
They also rely on the local regional center, which they assumed would help Jack after he graduates from high school, so he can remain at home, continue to hone his skills and generally live as independently as possible. If that funding vanishes, Coppedage worries Jack will someday end up in a facility where people don’t know him, don’t know how to communicate with him and don’t care about him.
“It feels like we’re going backward,” Coppedge said. “Half the time, I put my head in the sand because I’m just trying to manage the day-to-day. The rest of the time I worry that (the federal government) is looking at people like Jack as medical problems, not as unique people who want to have full, happy lives. It feels like that’s getting lost.”
The current uncertainty is stressful, but it’s even harder for families who are immigrants, Wright said. Those families are less likely to stand up for services they’re entitled to and are facing the extra fear of deportation. English learners, as well as low-income children, are disproportionately represented among students in special education, according to state data.
“That’s the other piece to all this — how it’s affecting immigrant families,” Wright said. “It’s a whole other level of anxiety and fear.”
Decades of progress on the line
Karma Quick-Panwala, an advocate at the nonprofit Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, said she worries about the rollback of decades’ worth of progress that was hard-won by the disability rights community. 
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the 1975 law that created special education, actually predates the federal Department of Education. In fact, Congress created the department in part to oversee special education. Removing special ed would be a devastating blow to the disability community — not just because services might be curtailed, but philosophically, as well, Quick-Panwala said. 
In the Department of Education, special education is under the purview of education experts who promote optimal ways to educate students with disabilities, so they can learn, graduate from high school and ideally go on to productive lives. In the Department of Health and Human Services, special education would no longer be overseen by educators but by those in the medical field, where they’re more likely to “look at disability as something to be cured or segregated and set aside,” Quick-Panwala said.
“The disability rights community has worked so hard and gave so much to make sure people with disabilities had a right to a meaningful education, so they could have gainful employment opportunities and participate in the world,” Quick-Panwala said. “The idea is that they wouldn’t just be present at school, but they would actually learn and thrive.”
For the time being, Wright, Quick-Panwala and other advocates are reminding families that federal funding might be shrinking, but the laws remain unchanged. Students are still entitled under federal law to the services outlined in their individual education plans, regardless of whether there’s money to pay for it. The funding will have to come from somewhere, at least for now, even if that means cutting it from another program. And California is unlikely to roll back its own special education protections, regardless of what happens in Washington, D.C.
An imperfect but successful routine
Those reassurances are scant comfort to Crain, whose daughter Lena will rely on government support her entire life. Born seven weeks prematurely, Lena has cerebral palsy, epilepsy, a cognitive impairment and is on the deaf-blind spectrum. But she has a 100-watt smile and a relentless spirit, Crain said. Even after the whole family has been up all night, Lena insists on going to school and getting the most out of every day.

Funny and assertive, she has a few close friends and, like many teenagers, plenty of opinions about her parents. She loves her English teacher and spends most of her day in regular classrooms with help from an aide. Her favorite book is about Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist who won a Nobel Peace Prize for fighting for girls’ right to an education.
Between school and home visits from aides and after-school therapists, Crain feels the family has pieced together an imperfect but mostly successful routine for Lena.
“Our entire lives are about teaching her self-advocacy, so she can have the most independent life possible,” Crain said. “Just because you need support doesn’t mean you can’t have a say in your life. There’s been so much work around the culture and the laws and the education system to make sure disabled people can make their own choices in life. We’re absolutely terrified of losing that.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120125-Lena-Deacy-ZS-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C670&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

California needs nuclear options",Leonard Rodberg,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/california-energy-needs-nuclear-options/,"If California ditches fossil fuels for greener energy, we can still expect weekly rolling blackouts. But nuclear power is unaffected by weather.","Guest Commentary written by

Leonard Rodberg
Leonard Rodberg is professor emeritus of Urban Studies at Queens College, City University of New York. 


Sure, California can swear off fossil fuels and shut down its nuclear plants, powering itself entirely with wind, water, and sun. 
All it takes is getting used to weekly rolling blackouts.
Some energy predictions are tricky; this one isn’t. We can estimate how much electricity each solar panel and wind turbine will produce, and when they’ll produce it. Then we can plug those numbers into a computer, along with green advocates’ optimistic projections of future electricity demand, to see how supply and demand match up on an hourly and seasonal basis.
Even with vastly expanded battery storage capacity to smooth things out, the match is poor. 
California will sometimes generate renewable energy in abundance, but grid operators will still face tough choices — such as disconnecting generators when there’s too much sun and little demand or firing up fossil-fuel based gas turbines when there’s no sun or wind at all. 
During much of the year, especially in late summer and throughout December and January, solar and wind power will meet demand for some hours but not have enough excess to charge the batteries. 
California might generate as much energy from wind and sun as it uses overall, but not when it’s needed. To keep the power flowing, the state will actually need up to 80 gigawatts of gas-fired backup capacity — far more than it has today — or risk repeated shortfalls.
Eighty gigawatts is enormous. California’s current peak demand is just over 52 gigawatts, but by 2050 — with millions of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and energy-hungry data centers — electric demand will be far higher. 
Keeping all that backup generation on standby won’t come cheap. The cost of maintaining this fossil fuel capacity must be added to the already high cost of intermittent renewables like solar and wind.
A system powered solely by solar, wind, and hydro isn’t an engineering strategy; it’s a belief system. Zealotry and energy reliability don’t mix.
Some zealots who advocate for an all-renewable energy future have offered unrealistic scenarios for powering California while eliminating carbon emissions. Our recent studies show their plan for California would leave it short of power at least 50 days a year.
The state’s official energy plan isn’t much better. A new grid simulator — the Hourly Electric Grid Analysis, or HELGA — compares expected demand with renewable output on an hour-by-hour basis. It shows California’s plan would cost nearly a trillion dollars yet still require the grid to burn almost as much natural gas as it does today.
Like every other state, California will need large, zero-carbon generators that operate independently of the weather to meet its climate goals. 
Realistically, that means nuclear power. 
A fleet of advanced reactors running around the clock can provide reliable, carbon-free electricity. New designs — such as Bill Gates’s Natrium reactor with molten salt thermal storage — are engineered to ramp output up and down in response to grid demand. Others will operate continuously, supplying the grid or charging storage systems as needed.
California can reach its climate goals, but not through blind adherence to ideology. Clean, reliable power is possible, but only if the state faces reality about what it takes to get there.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/080924-Diablo-Canyon-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

(Via FWC)When I was growing up here in Florida, everyone revered science. We looked to high-IQ scientists to tell us how to fly to the moon, how to transplant a heart, how to fire up a laser, how the universe began with a Big Bang.
But science is clearly out of favor now, especially in Florida. If you don’t believe me, look at the argument the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission put forward last week to convince a judge to approve a different kind of Big Bang: the first bear hunt in 10 years, starting Saturday.
An animal advocacy group called Bear Warriors United sued to stop the hunt, arguing that allowing people to blow away 172 bears over 22 days would fly in the face of science. The FWC’s attorney argued that there’s no law requiring the agency to follow this “science” stuff.
“There is nothing that mandates or controls how a commissioner votes,” the FWC attorney argued in a court filing, “nor requires that a commissioner base his or her vote specifically on a body of sound science.”
So beat it, you brainiacs! We don’t need no stinkin’ science! We can do what we want!

Clay Henderson, who helped create the wildlife commission 25 years ago, told me he was “just flummoxed by the FWC response. Their argument is the governor appointed them and the Senate confirmed them and that is all that matters. They are not bound by science.”
This certainly helps explain why the wildlife commissioners pushed for this hunt despite clear evidence that Florida’s bear population is in decline (more on that in a minute).
If they were following the science, they would hold off the hunt until they could get better information. Instead, they followed what I think of as the Veruca Salt Principle, which is “I don’t wanna wait! I want it NOW!”
When Bear Warriors United first sued, the organization’s founder, Katrina Shadix, told me she hoped the legal challenge would “shine a bright light to expose the FWC’s culture of corruption, as well as demonstrate the desperate and immediate need for massive agency reform.”
The suit has so far failed to stop the hunt, but it sure achieved that goal of switching on the spotlight to show us what the wildlife commissioners are all about.
Repeating mistakes
I was there in person for the last bear hunt back in 2015. The parallels to today are downright eerie.
The wildlife commission staff couldn’t say for sure how many bears there were, just like today. The hunt was massively unpopular with the general public, just like today. The commissioners who insisted on the need for a hunt sneered at the ignorant public trying to oppose them, just as the commissioners are doing now.
Only one commissioner voted against holding that 2015 hunt: avid outdoorsman Ronald “Alligator Ron” Bergeron, a rodeo champ, airboat pilot, and python hunter from Davie. Not exactly a shrinking violet, nor someone who tends to mince words.
“I’m a hunter myself and my family has been here for 170 years, all the way back to the 1840s,” he said 10 years ago. “But I believe that we need to evaluate, take our time a little bit here.”
Waiting would have been the smart thing to do. The hunt turned into a colossal disaster.
Wildlife commissioners had given the hunters a week to kill about 300 bears. They nearly hit the limit after just two days, forcing the executive director to shut it down early. Meanwhile, among the dead were 36 lactating mother bears, which may have left behind orphaned cubs.
I contacted Bergeron this week to ask him about the sitting commissioners claiming they’re not bound by science. He told me that when he sat on the wildlife commission, he believed that science was essential to doing the job, which was — in case you forgot the name of the agency — conserving Florida‘s wildlife.
“I think the state’s iconic wildlife — the panther, the eagle, the manatee, the bear — deserve an even higher level of protection than other wildlife,” he told me.
Bergeron said he could support having a bear hunt if the science showed a need for one. If there were too many bears for the amount of food they usually eat, for instance, that would be ample justification for thinning them out.
But there’s no science showing that.
Instead, he pointed out, the estimated number of bears in Florida now — 4,050 — is fewer than the estimated number we had before the hunt 10 years ago — 4,300.
“The population isn’t growing,” Bergeron said. “It’s stable.”
That means this isn’t a hunt to control the bear population, he said, but a hunt intended to provide some hunters with a trophy.
From what I heard this week, it’s even worse than that.
Juking the stats
During the August commission meeting at which they approved the hunt, Commission Chairman Rodney Barreto bragged about the process behind their vote.
Rodney Barreto via screen grab
“We make decisions based on science,” said Barreto, a wealthy developer. But that was another untruth.
This is the same Barreto who during a legislative committee meeting denied any effort on his part to develop in a sensitive wetland, even though an official record indicated he had filed an application to do exactly that.
For its lawsuit, Bear Warriors United brought in a former FWC bear biologist to testify about what was wrong with the agency’s science claims.
After the case was over, I talked to Darcy Doran-Myers, who worked for the agency for four years, about what she said in court. What she told me was disturbing.
It reminded me of a scene from “The Wire,” in which one of the characters uses the phrase “juking the stats.” It means rearranging the official numbers, twisting them this way and that, so they look better than they really are.
The FWC has divided the state into seven “bear management units.” The hunt is scheduled to occur in four of them.
One of the units in which the FWC plans to allow hunting is called “Osceola.” It’s about as far north as you can go in Florida without winding up in Georgia. The region got its name because it encompasses the Osceola National Forest. It’s known as one of Florida’s most forested and least-developed bear management units.
A scientific abundance survey, presented to one of the FWC’s advisory groups a month after the commissioners’ vote to hold the hunt, reported that Osceola’s bear population has seen a steep decline. It now contains just 165 adult bears, down from 496 in 2014.
The state’s bear management rules — at least the ones they’re using this year — say that no hunting can occur in regions with fewer than 200 bears. Obviously, that would eliminate hunting in the Osceola region.
Darcy Doran-Myers via Research Gate
So, they juked the stats. The official estimate for the Osceola region wound up including bears from Georgia too, Doran-Myers said. That boosted the number of bears in the unit to more than 300.
Then the FWC adjusted the total number of bears that could be killed. Originally the commissioners had approved killing 187, but now it’s a slightly smaller number: 172.
Bear (sorry!) in mind that the Florida hunters can’t stray across the state line to kill their prey in Georgia unless they’re licensed in both states. If they aren’t, they can only shoot bears in Florida. But counting bears from a different state gives a different impression about how many targets there are.
“It’s totally illogical from any way I can look at it,” she told me.
Juking the stats also means that by allowing bears to be killed in the Osceola region, the FWC may imperil the future of that segment of the bear population.
That’s not “conservation” by any definition of the word.
There’s no good reason to push this hunt ahead right now. Before the 2015 hunt, there were a number of bear maulings tied to human failure to properly dispose of garbage, so the argument for rushing the hunt then was to take care of that problem (even though we know now that a hunt has no effect on those incidents).
Those sorts of maulings have been stopped by better trash management. We did have one person killed this year by a bear — but that’s the first time that’s happened in Florida history.
Blood money
Bear Warriors United is appealing the judge’s ruling allowing the hunt, Shadix told me.
Meanwhile, her organization and its allies have fought back as best they can. They encouraged people who have no interest in killing bears to try to obtain hunting permits from FWC.
By one count, people who won’t hunt bears won 52 of the permits issued. That’s about 30% of all the permits, which should give you a good idea of how strongly some people want to protect the bears.
However, that may not help as much as it seems.
Katrina Shadix via screengrab
People who do manage to kill a bear have to turn in their official bear “tag” along with proof of their kill within 24 hours. Shadix pointed me to some social media posts by people in favor of killing bears. One, a woman from the town of Vernon (so odd and violent a place that it was the subject of an Errol Morris documentary), wrote, “I’m not using my tag until Bear No. 3.”
Some bear advocates are also offering to pay hunters with permits $2,000 not to kill a bear.  Shadix said she’s seen social media comments from hunters about how they think that’s a cheap effort. They can make $10,000 off selling bear body parts such as gallbladders to people who use them for folk medicine.
So, to sum up, the state wildlife commissioners — all of whom were appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and most of whom are in the development business — ignored actual science and public opinion to hang a target on the state’s shrinking bear population and make a few people a lot of money.
Even worse, they’re allowing the use of bows and arrows, crossbows, and bait to lure wary bears close enough to shoot. If there’s a hunt in 2027, they plan to allow the use of dogs to harry the bears, too.
DeSantis could put a stop to this if he wanted. As I mentioned, he appointed all seven commissioners. He could call Barreto and say, “Don’t do this.”
I asked his official spokespeople if he was going to step in and save the bears. As usual, I didn’t hear back from them even to acknowledge my question. Shadix said her organization and others have appealed to him for help. They, too, got radio silence.
But that’s understandable. DeSantis’ pro-development choices for the wildlife commission have done little to conserve wildlife, and he’s done nothing to rein them in.
During his years in office, we’ve seen a major manatee die-off and now there are signs that the population of the Florida panther is in decline. That’s our official state animal, barely saved from extinction once, now apparently headed for the exit door again.
When it suits him, DeSantis likes to pretend to be as green as a glass of beer on St. Patrick’s Day, but he’s not. His actions — or lack thereof — speak far louder than his words. That’s just science.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Florida-black-bear-via-FWC-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 00:58:24.974407
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-04 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut needs climate heroes,Claudia Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/04/governor-can-be-a-climate-hero-but-claudia/,CT leadership has not stood up for major provisions in the governor's executive order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.,"Some recent events have highlighted a significant lack of follow-through for both the 2008 Global Warming Solutions Act provisions passed by our state legislature, and Executive Order No. 3 signed by Gov. Ned Lamont in September of 2019.
Since that time, transitioning our state from fossil fuel energy to the stated target of 100% zero carbon for our electric sector by 2050 has had some serious setbacks.  Unfortunately, Connecticut’s leadership has not stood up for major provisions stated in that executive order.  While political times have changed, Mother Nature has continued to obey laws of science and will not pause while we take a break from implementing our own state laws.
On the same day that nine activists from Don’t Destroy Our Future held a peaceful sit-in in the governor’s office in opposition to multiple new gas expansion projects, Eversource announced a proposed 13% increase in its “winter electricity rate,” subject to approval by PURA.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that Connecticut’s residential rate is already 92% higher than the national average.  According to Hartford Business Journal reporting, the reason is because the cost of electricity Eversource purchases for customers has gone up. This increase “reflect{s} constrained natural gas supplies and increased heating demand” in the winter months. 
The rate increase would be effective January 1, 2026, about a month away.   With an estimated 1.3 million customers in 157 of Connecticut’s towns and cities, Eversource is encouraging customers “to explore competitive suppliers through the Energize CT rate board, where alternative providers may offer lower prices or renewable energy options.” Hmmmm… so why doesn’t Eversource pursue renewable energy options?  Why is Eversource wedded to “natural” gas, an industry term that obscures the fact that it’s primarily methane gas, which has immediate emissions during the following decade that, when compared to carbon dioxide, are more than 80 times more damaging to our environment and human health?
In a November energy forum hosted by the Hartford Business Journal, speakers including State Department of Economic & Community Development Commissioner Daniel O’Keefe urged that our state move away from individual state level power purchase agreements and instead look to ISO-New England for regional energy procurement.  Their reason? Connecticut commercial energy prices are 140% higher than the U.S. average.  So, with gas still comprising 60% of our state’s energy supply, both our homes -–remember the “winter electricity rate” noted above–- and businesses are facing higher rates with no end in sight year after year.
The initial financial costs for transition away from fossil fuel energy to renewables -–solar, wind, geothermal-– sounds like a big investment.  It is a big investment up front.  But right now, the Lamont administration is approving a number of gas pipeline expansions with costs of $8 million to $15 million per mile that are simply being passed along to rate-payers in our monthly bills as part of delivery charges.  And those pipeline expansions are investments in the next 20 or 30 years of continued gas energy.  So, either we’ll get our money’s worth–- or rather the industry’s money’s worth–- or the pipelines will only be used for the next five to ten years, which makes it a short-term investment for them that consumers have paid for with no choice or questioning.
Unfortunately, in his January, 2025, State of the Union address, Gov. Lamont made no reference to these Executive Order No. 3 goals:  to implement strategies “to assess and prepare for the impacts of climate change in areas such as infrastructure, agriculture, natural resources and public health” and to “spur innovation in carbon-reduction strategies and economic development throughout the state and the region.”  Instead, in proclaiming accurately that most of our power comes from natural (methane) gas, he predicted that it will continue “for the foreseeable future.”  
This indicates that his administration intends to continue to issue permits for further gas pipeline expansions.  So our families and business financial security will continue to be at the mercy of investor-owned utilities like Eversource, with decisions made to increase their profit.  Eversource apparently finds changing to renewable energy too expensive because wind, solar or geothermal power cannot be charged to ratepayers, unlike methane gas construction costs. Also note that, while geothermal infrastructure costs more to install, there is no fuel cost for decades after.
To support implementation of  Executive Order No. 3, we needed state officials to end the continued expansion of fossil gas by opposing the doubling of Brookfield’s compressor station capacity.  Instead, DEEP has issued preliminary approval.  We needed the Department of Administrative Services to support updating of the Hartford Capitol Area System energy infrastructure with geothermal conversion.  Instead, the choice was to replace old gas boilers with more gas boilers.  
We need to hear Gov. Lamont’s opposition to an Eversource plan to build new pipelines between Middletown and Montville by drilling and laying such pipe underneath the Connecticut River.  To date, no such statement has been reported.
In short, we need our state leadership to deny all such permits and projects that undermine or directly conflict with Gov. Lamont’s stated executive order goals. Such action has not been forthcoming, just when the people of our state and the New England region need it most.
Following the Don’t Destroy Our Future activists’ attempt to meet with the governor, his spokesperson responded with a press statement: that the administration looks forward to conversations with “regional partners” about how to increase our state’s energy supply, lower costs for ratepayers and to protect the state’s investment in renewable energy. Maybe including some of his own constituents, such as the youth-led SunRise Movement, as one of those “regional partners” is a good place to start.
Our young people have the highest stakes in this one-planet-or-no-liveable-planet future we are all facing now.  Indeed, it is young people who will benefit from, or pay the prices–both financial and environmental–for any action taken or promises broken by our state leadership. We need climate heroes now who have the commitment to follow through on Gov. Lamont’s Executive Order No. 3 promises made in 2019.  Please step up now.

My elementary school participated in mainstreaming, a practice in which students with special needs are integrated into general education settings. So, in my kindergarten class there were a few neurodivergent students. 
I could tell that they were different, but I also understood that this was perfectly okay. We played and learned together, which reinforced the importance of inclusion and acceptance.



I arrived at high school with a passion for work in special education and was accepted into a program known as “PE Partners”, a physical education class made up of neurotypical and neurodivergent students. 
My experiences in this program were incredibly positive and meaningful, except for the day a young neurodivergent student became incredibly agitated and began to get physically violent. The boy was autistic, which hindered his ability to regulate his emotions and physical outburst. During this specific outburst, the boy had to be physically restrained by an aide. She held him down on the ground, arms restricted, as he screamed and cried and begged. 
The scene was traumatic to say the least. 

Emme Turner

Considering how distraught I was, I can only imagine how difficult that moment must have been to process for a student with an intellectual disability. The worst part is, at the time, there was really no other option to deescalate the situation. If he had not been restrained, he could have been a serious harm to himself or others. There needs to be more options for responding to such crises.
Students in special education are particularly vulnerable to experiencing mental health crises. They have higher levels of emotional, behavioral, developmental, and trauma-related needs. For instance, one report notes that students eligible for “emotional disturbance” in Connecticut face very high rates of suspension and removal, suggesting gaps in behavioral-health supports. Furthermore, there has been a sharp rise in restraint and seclusion incidents in Hamden and Clinton schools. Officials link this increase to post-pandemic trauma, behavioral escalations, and disruptions in special education programs. 
As schools struggle to manage increased emotional and behavioral challenges with limited resources and support systems, a mental health crisis among children in special education grows. 
I advocate for a mandate which requires dedicated, embedded mental-health professionals in every special education classroom or setting statewide. This can include school psychologists, counselors, and licensed social workers. It would be funded by the state and tracked by student to clinician ratios. 
Existing Connecticut policy requires districts to adopt behavioral intervention plans and includes behavior assessments under recent legislation in special education. Additionally, the state’s “School Health and Sanitation” guidelines emphasize that districts should provide early and ongoing mental health screening, crisis intervention, staff development, parent-school linkages and community-based linkages. 
I believe that we can take this focus on mental health in special education a step further. My suggested legislation would require each education classroom, or wing, to have at least one full-time licensed mental-health clinician dedicated to students with IEPs or other special-ed designations. While professional guidance currently recommends about one full-time school psychologist for every 500 students and one counselor for every 250, the reality is that many schools face ratios of 1:1,000 or worse. Thus, students with special needs are often left without consistent mental-health staffing. 
When schools have dedicated mental health professionals embedded in special education settings, they can intervene early, provide screenings, link to community care, train staff in de-escalation, and create proactive support, ultimately helping to prevent mental health crises. Inevitably, the occasional crisis will still occur but studies show trauma-informed supports substantially reduce the use of restraints and seclusion. 
A similar legislation has been successfully implemented in Sacramento County, California. They launched a county-wide initiative under the state’s Mental Health Student Services Act to place a full-time mental-health clinician in every public school. This model has expanded prevention, early intervention, and crisis services for more than 250,000 students and has been credited with transforming schools into “centers of wellness” by strengthening daily mental health support, not just emergency response.
This mandate would move the special education system from largely reactive discipline and punishment to proactive support and prevention. Rather than falling back on restraint, seclusion, suspension or exclusion, policy must promote services that prevent escalation. There is a lack of dedicated mental-health staffing in schools that needs to be corrected. I believe it can lead to measurable improvements, like reduced restraints, improved school climate, and better access to mental health for a vulnerable population. Supporting these students can improve well-being and educational outcomes. 
We owe it to every child, especially those with special needs, to create schools where mental health is not an afterthought, but rather a foundation. No child should have to endure the trauma of physical restraint simply because our system lacks the resources to support them better. By embedding dedicated mental health professionals directly into special education classrooms across Connecticut, we can transform schools from places of crisis to places of care, growth, and true inclusion.

(Getty Images)The Alaska Court of Appeals has rejected an appeal from a man who received one of the highest prison sentences ever given in Alaska to a juvenile convicted of murder.
In an order published Friday, the court concluded that the recantation of a key witness is not enough to warrant a retrial for Brian Hall, who was 17 at the time. In 1995, Hall was sentenced to 159 years in prison for the killing of two men in Anchorage, Mickey Dinsmore and Stanley Honeycutt. 
Despite the rejection, wrote Judge Marjorie Allard on behalf of the court, Hall is eligible for resentencing as part of a wave of juvenile punishments being reconsidered by state courts.
“At sentencing, the court sentenced Hall to 159 years to serve, one of the highest sentences — if not the highest sentence — that a juvenile tried as an adult in Alaska has ever received,” she wrote. “As a juvenile sentenced in 1995 to a de facto life without parole sentence, Hall has been granted the opportunity for a resentencing in which his youth and the unique attributes of youth will be appropriately considered.”
In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment prohibits courts from sentencing children to life in prison without the possibility of parole, except in homicide cases.
Two years ago, the state appeals court said the Alaska Constitution imposes further limits in addition to those provided by the U.S. Constitution.
Since then, Alaska courts have resentenced several former juveniles who were sentenced to long terms in prison. In September, Alaska’s youngest convicted female murderer was released from prison on parole after 40 years behind bars. 
Hall, who has been in prison for 30 years, could receive similar treatment.
At the time of his trial, Hall claimed he acted in self-defense and that he believed, based on a statement from then-15-year-old Monica Shelton, that Dinsmore and Honeycutt — the people he killed — were armed.
At trial, Shelton denied telling Hall that the two were armed. Hall was convicted and sentenced with that testimony.
While in prison, Hall married Angela Diaz (now Angela Hall), and Angela hired a defense investigator who got in contact with Shelton. In a recorded interview, Shelton said she was scared at trial and lied in her testimony.
In an interview with the Anchorage Daily News, Hall said he is full of remorse about his crime and isn’t the same person he was at 17.
Years of legal arguments followed the investigator’s interview as Hall first requested a new trial, then asked for post-conviction relief. 
Superior Court Judge Adolf Zeman dismissed that request, siding with state prosecutors who had raised procedural errors, including the idea that Hall’s filings were too late. 
He also concluded that Hall failed to show that Shelton’s recantation would “probably result in an acquittal,” the standard that applies to timely filings for post-conviction relief.
Allard, writing on behalf of the appeals court, overruled Zeman on the procedural elements of Hall’s argument but concluded that even with the recanted testimony, it wasn’t clear that a new trial would result in a new outcome.
“The problem that Hall still faces, notwithstanding Shelton’s recantation, is that the rest of the evidence from trial indicates that Hall’s mistaken belief that he had to use deadly force … was not objectively reasonable,” she wrote.
“Hall was required to show that, viewing all the well-pleaded facts in the light most favorable to Hall, it is “highly probable” that Shelton’s recantation would result in an acquittal at any retrial,” Allard said.
“But while Shelton’s recantation constitutes important new evidence that sheds more light on Hall’s motivations and the reasons for his subjective fear, it does not alter the fact that his actions in shooting both men still appear overly impulsive and objectively unreasonable under the circumstances.”
Even with that finding, Hall is eligible for resentencing, Allard said.
“As part of that resentencing, the court should take into account Shelton’s recantation and the effect of that recantation on Hall’s level of culpability.”

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s largest historically Black university is not doing enough to ensure Black and women-owned businesses can participate in state contracts, state Treasurer Dereck Davis said Wednesday.
Two contracts drew Davis’ attention and criticism during Wednesday’s Board of Public Works meeting: First, a $10.5 million contract for campuswide electrical upgrades at the Baltimore campus, and then a $1.6 million contract to provide engineering services for a security wall at the university.
A campus official defended the university’s performance, and said the contracts angering Davis were atypical. But Davis said he “can’t hold majority folks to goals that Morgan’s not meeting. They’ve got to be held to the same standard.”
The university set minority business enterprise participation at 17%. Davis said those targets were too low and expressed concern that the university reduced the initial 33% MBE goal for the engineering contract.
“I guess after the school had some conversations with the industry, and they said that, ‘Oh, we couldn’t find qualified MBEs,’ or whatever the case may be, it got lowered to 17%. The winning bidder came in and ended up at 33%,” Davis said. “Why? Because this is what it sounds like to me, it sounds like the same old — as we say — okie-doke.
“We can’t find anybody qualified. We don’t know anybody that can do it, and so then the state just sort of falls for that, and goes, OK, what can you do?,” he said. “And they lower it to 17%.”

Davis said dealing with contractors is “no different than for those of you who have children.”
“If you set goals, the kids will meet those goals that you set,” Davis said. “It’s no different with this. If you set the goals, they will meet the goals that we set. However, if they can get out of it, they will and it’s up to us to be diligent and try harder.
“They’re going to test you at first to see if they can get out of it,” he said. “And if we go, OK, then they will get out of it. But if you push back on their pushback, they’ll get there.”
Warren Builds LLC, based in Upper Marlboro, was awarded the contract for the security wall. The company’s bid included 33% minority business participation.
Kim McCalla, senior vice president for facilities, design and construction, defended the contracts. She said the university lowered the goal after a review of available contractors.
“There was some pushback on the goal,” she said, adding that the university originally wanted to see if they could double the original 15% goal on the contract.
The Upper Marlboro company, which is a certified MBE contractor, is handling much of the work itself. In doing so, rather than subcontracting work, it raised the total participation rate above 30%, McCalla said.
“Typically, and if you’ve seen in our past history, our MBE goals are typically much higher than the state’s goals and even Morgan’s goal,” she said. “But there’s a limited amount of scope of work that’s occurring in this project. It’s very finite where I believed it was going to be more difficult in order to achieve the goals for doing this specific type of work, it’s very limited. There’s not a lot of sub-trades with it to be farming out to other firms to do it, which is why we had lower goals.
While McCalla said the contracts drawing Davis’ attention were the exception, rather than the rule, but Davis disagreed.
“There have been other issues we’ve had with Morgan not meeting” MBE goals, Davis said.
“I also know for a fact, at least in my four years being here, we’ve had issues where the school’s goals haven’t been met, either or they’ve been very low,” he said.

Wes Mpore speaks at the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washigton's ""Lox and Legislatotrs"" breakfast in Rockville on fDec, 3, 2025. (Photo by Joe Andrucyk/Governor's Orrice)The Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington has a long list of legislative priorities, from fighting antisemitism and poverty to supporting reproductive and immigrant rights, and more.
But you might not have known it from the group’s annual Lox and Legislators breakfast Wednesday in Rockville, where antisemitism and security for houses of worship dominated the conversation by lawmakers, and where an impassioned Gov. Wes Moore pledged millions for security.
“There’s an entire legislative agenda that includes reproductive freedom and the environment and health equity and combating homelessness and immigration and all the things that you see on our paper that … we lobby for every year,” said Ron Halber, CEO of the JCRC. “But it was very interesting that the elected officials chose to spend more time focusing on antisemitism.
“But you’ve got to understand, this has become something that has consumed the Jewish community, OK?” said Halber, who added that if you’d told him three years ago that he would be “focusing all my time on Jewish security … I’d have felt like you’re crazy.”

But three years ago was before the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel that sparked the Gaza war.
Since then, hate crimes against Jews have risen sharply, jumping from 77 in Maryland in 2022 to 284 in 2023 and 276 in 2024, according to Maryland State Police data. That report said anti-Jewish hate crimes accounted for 28.5% of all hate crimes in 2024, trailing only attacks against Blacks.
As a result, institutions like B’nai Israel, where Wednesday’s event was held, have had to add security features and police or security officers on what Halber said is “almost like a tax on our own membership.”
For that reason, Halber said, the JCRC is pushing for a doubling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program, from the current $500 million to $1 billion next year; an increase in state funding for school-based security from $3 million to $5 million; and a doubling of Montgomery County funds for nonprofit security, from $1.2 million to $2.4 million.
A state fund, the Protecting Against Hate Crimes program for security at houses of worship and nonprofit facilities, was doubled from $5 million last year to $10 million this year. Halber said the JCRC, with an eye toward the state’s looming budget deficit, asked that the fund be kept level at $10 million next year.
Moore announced Wednesday that his budget for next year would include $10 million for that program, part of what he called the state’s “ironclad commitment to stop antisemitism in its tracks” and building a future “where hate as no oxygen.”
“There is no higher goal for any chief executive than ensuring their people feel safe where they live, where they work and where they worship,” Moore said, according a copy of his speech as prepared for delivery. “Last year, we doubled state funding for grants that protect against hate crimes. I am proud to announce that this year, my budget proposal will preserve historic funding of $10 million for hate crime protection grants.
“We are going to preserve funding for hate crime prevention because we talk to Jewish leaders … they tell us that their chief concern is being protected from violent acts of antisemitism,” Moore said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But the governor’s office also said, in a press release announcing the funding, that the preservation of the funds was also welcomed by the Pride Center of Maryland and by the Islamic Society of Baltimore.
While he welcomed the funding, Halber said it’s unfortunate that it’s needed and the JCRC can’t focus on the other issues in its legislative agenda.
“Like Marc [Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich] has said many times, ‘I’d rather this money go for social services or something else.’ Me too,” Halber said. “I don’t want to have the level of security we have here today, But we have to do it, because this is the crazy world we live in.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ja9_5012-1024x819.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 09:56:38.171520

(Photo by McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)A federal judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration plan to halt Medicaid funds for Planned Parenthood and similar health care providers.
The prelimnary injunction handed down Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts said a coalition of 22 Democratic attorneys general, including Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, had “demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” that the denial of fund unconstitutionally attached conditions to congressionally approved spending without giving notice to the states.
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani wrote the law “is impermissibly ambiguous” and an “unprecedented incursion into States’ traditional discretion over the regulation of medicine that Plaintiff States could not have anticipated when joining Medicaid.”
Talwani also wrote if the administration kept this law in place, it “would increase the percentage of patients unable to receive birth control and preventive screenings, thereby prompting an increase in States’ healthcare costs.”
The plan to withhold Medicaid funding was part of an expansive tax and spending cuts package signed into law by President Donald Trump (R) on July 4. The law bans Medicaid funding for health care providers “primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care.”
Planned Parenthood Federation of America, along with two of its affiliates in Massachusetts and Utah, filed a lawsuit three days after Trump signed the tax cut and spending plan.
Justice Department sues six more states, including Maryland, for voter lists

Later in July, the states filed a lawsuit that challenged a provision that eliminates Medicaid reimbursements for one year to health care providers that provide abortions and received more than $800,000 in federal and state Medicaid funding in 2023.
The defendants listed in the suit are the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and its administrator, Mehmet Oz.
An HHS representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Karen J. Nelson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Maryland, released a statement Wednesday welcoming the court’s “recognition that this law is unconstitutional.”
“We offer our most sincere gratitude to the tireless work of Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, who joined officials from 21 states and Washington, D.C. to fight against a ‘defund’ provision that will inevitably harm patients seeking crucial health care services,” she said.
The judge granted seven days for the Trump administration to appeal her ruling.
The Planned Parenthood lawsuit is just one of more than 100 legal actions – briefs and lawsuits – that the Maryland Attorney General’s Office has joined or led this year against the Trump administration. About four more were filed in November, including an amicus brief in support of California’s motion to dismiss a federal lawsuit that demands unredacted voter registration databases.
Brown, who serves as a co-led on the brief with 15 other attorneys general, argues in the brief the federal government seeks to collect personal information nationwide.
“Maryland voters deserve to cast ballots without worrying that their registration information will be mishandled,” Brown said in a statement. “The administration’s unlawful demands threaten both individual privacy and our collective confidence in our elections. We won’t allow federal overreach to undermine voting rights or discourage participation in our democracy.”

“NorthWestern and NW Colstrip have employed a strategy to violate Montana law and avoid FERC scrutiny of transactions,” the Public Service Commission said.
In July 2024, NorthWestern Energy announced it would acquire shares from Puget Sound Energy at the Colstrip electricity generation plant, and existing customers would benefit starting in January 2026.
But the utility holding company later formed a subsidiary, called NorthWestern Colstrip 370 PuLLC, and the utility is directing all the new shares to the subsidiary, an entity it said isn’t subject to Public Service Commission authority.
NorthWestern said it transferred the Puget purchase agreement to the subsidiary, so the subsidiary will acquire the new shares directly on Jan. 1, 2026, and the utility itself will not acquire or hold them.
In October, the subsidiary submitted a proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to sell electricity generated from the new shares on the wholesale market, and it told the PSC it plans to do so until its existing customers need the capacity.
Wednesday, the Public Service Commission filed a motion to intervene in the federal docket, raising numerous objections to the deal.
The filing, signed by PSC President Jeff Welborn and Vice President Jennifer Fielder, said NorthWestern Energy is a public utility, and the transfer of assets without PSC authorization likely violates Montana law.
It also said Puget Sound’s transfer of assets to NorthWestern (and NorthWestern directing them to its NW Colstrip subsidiary) without approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission violates federal law.
Additionally, the Public Service Commission said the subsidiary is attempting to sell energy and capacity it “neither legally owns nor controls” without the federal approval required.
In an earlier letter, however, NorthWestern told the Public Service Commission its plan protects existing customers from costs and liabilities associated with the new shares, and it allows the utility to offset operations and maintenance through wholesale sales — an assertion a conservation watchdog said demands examination.
NorthWestern also previously argued that questions regarding transfer of assets are squarely outside the scope of the proposal it submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — about a rate for wholesale sales.
In its filing with FERC, the Public Service Commission said a failed bill from the 2025 Montana Legislature is relevant in the case.
It said the proposed legislation attempted to exclude legally separate entities established by public utilities from the definition of a “public utility,” exactly the scenario NorthWestern asserts exists now.
The bill failed, but NorthWestern continued to try to shield its transfer from scrutiny and attempt an end run around Montana law, according to the Public Service Commission.
In failing to request approval for a transfer and instead seeking to sell on the wholesale market, the utility is “hoping to avoid state- and federal-level scrutiny regarding ownership and the associated state law violation,” the PSC said.
NorthWestern argues the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s jurisdiction isn’t triggered yet on any transfer, but the PSC said the deal to handle the Puget asset “was engineered to avoid Montana regulation, stop-gapped with a last-minute attempt at legislative change.”
The Public Service Commission also said NorthWestern’s move to direct Colstrip shares to the new subsidiary “before” they were officially acquired doesn’t mean the deal is outside the scope of federal authority — the subsidiary’s “most questionable argument.”
“It appears that NorthWestern’s strategy all along has been to avoid FERC and state scrutiny of this transaction,” according to the filing.
In its motion, the Public Service Commission asked the federal regulatory commission to reject NorthWestern’s filings and launch an investigation; “Montana will do the same.”
In an email, Public Service Commission spokesperson Alana Lake said regulatory staff identified the critical issue at the federal commission, and “their swift action” allowed the PSC to make a timely intervention.
“We are hopeful that FERC will acknowledge and address our concerns,” Lake said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-0026-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-03 21:58:15.551056

Gov. Tony Evers appointed John W. Miller, a venture capitalist who previously served on the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents, to serve as the next secretary and CEO of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.
Miller will fill the spot left vacant by Missy Hughes, who had served in the position since 2019 but stepped down from it in September just ahead of launching her campaign for governor. She joined a crowded field of candidates seeking Democratic nomination in 2026.
Evers said in a statement that Miller has a “proven track record of helping spearhead business growth and success in Wisconsin and around the Midwest, which makes him uniquely qualified to lead the exceptional team at WEDC.” 
“Under my administration, WEDC has entered a new era, focused on helping build an economy that works for everyone from the ground up. From investing in our workforce and higher education to bolstering entrepreneurs and budding businesses to leveraging public and private partnerships, John understands what it takes to build the 21st-century economy Wisconsinites need and deserve, and I have no doubt that his leadership will help us continue our work toward a stronger future for our state and communities across Wisconsin,” Evers said. 
Miller, who currently lives in Fox Point with his family, started his career as a congressional staffer for former U.S. Rep. Jerry Kleczka, a Democrat who represented Wisconsin’s 4th Congressional District (now represented by U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore). He went on to attend the University of Wisconsin Law School, graduating in 2006.
Miller then worked at Miller-St. Nazianz Inc., his family’s agricultural equipment manufacturing business, including as president and CEO for several years. He founded a venture capital fund called Arenberg Holdings LLC. in 2015 in Milwaukee; the firm works to mentor and invest in early-stage companies in the Midwest. 
Miller said in a statement that he is “honored” that Evers selected him for the position.
“WEDC celebrated a record year of investments in 2025, and I have every intention of using my experience in the business community to continue that success into 2026 and beyond,” Miller said. 
Evers previously appointed Miller to serve on the UW Board of Regents in 2021, though the state Senate fired him from the position in 2024 after he rejected a deal reached between Republican lawmakers and the UW System that traded concessions on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) for funding for employee raises and capital projects.
Miller was also previously appointed to and served on the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board of Directors under President Barack Obama and on the United States Trade Representative Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations under President Joe Biden. 
His appointment takes effect Dec. 15.

Brad Little speaks at the Associated Taxpayers of Idaho annual conference on Dec. 3, 2025, in Boise. (Photo by Laura Guido/Idaho Capital Sun) Idaho’s potential budget deficit, which will be exacerbated if lawmakers chose to conform with the tax changes under the federal “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” will be the central challenge for the Legislature as members return to the state Capitol in Boise in January. 
State elected officials who spoke Wednesday at the Associated Taxpayers of Idaho conference were somewhat at odds over the cause of that deficit and how to handle it, but everyone agreed budget cuts are coming. 
Idaho may need to find $600 million to $1 billion for next year’s state budget

Idaho is about $58 million behind revenue projections for the current fiscal year, with the Legislature’s projected deficit of at least $555.2 million for fiscal year 2027. Importantly, that number doesn’t include the estimated $167 million cost of Idaho adopting federal tax cuts in the federal tax and spending legislation adopted and signed by President Donald Trump in July. Other projections that include the cost of the federal tax bill show between a $600 million to $1 billion deficit for fiscal year 2027, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Legislators will vote during the 2026 session on whether to adopt the federal tax changes. 
The annual tax policy conference featured speakers who were lawmakers, tax experts, industry leaders and other officials. It was attended by many legislators, lobbyists, business and corporate representatives, and other stakeholders. 
 Idaho Lt. Gov. Bedke blames deficit on budget-making process, encourages use of ‘rainy day fund’ 

Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke began the day-long conference by critiquing the Legislature’s actions during the 2025 session, including passing a number of large spending bills before adopting a projected revenue number.
Idaho Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke, R-Oakley, conducts legislative business on the Senate floor on Jan. 7, 2025, at the State Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
“For the first time in Idaho’s history, (in) last year’s budgeting session, we acted more like Washington, D.C., than we did Idaho,” Bedke said. “… We created a list of things that we wanted to accomplish and passed that list of things before we set the revenue number, and then we backed into the list with the revenue number, and adjusted the revenue number to pay for that list of things.” 
As lieutenant governor, Bedke presides over the Idaho Senate and can cast tie-breaking votes, but otherwise is not often directly involved in creation and passage of legislation. 
Idaho’s budget-making process requires a projected revenue number to balance the budget against. The joint Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee will listen to projections from a variety of economists, university professors, state budget officials, and other stakeholders, and vote on a recommended revenue based on those presentations. The state’s budget writers on the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee then ultimately decide the revenue projection. 
In 2025, it took several tries for the committee to agree on a revenue estimate, doing so on March 6, eight weeks into the legislative session and after $5.1 billion in spending had already been approved, the Sun reported. 
Bedke said the state’s traditional method of garnering a consensus on a revenue number and then using a conservative estimate for that to keep money on the bottom line had been “the envy of every Western state.” He said Idaho had typically erred on the side of trying to under-project. 
“Being wrong on the upside, like we are now, results in tough choices and (to have) a tough budget year,” he said. “We all get a little buzz of finger-pointing and denying and blaming and even gaslighting, but that buzz needs to be short-lived. And we need to roll up our sleeves and make some tough decisions, because the math is going to win eventually.” 
To address the tough choices, he highlighted the state’s reserve fund, known as the “rainy day” fund. Idaho has around $1.4 billion in reserves, and Bedke argued it is “prudent that we use some of that to help and bridge over.” 
However, he opposed the idea of not adopting the federal tax changes under the “big beautiful bill,” which include no taxes on tips, no taxes on overtime for some workers, and no taxes on interest on auto loans. Despite the cost, Bedke argued that rejecting this for the state’s taxes would give other states an advantage who accept the tax breaks. 
“We cannot for long even entertain that thought of non-conforming to those federal changes,” he said. 
 Gov. Little says it’s ‘not raining,’ highlights positive state economic trends 

Idaho Gov. Brad Little in brief remarks to the conference painted a more optimistic picture than the lieutenant governor. 
He noted that Idaho had healthy reserves in its rainy day fund but said, “it’s not raining, maybe a cloud or two,” seemingly indicating he didn’t support tapping the fund for the current budget situation. 
Little did acknowledge “there are many challenges facing Idaho,” but they weren’t unique to the Gem State.  
He echoed his budget director, Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff, who earlier said that every state was dealing with revenue volatility as the infusion of federal funds from the pandemic are drying up. 
He did acknowledge that, as the state looks to the next fiscal year, fiscal year 2027, Idaho “will have to do more with less.” 
Little said the effects of the federal tax and spending bill will factor into making Idaho’s “budget environment very difficult going forward,” and will be approached “prudently,” but did not indicate if he supported or opposed conforming to the federal tax code. 
The governor highlighted positive trends such as high personal income growth and the state’s high ranking for “tax-friendliness” due to the $6.1 billion in tax reductions or rebates approved since 2019. He pointed to the state’s rapid growth as the source of its challenges. 
“We have been a victim of our own success, and I will not apologize for that,” Little said. “Our focus on common-sense policies continues to make Idaho a desirable place to relocate.”

 Legislative budget writers say budget is ‘fixable problem,’ downplay concern as ‘irresponsible’ 

Co-chairs of the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, known as JFAC, acknowledged that current estimates show a budget shortfall if the states do not do further cuts. In August, Little directed all state agencies outside of public K-12 education to reduce spending by 3% across the board for the current fiscal year, and in September, directed agencies to cut 3% for the next fiscal year. 
Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, and Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, said all projections are essentially a guess. Horman downplayed the projected deficit, saying its current shortfall when taking into account the budget from all sources — which include federal and dedicated funds in addition to general funds — “could almost be considered a rounding error.”

“You might have seen some headlines and some doom and gloom,” Horman said “Unconstitutional, crisis, these sorts of sound bites. I believe those terms to be inaccurate and irresponsible in some cases.” 
The state’s total budget, using all sources, is about $13.9 billion. Federal and dedicated funds typically are earmarked for certain programs or projects. The general fund budget is around $5.2 billion for fiscal year 2025, and it consists of unobligated money that the state uses to pay many of its bills and to enact policies. The general fund is typically the focus of the state budget because there is little control over dedicated or federal sources of funds. 
Idaho’s Constitution requires the state to have a balanced budget. If the state reaches the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2026, and its expenses still exceed revenues, the deficit will violate the constitution. Horman argued the state will not reach this point, but spending cuts will be needed.  
“(People) should expect those reductions to come,” she said. “Don’t anticipate that there are going to be huge increases in budgets this year. A predicted $555 million in requests in excess of predicted revenue has to come from somewhere.” 
Grow said a lot of the growth creating challenges for the current fiscal year budget are driven by forecasts coming in below actual expenditures in Medicaid and the state Department of Correction system. Supplemental requests, to cover costs incurred that weren’t funded the previous legislative session, include an additional $87 million for Medicaid and $17 million for covering the costs of the inmate population in state prisons. 
For the next fiscal year, there is a projected $133.7 million increase in the cost for state employee health insurance, he said. 
“That’s huge; that’s a 26% increase over last year’s budget,” he said. 
Horman cautioned against using the reserve funding for ongoing expenses to cover budget shortfalls. 
“That is a recipe for disaster,” she said. 
Grow and Horman indicated that tax conformity will be a major conversation during this year’s legislative session. Horman said the budget committee likely won’t set a revenue number until the tax policy committees produce a proposal for how to handle the federal tax changes and the income reduction that come with them. 
“We will see what the tax committees do,” Horman said. “I think it’s risky to even set a revenue number before we have some general idea of what that bill is going to look like, just because the variance could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and that would make setting the budget very tough if we don’t have some indication a ballpark figure of what that number is going to be.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0639-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-12-03 20:56:42.146916

Immigrants in Whatcom County are feeling scared after federal officials responded to last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., with harsh rhetoric about those without United States citizenship — and the announcement of drastic policy changes.
Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national living in Bellingham, is accused of traveling to D.C. and shooting Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe. Beckstrom, 20, died on Thanksgiving, and Wolfe, 24, remains in serious condition but has shown promising signs of recovery.
The federal government has reacted to the shooting with a slew of measures restricting immigration to the United States, including stopping Afghans from receiving visas and pausing asylum decisions for all nationalities.
Gabe Harrison, a Bellingham immigration attorney, said since the attack, he’s spoken to the handful of Afghan clients he’s had in recent years.
“They’re worried that their cases are going to be jeopardized by the actions of this one person who doesn’t represent them in any way,” Harrison said. “So the general feeling is, ‘What’s going to happen to us now?’”
Norma Suarez Govea, executive director and president of the Bellingham-based Immigrant Resources and Immediate Support, said the shooting was a “horrible, horrible event.”
“I can’t imagine what the family of the young person is going through, losing a child,” she added.
Lakanwal, who was shot by another guard member and remains hospitalized, has pleaded not guilty. He had been living in Bellingham with his family after leaving Afghanistan, where he was part of a military unit backed by the CIA, in 2021.
In Bellingham, Lakanwal struggled to find work and his mental health appeared to decline, it has been widely reported.
For six months in 2022 and 2023, he worked at Northwest Health Care Linen, the Bellingham medical apparel and linen company confirmed. Lakanwal did not speak English, so most employees’ interactions with him consisted of “explaining jobs by showing,” according to a spokesperson for the company. Lakanwal had gotten the job with the help of Evergreen Goodwill, the spokesperson said. Evergreen Goodwill has historically helped connect immigrant and refugee communities to jobs; in August 2022, Goodwill hosted a job and resource fair, hoping to expand outreach.
In a statement Wednesday, the Islamic Society of Whatcom County said Lakanwal “was not an integrated part of our community.”
“Like any house of worship, our doors were open to those who wished to pray alongside us, and as such he had visited a limited number of times,” the statement read in part. “Our interaction with him was very sparse, and we are sharing everything we know.”
The society is “fully cooperating with the FBI and local authorities,” the statement continued.
“Our hearts go out to the victims, their families, and all those impacted,” the group wrote. “We condemn this act unequivocally.”
World Relief Western Washington, a refugee resettlement organization with a Whatcom County branch, said in a statement Monday it “cannot confirm whether or not we have served any specific client without permission from our federal government partners.”
“We are shocked and devastated” by the attack, the statement read in part. The organization urged “our country to recognize these evil actions as those of one person, not to unfairly judge others who happen to share those same characteristics.”
In a statement Tuesday, Dec. 2, U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Everett, expressed support for World Relief and said, in part, “Refugees and humanitarian nonprofits that support refugees should not be punished because of the actions of one violent person.”
President Donald Trump wrote in a social media post last Thursday he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,” adding, “Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.” The next day, the Department of Homeland Security called for “remigration now,” a term that has been used to refer to mass deportation of a country’s non-white population, CNN reported.
To Jeremy Dorrough, executive director of Lynden nonprofit Racial Unity Now, that kind of talk is “un-American.” Lack of support for refugees has “been a national failure for decades,” he said.
“I think people who are on the sidelines don’t realize how little we really do to help people transition to the U.S.,” Dorrough said. “We do almost nothing.”
Much of the burden of helping people in that position rests on nonprofit or state agencies, of which few specialize in refugee assistance, he said. As a result, refugees end up living in homeless shelters and waiting in food bank lines.
“It would be difficult for the most established U.S. citizen to have to start over in that way,” Dorrough said, never mind someone fleeing a war zone.
Govea echoed the sentiment. The majority of refugees are already traumatized, she said. In a new country, they must learn a new language, find work and even navigate a new way of buying groceries.
Afghan refugees who have come to Whatcom County in recent years have not found a large community of those who share their culture, Dorrough and Govea agreed.
“There’s a lot of isolation,” Dorrough said. “There are dozens — not hundreds, not thousands — but I would say dozens of Afghans” in Whatcom County.
In 2021, World Relief helped settle at least 31 Afghan refugees in Whatcom County after Kabul fell to the Taliban and the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan, CDN previously reported. But by May 2022, 16 of those refugees had left to live in the Seattle area.
Those having difficulties adjusting may benefit from mental health services. But accessing that care can be challenging — especially for those whose native language is not English.
“We have some refugees from Spanish-speaking countries and finding therapists that speak Spanish is difficult,” Govea said. “I can’t imagine … how difficult it can be to find a therapist that speaks one of the languages from Afghanistan.”
The Trump administration’s push for tougher immigration enforcement has already left many without citizenship feeling fearful. For them, those fears have now been compounded by recent events.
Harrison, the immigration attorney, said before now he wouldn’t have thought of Afghan clients as at particular risk for enforcement. Their home country doesn’t share a border with the U.S., he pointed out, and many had already served the U.S. in some capacity in Afghanistan. The threat presented by the Taliban is well-known.
Now, he is concerned about Afghans in the U.S. being deported to a third country — and, once there, potential removal to Afghanistan. Back in their home country, some could face “death, torture, incarceration,” he said.
Sending people back to Afghanistan is “a death sentence for many people,” Dorrough said. “The Taliban has been hunting down people who cooperated with the U.S.”
The current location and status of Lakanwal’s wife and five children are unknown. His five boys were not in the apartment when the FBI executed a search warrant at the Bellingham complex, neighbors told Cascadia Daily News.
Fear of what happens next isn’t limited to Afghans, or even to refugees. One immigrant, who is not from Afghanistan, told Dorrough he has been carrying his U.S. passport everywhere he goes. Govea is worried about the impact of the shooting on all the families she works with.
“I don’t think people understand the difference between a whole bunch of different statuses,” Govea said. “To people, sometimes it’s just a brown person. Just an immigrant.”

As Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents increase arrests in Minnesota — part of a targeted campaign ordered by President Donald Trump — Democratic elected officials and immigrant rights activists say they are sorting through hundreds of messages claiming to have spotted ICE agents or immigrant arrests. 
Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Minnesota, said he received several reports of ICE arrests but couldn’t put a number on it since news of the ICE deployment emerged Tuesday morning.

The federal government doesn’t release statistics on daily immigrant arrests, and immigrant detention center rosters are not searchable online without knowing the name of a detainee — and those records are not always up-to-date, said Michele Garnett McKenzie, executive director of Advocates for Human Rights. 
That means activists must verify arrests with family members or witnesses, trawling through a sea of panicked messages to sort out the truth. 
“There have been some false alarms because the level of anxiety is so high, and we’re trying our best to not only disseminate information but facts  — find out what’s real, what’s happening, what’s not happening,” said state Sen. Omar Fateh, DFL-Minneapolis, during a press conference Wednesday afternoon. 
Advocates are focused on informing Minnesota residents — immigrants and non-immigrants — of their rights. Those include the right to refuse to open the door to federal agents if they do not have a warrant; the right to remain silent; and the right to a lawyer. 
State Sen. Zaynab Mohamed, DFL-Minneapolis, and Hussein were among others who spent the morning handing out small red cards, in Somali and Oromo, summarizing individuals’ constitutional rights. 
ICE agents have been accused of violating the constitutional rights of immigrants and American citizens, including detaining U.S. citizens for days. They have used munitions including pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters — including in the Twin Cities — resulting in injuries. 
“We are a nation of immigrants and of rights, but only if we are brave enough to defend it,” Mohamed said Wednesday.

Authorities suspect Andi Summerville embezzled $31,000 from the Wyoming Association of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Centers. She says she’s innocent. 
The post Former Laramie mayor charged with stealing from Wyoming mental health group appeared first on WyoFile .","The former director of a Wyoming mental health advocacy group faces felony charges accusing her of stealing more than $31,000 from the organization, court documents show.
Albany County prosecutors charged Andi Summerville on Tuesday with seven counts of theft and a single count of forgery. An arrest warrant was issued the same day, according to documents filed in circuit court in Laramie.
A Laramie police investigator found evidence suggesting Summerville used the organization’s debit card for personal trips to the Omaha Zoo and Mall of America and to pay for purchases at Target and Dick’s Sporting Goods, according to an affidavit of probable cause signed by Police Sgt. Jacob Bury, who investigated the case. The investigation also uncovered more than $28,000 in checks made out to Summerville from the group’s bank account.
Until this fall, Summerville served as executive director of the Wyoming Association of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Centers. In that role, she was a prominent voice on mental health issues in Wyoming, testifying before the Wyoming Legislature and giving interviews to various media outlets. The organization put her on administrative leave this fall and later fired her, the affidavit states.
Summerville also previously served as Laramie mayor and as a member of the city council.
In a statement to WyoFile, Summerville’s defense attorney Tom Fleener said his client is innocent.
“Ms. Summerville maintains that she is innocent of these charges and is looking forward to her day in court,” he said in a text message Wednesday. “All of these charges largely stem from issues with her expense reimbursements of which there was nothing improper.”
Summerville was booked into jail and subsequently released, Fleener said.

Police began their investigation in October after they were contacted by the mental health organization’s president, who shared concerns that Summerville had allegedly misused the group’s money. At the time, she was the organization’s only paid employee, working primarily from home.
In July 2024, following a leadership transition in the group’s board of directors, Summerville received full electronic access to the organization’s bank account and possession of the only debit card tied to that account, the police affidavit states. After that time, she was allegedly the only person with active access to the group’s financial accounts.
Police investigate
In September of this year, the board found seven expenditures totaling nearly $2,870 that didn’t appear related to the organization’s business. Police say those purchases included:

$419 at a Target store in November 2024.
$573 spent at three stores in the Mall of America in Minnesota in February 2025.
$469 at the Omaha Zoo in Nebraska in May 2025.
$875 between two visits to Dick’s Sports Goods in Broomfield, Colorado, in April and June 2025.

Police say Summerville acknowledged the purchases to the group’s president, who did not immediately respond Wednesday to a message from WyoFile, and attributed them to accidentally using the group’s debit card on personal trips. She said she had reimbursed the account afterward, but police said no deposits or transfers matching any reimbursements were found during a review of the group’s bank statements.
Investigators also found six checks — dating between August 2024 and September 2025 — written from the group’s account to Summerville, the affidavit states. The memos on the checks, which together totalled $28,500, all indicated they were for expenses.
“No receipts, invoices, or supporting records were located to justify any of these payments,” Sgt. Bury wrote in his affidavit. He also noted that the checks were out of step with expenses from the group’s previous budgets.
“Summerville’s self-issued checks exceeded the organization’s entire annual travel budget by more than $11,000 and far surpassed every other discretionary category,” Bury wrote. “Budgets recovered during the execution of a search warrant of Summerville’s home, including those prepared in prior years, show no historical pattern of reimbursements of this size. 
“These documents collectively demonstrate that the checks issued by Summerville were not consistent with [the group’s] planned or authorized spending,” the investigator continued.
The group’s board made formal requests on Oct. 3 and Oct. 6 for Summerville to provide all receipts for spending from July 2024 to October 2025, police say. The affidavit alleges she did not comply.

Invoking tradition, he led the people in noontime prayer. But rather than reciting it, as his predecessors generally did, he sang.
In chanting the traditional Regina Caeli, the pope inspired what some have called a rebirth of Gregorian chant, a type of monophonic and unaccompanied singing done in Latin that dates back more than a thousand years.
The Vatican has been at the forefront of that push, launching an online initiative to teach Gregorian chant through short educational tutorials called “Let’s Sing with the Pope.” The stated goals of the initiative are to give Catholics worldwide an opportunity to “participate actively in the liturgy” and to “make the rich heritage of Gregorian chant accessible to all.”
These goals resonated with me. As a performing artist and scientist of human movement, I spent the past decade developing therapeutic techniques involving singing and dancing to help people with neurological disorders. Much like the pope’s initiative, these arts-based therapies require active participation, promote connection, and are accessible to anyone. Indeed, not only is singing a deeply ingrained human cultural activity, research increasingly shows how good it is for us.
 The same old song and dance

For 15 years, I worked as a professional dancer and singer. In the course of that career, I became convinced that creating art through movement and song was integral to my well-being. Eventually, I decided to shift gears and study the science underpinning my longtime passion by looking at the benefits of dance for people with Parkinson’s disease.
The neurological condition, which affects over 10 million people worldwide, is caused by neuron loss in an area of the brain that is involved in movement and rhythmic processing – the basal ganglia. The disease causes a range of debilitating motor impairments, including walking instability.
Early on in my training, I suggested that people with Parkinson’s could improve the rhythm of their steps if they sang while they walked. Even as we began publishing our initial feasibility studies, people remained skeptical. Wouldn’t it be too hard for people with motor impairment to do two things at once?
But my own experience of singing and dancing simultaneously since I was a child suggested it could be innate. While Broadway performers do this at an extremely high level of artistry, singing and dancing are not limited to professionals. We teach children nursery rhymes with gestures; we spontaneously nod our heads to a favorite song; we sway to the beat while singing at a baseball game. Although people with Parkinson’s typically struggle to do two tasks at once, perhaps singing and moving were such natural activities that they could reinforce each other rather than distract.
 A scientific case for song

Humans are, in effect, hardwired to sing and dance, and we likely evolved to do so. In every known culture, evidence exists of music, singing or chanting. The oldest discovered musical instruments are ivory and bone flutes dating back over 40,000 years. Before people played music, they likely sang. The discovery of a 60,000-year-old hyoid bone shaped like a modern human’s suggests our Neanderthal ancestors could sing.
In “The Descent of Man,” Charles Darwin speculated that a musical protolanguage, analogous to birdsong, was driven by sexual selection. Whatever the reason, singing and chanting have been integral parts of spiritual, cultural and healing practices around the world for thousands of years. Chanting practices, in which repetitive sounds are used to induce altered states of consciousness and connect with the spiritual realm, are ancient and diverse in their roots.
Though the evolutionary reasons remain disputed, modern science is increasingly validating what many traditions have long held: Singing and chanting can have profound benefits to physical, mental and social health, with both immediate and long-term effects.
Physically, the act of producing sound can strengthen the lungs and diaphragm and increase the amount of oxygen in the blood. Singing can also lower heart rate and blood pressure, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Vocalizing can even improve your immune system, as active music participation can increase levels of immunoglobulin A, one of the body’s key antibodies to stave off illness.
Singing also improves mood and reduces stress.
Studies have shown that singing lowers cortisol levels, the primary stress hormone, in healthy adults and people with cancer or neurologic disorders. Singing may also rebalance autonomic nervous system activity by stimulating the vagus nerve and improving the body’s ability to respond to environmental stresses. Perhaps this is why singing has been called “the world’s most accessible stress reliever.”
Moreover, chanting may make you aware of your inner states while connecting to something larger. Repetitive chanting, as is common in rosary recitation and yogic mantras, can induce a meditative state, inducing mindfulness and altered states of consciousness. Neuroimaging studies show that chanting activates brainwaves associated with suspension of self-oriented and stress-related thoughts.
 Singing as community

Singing alone is one thing, but singing with others brings about a host of other benefits, as anyone who has sung in a choir can likely attest.
Group singing provides a mood boost and improves overall well-being. Increased levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin during singing may promote feelings of social connection and bonding.
When people sing in unison, they synchronize not just their breath but also their heart rates. Heart rate variability, a measure of the body’s adaptability to stress, also improves during group singing, whether you’re an expert or a novice.
In my own research, singing has proven useful in yet another way: as a cue for movement. Matching footfalls to one’s own singing is an effective tool for improving walking that is better than passive listening. Seemingly, active vocalization requires a level of engagement, attention and effort that can translate into improved motor patterns. For people with Parkinson’s, for example, this simple activity can help them avoid a fall. We have shown that people with the disease, in spite of neural degeneration, activate similar brain regions as healthy controls. And it works even when you sing in your head.
Whether you choose to sing with the pope or not, you don’t need a mellifluous voice like his to raise your voice in song. You can sing in the shower. Join a choir. Chant that “om” at the end of yoga class. Releasing your voice might be easier than you think.
And, besides, it’s good for you.

Reeves speaks at Madison restaurant,Simeon Gates,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/03/protest-immigration-crackdown-reeves/,About a dozen people who oppose immigration raids protested Wednesday outside a Madison restaurant where Gov. Tate Reeves was speaking.,"MADISON — A small group protested outside a monthly community meeting Wednesday in Madison to raise awareness about an immigration crackdown in Louisiana and Mississippi — a campaign known both as “Operation Swamp Sweep” and “Catahoula Crunch” – and to oppose the Mississippi government’s collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
While the group of about 12 protested outside, Gov. Tate Reeves, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, spoke inside of the Madison restaurant. The protesters were far enough away from the restaurant to prevent any direct communications with Reeves.
Beginning this week, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security are conducting a two-month immigration crackdown in Louisiana and south Mississippi. Protestors marched in New Orleans during the weekend to oppose the campaign.
The group also opposed Mississippi’s state agencies and local law enforcement in working with ICE’s immigration enforcement efforts through the 287(g) program.
On Wednesday, protestors in Madison stood across the street at the intersection in front of Mama Hamil’s, where Reeves was the keynote speaker at Grip N Grin, a monthly meeting to discuss current events. They waved signs as cars drove by, and some drivers honked as they passed.
Kathleein O’Beirne, a Ridgeland native, said this protest was made possible by a coalition of groups, including Mississippi United.

O’Beirne said immigrants contribute greatly to American society and the economy, and the president’s rhetoric around immigration is not rooted in truth.
“The truth of the matter is we Mississippians are smart enough to realize that there is a humane and civil way that respects families, that protects our communities, to address our immigration issues,” she said.
The crackdown in Louisiana and Mississippi is part of the Trump administration’s larger campaign of mass deportations, which O’Beirne described as a campaign of intimidation and harassment against immigrant communities in Mississippi.
Among the group was Paula Merchant, a U.S. Army veteran and former English as a Second Language teacher who founded Adelante, which works with the immigrant community in Jackson and helped organize the protest.
Her experience as an immigrant inspired Merchant to establish the group. She believes the current immigration system is broken and the focus should be on fixing it rather than deporting people. 
“They’re not going to work,” she said of the immigrants. “The kids are not going to school, and they don’t want to separate from one another because they don’t know if they’re going to be taken.”
Merchant was born in Mexico to a Mexican mother and an American father. She and her mother moved to the U.S. when she was 4 after her father died. Her parents never married, making it difficult to prove her father was biologically related to her. Merchant said this meant she and her mother had to take the standard immigration process, which was long and expensive. 
She said she didn’t get a green card until she was 14, and didn’t become a naturalized citizen until she was 28.
“Irregardless how you feel, they’re still your brothers and sisters,” she said. “They’re humans, you should want for them what you have for yourself.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/03123422/3X0A6452.jpg,,,2025-12-03 19:57:08.908965

Idaho mental health clinics sue state over Medicaid contractor’s cuts

The decision clears a legal hurdle for an Idaho Medicaid contractor, Magellan of Idaho, to proceed with its plan to cut specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine settings. The cut took effect Monday, Magellan spokesperson Kristen Durocher told the Idaho Capital Sun in a statement.
Since the contractor announced the decision — which is part of a series of cuts meant to help the state avoid a budget deficit — mental health providers and even the Idaho Sheriffs’ Association have warned that the cuts could risk public safety, as people with severe mental illness lose accessible treatment through the program. In attempts to block the cuts, some mental health clinics and patients on the program sued the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and top state health officials.

Idaho 4th District Judge Derrick O’Neill on Wednesday denied a request by four mental health clinics to pause the cuts, saying he didn’t believe he’d received enough information to suggest their case would succeed on its legal merits.
“Appreciating the fact that everybody involved is burdened by a difficult reality, I do not believe there is sufficient evidence before the court at this time to upset that reality,” the judge said at a Wednesday court hearing.
Federal judge Amanda Brailsford on Monday denied patients’ request for a temporary restraining order that could have required the state to continue offering the service.
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare could not be immediately reached for comment. Magellan is a private company that runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits.



 How to submit public comments on the Idaho Medicaid mental health cuts

On Nov. 26, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare notified Tribal representatives about planned Idaho Medicaid mental health service cuts by a private contractor, Magellan of Idaho. 
Tribal representatives can submit public comments by Dec. 26 via email to MCPT@dhw.idaho.gov. 



 Patients will go to homeless shelters, jails, if program is cut, mental health clinics say

The clinics asked the state court to pause Magellan’s plan to end the program, called Assertive Community Treatment, until the cuts’ legality is determined. An attorney for the clinics, Preston Carter of Givens Pursley, argued that the state health agency didn’t adequately notify providers about the cuts. Last week, the Department of Health and Welfare published a notice of the cuts and announced public comment opportunities for Tribal representatives, weeks after Magellan first announced the cuts in late October.

“The patients will disperse among homeless shelters, in jail, in institutions, in hospitalizations, and the providers will not be able to relocate them because of the characteristics of this population,” Carter told the judge Wednesday. “And the trust that has been built up between providers and their patients will evaporate and will be very difficult, if not impossible, to reestablish.”
An attorney for the Department of Health and Welfare, Deputy Attorney General Anita Moore, said the agency has few options for cuts because many Medicaid services are protected by federal and state law. But if the department’s cuts were delayed, she said future cuts could be more drastic. 
“It’s tempting to look at the Department of Health and Welfare as a bunch of faceless bureaucrats, heartless and cold, just cutting stuff left and right just because. …. That’s a cartoonish depiction or idea of how the department operates,” she told the judge Wednesday. “A lot of careful deliberation of what services have to be given priority over others or which amongst its myriad of services can be paired back with the least amount of negative impact on beneficiaries, or with the least amount of ripple effect across services, goes into these decisions.”
The judge, O’Neill, said later in the case attorneys will debate whether the department adequately notified the public about the cuts.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/teenmentalhealth.jpeg,,,2025-12-03 19:57:08.908965

A district court judge on Tuesday ruled in favor of the Northwest Landowners Association in its suit against the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which approved a permit for underground storage for carbon pipeline developer Summit Carbon Solutions. 
The landowner group successfully challenged a law that can force landowners to allow storage beneath their property. Northeast Judicial District Judge Anthony Swain Benson ruled the law allows a government-authorized taking of property without an avenue for “just” compensation determined by a jury.

Summit’s project would transport greenhouse gas emissions from ethanol plants in five states, including Tharaldson Ethanol near Casselton, to the sequestration site. 
The lawsuit isn’t specific to Summit, but seems likely to have implications for the project.
In a statement, Summit Carbon Solutions said it is reviewing the court decision and evaluating its options. 
Summit said the North Dakota storage area “remains an important long-term asset for the project and our partners, including the State of North Dakota, our ethanol plant customers, and the communities we serve.” 
The ruling also could impact the coal and oil and gas industries.

Minnkota Power Cooperative has been working to develop Project Tundra, which would capture carbon from a coal-fired power plant near Center for underground storage. 
The Energy and Environmental Research Center in Grand Forks, has worked on both the Summit and Minnkota projects. 
“It puts a shadow on projects and the projects underway,” John Harju, EERC’s vice president for strategic partnerships said of the ruling Wednesday. 
The law that was challenged requires landowners to allow carbon dioxide storage beneath their property if at least 60% of the affected landowners agree to the project. 
About 92% of landowners in Summit’s storage area  in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties had chosen to participate in the project when the Industrial Commission approved the storage permit last year.
The Dakota Resource Council, an environment group, said the ruling strengthens the position of landowners. 
“We see it as a major win for family farmers, ranchers, and rural landowners who have been standing up to CO2 pipelines and storage projects,” the group said in an email. 
Owen Anderson, an energy law scholar who began his career in North Dakota, was surprised by the decision. He’s not aware of any courts in other states that have reached a similar conclusion and said the decision, if upheld, opens the door to challenges of other pore space uses such as saltwater disposal, which could impact the oil and gas industry. 
“I would assume the state would appeal this,” Anderson said. “It’s a key case, no question about that.”
North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said Tuesday his office was still evaluating next steps.
National leader
North Dakota has been a leader in carbon capture and storage. It was the first state to be granted primacy in permitting Class VI injection wells, the kind of well needed for CO2 storage. Previously, all permitting had been done at the federal level. 
North Dakota has two ethanol plants injecting carbon underground, Gevo’s site near Richardton, formerly Red Trail Energy, and Blue Flint Ethanol at Underwood.
A representative of Colorado-based Gevo said the company is glad to work with the local community and landowners.
“We believe in fair compensation for our landowner partners and this has not been an issue for us in Richardton, nor do we expect it to be an issue in the future,” Gevo said in a statement.
Basin Electric Power Cooperative also operates a carbon storage operation at the Great Plains Synfuels Plant near Beulah. 
Representatives from Minnkota did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. Basin Electric did not provide a statement Wednesday. An official with Blue Flint declined to comment.
Legislature’s role
The decision creates uncertainty around how carbon capture projects could move forward and whether the Legislature will need to take further action.
Sen. Dale Patten, R-Watford City, is one of the legislative branch’s biggest proponents of carbon sequestration. He’s not sure what the next step will be if the district court ruling isn’t overturned.
“If the Supreme Court upholds the decision, what would be the alternative language that we could use?” Patten said. “I don’t know.”

Pore space, unlike surface land, cannot be fenced off. Carbon dioxide injected into underground pore space will migrate horizontally without regard for property lines on the surface. 
“This concept lets a small minority of pore space owners, even just one owner, dictate to the majority of owners — the majority have property rights as well,” Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said in a statement Wednesday.
Patten fears the court’s decision will prevent landowners from realizing the value of their pore space. 
“You cannot realize that value individually very effectively,” Patten said. “You have to realize it collectively.”

Troy Coons, chair of the Northwest Landowners Association that challenged the law in court, said a company could use good business practices and work with landowners to lease 100% of the pore space in a project area. If it is a public utility using the pore space for a public use, and they can’t lease 100% of the pore space, they have the option to use eminent domain. 
He does not think the Legislature should step in again. 
“I say they need to stay out of it,” Coons said. “They seem to have a real hard time allowing the organic, natural path of business to happen.”
He and the association’s attorney, Derrick Braaten, pointed out oil and gas companies in the Bakken routinely manage to work with landowners every day.
“It’s possible,” Braaten said. “It’s been done and it is being done.”

Hall worked in the Twin Falls Police Department and served in the U.S. Marine Corps, according to a news release by the governor’s office.
“I am honored and humbled to be selected by Governor Little to represent my Twin Falls community in the Idaho legislature,” Hall said in a statement. “I deeply appreciate the opportunity to serve my fellow Idahoans as we work to address critical issues across state government.”
Hall is set to serve in the Legislature until Nov. 30, 2026, which is the rest of Clow’s term. Hall plans to run for Clow’s seat in 2026, the Twin Falls Times-News reported.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Politicians, philanthropists and an excited public are celebrating the opening of the Montana Heritage Center, a $107 million project showcase of the state’s history.
During a ceremony Tuesday, Gov. Greg Gianforte called it a “world class facility,” and its historical exhibits and art galleries would not be out of place at major museums in Chicago, San Francisco or New York.
“This accomplishment is remarkable and highlights the generosity and the love that Montanans have for Montana,” Gianforte said.
Tuesday’s ribbon-cutting ceremony was the result of decades of work from many Montanans who wanted to help preserve the state’s history. A 70,000-square-foot addition was added to the building and an existing 90,000 square foot area was remodeled. 
The Homeland Gallery will likely become a destination for visitors to the state capitol, taking them through Montana’s rich history all the way back to the Ice Age. The space has exhibits from the state’s Indigenous peoples, with artifacts and deep explanations of nuanced history.
“If you think about it, 160 years ago, a number of pioneers met in Virginia City to talk about the process of starting to collect and preserve and honor the history of this area, and to be sure, it didn’t start with them, right?” Tim Fox, board president of the Montana Historical Society, said. “Our indigenous peoples were the first humans here, and our history goes back way beyond the discovery of gold, copper or silver.”
As visitors walk through that section, they’re treated to sounds that change as they move through the gallery. There’s interactive exhibits, things to watch and plenty to read. There’s also a smudge room, gardens, paths and gathering areas outside, as well as a cafe and event space.	
Montana Heritage Center Hours:
– M-W & F: 9am-5pm
– Thursday: 9am-6:30pm
– Saturday: 10am-5pm
– Sunday: 12pm-5pm
• Gift Shop Hours:
– M-W & F-Sat: 10am-5pm
– Thursday: 10am-6:30pm
– Sunday: 1pm-5pm
• Norm’s Café Hours: To be determined.
• Holidays: Open 7 days a week, year round, except for Christmas day and Thanksgiving day.


The Charlie M. Russell Gallery also houses an extensive collection of work from the famed western artist. With low light, some incredible frames and even a sitting area, it is a home for many paintings that had been in storage.
There’s also another rotating gallery that will house additional exhibits. Only about 10% of the total collection is on display, museum officials said.

And in the Homeland Gallery, there’s even a covered wagon, a simulation of going down a Butte mineshaft and an exhibit on where the nuclear missiles in Montana are.
“One of the goals that we’ve had in this gallery is to make sure that there are lots of different stories and lots of different perspectives presented,” Amanda Streeter Trum, head of curatorial with the Montana Historical Society, said. “History is not just told from one group’s point of view. And so we’ve got lots of stories and lots of people represented here, as it should be.”
The final $60 million for constructing the facilities was privately funded. The Dennis and Phyllis Washington Foundation, Norm Asbjornson, and BNSF Railway together contributed more than $40 million, according to a release from the governor’s office.
Gianforte helped fundraise after taking office, he said at the ceremony. He was supportive of the project, but wanted cost overruns to be paid for by private donations.
“I called every major business in the state … telling them about our plans and asking them for support,” Gianforte said. “Many of you got those calls and are here today.”
Hundreds of people filled the main atrium of the building for the ceremony and then were able to wander the facility after.

Gianforte also announced about $3.5 million had been donated toward an endowment to support Montana students getting to experience the museum. The goal, Gianforte said, is that every student in the state gets a tour the year they study the state’s history. 
The target for the endowment is $10 million.
Some facilities and parts of the center are still under construction and a full grand opening is planned for next summer.
“I hope that we can be a space where we can talk about difficult things and present challenging topics in addition to the fun, joyous topics as well,” Streeter Trum said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/HeritageCenter1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-03 19:57:08.908965

The products were widely distributed and sold by Chedrauui USA, Inc. – which owns grocery store chains El Super and Smart & Final – throughout store locations in Arizona, California, and Nevada under various titles including “S&C Sanitizer”, “S&C Disinfectant”, “Perfect Professional Advanced Multi-Surface Sanitizer” and “Prinex Sanysol.”
“Unregistered disinfectants can not only be ineffective, but can contain dangerous ingredients,” said EPA Pacific Southwest Region Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division Director Amy Miller. “Companies have a responsibility to protect their customers from illegal, potentially harmful disinfectant products, and can do so by making sure they are registered with EPA.”
In a release issued Tuesday, the EPA said their findings were based on inspections performed by the federal agency and California Department of Pesticide Regulation in 2021. 
An investigation at an El Super store in Santa Ana, California found that two of the pesticides being sold – “S&C Sanitizer” and “S&C Disinfectant” – contained ternary ammonia, a product with high toxicity that requires a “danger” label.
That store location and a Smart & Final in Hayward, California also sold two products – “Prinex Sanysol” and “Perfect Professional Advanced Multi-Surface Sanitizer” – that made unverified statements about their effectiveness at killing germs and other microorganisms, according to an investigation by the EPA.
Further investigation revealed that the grocery store chains widely distributed these disinfectants on numerous occasions to store locations throughout Arizona, California, and Nevada. The EPA found Smart & Final distributed the unregistered pesticide “Perfect Professional Advanced Multi-Surface Sanitizer” on at least 53 occasions.
The EPA stated the unregistered disinfectants were removed from stores as a result of the investigation and that Smart & Final and parent-company Chedraui confirmed the products are no longer being distributed to or sold in their stores.
The distribution or sale of unregistered and misbranded disinfectants and other pesticide products is a violation of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The federal pesticide law requires disinfectants be registered with the EPA.
Unregistered products can be harmful to human health and the environment, and may not be effective against the spread of germs. Registration and labeling ensures pesticide and disinfectant products are tested in accordance with specific guidelines and can be safely used for their intended purposes.The most up-to-date list of EPA-registered disinfectant products can be found on the agency’s website.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/elsupersmart-1024x562.jpg,,,2025-12-03 19:57:08.908965

Their homecoming was no exception.,"Homecoming remains an important enough tradition in the Mississippi Delta that the violence that happened in Leland and Rolling Fork in October didn’t diminish the crowds. Relatives still traveled home. Dozens still set up grills and canopies at games. Mississippi Today produced a collection of stories of homecoming events in the Delta, where traditions have evolved over time.
CLARKSDALE — At the end of the first quarter, the Clarksdale High Wildcats were down by 8. 
Mosquitos bit into the ankles of players and spectators. Cheerleaders and majorettes rallied for a new routine in tune to the school band’s thumping brass bass. Coaching assistants white-knuckled clipboards as superfans on the sidelines winced at an interception by the visiting Ripley High School Tigers. 
Doubt crept in between sips of homemade lemonade and chips scooped into spicy cheese dip, manifesting itself in side-long glances, short prayers and yelps of support for quarterback Tommie Magsby. A murmur passed through the crowd in Clarksdale on a balmy 76 degree night: Would the Wildcats lose the coveted homecoming game?
The Wildcats have long produced stars and dominated football statewide. The NFL has recruited 17 Clarksdale players, the second-highest number of any Mississippi high school. This season, Clarksdale has only lost to perennial rival South Panola High School. Clarksdale has won two division championships in the last decade. At last year’s homecoming, the Wildcats lost by a single touchdown to Southaven High during a game some fans described as a heart breaker and nail biter.

Under the harsh stadium lights and amid the roar of an antsy marching band, forceful head coach Curtis Kemp gathered the team on the sidelines with at least four assistant coaches in tow. 
He pulled his tight end and wide receiver into the huddle. Kemp exhorted them all to “run the ball,” execute the plays they practiced in the near equatorial heat of summer, be physical, and in the words of one of his assistants, get the smell and “homecoming feel” out of your mind. 
“You don’t want to lose the homecoming game,” Kemp said.
Visiting Green Bay Packers offensive lineman and former Wildcat Elgton Jenkins was in the audience. So were family and friends.
Even before kickoff, the aroma of rib tips wafted from smoker to serving plate, from tailgate to tent. Near the back fence, a truck let down a neon green shaved-ice hut from its trailer. Teachers folded programs.
‘You feel connected to something bigger’
When Tomika Bates first arrived in her hometown, she made sure to visit Rice Bowl, the greasy spoon Chinese spot that has her favorite shrimp. She and her high school friend group — all from the class of 2001 — missed other comforts of home such as Double Quick chicken and time with family.
Most of Bates’ friend group now live in the suburbs of Memphis or Jackson and in Nashville. They are bankers, morticians, instructional coaches at schools and principals. But today, in matching royal blue jerseys decorated with red iron-on patches, they are Wildcat superfans. 
“I’m here for a good time,” Bates said. “We all look forward to seeing old friends, rehashing old memories, and creating new ones year after year.”
Dennis Jackson, a multimedia teacher at Clarksdale’s vocational school and a Wildcat alum, stood by the 50-yard line during much of the game. He congratulated his students as they traded places by the bench between plays.
Jackson played football at Clarksdale while serving in the Marines and for an Australian football team. He was based in Wollongong, Australia, for much of his life between leaving the military and recently returning home. He also spent time as an actor in Hollywood.
“You get to know your home more when you’re far away from it,” Jackson said. “People know us from out there.”
Clarksdale High homecoming court candidates greet their family members by the bleachers at school’s homecoming game on Oct. 3, 2025.
He remembers when he first left Clarksdale at 20.
It was near noon on a weekday in January in the late 1980s. Jackson was in the 900 block of Lower Brickyard, a Clarksdale neighborhood by McKinley Street, sitting across from his grandmother at her dining room table. They were enjoying a send-off meal of pinto beans and some of his other favorite dishes. She smiled at him.
When Jackson returned to Clarksdale two years ago, he hardly recognized his hometown with its many empty lots and closed storefronts. He looked around the streets for neighborhood kids playing outside but encountered an eerie quiet. 
“It was the depopulation that you can see most,” Jackson said.
At Walmart, he began to feel at home. He ran into an old teacher and some former neighbors. One offered him a job at the school district. He is now enjoying his second year as a multimedia instructor at the vocational school.
After years as a retired athlete, he has become a Wildcat superfan again.
“It’s always been a tradition, you know, running into friends, getting a chance to tell a few lies,” Jackson said of homecoming night. “You feel connected to something bigger.”
‘I gotta be there’
By the second quarter of the homecoming game, Clarksdale’s fortunes had turned. The Wildcats were up by a touchdown. The team was playing with renewed vigor.

Magsby, the team’s star player, intercepted the ball near the 40-yard line. The audience was electric. Kemp led Magsby and his teammates to the field house as the buzzer sounded for halftime.
Kemp used the moment to impart wisdom and a winning strategy.
“I just told ’em it was going to be a long practice next week if we couldn’t get it done,” he said about the homecoming victory in a post-game interview.
The homecoming court was announced during halftime. Escorts led candidates across the muddy field. The students’ families descended from the bleachers to get a closer look.
One contestant, Erin England, and her brother carried a life-size portrait of her late father. The other contestants, in flowing gowns and hoop skirts, batted away bugs with white satin gloves and pushed curls behind bedazzled earlobes.
“Our next senior maid enjoys playing sports and spending time with friends. She loves going shopping and spending her mom’s money,” the announcer declared, describing England. “Her favorite Bible verse is Psalms 28:7: ‘The Lord is my strength and shield. I trust him with all my heart.’”
Mary Miller, the mother of quarterback and homecoming king Tommie Magsby, beamed from the stands during the third quarter. She held up a posterboard with his jersey number until the last play.
“I know his plays. I know when he’s going to run it. And each time, it’s a touchdown,” Miller said. “It’s like I know what he’s gonna do before he does it. He’s generous with the ball, and he’s got vision. You can’t teach people that.”

Since Magsby’s peewee league days, Miller has driven him to practices and made sure he had his water bottle and cleats. She remembers his first tackle and early victories. Even as a child, he spoke of little else than football.
In a recent game against Cleveland Central, Magsby ran a 90-yard touchdown. He might have scored five touchdowns if not for an opposing player tugging on his face mask. Coahoma Community College has offered him a football scholarship.
“I’ll miss seeing how good he plays out there,” Miller said. “Now, I work out of town. I have to put in time to make sure that I’m here. If I miss a game, it just does something to me. I gotta be there because that’s my son on the field. I want to let him know that he does have support and we follow him wherever he goes.”
Taking home the win
The locker room had a sour stench by the homecoming game’s triumphant conclusion: 43-14. Shoeless players in muddied pants blasted music from speakers. Admirers and superfans lingered just outside where equipment was being pulled in from the field.
Kemp reclined in his office beside a white board covered with Xs, Os and initials.
“As a coach, you really have to tamp it down,” he said with a wide smile, hardly able to contain his glee.
It was his students’ night, not his.
Kemp graduated from Clarksdale High in 1999 and became head coach three years ago. He’d worked as Coahoma County High School’s head coach for three years. He had wanted the job for much of his coaching career.
“Clarksdale has been a good team for some time,” he said.

More than developing star players and bringing home wins, Kemp said he is mostly in it for the mentorship.
If you’re an upstanding guy, the football part will work itself out, he said. He just asks for commitment and accountability.
The young men Kemp coaches sometimes remind him of a time when he was young, and shared NFL dreams with his teammates.
One of his fondest memories was playing during the 1999 homecoming football game. The Wildcats were playing Greenville’s T.L. Weston High School. The lights were bright and the fans were loud. Kemp was on the field with his best friends. The Wildcats had a handful of injured players and weren’t favored to win.
Kemp scored four touchdowns. The last one sealed Clarksdale’s win, and players and fans mobbed him at game’s end.
His wildest dreams seemed within reach.
“I wanted to go pro,” Kemp said. “Most players won’t. But if I could see them doing something, taking care of their families and doing stuff around town as young men, I’m fine.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/26115933/MG_8645-8.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

“You can apply tariffs on whoever you want, but if you want to rub it in somebody's face and nose, you're going to get reactions like this,” Tom Kavet said of the president’s policies toward Canada.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘A costly unforced error’: Vermont Legislature’s top economist slams Trump’s trade war.","MONTPELIER — The Vermont Legislature’s top economist called President Donald Trump’s trade war with Canada and Trump’s disparaging rhetoric toward the country a “costly unforced error” that is putting pressure on the state’s budget at an already challenging time.
Tom Kavet was speaking to members of the Vermont House and Senate at a briefing Wednesday in Montpelier on some of the major issues legislators will face when they reconvene for the 2026 legislative session, which starts the second week of January.
Kavet said a drop in visitors from Canada this year compared to years past — something that is a direct result of Trump’s actions — has meant less tax revenue is being collected from tourists to support state services. That’s likely to make it harder for legislative leaders, working with Gov. Phil Scott’s administration, to balance the books when they start developing a new state budget next month, Kavet said. 
At the same time, top legislators have already pointed to how rising costs at home and shrinking federal support for key social services could force them to trim other programs and initiatives that residents rely on, though they have not yet proposed specific cuts.
Traffic at Vermont’s welcome and visitor centers was down 9% between January and mid-November 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, according to data Kavet presented Wednesday. Most of those centers are situated on or near Interstates 89 and 91.
At the centers located closest to Canada — in Alburgh and Derby Line — the drop between those time periods was far higher, about 36%, data shows. At centers located slightly farther south, including in Georgia and Lyndonville, the drop was about 18%.
Meanwhile, data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows that traffic into the U.S. at border crossings in Vermont fell below 2024 levels immediately after Trump took office in January 2025, and has remained below 2024 levels every month since.
In October 2025, cross-border traffic — which includes cars, trucks, pedestrians, and airplanes — was down about 22% compared to October 2024, federal data shows.

Kavet called the decline in cross-border visitors this year “needless.” 
Kavet is the president and co-founder of a Williamstown consulting firm that provides fiscal analyses guiding Vermont’s state budget-building process each year.
“I say needless just because you can apply tariffs on whoever you want, but if you want to rub it in somebody’s face and nose, you’re going to get reactions like this,” he said. “And it just doesn’t help when it comes to revenue that we’re wanting — and needing.”
The decline in traffic comes as Vermont has brought in less tax revenue from hotel room rentals and purchases at restaurants and bars than the state was expecting, Kavet said.
Meals and rooms tax revenue landed about 2% below October targets, according to the latest data from the state Agency of Administration. The amount the state put into its education fund from that same tax was about 4% below officials’ targets, according to the data.
Meanwhile, between January and the end of October 2025, the data shows meals and rooms tax collections were about 1% lower than they were over the first 10 months of 2024.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderA key advisory panel that oversees nationwide vaccine recommendations may vote to restrict access to hepatitis B immunizations for newborns and reconsider recommendations for a wide variety of other childhood vaccines when it is scheduled to meet this week at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
The committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a plethora of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. The recommendations play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible those immunizations are to the public.
CDC panel abandons, for now, more controversial vaccine proposals but casts doubt on safety

According to a draft agenda posted to the CDC’s website, the committee plans to discuss the current childhood and adolescent immunization schedule, which includes vaccines against diseases like polio, diphtheria, tetanus, and RSV. They will also vote on new recommendations around hepatitis B, an incurable viral infection that attacks the liver.
The current three-dose series for hepatitis B includes one vaccine administered to infants within 24 hours of birth, and subsequent booster shots given one month and six months after the initial dose. ACIP has been recommending a hepatitis B vaccine for all infants since 1991, which resulted in a 99% drop in serious infections between 1990 and 2019.
A resolution seeking to alter current CDC recommendations around hepatitis B vaccines for newborn children was initially scheduled for September’s meeting, but was later postponed.
If ACIP members choose to implement the changes, official CDC guidelines may recommend that pediatricians delay administering the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until at least 30 days after birth for all children whose mothers test negative for the disease.
Chari Cohen, who serves as president of the Hepatitis B Foundation, said she was deeply concerned about the push to alter the childhood vaccine schedule, arguing that efforts to delay doctors from administering the hepatitis B vaccine to newborns are rooted in misinformation.
“There’s no scientific argument that one could really make to get rid of the vaccine,” she said. “There’s been no new data published, no scientific, rigorous data that would change anyone’s mind.”
And while private health insurance plans may elect to continue covering the hepatitis B vaccine, Cohen says she worries about vaccine access for children enrolled in Medicaid or the Vaccines for Children program, which provides free immunizations to children who are uninsured or underinsured.
Ahead of the panel’s vote, states like Massachusetts and Rhode Island have preemptively announced that they will continue to provide access to the hepatitis B vaccines for newborns, regardless of what the CDC panel decides. 
However, Georgia’s state government has taken a different approach. The state’s Department of Public Health said it “will monitor updates and federal guidance on administering the hepatitis B vaccine and assess how these changes may affect the health of Georgia’s newborns,” according to a statement from Nancy Nydam Shirek, the department’s communications director.
Shakeups at the HHS
The panel’s December meeting is its first since Trump promoted a scientifically unsupported link between Tylenol and autism, more than 600 CDC workers were fired from the CDC, a prominent vaccine skeptic was appointed to the second-highest office at the CDC and U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. instructed the CDC to update its website to display unproven claims linking vaccines to autism.
A CDC page on vaccine safety now states that “studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism,” though a small disclaimer at the bottom of the page notes that the header stating “vaccines do not cause autism” has not been removed due to an agreement with U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who heads the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
Cassidy, a doctor, cast the deciding vote to confirm Kennedy as health secretary on the condition that Kennedy “maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes.” Kennedy later backtracked on that promise, firing all 17 previous members of the committee and replacing them with a slate of hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics.

Since the panel’s most recent meeting in September, former ACIP Chair Martin Kulldorff — a doctor and former Harvard Medical School professor who is known for his opposition to vaccine mandates — has been appointed to another position within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where he will serve as a key advisor to Kennedy. 
Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a Hawaii-based pediatric cardiologist and senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance, will serve as the committee’s new chair, according to a press release from the HHS.

Fewer than half of Montana students in grades 3 through 8 are at or above grade-level proficiency standards in language arts and math. 
That’s according to the first statewide results of a new standardized assessment implemented during the last school year. 
The Office of Public Instruction released the statewide scores of the Montana Aligned to Standards Through-Year Assessment, or MAST, before the Thanksgiving holidays. State superintendent Susie Hedalen said while OPI has work to do training teachers on administering the test and early data shows a need to improve student outcomes, the format has been well received by students and offers usable data for educators. 
Montana’s average of students who tested at or above proficiency levels for their grade was 43.1% in language arts, and 36.9% in math. 
While OPI says that the new testing format precludes direct comparisons from previous years, the scores are similar to those from the 2021-22 school year, which showed 46.1% and 36.5% of students proficient in language and math respectively following a well-reported slump in student achievement attributed to COVID-19’s impact on education. 
“In literacy we are higher than in math. That’s a trend we’ve seen for many years,” Hedalen told the Daily Montanan in an interview. “I look at this as really important data for us to make data-driven decisions. 
Hedalen, a Republican, said she’s excited that the new MAST format allowed educators to receive feedback on student outcomes quickly.
MAST was implemented statewide during the 2024-2025 school year after piloting the test for two years under former state Superintendent Elsie Arntzen. 
As opposed to previous standardized testing formats, MAST involves “testlets,” smaller math and English Language Arts tests that take place during four testing periods in the school year, creating a “through-year assessment model.”
The goal is to offer more immediate feedback to educators, students, parents and administrators by providing multiple data points to track progress and alter curriculum or teaching strategies throughout the year to benefit students. 

But it may take some time for educators to smoothly integrate the new testing regimen in classrooms. 
A survey, shared with the Board of Public Education during the summer, collected responses from 246 teachers across the state and showed that while the more frequent but shorter test format helped engage students and provide feedback, some teachers found they tested topics not covered in classes and they seemed “irrelevant to instruction.”
According to the survey, 72.8% of teachers felt “unable to schedule testlets in a way that aligns with their syllabus,” and a vast majority reported insufficient training in the new protocol. 
Hedalen, elected in November 2024, said she had heard similar feedback from educators and administrators since she came into the position this year. 
“I believe this has been very challenging … coming from the field I felt that myself,” Hedalen said. “Educators needed more professional development. We didn’t get an understanding of the new assessments to a broad enough audience. We needed to do more with school leaders and educators”
“There’s lots of work to back up, make sure we’re on the same page, schedule testlets, and align with curriculum,” she said. “And then teachers have the data on which students are connecting on the standards, and which students are reaching proficiency and which ones might need more support.”
The survey conducted last school year included responses from more than 35,000 students, and a majority reported preferring the distributed assessment format over a single end-of-year exam, and most reported feeling positively about how the testlets helped their learning outcomes. 
Hedalen said that the first round of MAST scores should be taken with a grain of salt given it’s the first year, and that when she looks at the bigger picture of Montana students across all grade levels and compared to national standards, students are doing comparatively better. 
She said that comparing national testing data shows that Montana students have had one of the highest bounce-back rates from COVID-era scores. Scores from 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress assessments show Montana 8th graders ranking 10th in math proficiency and 4th in reading proficiency compared to all states.  
In addition, Hedalen said high school ACT scores this year showed the highest language arts proficiency for Montana students since the test was adopted in the state, and she pointed to data coming in from new early literacy programs which show promising trends for younger students. 
“Those are all exciting data points to me, but I completely acknowledge we have work to do,” she said. “It is really great we have a new, more accurate baseline on how students are doing in language arts and mathematics according to our state standards, and we’re going to work to provide students what they need to get college and career ready, especially with math.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-200443854-001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

The $4.7 million project has been in the works for about three years, said Peggy Allen, president of the Upper Valley Agricultural Association.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published in Valley News on Nov. 28, 2025.
NORWICH — The town has granted permission to a nonprofit to build a permanent all-season structure for the Norwich Farmer’s Market on a property across Route 5 from the market’s current location.
The Norwich Development Review Board approved the nonprofit’s plans to develop about 9.5 acres of a 35-acre property it plans to purchase. 
The project includes constructing a 7,500-square-foot building in the shape of a large barn, an outdoor vendor area, a picnic area and parking, according to the board’s written decision, filed on Nov. 13.
The Upper Valley Agricultural Association, a nonprofit created in 2024 “with the primary intent of trying to find a permanent home for the market,” proposed the project, association President Peggy Allen said at a mid-October Development Review Board hearing. A group has been working on the $4.7 million project for about three years, she said.
The nonprofit began eyeing the vacant property for the project in summer 2024 and since then has finalized a purchase-and-sale agreement with the out-of-state landowner, Rose Z Dyke Trust in care of Judith Currier of Leesburg, Va.
Allen declined to say when the sale will close, although she did say it will be “soon” and is “on schedule.”
The new property sits across the road from the current summer market location on Route 5 in Norwich. The Norwich Farmers Market leases the current summer market site from the Hanover Consumer Cooperative Society and holds its winter market days in Tracy Hall.

In addition to creating a permanent home for the market, the project aims to reduce traffic congestion, parking and capacity issues with the winter market at Tracy Hall. Also, the outdoor market’s current site sits below Route 5 and is prone to flooding in heavy rain.
One of the biggest challenges with the current summer market location is parking, which often fills up early in the morning and overflows into the parking lot for Fogg’s Lumber and Hardware next door.
Because the current parking lot has no lined spaces, it is difficult to say how many cars come to the weekly market, Allen said. On one Saturday in August, she counted 850 cars between when the first customers arrived to get parking before 9 a.m., and 1 p.m. when the market wraps up for the day, she said.
The market runs 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. every Saturday from May through October and twice a month on Saturdays from November to April.
There are no current plans to expand market hours, but they “certainly” would not be reduced and can be adjusted in the future if that would help the market “thrive,” Allen said Monday.
The new property will have 270 parking spaces.

Under the proposed plan, the summer farmers market would be hosted mostly in the outdoor vendor area, but the building would have large garage doors that could be opened to host some vendors inside.
“If we’re going to build this kind of building it’s ridiculous for it to only be utilized for a winter market,” Allen said.
In the winter, the market would be inside the building with some vendors set up under an overhanging roof around the outside of the building.
In addition to hosting the weekly market in the building, the nonprofit plans to host related activities, classes and events and to rent the facility out for community events. This will hopefully help to cover operating costs.
Allen said she does not know what the market is currently paying in rent, but said the goal is to create an “easy transition” with similar expenses to the current market.

As a condition of development review board approval, the facility can be rented out only for “community use,” or events that are for the town, community or school groups or “gatherings that are intended for the benefit of the public.”
The nonprofit has raised $1 million as of last week, Allen said. The next phase is to raise another $3.7 million by the end of next year to cover the cost of the land, infrastructure and the building.
The nonprofit has started seeking money from local donors and is looking at other sources, including applying for a $1 million Northern Border Regional Commission catalyst grant.
As for water and sewer connections, the society has been in talks with Hartford about connecting to its municipal infrastructure.
The Hartford Selectboard unanimously approved moving forward with discussions about the water system at a July meeting, but said a feasibility study had to be completed first. At the time of the meeting, Allen said the market was prepared to move forward with the project even without Hartford’s infrastructure but that would be very challenging.
Members of the Hartford town staff are discussing with engineers for the project the work necessary to connect the building to the town’s infrastructure, Hartford Town Manager John Haverstock said Tuesday.
The Agricultural Association also has been in talks with Twin Pines Housing Trust about building affordable housing on the property, but Allen said that possibility is not part of the current proposal. If the project moves forward, the land will be subdivided and developed separately.
The review board approval this month marks another step forward for the project. This summer, the Norwich Planning Board cleared one hurdle by adjusting the town’s zoning code to create a definition for open-air markets.
The nonprofit also has to secure an Act 250 permit from the state before it can move ahead with the development. The nonprofit has not yet filed a permit application, but it has taken some “proactive” steps such as completing a survey for indigenous artifacts on the land, Allen said. The survey found that there were no artifacts, clearing one of many steps that could have been a “brick wall” for the project.
The current plan is to break ground next spring and finish construction “before the snow falls in 2026,” but this timeline could shift depending on how fundraising goes, according to the application.

Since its opening in the summer of 2021, the suit alleges, “Resorts World has proven beyond question that it is unfit and incapable of operating a casino and hotel complex in compliance with the law” and the resort and its owner, Genting Berhad, “have proven their bona fides as a corrupt racketeering enterprise that operates with complete disregard of basic governance, corporate ethics and the law.”
The suit, filed by high-stakes gambler Robert Cipriani and businessman James Russell, alleges Resorts World “adopted a deliberate business strategy — premised on ignoring regulatory and legal restrictions — to maximize revenues by welcoming criminals at Resorts World to launder their illicit proceeds,” conducting not a legal casino business, but rather  “a criminal racketeering Enterprise.”
The suit alleges Chesnoff, formerly a partner in a lounge at Resorts World, enriched himself by “arranging and disguising investments in Resorts World business on behalf of known criminals and prohibited persons” with the approval of Sibella, who received “a piece of the action. Chesnoff invested in, participated in and owned business interests at Resorts World, which were used to facilitate money laundering, and other illegal activities.”
Resorts World did not respond to a request for comment. Chesnoff referred the Current to his attorney, James Pisanelli, who did not immediately respond. Sibella also did not respond. 
The suit is the second Cipriani has filed against Sibella and Resorts World.  District Judge Miranda Du last year dismissed a suit filed by Cipriani. In November, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case to Du, but without Sibella as a defendant. 
Sibella and Chesnoff, the new suit alleges, conspired to oust Cipriani from the casino in 2021 because he reported to law enforcement that Resorts World executives allowed unsavory individuals to gamble.    
“Working together, the Defendants arranged to ‘arrest’ Plaintiff Cipriani on false charges, and, for good measure, manufactured a separate criminal charge of cheating at blackjack, with the clear intent and message to silence and prevent Plaintiff Cipriani’s future Cooperation,” the suit asserts. 
The Nevada Current was first to report in 2023 that federal authorities from the Central District of California were investigating a variety of allegations involving Resorts World Las Vegas,  MGM Grand, and Sibella, who served as president of both hotels. 
Resorts World terminated Sibella weeks after the story’s publication for violating internal policy. 
Sibella later pleaded guilty in federal court to failing to comply with anti-money laundering laws while president of MGM Grand. He later lost his Nevada gaming license. 
Resorts World LV agreed to a $10.5 million fine imposed by state gaming regulators for allowing illegal bookmakers Mathew Bowyer and Damien LeForbes to gamble at the casino. The two, who lost close to $24 million at Resorts World LV, were permitted to gamble despite the lack of documented sources of income required by casinos. Both pleaded guilty to money laundering and illegal bookmaking.  
Federal prosecutors have yet to file charges or impose a long-anticipated fine against Resorts World. 
The episode could be a factor in Resorts World’s effort to expand a New York City electronic gambling facility into a full-service casino. 
The company was one of three applicants with casinos in Las Vegas to win a recommendation Monday from the New York State Gaming Facility Location Board to be licensed in that state. 
The New York board’s selection report noted that Resorts World, asked to disclose disciplinary actions within the past five years, omitted “violations resulting in fines at Resorts World Catskills, Resorts World Hudson Valley, and its current video lottery gaming facility at Aqueduct.” Resorts World “disclosed a settled disciplinary action involving (parent company) Genting Berhad – RW Las Vegas LLC without providing details.”
The New York board “views this lack of transparency as concerning and recommends that the Commission weigh this in its licensing evaluation.” 
“As a consequence of this deliberate scheme to operate as a racketeering enterprise, not as a legitimate business, Resorts World stands as one of the worst examples of a governance and compliance disaster in the casino industry,” the suit asserts. 
Russell alleges Resorts World, by allowing gambler Brandon Sattler to bet in the casino, is responsible for Russell’s inability to collect a $10 million loan he made to Sattler. Sattler, who owned an audio-visual company that performed work at Resorts World, is described in the lawsuit as “a member of the enterprise.” 
Sattler is currently serving prison time for defrauding investors, including Russell, out of $7 million.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/resorts-world_exterior_hero-expanded-1-e1723756620194-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

Unofficial results from Tuesday’s election show Jill Davidson won nearly 95% of the vote, besting Republican opponent Axel Brito for the council seat that represents the neighborhoods of Blackstone, College Hill and Wayland on the city’s East Side.
Davidson, who serves as the director of development and communications at the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council, won a four-way Democratic primary in November, securing her chance at a contest with Brito. 
Davidson said in a statement Wednesday that she’s “looking forward to working toward long-term success for our public schools, pushing for increased environmental resilience, fighting for a more affordable Providence for everyone, and more.”
There were 700 votes in all, according to the unofficial results. That included 491 ballots cast on election day, 148 mail ballots, and 61 early votes.
The special election was held to fill the seat left by Helen Anthony, who resigned in early September to continue her recovery from injuries received in a 2023 accident.
City Council Chief of Staff June Rose said on Wednesday that Davidson’s swearing-in is tentatively scheduled for Dec. 17, following the anticipated certification of the election results on Dec. 11. 
Brito, a 21-year old Brown University senior, did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

James Malone (D-Lancaster) addresses supporters at his reelection campaign launch at Lancaster Distilleries on Dec. 1, 2025 (Photo courtesy of the Malone campaign)It was an early sign of Democrats’ off-year electoral strength when James Malone, the former mayor of East Petersburg, defeated Lancaster County Commissioner Josh Parsons in a March special election. He became the first Democrat to represent Lancaster County in the chamber since 1889. 
His victory was only by a mere 529 votes, but it was a shock to many political observers who thought a Democrat would never stand a chance in the race. The win gained national attention.
On Monday evening, Malone (D-Lancaster) officially launched his reelection campaign at Lancaster Distilleries in Columbia Borough.
“In that special election, voters from this community came together to say they were ready for something different,” Malone said. “This campaign isn’t about the noise or the chaos. It’s about neighbors. It’s about making our communities thrive. It’s about making sure Lancaster continues to grow in a way that reflects our values and our future.”
For both Malone, and Pennsylvania Democrats more broadly, the campaign launch was something like planting a flag. Despite the unique circumstances that led to his victory, the state party says it’s ready to help him win again, and are even aiming for the longshot goal of flipping the entire Senate, which is currently controlled by a 27-23 Republican majority.

“We are prepared to marshal every resource necessary,” Pennsylvania Senate Democratic Campaign Committee (SDCC) Chair Vincent Hughes told the Capital-Star. “And anyone who doubts that need only look at the results of the special election in Senator Malone’s seat earlier this year. We won it before. We can win it again. The Trump Agenda carried out by Republicans in Pennsylvania is wildly unpopular and they will answer for that in 2026.”
The 36th District race is likely to be one of the most closely watched in Pennsylvania. While the district voted strongly for Trump, it also went for Gov. Josh Shapiro by a less than 1% margin in 2022, according to data shared by the SDCC.
The path to a Senate majority is narrow, and would likely rely on Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis presiding as a tie-breaker. But Democrats say they believe there are enough vulnerable Republicans up for election, and a favorable enough political environment, to eke out that victory.
Brittany Crampsie, a spokesperson with the SDCC, said along with holding onto Malone’s seat, Democrats are working to flip four other districts. They’d need to win all of them, without losing a single seat, to get a majority.
Specifically, they’re targeting the 6th District, which includes parts of Bucks County and is represented by Sen. Frank Farry (R-Bucks); the 16th District, which contains Lehigh County and is represented by Jarrett Coleman (R-Lehigh) ; the 24th District, which includes parts of Berks and Montgomery Counties and is represented by Tracy Pennycuick (R-Montgomery); and the 40th District which includes Monroe County, and is represented by Rosemary Brown (R-Monroe).
Democrats have reason to be optimistic. A number of Pennsylvania races in November’s municipal elections went their way. And a special election in a strongly Republican congressional district in Tennessee on Tuesday night has shown that momentum for the party remains strong. 
While Republican Matt Van Epps won by a comfortable margin, Democrat Aftyn Benn had a surprisingly strong showing.

The district swung from one that voted for Trump by a 22 point margin in 2024, to electing a Republican by only 9 points on Tuesday.
That’s a 13 point shift. All of the Senate Districts Democrats are targeting in 2026 voted for Trump by a smaller margin in 2024, according to data shared by Crampsie.
Republicans, however, see a chance in the 36th District to retake a seat and cement their majority.
“The biggest difference from the 2025 special to the 2026 election is voters will actually know who James Malone is now,” said Michael Straw, the communications director with the Pennsylvania Senate Republican Campaign Committee (SRCC). “They’ll be well-informed about his voting record that has harmed small businesses and doesn’t represent the voters of the 36th Senate district.”
Straw added that Democrats’ recent victories have all come in off-year elections, where turnout is typically low. Only 29% of eligible voters participated in the March special election, relative to the near-80% who voted in the 2024 presidential election, an environment which Republicans believed favored Trump.
But, Republicans aren’t relying on turnout alone.
James Markley, the communications director for the Pennsylvania GOP, began his job on the day of Malone’s special election victory in March.
“It was a whirlwind,” he said and laughed.
Asked how Republicans plan to combat Democrats’ electoral gains since the 2024 election, he said they plan to pull a page from Democrats’ playbook, nodding to their recent victory in the statewide Supreme Court retention elections, which saw voters elected to retain a liberal majority on the bench.
“We saw what happened this November on election day, and we’re gonna be working extremely hard to do what we can to cut into the margins, to do a much better job facilitating and using mail-in ballots,” Markley said.
But, embracing mail-in ballots may mean Pennsylvania Republicans will be fighting against the leader of their national party, President Donald Trump.
“I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, the social media site that he owns, in August. Trump has long opposed mail-in voting and claimed, without evidence, that the practice is rife with fraud.
Still, Markley is optimistic, especially looking at voter registration trends across the commonwealth. While Democrats have maintained higher numbers of registered voters in Pennsylvania for decades, Republicans are starting to catch up.
“The biggest Republican victory in my lifetime in Pennsylvania was 2024,” Markley said. “There’s gonna be some pushback and there’s gonna be some victories for the other side in the next few years. We’re definitely seeing that, but I think Republicans are doing a great job pushing back everywhere they can. If you look at the registration numbers, they’re trending Republicans’ way.”
Another source of confidence for Malone’s team is the sustained popularity of Gov. Josh Shapiro, who will be on the ballot in 2026. Shapiro won his gubernatorial election by a roughly 15 point spread in 2022 against pro-MAGA candidate Doug Mastriano. And his approval rating remains relatively high.
Despite Shapiro eking out a victory in the district, in 2024, voters overwhelmingly chose Trump to be the next president.
Sexton hopes to use Shapiro’s popularity to Malone’s advantage, saying they plan to run “along with the governor.”
“We have good relationships there to do so,” she added. “Plus, we now have the benefit of incumbency.”
A spokesperson for Shapiro’s own reelection campaign did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star about what that might entail, or how Shapiro plans to get involved. In 2024, however, Shapiro was a visible surrogate for both the Biden and Harris presidential campaigns. His PAC also backed all Democratic row office candidates, save one who opposed Shapiro’s vice presidential ambitions.
However, Shapiro faced a far-right and conspiracy-prone candidate, Doug Mastriano, in 2022, who lost by a 15% margin. Now, the leader in the Republican primary race to unseat him is Stacy Garrity, who won reelection as treasurer in 2024 by a larger margin than any statewide candidate.
“A unique individual”
Stella Sexton, Malone’s campaign manager and vice chair of the Lancaster County Democratic Committee, called Malone “a unique individual, who is really the perfect person to have won and to hold this seat.”
She cited his eight years as mayor in East Peterson, a position he wasn’t paid for, and his upbringing in Wyoming.
“He’s not a typical politician,” she said. “He’s from Wyoming and grew up hunting and fishing for subsistence. He knows how to farm. He knows the building trades and put himself through school as a roofer. This is a guy who knows the value of hard work and can relate to people. And people sense that and feel that.”
Sexton said their campaign will focus on issues close to home: affordability, rising housing costs, school funding and supporting first responders.

“People are very concerned about the cost of living,” she said. “People want to be able to live and work in areas where they feel like they have a good home, and they have a good school district to send their kids to. We hear that a lot.”
Malone, who has a background in software development, has also been working in Harrisburg on issues related to artificial intelligence safety. He authored an amendment to a bill regulating sexually explicit deepfake images of children, known as CSAM. He was motivated by an issue in a Lancaster County school where sexually explicit images of students were created with AI and shared without consent. The bill would require teachers and other authority figures to notify investigators when made aware of such images. It passed the Senate unanimously last month.
Malone’s victory in March was something like a proof of concept for the upcoming elections. With Trump’s popularity dwindling since entering office, Democrats believe they can win in unlikely places. Holding the seat, however, in an election year that is likely to have much higher turnout, may be the real test.
Though Sexton sees November’s municipal elections as proof that they can hold on. Manheim Township’s board of commissioners, for instance, is now controlled by Democrats.
“I think we did such a good job of talking about how that was a Trump 15+ District, which it was in 2024, that some folks think, ‘Oh my gosh. How are we gonna win that?’” Sexton said. 
But she pointed to Democrats’ victory in the district, with voters supporting the retention of Democratic judges on the Supreme Court.
“We’re seeing some increasing purpling here,” Sexton said. “One of the reasons for that, I think, is that the people in the district — both our candidates and our voters — were energized by [Malone’s] win, and saw a path for themselves, and really worked hard.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Malone-reelection-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

Zach Nunn has expressed support for a bipartisan deal to extend federal health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, Iowa’s other U.S. representatives said they are looking at other ways to pursue lower health care costs.
Enhanced ACA tax credits, introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic and extended through the Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden, are set to expire at the end of 2025. This lapse is expected to cause health care premiums to rise — and potentially double — for people receiving health coverage through ACA-established Health Insurance Marketplaces.
Extending these tax credits was the main issue Senate Democrats sought to address through the 43-day federal government shutdown. The government reopened with no action taken on ACA enhanced tax credits — though Senate Majority Leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote on the subject in December as part of the agreement to end the shutdown.

While a vote on ACA subsidies is expected in the Senate, no such agreement has been reached in the U.S. House — and talks appeared to have stalled with President Donald Trump’s administration on moving forward with a measure to extend these tax credits for a limited period of time.
While House GOP leadership has not moved forward with any commitments to address the issue, certain U.S. House Republicans — including Nunn, representing Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District — have proposed legislation to address the issue. Nunn cosponsored a bill called the “Fix It Act” on Nov. 25, a bipartisan measure that would extend the ACA premium tax credits by two years while also implementing new income limits and creating new penalties aimed at eliminating fraud in the system.
Nunn said in a statement provided to the Des Moines Register the bill was “the kind of bipartisan fix we need for short-term stability so that we can negotiate long-term reform.”
Katie Smith, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Nunn has changed his stance on ACA tax credits because he is expected to face a competitive reelection race in 2026.
“After trying to destroy it for years, Zach Nunn is waking up to the reality that his opposition to the Affordable Care Act will cost him his job next year,” Smith said in a statement. “No amount of phony rhetoric or lies will change that. The DCCC will not let so-called Republican moderates like Nunn trick voters after refusing to do a single thing to address the health care crisis they created.”
Nunn was the only member of Iowa’s all-GOP delegation to sign on to the bipartisan proposal — the three other Iowa Republicans in the U.S. House have not supported a measure to temporarily extend ACA tax credits.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who is also predicted to have a close race in the 2026 election season, said in a statement she supports lowering health care costs but the ACA enhanced premium tax credits are not the best way to address rising costs. Miller-Meeks, a physician, characterized the tax credits as a “corporate welfare bailout to the health insurance companies done by the Democrats in 2021” at a November town hall.
“The enhanced premium tax credits subsidize profitable insurance companies, but doesn’t lower premiums,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement. “I will continue to work with leadership and the administration to bring down health care costs for EVERYONE, not just a select few or profitable insurance companies.”
Miller-Meeks and Nunn are the two incumbent candidates running for Iowa’s U.S. House seats in 2026. U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson is running for the state’s U.S. Senate seat and U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra is running for governor in the upcoming election.
A spokesperson for Hinson said the congresswoman backs efforts to address health care inflation, but is more supportive of ideas on shifting funding to a Health Savings Accounts (HSA) model that directs money to individuals rather than health insurance companies.
“Health care is too expensive, no one should go broke trying to keep their family healthy,” Hinson said in a statement. “We should ensure working families — not just big health insurance companies — can directly access dollars meant for their health care needs and that no one can get away with profiting off seniors and sick Americans with sky high prescription drug costs. I will continue working on bipartisan solutions and reforms that lower premiums, improve access to care, and bring down the cost of prescription drugs.”
Feenstra also said in a statement he supports lowering health care premiums, but did not say if he backed any specific proposals that could come before Congress.
“As a former volunteer EMT for 15 years in my hometown of Hull, I want all Iowans to have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare,” Feenstra said. “The reality is that too many Iowa families, farmers, seniors, and small businesses can’t afford health insurance and prescription medications. That’s unacceptable. It’s why I’m focused on lowering healthcare premiums, increasing access to affordable insurance, and protecting our rural hospitals. We must do everything possible to lower healthcare costs and ensure that Iowans can receive the care and treatment they need and deserve.”
At a gubernatorial campaign event in November, Feenstra told reporters he and other members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee were considering multiple proposals aimed at lowering premiums, including efforts that would “directly give money to the small business, or give directly money to the family, to lower that premium cost.”

(Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services)The Minnesota Department of Human Services has issued a two-year moratorium on licensing for Home and Community-Based Services, a Medicaid program that helps people with disabilities receive care in their home or a community, such as group homes, instead of in nursing homes or hospitals.
DHS will stop issuing new licenses and cancel existing applications starting in January, according to a letter from the agency’s Temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi to lawmakers dated Monday. The Legislature passed a law this year allowing DHS to pause licensing if it finds that new applications are growing beyond program needs.
There are currently 2,549 active licenses and 2,314 pending applications as of mid-November, according to the letter. Compared to 2015-2019, the past five years have seen an increase in disability waiver recipients, i.e., people who need services, of 25%, much smaller than the 55% increase in the average annual number of licenses and 283% increase in new applications for licenses. Gandhi said DHS compared the growth in provider licenses to the growth in people seeking services to conclude that it should no longer accept new applications.
Still, providers warned that the decision will harm the disability community. A statement from the Association of Residential Resources in Minnesota, which represents disability service providers, said they were only notified Tuesday, and that the “sweeping, system-altering policy” decision was made “in complete secrecy.”
Josh Berg, a service director at Accessible Space, an assisted independent living provider, said that the decision to stop licensing new providers is “a really clear example of [DHS] saying that they don’t have things under control.”
ARRM, in the statement, said that home and community care providers have been blindsided by DHS twice in just over a month now: Once when the governor’s office and DHS released an audit program with a press release that left providers confused and panicked, and again with the licensing moratorium this week.
DHS appears to be tightening controls in the same programs. For example, the moratorium will affect Integrated Community Supports, a program that DHS has already been pausing payments for and investigating.
Fraud in Minnesota’s human services has become a high-profile political issue, recently drawing attention from President Donald Trump after the publication of an article claiming — with little evidence — that Somali-American immigrants accused of defrauding Minnesota’s public programs are sending the money to the terrorist group al-Shaabab. Trump’s administration is now planning to launch an “intensive immigration enforcement operation” targeting the Somali-American community in Minnesota.
Following federal charges against dozens of people alleging they defrauded a child nutrition program, an autism treatment program and Housing Stabilization Services, DHS moved to address fraud in other services, turning its attention to ICS starting in September and 13 other programs starting in December.
Berg said that he understands why DHS would pause licensing for programs they “can’t oversee effectively,” but was upset at the decision to retroactively cancel existing applications.
“There’s gonna be some providers that have bought properties that have been teeing up to be able to start services once they get their license approved that are now stuck,” Berg said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shireen_gandhi-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

Jimmie “Chris” Duncan walked out of the Ouachita Parish Correctional Center and into the arms of his parents last week after spending the past 27 years on death row.
Seven months ago, a Louisiana district court judge vacated his murder conviction for killing his former girlfriend’s toddler, citing doubts about the evidence used to convict him. The judge granted bail after multiple legal delays, including an unsuccessful request by prosecutors to the Louisiana Supreme Court to stop his release. Now free, Duncan spent Thanksgiving with his family — then celebrated his 57th birthday the next day.
“We thank God for Jimmie coming home,” Duncan’s stepmom, Sharon Duncan, said in an emailed statement on behalf of the family.
But Duncan’s journey to freedom is far from over. Prosecutors have asked the state Supreme Court to reinstate his death sentence. Duncan’s attorneys declined to make him immediately available for an interview.

The April decision by Judge Alvin Sharp to set aside Duncan’s conviction and death sentence came after a Verite News and ProPublica investigation examined the reliability of the key forensic evidence used to convict him. At the time, Duncan faced the possibility of being put to death as Gov. Jeff Landry, a staunch death penalty advocate, made moves to expedite executions after a 15-year pause.
Sharp, of the 4th Judicial District in Ouachita Parish, found that Duncan’s conviction was based in part on bite mark evidence now considered by experts to be junk science. That original analysis came from forensic dentist Michael West and pathologist Dr. Steven Hayne, whose longtime partnership as state experts has been questioned following concerns about the validity of their techniques. West, who did not respond to previous requests for comment, admitted in a 2011 deposition in another case that he no longer believed in bite mark analysis. Hayne died in 2020.
Over the past 27 years, nine prisoners have been set free after being convicted in part on inaccurate evidence given by West and Hayne. Three of those men were on death row. Duncan was the last person awaiting an execution based on the pair’s work.
Robert Tew, district attorney for Ouachita and Morehouse parishes, insisted in his appeal that the evidence prosecutors presented is sound, that Duncan raped and murdered 23-month-old Haley Oliveaux, and that he should be executed without delay. Tew’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Duncan’s release.
Police arrested Duncan on Dec. 18, 1993. He was babysitting Haley that day in the home he shared with the girl’s mother in West Monroe. Duncan told law enforcement he had put the toddler in the bath before going downstairs to wash dishes. When he heard a noise coming from the bathroom, he rushed upstairs to check on her and found Haley floating face down in the water. She was pronounced dead a few hours later.
Duncan was initially arrested for negligent homicide, until Hayne and West conducted Haley’s medical exam and claimed they discovered evidence she had been sexually assaulted and intentionally drowned. Hayne said he found bite marks on the girl’s body,  which West then examined, claiming to find that they were a match for Duncan’s teeth.
Based in part on those findings, prosecutors upped the charge against Duncan to first-degree murder. After about two weeks of testimony in 1998, the jury found Duncan guilty and sentenced him to death. He would spend the next quarter-century in a cell on death row at Angola.
During that time, however, his attorneys with the Innocence Project in New York, the Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner firm in Atlanta, and the Mwalimu Center for Justice in New Orleans uncovered a trove of evidence that eventually led to his conviction being vacated in April.
The most damning of that new evidence calls into question whether the bite marks Hayne said he found on Haley’s body were manufactured. In a video of West’s 1993 examination of Haley, which was not shown to jurors at the trial, the dentist can be seen taking a mold of Duncan’s teeth and grinding it into the girl’s body. (West has previously said he was simply using what he called a “direct comparison” technique — in which he presses a mold of a person’s teeth directly onto the location of suspected bite marks.)
In his ruling vacating Duncan’s conviction, Sharp said the work Hayne and West did on Duncan’s case was “no longer valid” and “not scientifically defensible.”
Additional evidence that undermined Duncan’s conviction included testimony from an expert witness who said that the child’s death was the result not of a homicide but of an accidental drowning. And investigators working for Duncan’s legal team spoke to a jailhouse informant who recanted his earlier trial testimony that Duncan confessed to the crime.
Haley’s mother, Allison Layton Statham, has come to support Duncan’s release, telling Mississippi Today in a July interview that she believes Duncan “was falsely accused of a crime he didn’t commit.”
As the higher court weighs the state’s appeal, Sharp, who had already ruled that Duncan was factually innocent of the crime, granted him bail on Nov. 21, setting it at $150,000. In his decision, Sharp said that the “presumption is not great” that Duncan is guilty and proof against him is “not evident.” The state fought the release but lost in court, setting the stage for Duncan to be freed the day before Thanksgiving.
“When Chris got out and I went to hug him, I was very emotional,” said attorney Ann Ferebee, a member of Duncan’s legal team for the last decade who greeted him shortly after his release. “I was kind of choked up, and he asked me, ‘Are you doing OK?’
“‘Really good to see you,’ is what I told him.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Following his release, Duncan went to live with a family member in central Louisiana. Christian Bromley, another attorney of Duncan’s, said he expects oral arguments in the state’s appeal to take place before the state Supreme Court in early 2026. Should prosecutors lose that round, they could take the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, retry Duncan on the same charges or retry him a new set of charges, Bromley said.
Or they could drop the charges altogether. But that seems unlikely, he said.
“We met Chris almost 10 years ago and have believed in his innocence, just like he has, that entire time,” Bromley said. “I think it is something that we always hoped for but knew that it was potentially an insurmountable feat to get there.”
Until this year, Louisiana had not carried out an execution since 2010 as it has been unable to procure the necessary drugs. But following Landry’s election, the state approved the use of nitrogen gas, a controversial method allowed in only three other states.
That led to the March 18 execution of Jesse Hoffman Jr. Saving Duncan from a similar fate has been “the most rewarding experience of my career,” said Ferebee, though she acknowledged that prosecutors are still pushing for the execution of Duncan. “We are celebrating this victory, but we know that there’s still more to come.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Duncan-Barnes-for-IP_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg-1024x683.webp,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall’s troubles with a potential scandal over Detroit Lions tickets he received from a lobbying firm have been resolved, as the attorney who made a formal complaint rescinded his request for the state to investigate the matter.
Bob LaBrant, the former general counsel for the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, filed a complaint Monday in reaction to news that Hall, of Richland Township, had received tickets to a Nov. 2 Lions home game from Bill Wort of Public Affairs Associates.
Both Hall and Wortz said the speaker paid for the tickets, but neither provided a copy of the reimbursement check when asked. That led to questions on whether Hall paid Wortz or the firm, and if the reimbursement occurred before or after Hall obtained the tickets.
Now, LaBrant appears satisfied after seeing a copy of the check. In a statement to Michigan Advance, Hall said the story was “manufactured” to attack him “from the beginning.” The story was originally reported by The Detroit News, who Hall took a jab at in his statement to the Advance.
“I won’t hold my breath waiting for a correction or an apology,” Hall added.
If Hall had obtained the tickets before paying the full market value price, Wortz could have been found to be in violation of a section of lobbying law that LaBrant helped institute. LaBrant worried the issue would go ignored if he didn’t file a formal complaint compelling Wortz to show that he had proof that the tickets were paid for and in line with applicable law.
Lobbyist who provided Lions tickets to Hall said fair market value was paid, has check to prove it

Wortz told Michigan Advance on Wednesday that he had that proof and was willing to show the state, as well as LaBrant, who indicated on Monday that if he saw the check and that Wortz had complied with the law, he would ultimately drop his complaint.
LaBrant and Wortz separately contacted the Advance to let a reporter know that the complaint has been withdrawn.
Although the complaint has been resolved, LaBrant told the Advance that he doesn’t know why Hall and Wortz were so reluctant to initially share the details when asked by reporters. Still, he was happy to see that the law was being followed in the Hall matter.
“I’ve labored in the vineyards on reimbursements of ticket gifts for some time now, and as a result, I didn’t want to see this either be ignored with the new administrative rules on gift reimbursement, and have this all turn into some sort of dead letter,” LaBrant said. “So that was my incentive to file the complaint.”
LaBrant was also puzzled why Hall, who has fashioned himself as a House speaker deeply preoccupied with transparency and ethics reforms, would take tickets from a lobbyist, especially given the corruption scandals that have plagued previous speakers in Lee Chatfield, Jason Wentworth and Rick Johnson.
“Why risk unfavorable press on something like this?” LaBrant asked.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6343-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

Kyle Walker listens during a 2025 committee hearing. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican state Sen. Kyle Walker won’t seek reelection next year, making him another opponent of the proposed GOP-redraw of Indiana’s congressional maps who will be leaving the Legislature.
Walker announced Wednesday that he would complete his Senate term through the November 2026 election.
Walker’s Senate District 31 is one of the state’s few politically close Senate districts, covering the northeastern corner of Indianapolis and the Fishers area in Hamilton County. He won the 2022 election with 55% of the vote.
Walker’s statement did not mention the congressional redistricting that’s been demanded by President Donald Trump, who has berated several Republican state senators who’ve come out against the redraw.
“I remain fully committed to serving with the same focus and energy for the remainder of my term, and to ensuring a smooth transition for the district’s future leadership,” Walker said in his statement. “But I also want to make this announcement now, in advance of the February filing deadline, so that potential candidates have some time to consider their interest and ability to serve this district.”
Walker is among about a dozen Republican senators to publicly oppose redistricting. Their opposition leaves the fate of the redistricting push uncertain even though Republicans currently hold 40 of the 50 Senate seats as about a dozen GOP senators have not yet revealed their stance.
Walker joins Sens. Eric Bassler of Washington and Greg Walker of Columbus as Republican redistricting foes who won’t seek reelection in 2026.
Kyle Walker announced his redistricting opposition last month despite his close ties with a leader of a pro-redistricting group and being a member of the 24-person Indiana Republican Party State Committee as the party’s 7th Congressional District vice chair.
“I’ve spent the past several months listening closely to my constituents on mid-decade redistricting,” Walker said at the time. “With 93 percent opposed, and as their voice in the Indiana Senate, I’ll be voting no.”
A Walker spokesman told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that Walker has resigned from his position as executive vice president of MO Strategies, a political consulting firm where he worked for several years that is led by Marty Obst.
Obst is the chair of Fair Maps Indiana, a nonprofit group that launched a six-figure advertising effort targeting undecided Republican senators pushing for their support of redistricting. Obst served in senior leadership roles in Trump’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns and was a senior political adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence.
Walker alluded to the job change in his statement Wednesday without giving any details.
“As some of my colleagues, friends and family know, this is a decision I’ve wrestled with for several months,” his statement said. “I am forever grateful for having the opportunity to represent the people of our district. This, however, is a season of change for me. Looking forward, I have also decided to start a new chapter in my professional career.”
Walker campaign spokesman Luke Thomas said Walker planned to continue as a state Republican committee member.
“He and Marty are great friends, and he’ll continue working with him and the team long enough to ensure a smooth and successful transition,” Thomas said.
Walker’s announcement cited key accomplishments from his Senate tenure, including a change the state’s local income tax distribution formula to ensure the city of Fishers receives a more equitable share of local income tax revenue. He also created a Sports and Tourism Bid Fund to help communities across Indiana access resources to host major events to stimulate local economic growth.

Free.,"High tensions around law enforcement, ICE tactics on display in heated US House hearing",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/high-tensions-around-law-enforcement-ice-tactics-display-heated-us-house-hearing,,"Members of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee decried violence against law enforcement, but seemed to make little headway in identifying how to address the issue during a Wednesday hearing that often saw each party harshly blame the other.Chairman Andrew Garbarino of New York, at his first hearing since taking over as for the retired Mark Green of Tennessee, sought to strike an even tone in an opening statement, condemning violence against police while noting that officers have a responsibility to maintain the public’s trust.“Law enforcement personnel are public servants, not public figures. They stepped forward to safeguard our nation and uphold the laws enacted by this body,” Garbarino said. “But that alone does not absolve them from facing any form of accountability. Public trust and public safety go hand in hand.” Other members of the panel, though, were less even-handed, with Democrats strongly criticizing some tactics used by federal law enforcement officers under President Donald Trump and Republicans denouncing such criticism as fueling violence against police.Several members of the panel, of both parties, acknowledged the two West Virginia National Guard members shot in a Nov. 26 alleged ambush in Washington, D.C.Police witnesses denounce Nazi comparisonsWitnesses from three police organizations, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs’ Association and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, largely agreed that heightened rhetoric about law enforcement activity was a danger to their members.“The rhetoric coming from the top, calling officers Nazis and Gestapo, it better stop right now,” Jonathan Thompson, the executive director of the National Sheriffs’ Association, said. “You are inflaming dangerous circumstances. You're attacking people that wake up every single day and do one thing: they put on their uniforms, they put on their star and… enforce the laws of this country.”Daniel Hodges, a D.C. Metropolitan Police officer who responded to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack and who Democrats invited to testify to the panel as a private citizen Wednesday, said protocol of federal officers under Trump invited the comparison.“There is a semi-secret police force abducting people based on the color of their skin and sending many of them via state-sponsored human trafficking to extraterritorial concentration camps,” he said. “Before we go around the room clutching our pearls, wondering how people could possibly compare law enforcement in this country to the Gestapo, maybe we should take a moment and ask ourselves if there isn't some recent behavior on the government's part that could encourage such juxtaposition,” Hodges said.Patrick Yoes, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said violence against officers was a nonpartisan issue.“My members are both Democrat and Republican,” he said. “And we’re all having the same problem.”ICE under microscopeSeveral Democrats said the tactics used by officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, undermined their law enforcement mission and endangered them, while Republicans blamed that rhetoric for making police targets.New York Democrat Daniel Goldman, a former federal prosecutor, objected to Thompson’s testimony that police officers “put on their uniforms.”“The problem is that's not the case,” Goldman said. “They don't put on a uniform, they don't wear identification, and they go out with masks on to — violently in many cases — arrest unsuspecting immigrants, non-violent, many of whom are actually here legally.”Goldman said as a federal prosecutor he worked with DHS officers “who represented the very, very best of our country.” But under Trump, the department’s behavior had grown irresponsible, he said.Illinois Democrat Delia Ramirez went further, calling DHS “the single biggest threat to public safety right now.”“They use anonymity to terrorize our communities and to violate our rights,” she said. “They reject accountability. They disregard court orders and they violate consent decrees. Bottom line: DHS agents lie. They act with impunity. They reject checks and balances, and they ignore Congress and the courts.”GOP defends DHSRepublicans on the panel deflected blame from DHS and drew a direct line from the rhetoric of some Democrats opposed to ICE’s tactics to physical attacks on law enforcement.Tennessee Republican Andy Ogles said Ramirez’s comment “pisses me off” and characterized DHS agents as carrying out the rule of law.“This is about the rhetoric against law enforcement, violence against law enforcement,” Ogles said. “This isn't about ICE. This isn't about deportations, or the (Homeland Security) secretary doing her job, securing the border and deporting those who are here illegally.”Rep. Eli Crane, an Arizona Republican, played a video showing Rep LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat who also sits on the panel, confronting ICE agents at a detention facility in her district.“What do you think it means to people that are out there watching and listening, watching social media, watching the news, and they see a member of Congress who sits on this committee go out there and behave like that?” Crane asked the witnesses.Thompson answered he was “appalled.”“Quite honestly, I find it reprehensible, and it’s obviously dangerous,” he said.McIver said she had been doing her job to provide oversight.Jan. 6 pardons at issueDemocrats also cited Trump’s pardons of people convicted of crimes as part of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as condoning violence against law enforcement.McIver suggested committee Republicans were hypocritical in condemning some anti-police rhetoric while staying silent or praising Trump’s decision to pardon Jan.6 rioters.“It is not Democrats who are praising, let alone pardoning, people who stormed this very Capitol complex to beat police officers and hunt down elected officials,” she said.",,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

State Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) and Sen. Heather Berghmans (D-Albuquerque) at a news conference Wednesday afternoon said they were alarmed by the findings of a new analysis of federal data on firearm trafficking. The report — published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a national organization that advocates for stricter gun laws — found that three out of four guns found at New Mexico crime scenes were originally sold by a firearm dealer.
The report, titled “The Supply Side of Violence: How Gun Dealers Fuel Firearm Trafficking,” urged legislative action to hold retailers to account for selling weapons that are later trafficked and used in crimes. Across New Mexico, in particular, it appears that most weapons recovered at crime scenes were trafficked, the report says. In nearly 90% of cases, someone other than the original purchaser possessed the gun used in a crime, an indication of a “straw purchasing,” in which someone legally buys a weapon and then sells it to someone who cannot legally purchase a gun or doesn’t want their name tied to the transaction.
The report ranked New Mexico fifth in the nation for most “crime guns” recovered per 100,000 people and fifth for the highest rate of firearm homicides.
Romero and Berghmans said they plan to introduce legislation in January that will place greater training and licensing requirements on gun dealers, similar to the requirements that barbers, cannabis proprietors and bartenders must undergo.
“We really want to focus on the adoption of security measures for these dealers, accurate tracking of their inventory, training for their employees,” Berghmans said. “We have regulations in the state of New Mexico that require a waitress or waiter to get a server’s license before they can serve alcohol so they can recognize people who maybe should not be served…we want firearms dealers to have the same type of training and the same type of licensing.”
Berghmans added that they want to “refrain from the selling of military-grade weaponry that could be used in the wrong hands.”
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in 2023 called on state lawmakers to pass a ban on assault rifles and heavier weaponry like .50 caliber rifles. Romero co-sponsored the 2023 bill to prohibit assault rifles, which ultimately failed. The following year, Lujan Grisham in her State of the State address called firearm legislation “the most important work” facing state lawmakers and announced a “gun safety package” that would have banned assault weapons and raised the legal age to purchase a firearm to 21. Most recently, Romero sponsored a failed bill that would have banned gas-operated semi-automatic firearms, magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds and devices that can effectively convert semi-automatic weapons into fully automatic weapons.
The recent Everytown for Gun Safety report found that the overwhelming majority of “crime guns” in New Mexico were pistols, though it noted that rifles made up a larger share of guns used in crimes in New Mexico compared to other states. 
Proposed laws in the upcoming 30-day legislative session are limited to budgetary matters and issues placed on the governor’s agenda. Romero and Berghmans said they have asked Lujan Grisham’s office to include this issue on her agenda.
“This is an epidemic of gun violence,” Romero said. She likened the legislative plan to that of combatting the national opioid crisis. Lawmakers and attorneys general across the U.S. went after pharmaceutical companies, which resulted in settlement payouts for thousands of local governments. “We know that the source — the seller of these guns — needs to be held accountable.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/abqguns-e1764796732207.jpg,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

Underhill elects to stay in the dark, axing plan to light up ski trail: “The lights are BLINDING,” one resident says

Tomasi Meadow, a wide field at the base of Mount Mansfield, is beloved by Underhill residents.  It’s so popular that in October, the Mansfield Nordic Club, a ski group that voluntarily grooms  the trails, asked: Why not make it better by adding lights that could extend the hours along the trail two evenings a week? 
Not so fast. Dozens of people turned up at an October town meeting about the lights and even more spoke out on Underhill’s Front Porch Forum, according to messages forwarded to VTDigger. Commenters brought up issues of light pollution, potential energy costs — even though the lights were donated and ran off a generator — and whether the lights would attract more people, increasing upkeep. 
Robin Farrell, a resident near Tomasi Meadow said she and her husband adamantly opposed the lights. “The lights are BLINDING,” Farrell wrote on Front Porch Forum. She called the impact “extreme and unnecessary.” 
“We are against them for many reasons – wildlife, impact on our peace, the message to the people who don’t ski that the field belongs to others, light pollution,” she wrote. 
After the backlash, the plan to light up the meadow was abruptly extinguished Wednesday. The issue highlights a fact of life in small Vermont towns: Change is not always met with open arms, especially when it comes to land use. In a state that prides itself on conservation, issues of development, like solar or housing, are often contentious.
Had the plan gone through, it would have brought 20 floodlights, donated by a ski club member, covering about a quarter of the public property owned by the Jericho Underhill Land Trust. The selectboard planned to offer a preview of the lights on Thursday evening for the town, and to take public comment a week later. There was no cost to the town, according to Bob Stone, chair of the Underhill Selectboard.
“Traditionally that field has been dark,” Stone said. “So this is a change. It’s never been done before. That’s really the heart of the matter.”
About 24 hours after VTDigger reached out to local leaders involved in the decision process, and after weeks of pushback in selectboard meetings and on message boards like Front Porch Forum, the Mansfield Nordic Club decided to step away from the night lights.
“We met a surprising amount of negative pushback and it does not seem that the community is open to a trial run of lighted community trails,” Jenn Carlson, president of the Mansfield Nordic Club, said in an email Wednesday morning. 
The change happened so quickly that Stone said he was unaware of the group’s withdrawal. 
“You’re telling me something for the first time,” Stone told a VTDigger reporter.
The day before, Adam Terko, executive director and head coach of the Mansfield Nordic Club, said the lights were exciting for their club.
“Daylight is sparse in Northern VT in the wintertime, and having lights at Tomasi Meadow would expand and extend recreation options while also increasing safety,” Terko said in an email. “I feel it is a relatively low-impact way to have a positive impact on the community.”
The club’s quick switch was in response to public opinion. The lighting itself was fairly straightforward: Light was an allowable use for the meadow, and no town permits were required because of the temporary nature of the lights, according to Anton Kelsey, chair of the town’s recreation committee who spoke during an October selectboard meeting. The lights would be on Tuesdays and Thursdays; they would be turned off by 7 p.m. They were also free, according to Stone. 
“It’s zero cost to the taxpayer or the town,” said Stone, who added he was initially against the lights. But he wanted to stay open minded, so he opened up the proposal to public comment. 
One resident brought up the potential concern of PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, in ski waxes, making their way into the local water supply. The potential pollutants brought into question whether the meadow be used for skiing at all, they asked. Another resident argued that darkness increased the solemnity of night skiing. 
Kelsey said in an email that the reason the proposal was removed was that “the groups involved felt the negative energy and support around the project was not worth the benefits involved.” 
“How we use common land is an important discussion,” Kelsey said. But in a draft message he prepared for Front Porch Forum, he asked his community members to stick to the facts. He added that ski wax used in Vermont should not contain fluorocarbons, a PFAS substance that was banned in the state in 2023. 
For now, the field will continue to be used for skiing, sledding and other winter activities by the light of the sun and the moon. Or as Carlson said in an email: “Back to headlamps for everyone!”

(Provided by SC Parks, Recreation and Tourism)COLUMBIA — The state parks department is asking legislators for nearly $186 million to fund sprawling upgrades and renovations in what the agency’s director described as “a generational move.”
The request is the largest in agency history, agency director Duane Parrish said Wednesday.
With it, the parks department could upgrade its campgrounds, buy new furniture for lodges, improve trail systems and build welcome centers for upcoming parks, among other projects, he said.
“People will look back 40, 50 years from now and say, ‘I’m really glad we did this,’” Parrish told the SC Daily Gazette.
The parks department’s ask, which it listed as its top priority for the year, would sum up more routine requests for maintenance, upgrades and new projects, Parrish said. Instead of coming to legislators for each project separately, that would allow the agency to get started on renovations statewide.
In recent years, construction costs have risen so quickly that projects broke their initial budgets before even making it to the end of the state’s lengthy approval process, said agency lobbyist Emily Frierson. The agency is also asking legislators to help speed up those approvals, according to the budget request.
“These projects have just skyrocketed with inflation, and then we have to go back to the Legislature two years after that” to ask for more money to finish the same project, Frierson said.
An overhaul of the sort the agency is requesting could allow the department to keep up with increasing demand for years to come, while also drawing in more visitors and more revenue, Parrish said. Although taxpayer money funds major projects at state parks, day-to-day operations are paid for through revenue the agency generates from store sales, as well as fees to get into parks and stay overnight.

The state’s parks are “some of the most natural and beautiful places we have throughout the state for the public to see and enjoy,” Parrish said.
Since he started leading the agency in 2011, more people than ever want to see those places, he said.
The COVID-19 pandemic sent more people outside, causing a boom in the popularity of hiking, biking, boating and other outdoor activities. Local, state and national parks, including South Carolina’s Congaree National Park, all reported record numbers of visitors in the ensuing years.
“Looking back, it wasn’t just a fad,” Parrish said. “It stuck, and outdoor recreation is at an all-time high.”
Combine that with a growing state population, and the parks department has seen “the wear and tear of 10 to 12 million people a year going through the parks,” Parrish said.
The park system doesn’t track exact visitor numbers, but a rough estimate would put the number of visitors a decade ago at around 6 or 7 million each year, he said.
Roads, water systems and lodges where campers can stay overnight need upgrades or repairs, Parrish said. Nearly $7.5 million of the requested cost would go toward those sorts of repairs, according to the agency budget request.
The biggest part of the request, just over $96 million, would help built visitor centers at six upcoming state parks expected to open over the next five years, along with installing and updating water and sewer systems and laying cables for internet access at new and existing parks, Parrish said.
Another $59 million would upgrade cabins, campgrounds, shops and golf courses. That could mean updating old furniture in the state’s cabins, renovating the interiors of park stores and upgrading RV hookups to supply more power, Parrish said.
Most of the state’s RV hookups don’t provide enough energy to run a dishwasher, which is a modern standard. That keeps some people from staying overnight, Parrish said. Other campgrounds lack sewer systems, another inconvenience for visitors.
The funding could also pay for new and improved trails and more parking lots, Parrish said.
SC parks department seeks $18M to open 4 new state parks

At some parks, guests have to reserve a parking spot before visiting because the demand is so high. At Jones Gap State Park in Greenville County, all 50 or so reserved parking spots might fill up before 9 a.m. during the fall season, when people flock to see the leaves turn colors in the mountains, Parrish said.
The department owns a stretch of land across the highway from the park where it could build a new parking lot, but it would need money for paving and to create a trail from the park to the new lot, he said.
“I think there’s an opportunity for us to take this money, maximize the usage of it and modernize state parks to the point where we have one of the finest modern state parks in the country,” Parrish said.
The final $23 million of the request would go toward restoring and preserving structures built as part of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. President Franklin Roosevelt created the program in 1933 in an effort to kickstart the economy by creating jobs for tens of thousands of young men. It ended in 1942 after the United States entered World War II.
South Carolina’s approximately 49,000 corps members built structures in 16 state parks, and evidence of their work remains in still-standing lodges and cabins. The parks department has restored some, such as Gaines Lodge at Table Rock State Park, but the agency could restore other, smaller cabins to the way they looked 80 years ago, Parrish said.
Whether the department gets what it requested is another story.
Every agency must contend for a finite amount of funding, and Parrish acknowledged state parks are not usually at the front of the line.
Still, Parrish said he’s hopeful legislators will agree to fund the request, even if they do so over a number of years instead of all at once. Parrish proposed pulling from the state’s unspent surpluses to fund the request.
The state ended up collecting $411 million more than expected in the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the state’s Board of Economic Advisors. The board’s latest revenue estimates, which include the higher-than-expected revenues and prior years’ unspent surpluses, give the Legislature an additional $2.4 billion to spend in the 2026-27 budget. Of that, $1.7 billion is meant for one-time expenses.
“I thought it was a good time to ask for that $186 million to say, ‘OK, this is a critical product for the people, the public of South Carolina,’” Parrish said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SCPRT_OutdoorAdventure_Biking_018-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court appeared skeptical Wednesday about a case alleging fraud in and seeking invalidation of last year’s medical cannabis petition campaign, which voters widely supported.
Former State Sen. John Kuehn of Heartwell, a longtime opponent of medical marijuana, continues to allege widespread “fraud” in the 2024 medical cannabis petitions. 
His lawsuit argues a district judge incorrectly ruled last November that the measures had enough signatures to reach the ballot despite allegations from Kuehn and two top state officials, largely based on questions about notaries.

Kuehn sued Secretary of State Bob Evnen and the ballot sponsors, but Evnen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers largely joined forces with Kuehn. Together, they argued that at least enough signatures would lose a “presumption of validity” to force the trial into a second phase involving greater scrutiny of signatures.
“Notaries are, in effect, walking stamps of approval,” Zach Pohlman, state deputy solicitor general, said Wednesday. “They are professional truth tellers. And so when they lie, that presumption of truth … gets pierced, and they become just like every other witness.”
If the justices reverse, the 2024 medical cannabis ballot sponsors might need to rehabilitate enough signatures to show at least 86,499 valid signatures on two petitions apiece for the voter-approved laws to stand, or 172,998.
The campaign had 6,822 more signatures validated than it needed.
No other court in the country has adopted such a legal argument that would extend or “impute” one instance of notarial fraud to other documents that person had notarized, Daniel Gutman, attorney for the ballot sponsors, has repeatedly said.
Timing of election case
Some justices probed how a ruling would fit more than a year after the 2024 election.
“What impact does it have that the signatures have already been verified?” asked Justice Stephanie Stacy, referring to county-level verification in summer 2024, before the ballot was certified.
“We know how the election turned out. What effect does that have?” asked Justice William Cassel.

Pohlman and former State Sen. Andrew La Grone of Dunbar, for Kuehn, said the Supreme Court could still legally invalidate the petitions. La Grone noted local election officials are not handwriting experts and can’t catch everything.
“When there are bad acts related to the affidavit … the value of the verification is destroyed, and the petition must fall unless the genuineness of the signature is permanently shown,” La Grone said.
Pohlman said the state’s highest court has invalidated a notary’s actions before, citing a 1944 case about a mail-in ballot. He said some other documents have also been invalidated.
“Of that document. But other documents notarized by the notary, have we invalidated those types of situations?” asked Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke.
“Not in Nebraska, your honor,” Pohlman responded.
A new legal theory
Justice Jonathan Papik pressed whether the arguments from Pohlman and La Grone have ever been used in other states. Pohlman pointed to Oklahoma, where he said that because a notary failed to post a notary bond, 7,000 signatures the person had notarized were tossed.
Attorney Daniel Gutman, for the ballot sponsors, pointed to a case from North Dakota where the state supreme court declined a “wholesale rejection” of signatures and chose not to “impute” one bad act to other notarizations.

La Grone and Pohlman said the cases are different, in part because they’re not seeking “wholesale” invalidation, just a second trial phase. Gutman said the result is the same.
“The remedy the appellants seek in this case — which is the mass invalidation of petition signatures — is inconsistent with the high value this court places on the initiative right,” Gutman said. “It is inconsistent with the Election Act, which facilitates, not undermines, the initiative process. And it is inconsistent with common sense.”
State attorneys had previously asked the trial judge to toss the petitions without a second phase last year, a position that appears to have narrowed.
Circulators and notaries
Wednesday’s arguments largely revolve around a 1919 Nebraska Supreme Court case — Barkley v. Pool — in which the court said a circulator’s fraudulent behavior could be extended to other actions. In that case, three men against women’s suffrage forged signatures in a petition campaign seeking to force a vote to overturn a 1917 law giving women some voting rights.
One circulator for the medical cannabis petitions from Grand Island pleaded guilty last year to forging signatures, including by using a phone book. Campaign officials maintain he worked alone and agree any signatures he gathered should not be counted.

Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong ruled last year that there were some signatures she said lost a “presumption of validity” and would need to be rehabilitated, identifying 711 signatures on the legalization petition and 826 on the regulatory petition.
However, Strong ruled that the challenges still fell “well short” of affecting access to the ballot.
Pohlman said Strong should have extended the wrongdoing she found to all other signatures the people touched, potentially tens of thousands of signatures. He said county-level verification is “some evidence on the front end” but that circulator oaths are critical.
Justice Jason Bergevin asked La Grone whether there was any evidence that electors who purportedly signed the petitions, outside of the Grand Island case, didn’t actually sign. La Grone said that’s a “very open question,” one which Kuehn wants to get to in the second trial phase.

Funke asked La Grone whether he was asking the court to transition Barkley to notaries. La Grone said the “focal point” is a circulator’s “oath,” one which requires a notary.
“We think it is merely an application of the rule to the notary context,” La Grone said.
Funke also asked whether, under Barkley, a trial judge must extend fraudulent acts to all other actions, or whether there is judicial discretion. La Grone told Funke it is “slightly unclear.” Strong ruled that, either way, the ballot sponsors would survive the Evnen-Kuehn challenge. 
Future of petition law
Gutman said the medical cannabis and women’s suffrage cases are different, and he asked the high court to consider whether the century-old case law is still good. He pointed to technological advancements and county officials now being part of the signature verification process. 
For example, only the secretary of state verified signatures in 1919, Gutman said, so Barkley relied on a circulator’s oath more as “the only evidence of the genuineness of the signature.”

“Every expansion of the scope of wrongdoing that may be imputed increases the risk of unjustly depriving an honest [signer] of the right to have his or her signature counted,” a legal brief from the ballot sponsors reads.
The AG’s Office has sought to frame the case as protecting the integrity of the ballot measure process. Pohlman said Wednesday that if the “proven fraud” in this case didn’t require a second phase of trial, “then the public’s confidence and the precious power of initiative may be shaken.”
Many medical cannabis supporters and campaign attorneys have said the opposite, arguing that continued attacks from top officials against the medical cannabis petitions and laws are more harmful. Gutman has said ballot litigation is also made “extremely difficult” when the secretary of state certifies an initiative but “tries to pull the plug at the last minute.”
A case about ‘numbers’
Gutman said the Kuehn-Evnen case is about “numbers,” specifically at least 3,464 signatures on the campaign’s petition to legalize up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a physician’s recommendation and at least 3,358 signatures on a petition to set a framework for regulating the new medicine. 
The legalization law received 71% support statewide, including a majority in all 49 legislative districts. The regulatory law received 67% support, including a majority in all but three legislative districts.

Gutman said that if the one bad notary act invalidates all others, those arguments could mean wills, real estate documents and more are “presumptively invalid right now.” Some targeted notaries have helped other petition drives in the state. La Grone said he was not asking to extend notarial wrongdoing on petitions to unrelated documents.
Of the notaries named in the Kuehn-Evnen challenges, just one — Jacy Todd of York — faces a criminal case in Grand Island. He is believed to be the first notary to face charges, with a trial set to begin Dec. 15. He is also running a 2026 GOP campaign for governor.
According to the Secretary of State’s Office, no notaries have had their notary commissions administratively canceled in 2025. According to a state-run database of notaries, all named notaries retain active notary licenses except Todd, whose commission expired July 29. 
What would a second phase look like?
Funke asked what a second phase would look like, to which Gutman said he doesn’t imagine doing anything more than local election officials.
“If we go back to a second trial, there’s nobody we can hire, nothing we can do, nothing I can say, that is better than what the election officials have already done to verify the signatures,” Gutman said.
Pohlman said a second phase would mean sponsors have to prove “by a preponderance” that they have enough signatures. He said the Supreme Court would need to require the trial move forward “as quickly as possible” and could prohibit circulator affidavits from being repaired by “self-serving testimony.”

“So does that mean they’d call 86,000 signatories to testify that the petition was read to them, they understood what they were signing and they actually signed it?” Funke asked.
“And do that quickly?” Papik added.
Pohlman said he doesn’t think the sponsors would need to call that many people, just circulators, notaries and enough voters to clear the threshold, if possible. Some of the notaries targeted in the case also served as circulators.
The 2024 campaign marked the third attempt for Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana to reach a statewide vote. In 2020, a divided Supreme Court, 5-2, said the first attempt was too broad. Papik wrote the dissent and would have let voters weigh in. In 2022, the campaign did not garner enough signatures.
Some campaign volunteers have privately worried about issue fatigue for voters or campaign workers. Some have also expressed concern about whether some circulators, notaries or voters would come forward as the state continues to pursue civil, criminal and political penalties against some medical cannabis supporters.
In a Wednesday statement, Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, which ran the 2024 campaign, said: “They cannot undo the will of the voters. Every lawsuit, every delay, every political maneuver is confirmation that we are winning.”
The Supreme Court will issue a ruling in the coming months on the case.

Fiona McFarland debating her sovereign immunity bill on April 8, 2025, in the House Judiciary Committee. (Photo via the Florida Channel)Despite overwhelming opposition from city, county, hospital, and school district lobbyists, a House spending panel Wednesday approved a bill to increase the amount of money people injured by the government can recover in negligence cases.
The House Budget Committee spent less than 15 minutes Wednesday discussing the merits of HB 145, offered by Sarasota Republican Rep. Fiona McFarland, before voting 22-2 to pass the bill.
HB 145 would increase the “sovereign immunity” limits per person from $200,000 to $500,000 and up the cap per incident from $300,000 to $1 million. The new limits would apply to claims that occur between Oct. 1, 2026, and Sept. 30, 2031. After five years, the caps would increase to $600,000 and $1.2 million, respectively.
HB 145 still must be considered by the House Judiciary Committee before it is ready for a House floor vote. Although the bill is being fast tracked in the House and is a priority for House Speaker Daniel Perez, its fate is less certain in the Florida Senate. There is no companion bill filed as of now and the Senate didn’t consider similar legislation last year.
Bob Harris with the Panhandle Area Education Consortium testified that his clients, a group of 14 school districts in northwest Florida, won’t be able to afford the insurance premium increases that, he said, would occur if the bill becomes law.
“The difficulty is this: We know if these increase in caps go in, we’ll see an increase in the number of cases. It’s the pot-of-gold-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow syndrome. We know that will happen,” Harris said.
Sovereign immunity stems from the Latin phrase “rex non potest peccare,” which translates to “the king cannot commit a legal wrong.” In legal terms, it refers to the state’s authority to exempt itself as a legal sovereign from civil lawsuits, although the state does allow negligence claims against itself and its subdivisions — agencies, cities, counties, and public hospitals — within limits.
Complicated process
Injured parties can sue for damages and collect within the liability thresholds established by law, but if they win awards in excess of the limits they must go to the Legislature in the form of what’s called a “claims bill” to collect. But the claims bill process is lengthy. It also allows the defendant to challenge the jury verdict at the legislative level.
Once a claims bill is filed, each chamber’s presiding officer refers it to a special master, who essentially reconsiders the jury’s recommendation. Claims bills also go before House and Senate committees that consider special masters’ recommendations. Ultimately, the bills must pass in both chambers.
McFarland, who has sponsored similar  legislation for the past three years, didn’t disagree that the bill increases liability for government entities.
“I know it’s hard. I know their costs will go up, their costs for insurance, their costs for liability. I know that it will increase. Of course, that’s what the numbers say,” McFarland said. “I’m just saying that its worth it. It’s time to update it. ”
The House this week also passed a bill that allows wrongful death lawsuits for the loss of developing fetuses,

DemasJudge Indira Talwani, in the U.S. District Court in the District of Massachusetts, granted a preliminary injunction to attorneys general and governors in 22 states, including Michigan, seeking to block a provision of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” known as the “Defund Provision.” The law sought to exclude certain health centers, including Planned Parenthood health centers, from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements for any type of health care services. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, one of the attorneys general suing in the case, said in a press release that these health care centers provide essential healthcare services, including cancer screenings and birth control, especially to low-income patients. 
“Unlawfully defunding the health clinics that Michiganders rely on – especially those living in Northern Michigan’s healthcare deserts – would have left residents without access to essential care,” Nessel said in the press release. “I am relieved that the Court saw the Trump Administration’s effort for what it was: another illegal political tactic aimed at undermining the healthcare people need.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit was initially filed in July, and the states asked for the preliminary injunction in September after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled in a separate case that the Defund Provision could go into effect. 
Talwani ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “shall take all steps necessary to ensure that Medicaid funding continues to be disbursed in the customary manner and timeframes to Plaintiff States to reimburse claims without regard to whether the claims were filed by entities that may be ‘prohibited entities’,” requiring the federal government to continue funding medical services at Planned Parenthood and other impacted health centers. 
The order notes that the states are likely to succeed on the merits of their case, which argues that the scope of “prohibited entities” is too vague and unclear as to which health care facilities it would impact, and would be retroactively changing the terms of Medicaid after states had already joined it.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_9096-1-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

“Montana knows better than anyone there’s a right and wrong way to mine,” Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke said in a statement. “Fast tracking a mine with overwhelming public opposition and bypassing the mechanisms that allow for transparency and accountability is the wrong way to do it.”
Representatives from U.S. Critical Materials have said they want to conduct exploratory mining of rare earth minerals to see if a fullscale operation is feasible.
But the mine would be at the headwaters of the Bitterroot River, and the proposal has drawn pushback for numerous reasons, including because mine representatives have not kept locals informed of their plans.

Tuesday, Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy said he supports “unleashing Montana’s resource economy and mining industry,” but he had weighed other considerations, too.
“I also believe local voices must be heard loudest when considering public lands policy,” Sheehy said in a statement. “Regarding the Sheep Creek Mine, local Montanans have made their opposition clear, therefore I oppose efforts to approve the proposed Sheep Creek Mine and encourage the Permitting Council to remove it from their fast-track list.”
A couple of weeks ago, Ravalli County Commissioners learned the Sheep Creek project landed on the federal FAST-41 list of priority infrastructure projects, Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act.
Four other projects are listed as “transparency projects” in Montana, ones posted “in the interest of transparency,” all in the mining sector. They include a Stillwater Mine underground platinum and palladium project in Nye and the Becky’s Mine Modification in Bridger to expand surface mining of bentonite.

At a meeting on Monday about the proposed Sheep Creek project, roughly 700 citizens turned up, according to an estimate in a letter Ravalli County Commissioners sent to members of the Congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte.
“We received NO public testimony in support of including the proposed mine in the FAST41 program,” commissioners wrote in the letter dated Tuesday. “If the mine is to be considered, it MUST be reviewed under the highest environmental standards.”
At the meeting, mine representatives said they were proposing to explore “around” 3.9 acres for critical minerals, including gallium, tied to U.S. defense needs. They described the Sheep Creek area as “a geologic unicorn,” rich with minerals but without some of the environmental challenges in other mountain areas.
U.S. Critical Materials representative Scott Osterman said the FAST-41 acronym was a “misnomer” that incorrectly implied being listed was about “being fast.” However, the federal FAST-41 dashboard said listed projects are in response to Executive Order 14241, which calls for “expedited review” for domestic mineral production.
At the meeting, members of the public said company officials have been opaque or contradictory about their plans, withholding records and keeping Bitterroot Valley residents in the dark, or reporting one thing to Montanans and another to potential investors.
They also questioned whether the company is foreign-owned. At the meeting, Osterman said foreign ownership is “being taken out” and “we’re moving forward with zero foreign ownership.”
In their letter, Ravalli County Commissioners requested a full environmental impact study with no shortcuts or exclusions, “strong environmental protections,” and accountability from U.S. Critical Materials.
They also outlined a list of specific concerns, including water quality and supply; ecological and wildlife impacts, including on species of concern; transparency and public participation, in this case, a lack of it; long-term economic and cultural costs; and local impacts.
Rare-earth mining is “very water intensive,” and water resources may not be adequate to support the operations in the closed basin “without harming existing uses,” the commissioners said. They said exploration could lead to contamination and threats to surface and groundwater.
The commissioners also said the Bitterroot Valley economy is tied to its natural landscape, from agriculture to recreation, and damage to water quality or wildlife “could impose long-term costs on local businesses and livelihoods.”
“There is also a moral and cultural question: Do we want to risk our clean water and heritage for a potentially disruptive industrial operation that may or may not deliver commensurate local benefit?” the commissioners asked.
In a social media post, Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines also raised concerns about the lack of information from U.S. Critical Materials officials to locals.
“We must increase critical mineral mining but in a responsible, locally driven way,” Daines said. “Unfortunately the developers of Sheep Creek Mine didn’t engage w/the local community. Until they do, I can’t support the project & call on the admin to ensure transparency and local engagement in the permitting process.”
Zinke, who represents the western district in Montana, also called for more information from mine representatives and consideration of Ravalli County residents and elected officials.
“Ravalli County officials and residents have been clear in their concerns and opposition to this project,” Zinke said. “It has fallen on deaf ears and they have received no communication from the company. I urge the council to remove Sheep Creek from the FAST 41 process.”
The Permitting Council did not respond Wednesday to a request for comment in time for this story.
Wednesday, the Sheep Creek exploration was still listed as a mining project on the “transparency” dashboard, projects posted in response to the executive order calling for expedited reviews for proposals that would increase American mineral production.

(Photos by Fran Baltzer and Roman Broszkowski)It might seem like democratic socialism is having its moment in the sun, with two of the movement’s members snagging council seats in Jersey City’s runoff election Tuesday just a month after Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayoral race.
Supporters say the wins — marking the first time a democratic socialist has been elected to public office in New Jersey in over a century — represent more than a moment. They signal a trend. And many in the movement, which rejects capitalism in favor of community ownership, have their eyes set on higher office.
“This is watershed for us, absolutely,” said Jake Ephros, who was elected to Jersey City’s council along with fellow democratic socialist Joel Brooks.
The movement’s activists have worked for years to build a bench of electable democratic socialist candidates, relying on labor unions to help grow grassroots support and taking lessons from prominent politicians who identify as democratic socialists including Reps. Alexandria O’Casio Cortez (D-NY) and Rashida Talib (D-MI), a national organizer said.
But the growing resentments of the working class, backlash against corporate-funded Democratic incumbents, and frustration with President Donald Trump’s policies coalesced to ensure a banner year for the Democratic Socialists of America, said Chanpreet Singh, a national electoral organizer with the group.
Voters elected more than half of the 21 democratic socialist candidates the group endorsed and funded across the country this year, including Ephros and Brooks, Singh said.
The group’s fundraising slogan: “Socialist cash takes out capitalist trash.”

“There is a lot of exasperation with the establishment, with the way things are going, just business as usual,” Singh said. “Candidates like Jake and Joel, they championed really bold, unapologetically socialist policies, like universal rent control and child care. These are things that speak to people in a moment when they’re feeling really frustrated, the cost of living is rising, and they want something more than what your typical Democratic incumbent offers.”
The group hopes to get more democratic socialists elected to Congress in coming years, Singh added.
Dan Cassino is a professor of government and law at Fairleigh Dickinson University and the executive director of the school’s poll. He agreed socialism has largely lost the stigma, at least among progressives, that it historically has carried due to its association with authoritarianism.
“In urban areas of New York and New Jersey, socialism just isn’t the bugbear that it used to be,” Cassino said.
While the proportion of New Jersey Democrats who identify as socialists has remained around 10 percent in recent years, even voters who don’t consider themselves socialists are willing to vote for a candidate who is, Cassino said. For Democratic candidates, being an avowed democratic socialist can give them an edge with Democrats who have become alienated from the institutional party, he added.

Still, Cassino noted, political ideology tends to matter less to voters than policy priorities and campaign promises.
“These candidates are running almost more as technocrats than anything else. They’re identifying problems, especially with regard to affordability, and offering what seems to voters to be reasonable solutions to those problems,” Cassino said. “At the end of the day, people want to hear that candidates understand the problems they’re facing, and have a solution. Ideological labels don’t matter as much as a belief that they can solve real problems.”
Ephros and Brooks both ran on platforms focused on affordability and quality-of-life issues, calling for more state funding for schools, the creation of a municipal transit council to improve mass transit, and more investment in public health care, among other things.
Brooks, a labor organizer who will represent Jersey City’s west side, also ran for city council in 2021 but fell short by about 200 votes. He did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Ephros, a teacher and union organizer who will represent the city’s northern neighborhoods, told the New Jersey Monitor that his first priorities, once he’s sworn in next month, will be to enact universal rent control, tackle trash issues including making collection a municipal function instead of privatized, and enforce existing laws to hold absentee landlords accountable for property problems.
Ephros credited his election success partly to the same voter frustrations Singh mentioned, adding that working people overburdened by the ever-climbing cost of living were hungry for change.
And while widespread frustration with Trump’s policies united Democrats and mobilized them to the polls, Ephros thinks his and Brooks’ solutions-focused platforms and can-do attitudes made the difference at the ballot box.
“We can’t only fight against something. We have to be fighting for something. And so we aren’t only saying: ‘Vote for me. I’m going to fight Trump!’ It’s: ‘We’re going to pick up the trash. We’re going to get our streets paved. We’re going to cap our rents. We’re going to fight back against the tax breaks that we’ve been giving billionaire developers on the backs of ordinary homeowners,’” Ephros said. “We’re going to do all of these concrete, tangible, and positive things to make life better for ordinary people here — with their help, not for them, but with them.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-03 22:20:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump plan would weaken vehicle mileage rules that limit air pollution,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/03/trump-fuel-economy-standards/,"The proposal significantly reduces fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year.
The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
“From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers.
The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.
Rule change will save money, Trump says
The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October. according to Kelley Blue Book.
Automakers applauded the planned changes. They had complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.
Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”
“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.
Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards “with real world market conditions.”
Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.
Environmentalists decried the rollback in mileage standards.
“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.
“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program.
Polluting cars to stay on road
“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,” she said.
Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.
No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.
Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.
The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and more 4,870 tons a year of smog components nitrogen oxide volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.
Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25337752433944-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., and Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., sent a letter to Bondi Wednesday urging “transparency and clarity” as the department prepares to release evidence collected during the federal investigation of the sex offender. Epstein died in a Manhattan jail in 2019 awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.“We write as the bipartisan lead sponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act to express our shared interest in supporting the Department of Justice’s efforts to carry out the provisions of this critical new law,” the lawmakers wrote. “In light of the short 30-day deadline to release the Epstein Files, we are particularly focused on understanding the contents of any new evidence, information or procedural hurdles that could interfere with the Department’s ability (to) meet this statutory deadline.”The U.S. House overwhelmingly approved legislation, 427-1, to compel the Justice Department to publicly release the material. The Senate agreed unanimously. President Donald Trump, after months of calling the files a “hoax,” signed the bill into law on Nov. 19, starting the clock for the Dec. 19 release deadline.Epstein surrounded himself with influential politicians and celebrities, and had a well-documented friendship with Trump.‘New information’ emergesThe lawmakers highlighted in the letter that the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a memo in July stating that the department would not be publicly releasing any further information or material related to the Epstein investigation as officials “did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”But on Nov. 14, the department announced the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan would begin “new investigations” into any connections between Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and prominent investor Reid Hoffman.Bondi said Nov. 19 during a press conference that “information has come forward, new information, additional information.”“In the interest of transparency and clarity on the steps required to faithfully implement the Epstein Files Transparency Act, we request a briefing either in a classified or unclassified setting, to discuss the full contents of this new information in your possession at your convenience, but not later than Friday, December 5th, 2025,” the lawmakers wrote to Bondi.The law has a carve-out to exempt the release of any material that is part of an ongoing investigation.In response to States Newsroom’s request for comment, Department of Justice spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre wrote in an email, “I can confirm receipt of the letter but will decline to comment further.”‘Never-before-seen’ Epstein island photos The letter to Bondi comes as Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released “never-before-seen” photos and videos of Epstein’s residence on Little Saint James, a small private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.The committee requested the images from the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Justice as part of the lawmakers’ ongoing inquiry into Epstein’s activities.

“These new images are a disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island. We are releasing these photos and videos to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein’s horrific crimes. We won’t stop fighting until we deliver justice for the survivors,” committee ranking member Robert Garcia said in a statement.Some of the files, released publicly in a cloud folder, contain images of furnished bedrooms, bathrooms, a room with masks on the wall and what appears to be a dental exam chair, a telephone with a list of names on speed dial, some redacted, and a chalkboard with notes, some redacted, containing what appear to be the words “power” and “deception.”

Videos reveal a large compound with an inground swimming pool and winding stone walkway toward the sea, as well as short clips of bedrooms and at least one medicine cabinet.The Republican-led committee investigation began in August and is separate from the new law requiring the Justice Department’s disclosure of evidence.

Committee Republicans did not publish a press release as of Wednesday afternoon on the Democrats’ release of the images and videos.Last month, committee Democrats released select emails provided by Epstein’s estate. Within hours, committee Republicans released a cache of 23,000 pages of correspondence.

The committee, chaired by Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., has issued several subpoenas, including one to the Department of Justice for all Epstein investigation files. Others include subpoenas to interview Epstein’s co-conspirator and convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell, Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and several former attorneys general.Epstein had over 1,000 victims, according to the FBI.Epstein, a former hedge fund manager who claimed he only managed assets for billionaires, pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting sex from a minor and soliciting prostitution. He avoided a federal investigation when the then-U.S. attorney in Miami, Alex Acosta, cut the plea deal with Florida prosecutors.Acosta would later become Trump’s Labor secretary in 2017.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

Dec. 3, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Capitol’s annual Christmas tree-lighting event that has been marked in recent years by singing children and sometimes interrupted by protests focusing attention elsewhere is getting more private in a public place.
Gov. Jim Pillen moved this year’s event to 6 p.m., after the Capitol’s public hours, and required tickets obtained from state senators to attend. The Governor’s Office said it was an effort to keep the event focused on the season’s meaning. 
The move spurred some criticism from lawmakers, including State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, who argued in a Facebook post that the people’s event in the people’s house should be open to the public and questioned why lawmakers needed to handle tickets.

Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the program was moved partly to make sure the lighting happened after the sun had gone down and that ticketing was required to host an event in the Capitol after regular business hours.
She also acknowledged that the changes came a year after people posted videos on social media of protesters in support of Palestine last year that some 2024 attendees complained interrupted the flow and feel of the celebration for student performers and families.
“In recent years, this wonderful Christmas program has been severely disrupted by Free Palestine and assorted other radical protesters,” Strimple said. “That has been frightening for kids in attendance and a serious concern from a security standpoint.” 
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, in a Facebook post, said her office had received ticket allotments from other senators and would work with others to make sure the public could still attend. She asked people to reach out if they needed tickets.
“The holiday season should extend goodwill to all Nebraskans who want to join together for the traditional tree-lighting festivities in the people’s house,” Conrad wrote.

Last year, some social media posters amplified the tree-lighting protest as evidence of Christians being bullied and praised the response of the Nebraska State Patrol, which removed at least one person for yelling during the event.  
Others questioned why the Christmas-themed event was being held in a public building and venue, in a seat of state government meant to represent a pluralistic society of multiple faiths, including the right of Nebraskans to worship no faith.
Pillen has argued that too many of Nebraska’s Christians and people of faith have been too quiet. He blamed the majority’s silence for a lack of moral clarity. He recently visited Israel, meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the American ambassador, Mike Huckabee.
Strimple said the revamped process was “designed” to ensure that the ceremony remains accessible and safe for the families and several “small children who attend.” Some expect protesters to make their way in and exercise their First Amendment rights. 
“Hopefully, this change will help ensure this Christmas program can be enjoyed safely, securely and without disruption for the families in attendance,” Strimple said.

,DC,2025-12-03 22:03:57+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House punts vote on college-athlete compensation bill,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-punts-vote-college-athlete-compensation-bill,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House GOP leadership pulled a bill from the House floor Wednesday that would set a national framework for college-athletes’ compensation. The Student Compensation and Opportunity through Rights and Endorsements, or ‘‘SCORE” Act, would bar student-athletes from being recognized as employees and provide broad antitrust immunity to the NCAA and college sports conferences. The measure was on the House schedule for Wednesday, before the office of Majority Whip Tom Emmer announced Wednesday afternoon its consideration would be postponed. The notice did not provide a reason for the cancellation, as is typical. The bill’s lead sponsors are GOP Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida and Democratic Reps. Janelle Bynum of Oregon and Shomari Figures of Alabama.The other original co-sponsors are all Republicans: House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, Education and Workforce Committee Chair Tim Walberg of Michigan, and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Lisa McClain of Michigan, Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin and Russell Fry of South Carolina.Bipartisan oppositionThe bill has faced widespread Democratic opposition over concerns it would roll back student-athletes’ rights and give “unchecked authority” to the NCAA while failing to protect student-athletes. Though the bill has garnered broad GOP support, some in the party have pushed back against it. House GOP critics include Texas’ Chip Roy, who dubbed the bill a “Band-Aid on a gunshot wound” during a House Rules Committee hearing Monday. Roy, along with fellow House Freedom Caucus members, Byron Donalds of Florida and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, joined Democrats in voting against the rule governing floor debate alongside several other measures Tuesday. The rule was still adopted, 210-209. The bill advanced in July out of the House Energy and Commerce and Education and Workforce committees, which have jurisdiction over elements of the bill.The college sports world has grappled with the fallout from the NCAA’s 2021 guidelines, which let student-athletes profit from their name, image and likeness, or NIL. A patchwork of NIL laws exists across states, with no federal NIL law in place. In June, a federal judge approved the terms of a nearly $2.8 billion antitrust settlement that paved the way for schools to directly pay athletes. Senate Dems’ competing billMeanwhile, the bill would face a tough path in the Senate, where Democrats have expressed opposition. Democratic Sens. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced competing NIL-related legislation in September. Known as the Student Athlete Fairness and Enforcement Act, or “SAFE Act,” the bill “gives all athletes Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) rights, establishes uniform health and safety standards, protects scholarships and requires agents to register with a state and abide by clear contract requirements, including a 5 percent cap on fees,” according to Democrats on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, where Cantwell serves as ranking member.",,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

The Vermont Conversation with David Goodman is a VTDigger podcast that features in-depth interviews on local and national issues. Listen below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get podcasts.




Leila Stillman-Utterback graduated from Middlebury Union High School in June and decided to take a gap year to pursue a dream. The 18-year-old Vermonter traveled to Israel to participate in a solidarity program that included  volunteering with Rabbis for Human Rights in the Israeli-occupied West Bank to help Palestinians harvest olives. She was part of an effort to provide “protective presence” for Palestinians who are under constant attack from right-wing Israeli settlers. She said she wanted to live the Jewish values of tikkun olam (repairing the world) and b’tselem elohim (a belief that everyone is created in God’s image). 
On October 29, Stillman-Utterback was detained by Israeli soldiers, spent a night handcuffed in a police station and was accused of violating the terms of her tourist visa by entering a closed military zone. After being hauled before a judge at 3 a.m., she was deported and banned from Israel for 10 years.
Leila’s treatment at the hands of Israeli authorities was deeply personal for her mother. Danielle Stillman is the rabbi of Middlebury College. She teaches the values that Leila is living. Her daughter is now paying the price. 
The Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu may have hoped that by coming down hard on a young American activist that it would silence her. The opposite has occurred. Stillman-Utterback has spoken out in multiple interviews in the Israeli press. 
“My deportation felt like a betrayal,” wrote Stillman-Utterback in a powerful essay about her ordeal in The Forward, an independent Jewish American news publication. “Israel was supposed to be for me, for every Jew. But the settler movement and the current government would like to redefine what it means to be Jewish along political lines.”
Stillman-Utterback rejects the notion that criticizing Israel is somehow antisemitic. “I’ve grown up my entire life with a connection to Israel, with a love for it even,” she told The Vermont Conversation. “I have also grown up my entire life being allowed to be critical of Israel and … frustrated [and] angry.” She added that it was essential that “in a time of real rising antisemitism globally, that we are able to hold criticism and love at the same time. I really do think that it’s possible.”
Stillman-Utterback’s treatment is part of a larger crackdown on Palestinians and Jewish activists by the Israeli government and right-wing settlers who operate with near impunity in Palestinian communities. In October, there were 126 olive harvest-related settler attacks against Palestinians, and Israel detained and deported 32 foreign activists who were accompanying Palestinian harvesters near the town of Burin, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Stillman-Utterback, who two years ago was named a Bronfman Fellow, a cohort of high-achieving Jewish teens, is appealing her ban from Israel and is committed to staying engaged. “We need to maintain our relationships in order to show that there are people who are committed to a peaceful and just future. It doesn’t matter what it looks like, whether it’s a two state solution, whether it’s binational, it only matters that that we end the violence and that we end the occupation, that we move towards equality. Any movement towards equality and towards an end in violence, towards accountability for settler actions, is a move in the right direction.”
Rabbi Danielle Stillman said that she’s “inspired by [Leila’s] principled willingness to hang in with Israel despite this really harrowing, dramatic experience, and that that really comes from her Jewish values … to contribute to building a better society in a place that she’s come to really care about.”
Rabbi Stillman said that American Jews are deeply divided about Israel, especially along generational lines. A recent Washington Post survey found that just over half of Jewish Americans — and two thirds of those over 65 — say they are emotionally attached to Israel, but only about one third of those ages 18 to 34 feel that attachment. About half of younger Jews are more likely to say Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, compared to about one third of older Jews.
Leila’s arrest and expulsion “just makes me really concerned about the future of the relationship between Israel and the diaspora, between American Jews and Israeli Jews,” said Rabbi Stillman.
Rabbi Stillman criticized how antisemitism is being “used in a certain way to further an agenda of silencing solidarity with Palestinians and silencing speech in general on many college campuses.”
Leila Stillman-Utterback is now back home in Middlebury figuring out what she will do with the rest of her gap year before attending Williams College in the fall of 2026.  She expressed gratitude towards her parents. 
“I was taught to always stay in a place of not knowing, even if it’s uncomfortable, and I feel immensely grateful for never being told that only one answer is right, and for always being taught to live in that liminal space.”

(Kennedy Thomason/ Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma electric utility company requested that a commissioner on a governing board recuse himself from a case because of an “unacceptable bias.” 
Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company, or OG&E, requested on Nov. 26 that Corporation Commissioner Todd Hiett recuse himself from a case that would allow the company to expand its power generation sites. This includes building natural gas turbines at the Horseshoe Lake Power Plant in Oklahoma County, which OG&E estimated would total more than $506 million in capital costs. 
Hiett said in a filing that OG&E would recover these millions from ratepayers. 
The Oklahoma Corporation Commission is a three-person statewide elected board that regulates the state’s oil and gas, utility and transportation industries.
OG&E’s general counsel Chase Snodgrass argued in a filing that Hiett’s public comments demonstrate a bias against the company and he should recuse because “actual bias and the appearance of bias” violate Oklahoma’s ethical rules for public officials.  
Hiett said OG&E is “evil” and called the company a monopoly spreading “propaganda,” according to Snodgrass’ filing. 
“So, this is nothing more than the monopolies – once again, just like they have been doing at the Legislature, but now they are doing it at the Commission, they are trying to capture this regulatory body, utilize this regulatory body through an order to promote propaganda,” Hiett said at a public meeting Nov. 13, according to the filing. 
“What we have in the state of Oklahoma is the two major utilities, both PSO and OG&E, have been working for several years over at the Legislature to systematically do two things, remove themselves from regulation and strengthen their monopoly status.”
At the same meeting, he said utilities have spent millions to send out mailers to consumers with “propoganda” about saving millions. 
Hiett declined to comment Wednesday, but said he would offer comment at the Corporation Commission’s meeting Thursday. 
Christi Woodworth, OG&E’s vice president of marketing and communications, said in a statement that the company didn’t want to take this action but was forced to because of Hiett’s comments. 
OG&E did not send any mailers, she said. 
“This case is about ensuring sufficient power generation for OG&E to serve our customers …,” she said. “On Nov. 13, the Commission approved three projects selected through the Commission’s competitive bid process. We also requested to use a particular accounting treatment that would have saved our customers $176 million in unnecessary interest costs over the life of the project.”

(Courtesy photo)The Rhode Island State Police’s second-in-command will step down from his $250,000-a-year job to ensure the state’s Roman Catholic clergy and staff adhere to the law and their own internal policies.
Lt. Col Robert Creamer was tapped by the Diocese of Providence Tuesday to be its next director of compliance, a role established in 1993 as part of its “commitment to protecting children,” according to the church’s announcement.
Creamer begins his new job Jan. 5.
He will succeed Kevin O’Brien, himself a former major and commander with the State Police who has led the office since 2015.
Creamer will be responsible for ensuring that diocesan entities and employees “follow policies, procedures, and law.” That will include overseeing investigations, background checks of clergy and employees, alongside cooperation with law enforcement.
District Court Judge Stephen M. Isherwood, who chairs the Diocesan Review Board for the Protection of Children and Youth, described Creamer’s new role as one that necessitates “a diversity of talents.”
The Bishop Bruce Lewandowski said Creamer is more than up to the task.
“Col. Creamer brings to our diocese his extensive career experience and stellar reputation as a top leader in our state’s law enforcement,” he said in a statement.
A parishioner at St. Peter’s Church in Warwick, Creamer is a graduate of Providence College where he received a bachelor’s degree in finance. He received a master’s degree in cybersecurity from the University of Rhode Island and one in business administration from Bryant University.
Creamer’s career with the State Police spans nearly 29 years. 
According to his LinkedIn, Creamer started as a trooper in June 1997 — a position he held through 2009. He then served as the officer-in-charge of the State Police’s major crimes unit and directed its detective bureau.
Under Col. Darnell Weaver’s leadership, Creamer was promoted to the No. 2 position of deputy superintendent and chief of field operations in 2022, which involves helping to oversee the 650 employees that make up the state’s Department of Public Safety. He is also the public information officer for the State Police.
Creamer told Rhode Island Current he will leave the State Police on Jan. 2.
His replacement has not been announced.

McCuskey has filed documents in a federal appeals court supporting the continued presence of National Guard members in Washington, D.C.
Twenty-three attorneys general from other states joined McCuskey in a friend of the court brief, filed Tuesday, that pushed back on a federal judge’s recent ruling that President Donald Trump’s deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to D.C. was illegal.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey supported Trump’s proposed “crime crackdown” in the nation’s capital, sending 300 state National Guard members to D.C. in response. 
Nearly 2,000 National Guard troops are in D.C. West Virginia National Guard members who have remained in D.C. — about 160 to 170 troops — have volunteered to be there, according to Morrisey. 
Two members of the West Virginia National Guard were shot last week while on duty blocks from the White House. U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died on Thanksgiving as a result of her injuries, and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in the hospital with severe wounds.  
“This mission has already produced strong results, but still more work must be done, and danger still lingers,” wrote the attorneys general, including McCuskey.
U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb said Trump sending National Guard members to D.C. was “unlawful,” and she sided with D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who sued the federal government over the Guard deployment. Schwalb also argued that it exceeded the president’s legal authority. 
The judge paused the order until Dec. 11 to give the Trump administration time to appeal the decision. The Trump administration has already filed an appeal, asking to stop the preliminary injunction and saying the National Guard deployment is legal.
McCuskey and his colleagues support the Trump administration’s authority to authorize the National Guard in D.C. They believe the president has legitimate authority to make that call and that their presence has helped reduce crime in the nation’s capital. The brief filed by attorneys general was first reported by MetroNews. 
Residents, government officials and federal workers and more “have endured assault, robberies at gunpoint, and even murder,” the attorneys general wrote. 
They continued, “President Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in the District has caused crime rates to drop substantially.”
The attorneys general also said that “troops have worked on beautification projects to clean up neighborhoods.” 
“This type of work supports the efforts to prevent crime by ensuring that those neighborhoods are not ‘recognized as invitations to violent and property crimes,’” they said.
The attorneys general pushed for a stay in the injunction so that Trump can continue his efforts to decrease crime in D.C., “but still more work must be done, and danger still lingers.”
“Not only is the President likely to succeed on the merits, but the equities weigh heavily in favor of a stay,” they wrote. 
U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth pledged last week to send 500 additional troops to D.C. following the shooting of two West Virginia guard members. West Virginia has not been asked to send additional guard members, according to the governor. 
Following the shooting of Beckstrom and Wolfe, Morrisey has been questioned about his decision to send National Guard members to D.C. Only six states sent Guard members to participate in Trump’s “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.” 
Earlier this week, the West Virginia Democratic Party called on Morrisey to clarify the scope and purpose of the ongoing deployment of Guard personnel to D.C., “particularly in light of multiple public reports documenting that Guard units — including those from West Virginia — have been assigned to landscaping, beautification and trash-removal duties in the nation’s capital.”
“At a moment when families are grieving and communities are asking hard questions, it is entirely appropriate for the governor to explain the true nature and purpose of this deployment,” said Mike Pushkin, chair of the state Democratic Party.
The West Virginia National Guard said in August that, “WVNG service members are not conducting beautification projects, such as litter collection and site restoration.”
In the wake of the shooting, Morrisey has stressed that any remaining members in D.C. are there on a voluntary basis and support the mission.

(By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) Deering High School senior Jack Borland said during his sophomore year he wanted to start a club. He told his soccer teammates about it after practice one day, hoping they’d join. They nodded along politely, he said, but when the first meeting rolled around only one showed up: Joel Andre. 
“That’s the kind of person Joel is: loyal, supportive,” Borland said. “He’s the guy who shows up when no one else does.”
On Wednesday, hundreds of people showed up for Joel Andre and his family, including another Portland high schooler, who are now detained in Texas. Students and teachers walked out of class and were joined by local and state officials and other community members to protest in Portland. 
Border agents in New York detained the mother and her three teenage children in November after the family attempted to seek asylum in Canada. An immigration judge had issued a deportation order for the family in February and their appeal for asylum in the U.S. was denied in October, court records show. The family is originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and first entered the U.S. in 2022, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The mother, Carine Balenda Mbizi, and oldest sibling, 19-year-old Olivia Mabiala Andre, are currently detained in Texas at the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, according to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainee locator system. The system doesn’t track people under 18 years old and therefore doesn’t capture records for the two high schoolers, though they are believed to also be at that facility. 
During the protest, which was organized by the youth activist group Voices for Portland Maine Students, attendees marched along Congress Street from Monument Square to City Hall. Speakers including Borland called for broad changes to immigration policy, to one that centers individual humanity, and shared stories about how their classmates bettered their community.

Casco Bay High School teacher Kerry Herlihy said Joel Andre’s sister, Estafania Andre, was consistently the first student in her room each morning. She is a gifted writer with many passions, Herlihy said, including being “married to math after a rocky courtship,” as Estafania Andre had put it.
Herlihy said Estafania Andre had dreams for her future, including working for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and making her community a better place. 
“Don’t we want a future where that kind of determination and joy is rewarded and cultivated?” Herlihy asked. 
The protest was spearheaded by Casco Bay seniors Evie Jones and Caroline Chong, who began the rally with chants including, “No hate, no fear. Refugees are welcome here.”

Some of the speakers know firsthand what it is like to navigate the U.S. immigration system, including state Rep. Deqa Dhalac, who left her home country of Somalia before the start of the civil war that still lingers today. 
“We can and must reimagine a system that centers dignity and fairness,” Dhalac said. The South Portland Democrat is the sponsor of a bill that seeks to place restrictions on local immigration enforcement activities, which the Maine Legislature passed earlier this year but the governor delayed her decision on until next year. 
Several speakers called for policy change but also a general change in how the country views immigrants. 
“If we as a nation wish to evolve beyond this, if we wish to overcome these cycles of oppression,” said Omari Brent, a junior at Waynflete, “we must embrace and we must never exclude.” 
Casco Bay senior Lachlan Gartland is in a mentor group with Estafania Andre. When he heard what happened to the freshman student and her family, he told Maine Morning Star he was outraged but didn’t know what to do. The protest on Wednesday provided the tangible action he and many others were seeking. 
“Obviously, we’re not going to topple the government. Obviously, we’re not going to take over the world,” Gartland said. “But we can change it while we exist in it. That’s what’s important. That’s the message I hope that is portrayed today.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5340-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 16:58:53.207857

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Prosecutors in Salt Lake City filed a criminal charge Wednesday against the armed security volunteer who mistakenly shot and killed an innocent bystander at a No Kings protest in June. 
Matthew Scott Alder, 43, of Murray, is charged with one count of manslaughter, a second-degree felony. 
“While you may have a right to use lethal force, that doesn’t mean that lethal force can be used in a reckless manner,” Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill told reporters Wednesday in announcing the criminal charge. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Gill’s decision to prosecute comes nearly six months after the fatal shooting of Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo, a father and fashion designer from Clearfield. Ah Loo was taking video of fellow protesters marching in downtown Salt Lake City when he was killed on June 14. 
Alder fired three shots in total, also wounding his intended target, a man carrying a rifle. He told investigators he thought the man was about to commit a mass shooting when he shot toward a crowd on State Street, Gill said. An attorney who previously represented Alder did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Ah Loo’s widow, Laura Ah Loo, said in a news conference the district attorney’s decision to file a criminal charge represents “a significant first step in the right direction and establish a precedent that I hope will lead to a safer environment of public gatherings in the future.” 
Laura Ah Loo said the months since her husband’s death “have been long, painful and deeply frustrating” as her family has waited for answers. She held back tears as she talked about her grief and said her husband was an incredible father.

Police did not initially arrest Alder, identifying him as a peacekeeper who was working with protest organizers at the event. Gill said he’s not asking for Alder to be jailed before trial because he doesn’t see him as a flight risk. Instead, Gill said he’ll request a summons ordering him to appear in court. 
On the day of the protest, police did arrest Arturo Gamboa, the man who was carrying the rifle that day, as Utah law allows, but did not shoot anyone. Gamboa spent almost a week in jail and was released without being charged with any crime. His attorney Greg Skordas has said his weapon was unloaded and pointing down at the time he was shot. 
Gill confirmed Wednesday that his office is not filing criminal charges against Gamboa, saying there’s insufficient evidence he committed a crime. 
Gill, a Democrat, noted state law permits people to openly carry guns in public spaces and called Utah’s self-defense law “robust,” saying together, those factors can leave innocent bystanders vulnerable to being shot. 
Alder is not charged with wounding Gamboa, Gill said, because Utah law shields him from such liability.
If convicted in Ah Loo’s death, he faces up to 15 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

His first day as the director will be July 1.,"The Mississippi Department of Archives and History announced Wednesday that Barry White will succeed Katie Blount as the agency’s director when Blount retires next year.
White has been director of  the department’s  Historic Preservation Division since 2020.
In his current role, he administers statewide grant programs, oversees major preservation initiatives and works on building partnerships with local, state and federal agencies. He is also part of the leadership team for the partnership between Archives and History and Mississippi State University to turn Historic Jefferson College near Natchez into a regional hub for education, research and workforce development. 
White will begin transitioning to his new role early next year. His first day as the director will be July 1, after Blount steps down.
“Our stories belong to every Mississippian, and I am committed to strengthening our connections to communities across the state,” White said in a press release. “As we look to the future, collaboration will continue to drive our efforts to preserve and share Mississippi’s history in meaningful ways.”
MDAH announced Blount’s planned retirement in August. After becoming director in 2015, she oversaw the opening of the Two Mississippi Museums in 2017 and helped efforts to redesign the state flag in 2020. She is the second woman to hold the position. The American Association for State and Local History gave her a lifetime achievement award in June.
“Barry has earned the trust of colleagues and communities throughout Mississippi,” Blount said in the press release Wednesday. “He’s forged strong relationships with key stakeholders through his thoughtful approach to preservation and his dedication to public service.
Spence Flatgard, president of  the Archives and History Board of Trustees, said, “Katie Blount’s leadership has strengthened this agency in profound and lasting ways, and Barry is the right person to lead MDAH into our next chapter. His experience, integrity, and relationships across the state give him a deep understanding of both our mission and our partners who help carry us forward.”

(Photo: Ahmed Jallow/NC Newsline) Ten North Carolina school districts will share more than $392 million in state lottery-funded grants to replace and renovate aging facilities, state education officials said Wednesday.
The grants target some of the state’s most economically distressed counties. The projects cover seven elementary schools, two high schools, and one Career and Technical Education center. They involve the complete renovation of two existing buildings and the construction of 14 replacements.
State officials said several of the facilities slated for demolition were built in the 1950s and 1960s.
“This funding is critical to sustaining and nurturing excellence in North Carolina public schools. It’s an important step in our journey to ensure that a zip code does not determine the quality of a child’s education,” state Superintendent of Public InstructionMo Green said during a press conference.
Altogether, the state received 92 applications totaling nearly $2 billion in requested funding, but only 10 districts were selected, according to officials. The Department of Public Instruction reviewed each proposal against seven criteria established in state law, including the county’s economic tier designation and the severity of facility deficiencies.
“These projects will transform the learning environments and positively impact the daily lives of thousands of children and families across the state,” said Nathan Maune, Director of the Office of School Facilities.
In Transylvania County, Superintendent Lisa Fletcher said the investment, which includes rebuilding the high school campus and adding a new CTE facility, represents more than bricks and mortar.
“We’re doing this so a student who loves working with their hands can learn a trade in a space that looks like a real shop,” Fletcher said. “We’re doing this so a student who dreams of nursing and physical therapy can practice in a space that looks like a real clinic.”
Tyrrell County, the state’s smallest school district with 436 students, will use its $62 million award for a new PK–13 facility to replace aging, flood-prone buildings. “This is going to be a state-of-the-art facility for students in early childhood development through grade 13,” said Tyrell County School Superintendent Brianna Williams.
The grants represent the largest one-year allocation from the state’s lottery-funded school construction program since its creation in 2017, officials said.
Awards are capped at $42 million for elementary, $52 million for middle, and $62 million for high school projects.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2114-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-03 16:58:53.207857

(Photos by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch. Logo via Iowa Board of Regents)The Iowa Board of Regents has charged its investment and finance committee with taking another look at increasing efficiencies in public higher education and identifying potential new revenue streams as the future of higher education becomes more uncertain.
Regent Sherry Bates, in her capacity as president, called upon regents and committee members Kurt Tjaden, Nancy Dunkel and Christine Hensley to undertake the “revenue enhancement efficiency study” and bring recommendations to the board.
“The board has been clear that this is a priority, and our universities have been doing their part, but the time is right for a new formal review to see what additional measures can be undertaken,” Bates said.

Each of the universities governed by the board have already been identifying and implementing administrative savings and efficiencies “for some time,” Bates said, leading to the state of Iowa ranking fourth in the U.S. for most efficient administrative costs.
Board of Regents Executive Director Mark Braun said during the meeting this review is similar to past studies of revenue streams and cost-saving measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and in 2014. Board documents described these previous reviews as “fruitful,” but stated further study should be conducted with the uncertain future of higher education.
Launched in 2014 and worked on for multiple years, the Transparent, Inclusive Efficiency Review, or TIER, was an undertaking by the board, universities and consultants contracted with the board to find opportunities to reduce costs, increase savings or improve service. From this review, the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and University of Northern Iowa each created task forces and plans to improve in areas of virtual and distance learning, enrollment management and the availability and efficiency of courses and resources.
Regent Kurt Tjaden, chair of the investment and finance committee, said he agrees with Bates that while “universities have done excellent work in this area,” more work is still necessary. He said he looks forward to heading the committee’s efforts in the study and will provide updates to the full board “on a regular basis.”
“This strategic opportunity is an ability to jointly engage the board, office, regent institutions, and third party experts, to challenge and expand our thinking and explore new areas of opportunity to ensure our future financial foundation remains strong,” Tjaden said.

Dec. 2, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan Advance The Michigan Senate is considering a pair of payroll tax withholding bills in the spirit of the since-expired “Good Jobs for Michigan” and other economic development programs that were not extended by the Legislature.
Members of the Senate Regulatory Affairs Committee took testimony Tuesday on Senate Bill 472 and Senate Bill 473, both sponsored by state Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing). The package, if passed as introduced, would task the Michigan Strategic Fund with creating a new jobs program where eligible businesses could apply for withheld tax capture revenue collected under the Michigan Income Tax Act. Payment would be contingent on fulfilling a set of goals outlined in the bill, such as tangible efforts to create new jobs or maintain protected jobs in the state.
A fund would also be created to further that goal, managed by the Michigan Department of Treasury. Businesses deemed eligible that have signed written agreements with the state could receive up to 100% of withholding tax capture revenues for certified new jobs for a period of up to 10 years, and the Strategic Fund would be allowed to extend the period by up to 10 years if certain requirements were met.
An eligible business could also receive up to 100% of withholding tax capture revenues for protected jobs for a period of up to 20 years. 

 


The requirements for eligibility include: 

25 or more certified new jobs that paid at least 175% of the prosperity region median wage;
25 or more certified new jobs at a facility in a county with a population of up to 50,000 that paid at least 135% of the prosperity region median wage;
250 or more certified new jobs that paid at least 150% of the prosperity region median wage; and
1,000 or more certified new jobs that paid at least 150% of the prosperity region median wage, if the applicant also proposed investments in the facility that exceeded $1 billion.




Singh said that the bills, introduced in June, were similar to the state’s previous Good Jobs for Michigan program. The “good jobs” program had a two year sunset, but the Legislature did not extend the sunset. That opened the opportunity to create a new tool – the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, or SOAR, which has been the subject of controversy and has a poor track record in fulfilling its stated goal.
“I don’t know if I’ve found anyone in either party or either chamber that has been very excited about that program,” Singh said. “That program has sort of lived its life and it’s time for us to find different types of tools.”
Singh added that the goal of the proposed “prosperity regions” and median hourly rates are to ensure that the jobs being created and incentivized are higher paying jobs compared to the median wage of the area.
Singh said he had some conversations with colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, which led him to consider that some smaller counties might not ever get to the 150% or 175% threshold of the median income, so a piece was created in the bill for rural areas, with businesses there being able to apply with targets of jobs with pay 135% of the area median wage.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Again, this is for smaller projects, so 25 new jobs, and we specifically gear that toward counties of 50,000 and below,” Singh said.
Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield), the committee’s chair, said Singh was taking a thoughtful approach to hear concerns on all sides. He added that all of the incentives mentioned could be for naught if the Legislature can’t get local government and agency buy-in. Moss said he fought for that with the Good Jobs legislation and with SOAR, but he didn’t have to do that this time because Singh baked in local hearings and community votes as part of the new process.
Singh said local control was definitely a component in the new legislation.
“We can always create stronger language if there is a desire, but we want to allow the local community the ability to sort of create what the right mechanism is for themselves,” Singh said.
Sen. Dan Lauwers (R-Brockway) said that programs like the one being proposed, and previously enacted, tend to take taxpayer money from businesses and if they are not eligible, they don’t receive the incentive, but a competitor might now have an advantage.
“It seems a little unrealistic in even how it operates,” Lauwers added. “If these programs took people that were not working and put them to work, I would be recommending this. That’s great, but I have lived through enough of these programs to know what happens when a new employer comes to town and they pay a premium over the going rate. It’s not the people who aren’t working who go to work for this new company. It’s the people that are already working for me and my other colleagues.”
Lauwers said that puts businesses in positions where they now have to go out and recruit, which could take years and additional investment.
The committee took no further action on the bills.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251202_145458-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-03 16:58:53.207857
,DC,2025-12-03 21:05:12+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate panel seeks speedy bipartisan deal on health insurance subsidies,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-panel-seeks-speedy-bipartisan-deal-health-insurance-subsidies,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate committee that oversees health care started coalescing around an approach to lower costs for Americans during a Wednesday hearing, though several hurdles lay ahead.Republicans and Democrats on the panel appeared to accept that enhanced tax credits for people who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace should not expire at the end of the year. Just days are left for open enrollment and premiums are expected to greatly increase. The bipartisan momentum among a select group of senators will need to build significantly in the days ahead if an extension of the subsidies is going to speedily garner the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate and then move through the GOP-controlled House. It will also need President Donald Trump’s signature to become law, and he has so far not signaled support for an extension.“I'm hoping that we can find a bill that can get 60 votes, that can fix the problem with the exchanges for January 1, 2026,” Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., said. “It shouldn't be a Republican solution. It shouldn’t be a Democratic solution. It should be an American solution.”Cassidy cautioned lawmakers on the panel from pressing for “grandiose ideas,” saying Congress must “have a solution for three weeks from now.”  A ‘political problem’ seen for the GOPBut extending the ACA marketplace subsidies, possibly with tweaks, is just a short-term solution that senators on the committee agreed will need to be followed up with an overhaul of the American health care system. Any efforts on larger-scale legislation will bump up against the deeply entrenched politics of the Affordable Care Act, well-funded lobbyists and next year’s midterm elections, none of which will make the process easy. Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, the ranking member on the panel, said he appreciated Cassidy’s “sentiment about wanting to do something quickly,” but said Republicans should have focused on the expiring ACA tax credits earlier in the year, instead of leaving it until now.  “The reason for this hearing, to be frank, is that my Republican friends understand they’ve got a political problem,” Sanders said. “Their political problem is that all over America today, people on the Affordable Care Act are opening up packages coming from the insurance companies, and guess what? Their premiums on average are doubling and in some cases in my state are tripling or quadrupling.”Sanders said Congress should extend the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits for another year, or two, or three, while lawmakers sort through larger, structural issues around health care costs. “Yes, the current system is broken. Yes, we need to create a new system,” Sanders said. “But unfortunately, we aren't going to do it in two weeks.”Sanders suggested the committee hold a series of hearings in the months ahead featuring leaders from other developed countries that provide health care to all of their residents.Extensions of tax credits debatedMaine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said “there's a limit to what we can do in this first year” and that lawmakers are “going to need a two-year plan.”Collins indicated that she wants to see “reasonable” income caps to limit eligibility for ACA marketplace tax credits in any short-term extension that Congress may pass. Washington state Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said Republicans who are serious about addressing the spike in costs for ACA marketplace enrollees should work with Democrats to pass a “clean, one-year extension” of the enhanced subsidies. “And if their call for reforming tax credits is serious, we should look at that. We can talk about those reforms ahead of the 2027 year,” Murray said. “But I have to say, I'm not optimistic that most Republicans are serious about this because they refused to talk about this problem before right now, and I've been down this road before.”Murray also rebuked Cassidy for not focusing the committee’s attention on the expiring tax credits earlier in the year by taking a swipe at his vote to confirm Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.“This is about as serious as expressing concern about RFK Jr.'s anti-vax crusade after voting to make him the most powerful public health official in the country,” Murray said.‘Reasonable caps’ backedAlaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said members of the committee need to focus on what the next few months and years look like for Americans' health care costs. “I think we're going to need to have a short-term extension. But I think we can put reasonable caps on. I think that we can put some of the parameters that we have been talking about. There's no great secret sauce here to how we're going to deal with this particular dilemma that we're in,” Murkowski said. “But we've got to be looking longer term to — how do we ultimately reduce these costs of care?”Murkowski said she was also concerned about a decrease in funding for public health and prevention initiatives, before asking the witnesses appearing before the committee what their top recommendations would be for “prevention-type programs that have the strongest evidence for reducing long-term costs.”Joel White, president of the Council for Affordable Health Coverage in Washington, D.C., said Congress should allow “premium discounts in the individual market for wellness programs,” which he said is currently illegal.Marcie Strouse, owner and partner at Capitol Benefits Group in Des Moines, Iowa, suggested lawmakers open up health savings accounts “to allow for more holistic and preventive services.” She also said Congress could highlight “direct primary care and making sure people are actually getting the care that they need.”Dr. Claudia M. Fegan, national coordinator at Physicians for a National Health Program in Chicago, suggested enhanced primary care and screening people for diseases like cancer that can be easier to treat when caught early. Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the hearing clearly demonstrated that there is “underlying agreement that this system needs a lot of reform.”But, she said, Congress needs to take a look at the entire health care system, not just the Affordable Care Act. “I want to make a point that just under 50% of Americans get their health insurance through employers or group insurance, 20% are on Medicaid, 15% on Medicare, 1% on TRICARE or VA, and just over 6% are in this market,” Baldwin said. “There are problems with this market. But I have to say that abandoning the ACA … is not going to solve the system as a whole.”Ohio Republican Sen. Jon Husted appeared supportive of a short-term extension of the enhanced ACA tax credits to provide Congress more time to address larger issues with health care affordability.“We can freeze the subsidies where they're at right now for a temporary period of time. I don't know if that's one year or two years to help give some relief,” he said. “And by the way, just because we continue those tax credits does not drive down the cost. It transfers the burden to the taxpayer and future generations. But it is a little help right now that we both can agree on. And then we’ve got to fix it.” Husted said there are easily a dozen bills that Congress could take up individually to start bringing down health care costs. Hawley offers plan for health costs tax exemptionMissouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley also appeared to side with extending the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits in the short term.“We are looking at a massive crisis unless Congress acts and acts soon,” Hawley said. “And my message is to the leadership of this body — to the leaders of the House, the leaders of the Senate —maybe it's time we all locked ourselves in a room and got to a solution here.”Halwey pitched a bill he just introduced to exempt health care from taxes. “If you pay premiums, you ought to be able to deduct that from your taxes. If you have out-of-pocket medical expenses, you ought to be able to deduct every dollar off of your taxes. You want to lower the cost of health care immediately. Do that. No taxes on health care for any American,” Hawley said. “And you set an upper limit so you don't have rich people gaming the system. I get it. That's fine. But let's think about working people in this country who cannot afford health care.”Hawley said it should be allowed whether an American itemizes on their taxes or not. All three panelists seemed initially supportive of the idea. Redoing tax credits in 2026Cassidy said after the two-hour hearing he’s working to get support from lawmakers in both political parties for an integrated approach for next year.“You could use the income that would be used to extend the subsidies, apply them to the bronze plan, because the bronze plan is so much less expensive. You could then put that balance into the health savings account,” Cassidy said, referring to coverage levels in plans on the ACA marketplace. “So it does continue the support using the existing mechanisms we have, but integrates the HSA, which gives first dollar coverage and could potentially lower the net deductible.”Cassidy said Congress could extend the open enrollment period for the ACA marketplace and then fund the Health Savings Accounts, which are tax-advantaged savings accounts, before the end of March. “People would save their receipts and submit them for payment,” he said. “People do that all the time.”",,,,2025-12-03 16:58:53.207857

If enough signatures were collected, the map will be placed on hold until voters decide its fate at the ballot box next year. 
“This unprecedented show of grassroots power signals the overwhelming public demand for Missourians to have a say in whether (the map) becomes law,” People Not Politicians, the political action committee behind the referendum campaign, said in a statement Wednesday.

The new map was crafted at the urging of President Donald Trump in order to give Republicans control of seven of Missouri’s eight seats in Congress. To do it, GOP lawmakers broke up the Kansas City-based 5th District represented by Democrat Emanuel Cleaver.
Soon after lawmakers passed the map, People Not Politicians submitted paperwork for a referendum to the Missouri secretary of state. Since then, the group has raised millions of dollars — mostly from out-of-state nonprofits who don’t have to disclose their donors — and reportedly collected more than 200,000 signatures. 
To succeed, a referendum petition must have at least 106,000 signatures from registered voters distributed among six of the state’s eight congressional districts.
From the moment the referendum campaign launched, Republicans have worked overtime to undermine it.
Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a first-term Republican, announced he would not accept any signatures collected before the governor signed the new map into law, a move that would invalidate more than 90,000 signatures. A Cole County judge is scheduled to hear arguments over that decision next week. 
Missouri GOP goes scorched earth to keep its gerrymandered map off the 2026 ballot

Hoskins is also in court defending the ballot summary he wrote for the referendum in which he informs voters the map “better reflects statewide voting patterns” and replaces a “gerrymandered” version that “protects incumbent politicians.”
Attorney General Catherine Hanaway filed a federal lawsuit arguing that even though the congressional map is a piece of legislation approved by the General Assembly, it should not be subject to a citizen referendum. 
Hanaway has also accused a company hired by People Not Politicians to collect signatures of bringing undocumented immigrants into the state to assist with the campaign. The attorney general has presented no evidence to support this claim, and the company has adamantly denied it.

Alan Powell, a Hartwell Republican, said the committee's concerns revolved around declining profits amid increased spending. Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderThe head of the Georgia Lottery painted a rosy picture of the lottery’s contribution to education at a Georgia House committee hearing Wednesday, but lawmakers pressed Georgia Lottery Corporation CEO Gretchen Corbin about spending and long-term revenue trends amid a slowdown in lottery sales.
The Georgia House Regulated Industries Committee hearing served as a financial checkup for what is now the state’s only major current form of legal gambling, coming amid the ongoing work of the House Study Committee on Gaming in the State of Georgia, which is tasked with researching the impacts of expanded gambling. Another committee, the Senate Study Committee on Making Georgia the No. 1 State for Tourism, recently published its legislative recommendations, which include expanding gambling through legalizing sports betting.
“Concerns that I had are we’re looking at a decrease in the net (revenue) as we see the (expenses) increase going up, and I think that’s where the genesis of a lot of the questions is going to be coming from,” said Hartwell Republican state Rep. Alan Powell, the chair of the committee.

Corbin said the Georgia Lottery has returned more than $30 billion to the state for education since its inception in 1993, supporting over 2.25 million students through the HOPE Scholarship and Grant programs and more than 2.2 million children through the Georgia Pre-K program.
“We are thinking of these students when we walk into the building. We’re thinking of the students when we walk out of the building, and we see, and we know, and we hold tightly to our responsibility to provide the greatest amount of revenue to send to you and the governor to allocate for education,” Corbin said.
Corbin also touted what she called the lottery’s strong start to the current fiscal year, with a revenue of $414.8 million in the first quarter and a profit of $51 million, which she said was the strongest in the lottery’s history.
Despite the positive tone, lawmakers pressed Corbin on a recent slowdown in traditional lottery sales  — for fiscal year 2024, gross ticket sales decreased by $132.8 million, or 2.2% as compared to 2023, according to the Georgia Lottery’s 2025 financial report. 
Corbin said the recent fluctuations are due to economic “anomal(ies),” including the COVID-19 pandemic and years with unusually high numbers of large-jackpot draws, such as six separate $1 billion jackpots in one period.
“During that year, we had over six $1 billion jackpots, and so that was an anomaly. The industry had never seen over six $1 billion jackpots,” Corbin said.
Lawmakers also questioned lottery officials on the substantial budget for advertising and vendor contracts — the lottery spent $53 million on marketing last year. Committee members asked about a dip in net returns, raising questions about the return on investment from the marketing’s sizable budget.
“It seems like the education is getting the crumbs here,” said Rep. Karen Bennett, a Stone Mountain Democrat.
Corbin defended the spending, pointing to independent evaluations showing that the value exceeds the cost.
The committee floated the possibility of conducting a performance audit to evaluate the efficiency of the Georgia Lottery’s’s operations.
“I would like to maybe, for the purview of the committee, that maybe it is time that we see a performance audit done to evaluate certain things, if that’s the wishes of the committee,” Powell said before adjourning.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/P1030620-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-12-03 15:58:40.566192

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Democrats and voting rights advocates this week voiced vehement opposition to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ call to redistrict Florida’s congressional map in a special session next year, calling it an “illegal” gerrymander in violation of the Florida Constitution.
Not surprisingly, Desantis disagrees.
The governor was asked Wednesday whether he feared a strong turnout for Democrats in the 2026 midterms could backfire on Republicans creating a new map and actually put more of the state’s 28 congressional districts in play.
“They’re not allowed to use the partisan data,” he said of the Legislature’s intent in creating a new congressional map for 2026.
The governor was alluding to a section of the Florida Fair District amendments passed by the voters in 2010 saying no reapportionment plan or individual district can be drawn “with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or incumbent.”
Another section says districts cannot be drawn with the “intent or result of denying or abridging the equal opportunity of racial or language minorities to participate in the political process or to diminish their ability to elect representatives of their choice.”
In 2022, DeSantis vetoed the congressional map sent to him by the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature and reconfigured a district in North Florida to erase Black representation in that area and help elect more Republicans to Congress.
Voting rights groups sued in both state and federal court, claiming the map violated Fair Districts, but both lawsuits were unsuccessful. The Florida Supreme Court upheld the DeSantis-approved map in July, writing that the old Congressional District 5 map likely was an illegal race-based gerrymander that violated federal equal-protection rights. A panel of federal judges also upheld the constitutionality of the 2022 map a year ago.
Texas (and several other states around the country) undertook to redraw their congressional maps this year following a demand to do so by President Donald Trump in July.
1965 Voting Rights Act
DeSantis said his motivation for redrawing congressional districts is that the state will “be forced to do it because the Supreme Court’s VRA [Voting Rights Act] decision is going to impact the current map. No matter what else, that is going to have to be addressed.”
The U.S Supreme Court heard oral arguments in October in a case out of Louisiana that could lead to sweeping changes in longstanding rules requiring mapmakers to ensure that racial minorities get a chance to be an electoral majority or plurality in some areas.
The court is using the case to determine whether Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act remains constitutional. The section prohibits voting laws or procedures that deny or abridge voting rights due to a person’s “race or color” or membership in a language minority.
In July, the governor said it was “appropriate” for the state to conduct a mid-decade congressional redistricting because he contends Florida unfairly lost a seat to which it was entitled in the 2020 U.S. Census. He followed up on that in August, saying he and Attorney General James Uthmeier supported an update to the 2020 Census.
No update to U.S. Census 
That hasn’t happened, however, and DeSantis acknowledged in Tampa Wednesday that it likely wouldn’t. He insisted it’s still appropriate to do the redistricting in Florida because the state’s political demographics have changed significantly since 2020, with Republicans surpassing Democrats in voter registration over the past five years (more than 1.4 million additional Republicans).
“I just haven’t seen the movement that I was hoping for,” he said about an updated Census.
“When did the Census stop? It stopped basically at the end of March of 2020. But what’s happened in Florida since then? We’ve had a big population [increase]. So, the districts are not well apportioned, and I don’t think that people are getting equal representation. And that was a demographic shift that I don’t know that we’ve necessarily seen in modern history before.”
DeSantis’ call for a special session on the topic following the regular legislative session would seem to fly in the face of efforts about to be undertaken by the Florida House, which will begin its own committee meetings on the issue Thursday afternoon.
The governor did not respond to the Phoenix’s question to him Wednesday as to whether his special session means the House’s work during the regular session may prove irrelevant.
Asked if his staff were already working on alternative congressional maps, he said no.
“There’s nothing that anyone on my staff has done with respect to actually doing the map,” he said.
Meanwhile, state Rep. Daryl Campbell, D-Fort Lauderdale, filed a resolution Wednesday (HJR 619) that attempts to end partisan gerrymandering once and for all. He would allow voters to decide via a constitutional amendment whether to create independent commissions (one each for the state House, state Senate, and Congress) to redraw legislative and congressional districts.
“The people should choose their representatives, not the other way around. These commissions would be made up of regular Floridians — not lawmakers, not lobbyists, not campaign insiders,” Campbell said in a press release. “If you’ve recently made money in politics, you’re out. This is about independence and fairness, not influence and favors.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-1-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-03 15:58:40.566192

Although evidence of a new infusion of bloodlines is lacking, both transplant animals are alive, and breeding is anticipated to occur soon if it hasn’t already. 
The post What happened to the grizzlies Wyoming trucked in from Montana to boost genetic diversity? appeared first on WyoFile .","In the months after Grizzly 1126F hit the ground in Wyoming two summers ago, the young translocated bear went on an impressive walkabout that had state biologists eagerly watching her movements. 
And move she did.
“She moves everywhere,” said Dan Thompson, who leads large carnivore management for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. 
Grizzly 1126F’s unique history ups the intrigue in her travels all over the map. The 4-year-old sow is one of two bears that were trucked south from Montana’s Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem in July 2024, along with Grizzly 1129M, a male. The translocation, partly in response to a federal judge’s 2018 ruling, was intended to increase the genetic diversity of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s population of grizzlies, which remains geographically isolated.  
So where’d Grizzly 1126F go after being captured near Montana’s Middle Fork Flathead River and deposited southwest of Togwotee Pass in the Blackrock Creek drainage? 
“She has made several loops around the entire ecosystem,” Thompson said. “Around Yellowstone, into Idaho, up toward Cody. Then she went down toward Jackson, Wilson, into Idaho again and came back across the north end of the Tetons.” 
The female grizzly has stopped, for now, to den at a remote site deep in the Teton Wilderness beyond the North Fork of the Buffalo Fork River, he said.

Meanwhile, the translocated male has had the opposite proclivity since being turned loose along a remote shoreline of Yellowstone Lake. Grizzly 1129M basically stayed put. 
“He really has maintained a location in the southern half of Yellowstone, south of Yellowstone Lake,” Thompson said. 
Typically, males make big dispersals and females stay put — the opposite of what’s happened with the translocated grizzlies. It’s led biologists to joke that they missexed the two animals. They didn’t, Thompson said.
Ultimately, it’s not where grizzlies 1126F and 1129M go that’s most important to those biologists. It’s what they do: Ideally, other grizzlies. The goal is for them to reproduce.
“She should have bred this year,” Thompson said, “so it’ll be interesting to see if she has cubs this spring.” 
Grizzly bear crews that keep close tabs on the population will be monitoring to see if that’s the case. 
Ascertaining whether Grizzly 1129M has spread his genes will be less straightforward. The boar is also estimated to be 4 years old, which isn’t considered a “prime age,” Thompson said, but he still should have bred females in summer 2025.
“We can only discern that through DNA tests,” he said. 
Eventually, analyses of blood extracted during routine grizzly bear captures will be able to pinpoint bears on the landscape that have genetic markers from both the Greater Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide populations.

For now, Thompson and his fellow carnivore managers are just happy that both bears have stayed within the Yellowstone region and stayed out of trouble — neither has been involved in any known conflict.  
The translocation of two grizzlies was an interagency effort that’s related to the status of the species: Ursus arctos horribilis is classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Populations in both western Montana’s Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem and the tri-state Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem are considered robust and have long exceeded goals, but about 35 miles separate the two populations and there has never been a proven case of a grizzly departing one recovery zone and breeding in another. (They’ve come close: In 2023, a Yellowstone ecosystem bear dispersed to the northeast and ended up in Montana’s Pryor Mountains.)
North Montana’s grizzlies are connected to a much larger Canadian population, and so specifically, biologists want to see new genetic material introduced to the isolated Yellowstone population. It’s unclear if that’s happened yet, but there are no grave concerns about inbred grizzlies.
“This was not because we were worried about the genetic vigor of the population,” Thompson said. 
But the 2018 ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen, which overturned the states’ bid to manage and hunt grizzlies, cited concerns about the population’s long-term genetic health. The federal judge out of Montana faulted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for not planning to intervene unless “the Greater Yellowstone grizzly’s genetic health is demonstrably weakened.”
“In short, the Service has failed to demonstrate that genetic diversity within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, long-recognized as a threat to the Greater Yellowstone grizzly’s continued survival, has become a non-issue,” Christensen wrote. 
Seven years later, two grizzlies born in Northern Montana — 1126F and 1129M — are spending their winters in Wyoming den sites. Evidence that they’ve reproduced could be months away.

Javitz Federal Building on Sept. 3, 2025, in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear a lawsuit from the immigrant-rights group Voces de la Frontera against the authority of the state’s county sheriffs to hold people in county jails based on detainers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The lawsuit from Voces will be immediately heard by the Supreme Court as an original action, meaning it won’t begin at the circuit court level and work its way up to the Supreme Court. The case comes as jurisdictions across the country wrestle with the effects of the Trump administration’s increased immigration enforcement and the level to which local law enforcement should participate.  
Courts in New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Montana have previously ruled that state law bars local law enforcement officers from complying with federal immigration detainers. A state law in Illinois prohibits local cooperation with federal immigration agents. 
Here in Wisconsin, more than a dozen county sheriffs offices have signed 287(g) agreements with ICE that grant sheriff’s deputies some immigration enforcement authority, including the ability to question people in custody about their immigration status and hold people in jail under federal detainers. 
The Dodge County sheriff maintains an agreement with the federal government to hold many types of federal detainees in the department’s jail — including immigrants. That agreement includes sheriff’s deputies transporting detained migrants to and from a controversial ICE facility in Broadview, Ill. 
Some departments in the state, including Madison and Milwaukee, have explicitly said they won’t cooperate with federal immigration efforts. 
Voces’ lawsuit argues that state law does not give Wisconsin law enforcement officers the authority to conduct civil immigration enforcement. 
In accepting the case, the Court said it would consider whether Wisconsin sheriffs have the authority to arrest people as part of a civil immigration enforcement action and how 287(g) agreements affect the application of state law. 
Departing from usual practice in which state Supreme Court decisions to accept cases are unsigned, conservative Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley dissented from the decision to hear the case. 
In a written opinion, conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote Supreme Court rules state it takes four justices to agree to accept an original action and that normally these decisions are unsigned to prevent observers from inferring if the justices hold pre-established views on an issue. He added that just because some justices publicly dissented, that does not reveal how every justice voted in the decision to accept the case. 
“The public may begin to infer that if a justice does not publicly dissent to an order granting review in a case, that justice has joined the order taking the case,” he wrote. “That assumption would be unwarranted. Even if some of my colleagues publicly record their dissent, as in this case, that does not necessarily reveal which justices voted for or against the petition in closed conference. A grant order simply means the requisite number of justices voted to grant a petition — in this case, four —nothing more.”
Under Wednesday’s order, Voces has 30 days to file a brief in the case.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)In some of his first public remarks since taking the helm of the South Dakota Department of Corrections, Secretary Nick Lamb told an oversight commission Wednesday that the state “has a long way to go” to address challenges in its prison system.
Gov. Larry Rhoden appointed Lamb in late October, days after the departure of former Secretary Kellie Wasko, who announced her resignation weeks before the state Legislature voted to endorse the construction of a $650 million men’s prison in Sioux Falls.
Lamb came to South Dakota in mid-November with decades of correctional experience, most recently in Iowa.

He took the helm of an agency bedeviled for half a decade by controversies, among them:

A staff shakeup over allegations of nepotism and harassment by prison leadership, spurring a revolving door of wardens and cabinet secretaries.
Unrest among inmates that left offenders and staff members injured in Sioux Falls and Springfield.
Heated pushback against a men’s prison construction proposal that forced Rhoden to restart discussions — and cost taxpayers $20 million in sunk costs on a prison site in Lincoln County that was abandoned for a location in Sioux Falls.
A tally of fatal prison overdoses higher than the state has seen in recent memory, which have persisted in the face of investigations and arrests.

Lamb spoke for less than two minutes in his introduction to the Corrections Commission, which met virtually for the second time since the group’s new leadership signaled their intention to expand their involvement in prison policy discussions.
The new secretary talked about “a very busy three and a half weeks” meeting staff and reviewing policy and thanked Wasko for her leadership and her “great work” during her three and a half years with the agency.
Lamb said much needs to be done, particularly with two new prisons in the works (a women’s prison in Rapid City, in addition to the men’s prison in Sioux Falls) and persistent challenges with staff retention, repeat offenses and security concerns inside existing prisons.
Overdoses addressed in, out of commission setting
Lamb also offered a nod to the overdoses, the most recent of which came last week at the maximum-security Jameson Annex of the South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls.
“South Dakota is not any different than any other state with its continued struggle with synthetic cannabinoids,” Lamb said, referring to synthetic drugs like K2, which is responsible for most of the eight overdose deaths that have occurred in 2025.
State apologizes, but can’t explain missing evidence in prison overdose case

Lamb did not elaborate on the extent of the drug problem in other states, but news reports on the issue have appeared in multiple states this year. Kansas officials cited K2, which typically lands in prison on paper that’s been soaked with intoxicants and dried out for distribution, as the reason for restricting access to newspapers. A jail in Wisconsin signaled plans to scan all inmate mail for delivery via electronic tablet in an effort to restrict access to K2, mirroring a policy in place since 2021 at state institutions.
South Dakota has long had such a scanning policy for inmate mail, all of which is delivered via tablet.
Attorney General Marty Jackley’s office has investigated each of the South Dakota overdose deaths, and issued charges for an inmate and Colorado resident accused, respectively, of delivering the drugs involved in two of those deaths. Separate to those charges, Jackley’s office indicted other inmates and a former correctional officer in September for allegedly distributing K2 in prison.
Three more inmates have died of overdoses since the September indictments. In an interview that aired Wednesday on South Dakota Public Broadcasting, Jackley told Lori Walsh that there are other investigations involving other correctional officers, and that he intends to work with lawmakers to stiffen penalties for drug-dealing Department of Corrections staffers.
“Absolutely these deaths are preventable,” Jackley said.
Commissioners pledge greater oversight
At the Corrections Commission meeting that began a few hours after Jackley’s remarks hit the airwaves, the group’s members doubled down on their September promise to take a more active role in prison policy.
The commission’s role diminished under Wasko’s tenure, typically only voting to approve meeting minutes and hear financial updates on prison industries, even as the law that created the group defined it as one meant to advise the Department of Corrections.
David McGirr, a longtime commission member, agitated for a more active role in mid-2024. On Wednesday, he again pointed out that past commissions had such a role, and encouraged the lawmakers now serving to endorse a return.
Head of state prison system wants to ‘close the doors’ to public scrutiny of security incidents

“Secretary Wasko felt like she didn’t have to share anything with us because we aren’t elected officials, but we’re appointed by the governor,” McGirr said.
Although some of the board members are not elected officials, others are. One of the new members, Sioux Falls Republican state Rep. John Hughes, told McGirr he agreed, and called out the overdose situation as proof that the group needs to step up its oversight.
Hughes said he spent the weekend reading up on K2, and was troubled by the impact it’s had in South Dakota.
“The inmate deaths are sickening,” Hughes said, adding that inmates are “our people” during their time in state custody.
“We have to own the responsibility for these people,” he said.
Lamb did not speak up to address his view on the commission’s role, and no commissioner asked him to.
Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, now chair of the group, said she intends to call more frequent meetings in the coming years, noting that she called December’s meeting — one more than the group had on its calendar prior to her ascension — to set that tone.
“It didn’t sit right that we met so infrequently,” Wittman said.

Gretchen Whitmer is applauding a $400 million grant to support the deployment of two small modular nuclear reactors at the same West Michigan Nuclear plant pursuing a first-in-the-nation restart. 
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement on Tuesday that the reactors would supply power to support manufacturing as well as data centers and the growth of artificial intelligence. 
Whitmer cheered the announcement as a win for energy affordability and business in the state. 
“Today’s announcement will lower energy costs, reaffirm Michigan’s clean energy leadership, and show the world that we are the best place to do business,” Whitmer said in the Tuesday statement. “This historic investment will double Palisades’ capacity, provide more clean energy for Michigan homes and businesses, and protect good-paying Michigan jobs.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After the Palisades plant was shuttered in 2022, it was sold to Holtec, which has been working to restart the plant with the federal government granting the company a $1.5 billion conditional loan. The United States Department of Agriculture has also awarded Palisades more than  $1.3 billion to help restore service. However, the restart has received pushback from some environmentalists and anti-nuclear advocates raising safety concerns in reviving the reactor.
While the reactor is set to produce 800 megawatts of energy upon resuming operations, the two modular reactors supported by the $400 million award will add an additional 680 megawatts of power to the facility, 340 megawatts per unit. 
Kevin Kamps, a radioactive waste watchdog with the group Beyond Nuclear, raised concerns about having multiple reactors on the same site, pointing to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, in which a massive earthquake struck Japan causing three of the plant’s six reactors to meltdown, leading to the release of radioactive material. 
“If you’ve got a zombie reactor that’s essentially 60 years old next to brand-new, untested reactors, the test is happening in real time on these designs and their construction,” Kamps told Michigan Advance. “You have both extremes of the risk spectrum.”
According to the World Nuclear Association, there are only two small modular reactors in operation globally: one in Russia and one in China. Due to the limited development and deployment of the facilities, the technology is generally considered unproven. A report from Stanford University also found that these reactors could produce two to 30 times the amount of nuclear waste compared to a traditional reactor. 
Alongside his concerns about safety, Kamps also questioned the financials around the award, calling it a “bailout” for Holtec.
“They’re gouging us, and Governor Whitmer says it’s great we’re lowering energy costs. On whose back?” Kamps said, emphasizing that Michiganders pay both state and federal taxes.

On July 27, 2022, Walker drove an unmarked police car and tried to stop a car driven by a man identified as E.S. in court records. The man led Walker on a pursuit, which several Jackson Police Department officers joined. 
The chase ended when Walker cut E.S. off, causing the officer to run into a tree and the man to swerve into a yard. A Jackson police officer pulled E.S. from the car and handcuffed him. 
While the man was under control and handcuffed, Walker slammed E.S.’s head into the hood of his car and kicked him in the head and face while he was on the ground, according to court records. 
Walker also faces state charges for another incident while working for Capitol Police. 
He and Officer Michael Rhinewalt were indicted for aggravated assault stemming from the Aug. 14, 2022, shooting of Sinatra Jordan and Sherita Harris. 
Harris was the passenger in a car Jordan was driving that Capitol Police officers stopped near State and Amite streets. Walker and Rhinewalt were later identified as those who opened fire.
A civil lawsuit Harris filed in 2023 which represents one side of a legal argument, alleges Jordan initially complied with a command to pull over, but then tried to drive away when shots were fired into the car. Gunfire hit Harris in the head and required her to undergo surgery to remove the bullet fragments. She has suffered “permanent neurological and facial injuries,” according to the lawsuit.
Walker and Rhinewalt were expected to start trial Monday. The trial did not take place, and court records do not list an updated trial date. 
Jordan, the driver, was charged in 2023 with fleeing felony law enforcement, assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest and possession of marijuana. 
In March, he pleaded guilty to fleeing law enforcement, which was reduced to a misdemeanor, and the other charges were dropped. He received a six-month sentence, and as of Wednesday, prison records do not show anyone under his name incarcerated.  
Harris’ civil lawsuit has been put on hold until the state cases are finished.
Rhinewalt is facing another state charge from his role with Capitol Police.
He and now former Capitol Police Officer Steven Frederick Jr. were indicted for manslaughter in the Sept. 25, 2022, death of Jaylen Lewis during a traffic stop on East Mayes Street. 
They are scheduled to go to trial in Hinds County on Dec. 8. 
The officers, who were conducting a drug narcotics operation, saw the car driven by Lewis turn and then run a red light on another street. They turned on their police lights to pull the 22-year-old over and blocked him from moving forward with their car.  
The former officers reportedly told investigators that one of them shot Lewis in the head in self-defense because he drove his car toward them. 
A federal lawsuit by Lewis’ mother, which represents one side of a legal argument, states he reversed his car and bumped the cruiser behind him, and it states that he did not show a weapon, reach for one, “or take other actions that could be reasonably perceived as endangering officers or others.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06120328/Capitol-Police-4.jpg,,,2025-12-03 15:58:40.566192

Firefighters who responded to the blaze reported dropping retardant nearly 2,500 times, according to data the Santa Fe National Forest provided to Source New Mexico. (Courtesy SFNF)Firefighters responding to the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire reported nearly 2,500 retardant drops as they fought the blaze that destroyed hundreds of homes in Northern New Mexico, according to data the federal Forest Service provided Source New Mexico.
Where those drops occurred — and what was in the retardant — is the subject of renewed interest after an independent geologic study discovered elevated levels of potentially dangerous contaminants, including arsenic, antimony and uranium, in 72 private wells in the burn scar, mostly in Mora County. 
Kate Zeigler, the geologist who discovered the metals, has said fire suppressants are a likely culprit behind at least some of the contamination, noting that many of the newly discovered contaminants exist in fire retardant and are not naturally occurring. She also stressed other possible sources of contamination, noting fire suppressants “are most likely not the sole and only source.”
Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims grapple with latest crisis

It’s a “super complex system we’re working to understand,” Zeigler told Source. 
Zeigler’s findings prompted the state Health Department on Nov. 14 to issue a public health alert, and state and local agencies have since moved quickly to provide bottled water and try to expand the number of wells tested.
Testing all the wells in and around the 534-square-mile area the fire burned through  has emerged as a key next step in mitigating the issue, local leaders said at a meeting last week at a Mora library. But that could prove to be quite an undertaking, according to a Source New Mexico analysis. 
A little more than 900 are registered with the Office of the State Engineer in the burn scar alone, according to OSE data Source analyzed. That’s more than twice as many as Zeigler and others  previously estimated and doesn’t include unregistered wells or those outside the burned area that draw from the same aquifer. 
Stacy Timmons, assistant director for hydrology programs at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, reviewed the OSE data at Source’s request. She confirmed Source’s findings about the number of wells, but noted location data might be inaccurate for some of the older wells. 
The average  depth of those wells is about 224 feet, though two are more than 1,000 feet and others as shallow as 16 feet, according to the OSE data. The wells Zeigler has tested up to this point are all less than 100 feet deep, though she’s monitoring a handful of deeper “gatekeeper” wells, she said, to detect whether contaminants are deep in the aquifer. 


So far, no contaminants have been found more than 100 feet deep, she said. The deeper the contaminants spread, the harder mitigation will be, she said. 
As for determining the role of fire suppressants, a spokesperson for the United States Forest Service said the agency is joining the search for an answer.
“We remain committed to working with local communities, Mora County commissioners and Dr. Zeigler to help identify the source of heavy metals,” Claudia Brookshire, a spokesperson for the Santa Fe National Forest, told Source in an email.
New Mexico officials, Mora residents say feds should respond to groundwater contamination

Brookshire noted that the retardant drop information the Forest Service collects may include “missing or duplicate data.” That’s because not all aircraft that responded to the wildfire— the largest in state history—were equipped with equipment to monitor the drops. Not all aircraft consistently report that data, and some are not required to, Brookshire said. 
Zeigler also reviewed the drop data and believes it could be incomplete. She is asking people who witnessed the fire to send any evidence they have of suppressant drops to her team. As she’s conducted tests, she’s heard multiple reports of retardant dropped in Monte Aplanado and near Morphy Lake, for example, areas that do not appear in the Forest Service data. 
“We’ve been trying to chase down anecdotal stories of people coming back to a house coated in pink dust,” she told Source in an email, referring to the characteristic pink color of the retardant.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/472909739_1002231225279491_2238023694336978293_n-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-03 15:58:40.566192

(Photo by Andrew Fraieli/Colorado Newsline)Colorado’s top election official declined a Trump administration request this week to share extensive voter information.
The request was the latest administration effort to extract details about registered voters in the state. Secretary of State Jena Griswold previously shared only publicly available voter roll information in response to U.S. Department of Justice requests. The latest request seeks more sensitive data.
“We will not comply with the Trump Department of Justice’s request for Coloradans’ sensitive voting information,” Griswold, a Democrat, said in a statement. “The DOJ can take a hike; it does not have a legal right to the information. Colorado will not help Donald Trump undermine our elections and hurt the American people.”

The DOJ’s Civil Rights Division asked Griswold’s office on Monday to enter into an agreement to share unredacted voter data including full names, dates of birth, addresses and identification numbers including a full driver’s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number. 
Griswold’s office has already shared copies of the state’s master voter list and a copy of the master voter history list. The data includes the names of voters, addresses, birth year, and, if provided by the voter, phone numbers. This is all public information.
The agreement the DOJ proposed to Colorado says its purpose is to verify the state’s compliance with federal election record maintenance rules. An attorney with the Civil Rights Division said the new request was a follow-up to the original request in May.










The DOJ can take a hike.


– Jena Griswold, Colorado secretary of state


“Clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair, and transparent elections,” Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in a statement. “The DOJ Civil Rights Division has a statutory mandate to enforce our federal voting rights laws, and ensuring the voting public’s confidence in the integrity of our elections is a top priority of this administration.”
The Colorado request is part of a Trump administration effort to collect voter information from states across the country, which raises concerns about the security of the information and future elections, according to election security advocates. The initial Colorado request, which sought “all records” related to the 2024 election, was among the most sweeping. 
Federal officials later acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter roll information with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens as a way to “scrub aliens from voter rolls.”
Griswold and other Democratic secretaries of state wrote to Trump administration officials in November expressing concern that the administration misled them about how it would use voter data collected from their states. Griswold has said voter data requests are just one of many ways the Trump administration has “made our elections less secure.”
In response to a Newsline inquiry about the latest request for sensitive data, Natalie Baldassarre, a DOJ spokesperson, included department announcements of lawsuits against other states that refused to supply sensitive voter data, appearing to suggest that Colorado could be at risk. The Trump administration has sued multiple states that have refused to provide the DOJ with their voter rolls.
Jack Todd, a spokesperson for Griswold, said “it certainly seems possible” that Colorado will be sued for refusing to provide voter data considering how many other states the DOJ has sued. “But only time will tell,” he said in a statement.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-03 19:35:25+00:00,CT Mirror,Arbiter gives 2.5% cost-of-living raise plus step increase for 3 CT unions,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/03/arbiter-gives-2-5-cost-of-living-raise-plus-step-increase-for-3-ct-unions/,The COLA and step raise effectively represent a 4.5% increase and could help all state employees get similar raises.,"A labor arbitrator has awarded three bargaining units within Connecticut’s Judicial Branch a 2.5% cost-of-living raise and a step increase this fiscal year, which effectively represents a 4.5% increase.
The raises ordered for judicial marshals, their supervisors and a third group that includes probation officers, information technology analysts, assistant clerks, counselors and other support staff, are retroactive to July 1, when the fiscal year began.
The award announced Wednesday also increases the likelihood that dozens of additional bargaining units in state government — which haven’t yet settled compensation deals — will get similar raises. And if that happens, it will mark the fifth consecutive year state employees’ compensation has increased by about 4.5%. (A step hike typically adds about 2 percentage points to the overall raise value.)
“Every day, we keep our communities running — protecting the public and providing the essential services we all count on,” the unions wrote in a statement directed at Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration. “It’s time to stop the games and respect us.”
Though Judicial Branch administrators technically negotiate with the employees assigned to the court system — just as higher education leaders handle contracts with college and university staff — they follow guidelines set by the governor’s budget office, which handles talks with most of the state’s unionized workforce.
The governor, who repeatedly promised healthy wages for all state workers during the summer and fall, expressed appreciation Wednesday for all state workers.
“My administration continues to negotiate in good faith with all of the Executive Branch unions and has had informal discussions with the [State Employees Bargaining Agent] Coalition regarding health, retirement, and other benefits for the past several months,” Lamont said in a written statement. “As we saw yesterday, when DOT crews worked overtime in Litchfield County to keep our roads safe during the snowstorm, our state employees are the backbone.”
The governor added that “this award is consistent with what we have put on the table in negotiations for our bargaining units for the first year of the contract. It is my hope we can reach a multi-year agreement in the near future with all of our labor partners.”
The administration insisted legislators include more than $200 million in the new state budget adopted last June, which would be sufficient cover 4.5% raises for most workers.
Still, several bargaining units became frustrated once the fiscal year began and new wage agreements had not been resolved. By July 8, all three Judicial Branch units, which represent about 2,100 workers in total, had broken off talks.
By the end of September, that number had grown to six, as unions representing rank-and-file correction officers, their supervisors and various education professionals also declared negotiations to be at an impasse.
Despite the governor’s public promises for healthy raises, the state and unions hadn’t resolved any contracts, disagreeing over work conditions and particularly work-from-home rules established during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Lamont administration has argued that workers should be spending more time in the office, while unions counter remote work is not an impediment to productivity.
This week’s arbitration award only addresses compensation for this fiscal year. The state and more than 30 bargaining units — including the three Judicial Branch units involved in the arbitration award — still must resolve compensation for future years as well as any changes to working conditions.
Tensions between Lamont and state employee unions also have worsened because of employment vacancies.
Labor leaders say the governor, a fiscally moderate Democrat, has left most agencies under-staffed since he took office in 2019 — even as state government has used aggressive budget caps to leave historic levels of money unspent.
“The longer these contracts are delayed, the less our agencies will be able to retain critical talent, let alone recruit effectively to fill the thousands of vacancies” across all departments, the three Judicial Branch units wrote in their statement.
State government has averaged more than $1.8 billion in surpluses since 2017 — which equals 8% to 9% of the General Fund. Lamont’s budget office projects a $2 billion surplus for the current fiscal year.
Given that more than three-quarters of Connecticut’s budget is largely fixed by contract or other legal obligations, 8% or more can be substantial.
These surpluses largely have been used to whittle down Connecticut’s hefty pension debt, which was amassed over seven decades prior to 2011 and still exceeds $33 billion.
Lamont largely has resisted scaling back this debt reduction effort to grow state agency staffing, despite surging overtime expenses.
Still, those surpluses have helped state employees enjoy raises far beyond those offered in the 2010s.
Arbiters consider the state’s ability to pay, among other factors, when deciding whether to order raises. And unions can cite those huge surpluses when seeking arbitration, which means this week’s award could provide a blueprint for more than 30 other bargaining units to seek hikes equal to about 4.5%.
Unions also noted that Lamont and the General Assembly back in May awarded a 2.5% cost-of-living raise and a step hike — effectively a 4.5% raise — to state police troopers for the 2025-26 fiscal year. The trooper’s union is the one major bargaining unit not in the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_5682.jpg,,,2025-12-03 14:57:50.416400

Ryan Fazio.","John Healey said Wednesday he is leaving as chief of staff to the Senate Republican minority, an acknowledgement that his advocacy of former Mayor Erin Stewart of New Britain for governor puts him at odds with a caucus committed to her GOP rival, Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich.
“What’s become very clear as the weeks go by and as the 2026 season takes hold, it will become difficult to remain,” said Healey, a New Britain native who was Stewart’s first chief of staff after her election in 2013. “Now that she’s all in as governor, I will want to have the freedom to be all in to support her.”
He’s expected to play a significant role in Stewart’s campaign.
Stewart, who had been raising money through an exploratory committee since January, declared her candidacy for the Republican gubernatorial nomination two weeks ago. Fazio, a candidate since August, has been endorsed by key lawmakers, including Healey’s boss, Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield.
Bringing back Healey was among Harding’s first moves after the Senate GOP caucus forced out Sen. Kevin Kelly of Stratford as its leader in February 2024, an unusual if unprecedented change of leadership at mid-term. Kelly’s abrupt dismissal of Healey the previous month was a factor in the demand for new leadership.
Kelly had hired Healey a year earlier, bringing onto his staff a lawyer and campaign operative who had been a senior advisor to House Republican leaders for nearly seven years until departing to become Stewart’s chief of staff.
“That was a very odd circumstance in the history of the legislature,” Healey said. “It has been a great privilege to work alongside Sen. Harding.”
Harding said Healey was crucial in helping with the unusual transition.
“I think John has been awesome for this caucus. The senators love him,” Harding said Wednesday. The decision to leave was Healey’s, Harding said.
Healey is expected to remain as Harding’s top aide into January, giving the senator a month to hire a successor. The annual legislative session opens on Feb. 4.
Healey made a point of praising Fazio and expressed hope the GOP eventually will unite in 2026 as the party tries to unseat Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat seeking a third term.
“I think very, very highly of Sen. Fazio, and I have valued the relationship we have developed over the years,” Healey said. “If I can use my experience to bring the party together when the time comes, I think that will be valuable.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/7DB4C06F-7AA1-4783-900F-4D7CE1D6EC5B-1024x781.jpg,,,2025-12-03 15:58:40.566192

The warning was issued during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the latest volley in a battle between states and the federal government over a program that feeds more than 360,000 Connecticut residents.
According to the Associated Press, a USDA spokesperson later explained that the Department of Agriculture would target the administrative funds for the program, not the benefits people receive. 
Officials in Connecticut called the warning “cruel” and indicated they would work to “protect the rights” of state residents should the directive, which had already been challenged in court, become official.
Gov. Ned Lamont released a statement on Wednesday saying that his office is aware of the comments by Rollins. “However, Connecticut has not received any formal notice from USDA that any funds may be impacted,” the governor said. “If a formal warning is received, we will work in collaboration with the Attorney General to protect the rights of Connecticut and its residents.”
In Connecticut, data protections were recently strengthened in a bill that prohibits state and municipal agencies, including schools, from sharing an individual’s address, hours of work, public agency appointments or “any other information that provides the date, time or place where such individual may be located.” That bill was intended to protect immigrant communities from the increased presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 
Scott Gaul, the state’s chief data officer, said that “the underlying intent of the legislation is to make sure people can trust in government and feel that they can interact with state agencies and the benefits that they’re entitled to.”
But Tuesday’s warning by Rollins indicates that the Trump administration is intent on securing that information.
Connecticut is one of the states that filed a legal motion against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in August over the demand that states hand over personal information. In the complaint, the states argued that while the federal government contends that such information is needed to root out fraud and waste, the information is instead being collected as part of a broader effort to amass a vast database that can be used “for a variety of purposes, including to locate and deport people.”
Immigrant rights groups have rallied for data protections. On Wednesday, Constanza Segovia, organizing director of Connecticut for All coalition and director of Hartford Deportation Defense, said in a statement that the policy was among many waging war on working class families.
“They are using immigrant communities as scapegoats but what they’re really doing is gutting the safety net for all people in our state, tripling the costs of health care for middle class families, and dismantling our public institutions to profit themselves and their billionaire friends,” she said. “Now more than ever we have to stand with working class immigrants, and with all people who work for a living and make our state thrive.”
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement on Wednesday that a court order currently prohibits the U.S. Department of Agriculture from forcing states to turn over this information and that, “court orders are not optional, and we will not hesitate to use every legal tool available to ensure that the Trump Administration respects and follows the law.
“The Trump Administration is free to do its job and prevent fraud and abuse without trolling through grocery lists and years of sensitive personal information for tens of millions of families. And, if they care one bit about American families during the holidays, they will drop this cruel and depraved attack on families and kids.”
Connecticut’s delegation also spoke out against Rollins’ comments.
“I am sickened by President Trump and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ continued abuse of hungry families in American,” U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd, said in a statement released Wednesday. 
DeLauro decried the treatment of parents, children, veterans and others who depend on SNAP at a time when the cost of household items and groceries are rising precipitously. “Yet this administration is so cruel and cold-heated that all they see are pawns in their political game,” she said. “They are so out of touch that they think starving our neighbors is good for their politics.”
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., also equated the Trump administration’s treatment of SNAP recipients as that of “political pawns.
“Donald Trump and his administration see hungry kids and seniors as nothing more than political pawns in his quest for power,” he said. “Since taking office, Trump has slashed billions in funding for food aid, waging an all-out war on hungry families. Now he wants to weaponize hunger to punish his political enemies for daring to obey the law of the land and protect Americans’ private information rather than cave to his demands.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25304719118315-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 16:58:53.207857

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Sherry Bates gaveled in for the last time as Iowa Board of Regents president Wednesday, with the board selecting Regent Robert Cramer to step into the role.
Bates announced Monday her plans to resign from the board Dec. 4, saying in a statement it’s time for her to take a step back to be with family and “allow the next generation of Regent leadership to continue our good work.” Regent Greta Rouse also announced at the time that she would step down from her position as president pro tem, and Regent Kurt Tjaden was appointed to the role Wednesday.
Echoing her previous statement, Bates thanked Gov. Kim Reynolds and former Gov. Terry Branstad Wednesday for putting their trust in her for more than a decade, as well as university leadership, board staff and her fellow regents. She added that her family’s support “made this work possible for me to do.”

“Best wishes to Robert and to Kurt,” Bates said. “I extend my full confidence and warmest wishes to you both.”
Bates was involved in presidential searches for the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa during her time on the board, Cramer said in a resolution during the meeting, and she helped approve hundreds of millions of dollars for capital projects across the campuses. She kept students in the front of her mind when making decisions, Cramer said, as she thought what is best for them is also what is best for the universities.
“The Iowa Board of Regents expresses its deep gratitude to Regent Bates for her expertise, dedication and extraordinary service and contributions to the Board of Regents, its institutions, students and families in all Iowans,” Cramer said. “Congratulations on your well-earned retirement from the board.”
Both Cramer’s and Tjaden’s leadership terms will end April 30, Bates said. Cramer was appointed to the board in 2023 and his term lasts until 2029, and Tjaden’s term will end in 2031 after being appointed to the board this year.
Cramer outlined three goals for his leadership during the meeting, saying Iowa’s public universities should provide an affordable education, academic excellence and a “fair and balanced place for vigorous debate.”
As Bates directed the board’s investment and finance committee to once again review university efficiencies and new revenue streams, Cramer said some of the work of the board and universities, either already completed or in progress, is already moving his goals forward. He said people at all levels of university operations should continuously work to better academic excellence in order to produce better students and create an atmosphere where students can engage in debate.
As a “bridge builder,” Cramer said this could be his chance to bring together those “who want to make our universities better together.”
“I think we can flip the narrative on higher education, and that is that here in Iowa, a degree from one of our public universities is a great investment, and it’s going to help these students going forward for the rest of their lives,” Cramer said.
Tjaden concurred with Cramer’s goals for the board and universities and said he’s thankful for the trust put in him by his fellow board members.
“Our public universities are among some of the best in the country, and quite frankly, our most valuable assets in the state,” Tjaden said. “And I’m confident with the university leadership, the regents office and the board of regents, we can continue to advance to the goals that Robert has talked about, and I’m excited to be a part of that.”

Members unanimously voted to approve an advisory opinion allowing a former Alabama Department of Human Resources employee to represent foster parents in private practice. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Ethics Commission Wednesday approved guidance allowing a former employee of the Alabama Department of Human Resources to represent foster parents in cases with the agency.
Members of the commission  approved an advisory opinion that the “Revolving Door” provision of the Alabama Ethics Act does not prohibit Kimberly Dobbs, an attorney currently in private practice, from representing clients who are foster parents in adoption proceedings before the agency.
The advisory opinion comes after a request from Dobbs. According to Brian Paterson, assistant general counsel for Alabama Ethics Commission, Dobbs retired from the ADHR in 2025 after working at the department for 17 years, but continues to be a part time employee, working as an administrative law judge for the agency when needed.

The Revolving Door provision prohibits people from working for two years in specific capacities that are related to the previous state agency in which they worked.
ADHR oversees situations in which parents have lost custody of their children. In many cases, parents seek to adopt children in their custody with consent of the agency.
“During her 17 years with ADHR, Ms. Dobbs represented them at trial court and appellate levels in dependency and termination cases,” Paterson said.
Dobbs asked the Alabama Ethics Commission if she can represent foster parents as a practicing attorney in private practice in adoption proceedings with consent of ADHR in cases she was not involved in as an attorney or as an administrative law judge.
Staff said they found nothing in the Revolving Door provision of the Alabama Ethics Act applied to Dobbs’ situation.

Ann Bollin (R-Brighton) and Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R_Richmond Township) attend the ALEC Conference in Ft. Worth, Texas. Dec. 2, 2025 | Photo from Bollin's official Facebook accountA number of Republican members of Michigan’s state House are in attendance at the American Legislative Exchange Council States and Nation Policy Summit in Fort Worth, Texas this week. Only one day of session was scheduled for the House this week, on Tuesday, which was a no attendance, no voting session. 
The organization, referred to as ALEC, is a conservative, corporate-friendly nonprofit known for drafting and promoting “fill-in-the-blank” legislation on issues such as tightening voter ID laws and loosening environmental regulations.
House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Twp.) received the 2025 Bob Williams Memorial Award for Policy Leadership at the conference for her work on the state’s budget, she posted on her official Facebook page. Rep. Ken Borton (R-Gaylord) congratulated Bollin on her award in a Facebook post from the conference. 
Some legislators also enjoyed their time in Texas — Borton also posted photos of himself and his wife Brenda enjoying time at the Fort Worth Stockyards while on the trip. 
The Michigan Democratic Party criticized the trip — including what they called a lack of transparency on how the lawmakers funded their travel and attendance at the conference, which has registration costs of hundreds of dollars. 

“Under Matt Hall’s consistently lackluster leadership, Republicans are out of session in Michigan and spending a week in Texas at a luxury hotel instead of doing the job Michiganders pay them for without any explanation for who’s footing the bill for this extravagant vacation,” Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel said in a statement. 
“While Democrats are ready and fired up to do the work to help middle-class families, Republicans are spending their time rubbing elbows at a convention held by the extremist ALEC organization,” Hertel added.
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.), in attendance at the conference, pushed back against the criticisms from Hertel, writing in a statement, “House Republicans are at ALEC to receive an award for having the best fiscal policies enacted in a budget this year. We cut pork spending by 87%, slashed waste, fraud, and abuse by $800 million, eliminated 2,000 ghost jobs, and made Lansing-insiders and politicians put their name on the pork projects they love so much by passing HEAT. And Gov. Whitmer signed it.”
“At this time, in 2023, failed Speaker Tate had already been at home for 19 days, starting his Thanksgiving and Christmas vacation early,” Hall added. “But House Republicans don’t operate like that. We do big things and plan on advancing our Regulation Rollback plan and other key priorities in the coming weeks. Democrats are just upset they’re going to have to come to work.”
There are six more days of session scheduled in the House in 2025. 
ALEC has recognized Michigan legislators in the past — Hall was named the organization’s State Legislator of the Month in February and was interviewed by the group at their annual meeting in June. Rep. Phil Green (R-Millington) also serves as the chair of ALEC’s Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/594948726_1248296387107995_1156461055590955424_n-1024x755.jpg,,,2025-12-03 14:57:50.416400

Jeff Landry’s cabinet has been chosen to lead the state’s community and technical college system despite his lack of experience in higher education.  
The Louisiana Community and Technical College System Board of Supervisors voted Wednesday to name state Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson as its next system president. Nelson will replace current President Monty Sullivan, who is retiring after serving in the position since 2014. Nelson will officially take office Jan. 1. 
The board hired Nelson without conducting a search. It is standard practice for boards to convene search committees and undergo a months-long search process for college and university leaders. 
Nelson, a Republican, has no prior work experience in higher education. Before Landry selected him to serve as secretary of the Louisiana Department of Revenue when he took office in 2024, Nelson ran against Landry for governor in 2023 and was previously a one-term member of the Louisiana House of Representatives.
By comparison, Sullivan has more than 30 years experience at two-year and four-year schools in Louisiana and Virginia. 
“​​I’ll tell you with humility, I have a lot to learn about the nuts and bolts of this,” Nelson said in remarks to the board after his hiring. “I really think that the mission of this system is one of the most honorable in the state, and I think one of the most impactful that we can have on the future of the state.” 
Nelson will receive a base salary of $400,000, an increase from his $225,000 salary as revenue secretary. Nelson will also receive a $45,000 annual housing allowance, a $25,000 automobile allowance and $20,000 in deferred compensation. 
Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly did not respond immediately to questions regarding when Nelson’s replacement will be announced. 
Nelson, 39, is 2010 graduate of the LSU Law Center. After graduating, he worked in the U.S. State Department’s Foreign Service for seven years before returning to Louisiana. 
Nelson’s appointment comes amid a major reorganization of higher education leadership in Louisiana. 
Last month, LSU hired Wade Rousse, formerly president of McNeese State in Lake Charles, as its system president, and Jim Dalton, the former provost at the University of Alabama, as its Baton Rouge campus chancellor. LSU is also replacing the chancellor at its medical school in Shreveport.
Last week, Southern University System President Dennis Shields announced he would step down, though its board has not yet announced his replacement. 
The University of Louisiana System is hiring campus leaders at McNeese and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Florida needs to pony up another $50.6 million to help administer the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, members of a House health care spending panel were told this week.
The additional money is needed as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill and Congress’ decision to reduce spending on the SNAP program by $156 billion over a decade. To help accomplish that goal, Congress reduced the federal government’s share of the program’s administrative costs from 50% to 25% effective Oct. 1, 2026.
Congress increased the states’ share of administrative costs from 50% to 75% resulting in the need for an additional $50.6 million.
Department of Children and Families (DCF) Assistant Secretary for Administration Chad Barrett tried to soften the financial blow in his appearance before the House Health Care Budget Subcommittee Tuesday.
“Please keep in mind Florida has the lowest administrative rate in the country, which is $13 per case per month, which puts Florida in the top percentile compared to all other states,” Barrett said.

SNAP is the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s  program that offers nutrition assistance to eligible, low-income individuals and families in the form of funds to purchase eligible food. As of October, more than 2.7 million Floridians in more than 1.5 million households participated in SNAP, Barrett said.
DCF, which administers the SNAP program, included the $50.6 million funding request in its proposed legislative budget request for state fiscal year 2026-27. Although it’s just a wish list, an agency legislative budget request can foreshadow spending priorities in the governor’s proposed budget.
Gov. Ron DeSantis will release his budget for state fiscal year 2026-27 sometime this month. The Legislature is not bound by the governor’s budget but can use the blueprint to guide its spending decisions.
Barrett explained that most of the amount ($34.7 million, or 69%) will cover the salaries and benefits of employees who help the program run — working at the call center, reviewing applications, overseeing investigations and benefits recovery. Another $9 million will be spent on contracted services, such as fraud detection and identity verification.
“I know we use the term administration a lot in this presentation, with the largest impact around staff and the tools required for them to complete their job requirements. But these are frontline staff providing support to Floridians in need and the department does not consider this workforce a true administrative component,” he said.
The $50.6 million is an estimate for annual recurring costs. But because the funding shift doesn’t take effect until Oct. 1 (three months after the start of the state fiscal year) it will only increase the state’s costs by $38 million next year.










Any change to the legislative budget request to the $50.6 million could directly impact the state's overall performance and the eligible Floridians we support.


– Department of Children and Families Assistant Secretary for Administration Chad Barrett


Nevertheless, Barrett stressed the need for the full infusion.
“Any change to the legislative budget request to the $50.6 million could directly impact the state’s overall performance and the eligible Floridians we support,” he said.
Barrett’s presentation was limited to the shift in administrative costs under the One Big Beautiful Bill and its hit to Florida.
But that didn’t stop some committee members from pressing him about another change in the One Big Beautiful Bill that will affect Florida. The bill requires states with high SNAP error rates to contribute to the costs of the food benefits. States with error rates below 6% won’t be required to contribute to the costs.
Error rates include under- and overpayments. Florida’s error rate in 2024 was more than 15%, the majority of which were categorized as overpayments.
Unless lowered, Florida would be required to contribute to 15% of the costs of the food benefit, or an estimated $1 billion, in 2027.
Committee Vice Chair Karen Gonzalez Pittman, a Tampa Republican, asked Barrett whether there could be a connection between the state’s low SNAP administrative costs and a high error rate.
“So, you are saying we have lean administrative costs; we’re lean. But yet we are going to have to pay billions because of the error rate. So, would it be better to have better administration than to pay out penalties?” she asked.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The University of Kansas and public universities in Arizona and Michigan will collaborate on a $3.75 million federal grant to recruit master’s degree recipients into a collaborative doctoral program focused on special education leadership.
The objective of the U.S. Department of Education initiative at University of Arizona in Tucson, Wayne State University in Detroit and KU in Lawrence would be development of a new generation of administrators prepared to be part of reforming special education and fostering partnerships in the discipline that deliver better academic achievement among students.
“There is a pressing need to improve outcomes for students with disabilities,” said Alison Zagona, an assistant professor of special education at KU. “Preparing doctoral students to take leadership roles, we believe, will help improve those outcomes.”
Doctoral students enrolled in the four-year program would receive financial support, including full tuition for four years, a living stipend, health insurance and funds for organizational membership and travel funds. The Department of Education said the program would begin in fall 2026.
The three universities would recruit people to the program who earned master’s degrees and had experience in special education teaching or a comparable career. Graduate students at each of the universities would work with one another as well as faculty on the three campuses.
They also would serve internships at high-need schools to learn directly from educators in the field and to collaborate on research with leaders in the schools.
“We have a wide range of research specialties they will have the chance to take part in and learn from, and they will also be able to explore their own research interests,” Zagona said.
Zagona said graduate students completing the program would be prepared for leadership jobs involved with special education teaching, research and administration.
“One of the biggest jobs of special education leaders is networking and building collaborative partnerships, and our students will get that through this program,” she said.
The Department of Education said applicants must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States to qualify. In addition, the federal agency said it was interested in enrolling scholars with disabilities.

(Photo: Duke Energy) Democratic Attorney General Jeff Jackson is intervening in Duke Energy’s proposal to raise electricity rates in North Carolina.
Duke Energy’s request, filed with the NC Utility Commission Nov. 20, asks for a 15% rate increase over the next two years. This would apply to Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, the company’s two utilities in the state.
“With costs rising everywhere, it’s important we take a close look at Duke Energy’s proposed rate increase to ensure it is necessary,” Jackson said in a statement on Tuesday. “My office is intervening to make sure we find the right balance between investing in our energy infrastructure and protecting North Carolinians’ wallets.”
Jackson’s move is backed by Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who held the role of attorney general prior to his election as the state’s top executive.
In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, Stein described the proposed rate hike as “simply too high.” He also criticized Duke Energy for cutting back on affordable clean energy.
“At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, we should be doing everything we can to make life more affordable, not less,” Stein said.
Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton told NC Newsline the company does not take requests to increase rates lightly.
He said the company is still awaiting a scheduling order from the NCUC for public hearings across the state in 2026.
A decision on the request requires evaluation from the NCUC and the commission’s public staff. Stakeholders like customer advocates and the attorney general are able to voice their concerns as well.
“We look forward to continuing a constructive dialogue with all parties as the review moves forward next year,” Norton wrote in an email.
The rate hike would result in a revenue increase of $1 billion for Duke Energy Carolinas each year, and $729 million for Duke Energy Progress, according to the company. If approved, the increases would increase beginning in 2027.
Monthly electric bills for a typical Duke Energy Carolinas residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would increase by $17.22 each month in 2027 if approved, according to the utility. For the same metric, the rate would increase by $23.11 each month for a typical Duke Energy Progress residential customer.
“Our goal is to deliver reliable power at the lowest possible cost for customers,” Duke Energy’s North Carolina president Kendal Bowman said in a statement announcing the proposed increases. “It’s important to strike the right balance of prioritizing investments that enhance the energy grid for current and future needs while also maximizing cost-saving measures for our customers.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Duke-Energy-Substation_684bcc11-fe6b-4e3a-b86d-f6e7f7b0e0f1-prv1.jpg,,,2025-12-03 14:57:50.416400

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine officials say they will continue to fight the Trump administration over its latest threat to withhold food assistance if the state refuses to share sensitive personal information with the federal government.
“It’s outrageous that we have an administration that focuses this much on cutting funding for food to its citizens,” U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat who represents Maine’s 1st Congressional District, told Maine Morning Star. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is threatening to withhold millions in federal funding from Maine and other states that have refused to comply with its request for information on program recipients.
The Trump administration argues the data is necessary to verify recipients’ eligibility, including immigration status. But Maine officials say the state is already using federal systems to conduct these checks and that the additional data request is illegal and would put Mainers’ privacy at risk.
Roughly 165,000 people in Maine receive benefits through SNAP each month, including more than 50,000 children and 39,000 seniors. More than $200 million in SNAP benefits have been issued so far in 2025.
Federal food aid has been repeatedly used by the Trump administration to try to coerce Democrats or Democratic-led states to comply with its agenda, including freezing payments during the federal government shutdown. 
“This administration has done everything it can to withhold SNAP benefits from people,” Pingree said. She pointed out that each time there’s a news story about these benefits potentially being taken away “there’s hungry people, senior citizens, veterans hearing this…and that causes a lot of stress and worry about food.”
Last spring, the USDA sent its initial request to states to provide information about individuals who receive SNAP benefits, including Social Security numbers, birth dates, home addresses, and immigration status.
In September, a coalition of attorneys general, including Maine’s Aaron Frey, won a temporary injunction after arguing that this sensitive data would likely be shared across federal agencies and used for immigration enforcement, in violation of the law.
During a White House cabinet meeting on Tuesday, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said 28 states and Guam have complied with the data request, and the remaining states, including Maine, have until the end of the week before federal funding is withheld.
Trump administration threatens to yank food stamps funding from Maine, other Democratic-led states

“The governor and attorney general will stand in the way of this cruel and callous attempt by President Trump to cause Maine people to go hungry,” Ben Goodman, a spokesperson for Gov. Janet Mills, said in an emailed statement.
Pingree said while they don’t “have the legal ability to do what they say they are going to do,” she “can’t put it past them to go against the court order.”
As a member of the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture and the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees agriculture, Pingree said she and her colleagues are “trying to use whatever leverage we have” in ongoing negotiations over the Farm Bill and budget “to push back on these issues.”
A spokesperson for the USDA told States Newsroom that administrative funds are specifically being targeted. For Maine, the amount of administrative costs paid by the federal government amounts to roughly $13 million over the course of the year, which Pingree notes would be a “hardship” for the state.
Ian Yaffe, director of the Maine Office for Family Independence at the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, has argued the data request violates state and federal law.
In an August filing in the Northern California district court, Yaffe said Maine DHHS “cannot share confidential SNAP participant data with a third party without executing an appropriate data sharing agreement or Memoranda of Understanding or similar document. USDA has not offered to execute data and security protocols that might address concerns that the requested data would be redisclosed or misused in violation of federal law.”
The Trump administration has also been pressuring states to provide confidential voter and driver’s license data to help build a sweeping citizenship verification program. Maine is currently among the states being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice for refusing to hand over voter data.
Pingree said it’s clear there’s two things they are going after, “a desire to suck up data from the states and a desire to stop food benefits.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/no-kings-maine-25-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-03 14:57:50.416400

“For me, it’s personal,” the Republican said in recorded remarks at a Wednesday news conference by Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.
Kansas families rely on safe road travel for essentials, including health care, employment, education and “everything in between,” Mann said.
The safety advocates organization Tuesday released a report, outlining why most states, including Kansas, received mediocre grades for road safety and how to address lapses in traffic laws.
This year’s report “makes it clear we still have major challenges on our roadways,” Mann said.
Politicians, advocates, law enforcement and mothers who lost their children in car crashes urged lawmakers during the news conference to shape their 2026 agendas to prioritize improving road safety.
The report rates all states and Washington, D.C., based on the organization’s key safety measures, including laws for seatbelt use, motorcycle helmets, child safety, young driver inexperience, impaired and distracted driving, speeding and red light running.
Red, the lowest ranking, means danger, indicating a state with inadequate road safety laws. Yellow means caution and includes states that have some of the organization’s optimal safety measures. Green signifies a good ranking for states that have enacted and enforced most of the measures.
Cathy Chase, president of the safety advocates organization, said 534 laws across the country need to be advanced to meet the organization’s safety criteria.
Kansas is one of 36 states in the yellow because of its lack of child passenger safety, adult occupant protection and young driver programs, according to the report.
Kansas records almost $3 billion in annual costs because of motor vehicle crashes, the report said. In the past 10 years, more than 4,000 people have died in Kansas traffic incidents. That includes 340 deaths in 2024.
In 2023, more than 40,000 people were killed in the U.S. in motor vehicle incidents. Texas had the most traffic deaths that year at 4,291, followed closely by California with 4,061 people. Both states’ numbers decreased in 2024, according to early estimates from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. D.C. had the fewest number of traffic deaths in both years at 44 people in 2023 and 47 people in 2024.
Annual traffic deaths have decreased across the board in recent years, but 2023’s number is still above 2011’s all-time low of 35,303 deaths.
Nearly one third of 2023’s traffic deaths were caused by drunk driving. 
Mann and U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, D-New Hampshire, sponsored this year the End DWI Act, which encourages states to enact laws requiring ignition interlock devices for first-time drunk driving offenses. DWI stands for driving while intoxicated.
The proposed law aims to reduce drunk driving recidivism and keep drunk drivers off the road.Pappas said it’s critical for state and federal lawmakers to have data, and the organization’s report informs efforts to reduce traffic deaths.
“I’m glad that we’re able to pursue a commonsense agenda here in Washington, at a moment where it appears that things are really divided. There’s a lot that unites us, especially when it comes to transportation and infrastructure and safe roadways,” Pappas said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tracey-Mann-with-chamber-4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-03 13:59:07.951382

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster signed an executive order Wednesday ending quotas for minority-owned businesses with state contracts.
The order directs state government agencies not to award future contracts or spend state dollars based on “unconstitutional and discriminatory race-based quotas or set-asides required by existing state law.”
The governor pointed to two sections of state law:

One requires the state Department of Transportation to award a minimum of 5% of certain highway contracts to minority businesses every year.
The other requires all state agencies to submit reports showing each agency spends at least 10% of its annual budget with minority-owned businesses.

“These policies rest on the false assumption that the solution to perceived historical wrongs is to racially discriminate against individuals in the present,” the governor’s order reads.
The order applies to future contracts only. Agencies won’t breach existing contracts.
“Nowhere should any person be treated differently because of their race,” the governor said in a statement “State government spending and procurements should be awarded based on merit and value to the taxpayer, not on set-asides or quotas. This order ensures that until South Carolina’s procurement process complies with the United States Constitution and treats every individual equally under the law, contracts will not be executed.”
The order also calls on state agencies to inform the governor’s office, by Jan. 9, 2026, of any other regulations or policies that require or allow an agency to take race into consideration when awarding a state-funded contract.
Republican Senate President Thomas Alexander and House Speaker Murrell Smith also plan to pre-file bills ahead of the upcoming legislative session to repeal these provisions when the General Assembly returns next month.
“We are a nation and a state dedicated to the principle that ‘all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator,’ as reflected in the Constitution’s requirement of equal protection of the laws,” Alexander, of Walhalla, said in a statement. “When existing laws no longer align with that constitutional command, it is our duty to correct them. I am confident my colleagues in the Senate share my belief that state government must reflect equality under the law in all its endeavors and ensure our statutes fully comply with the Constitution.”
In April, South Carolina’s Republican-controlled House passed a bill prohibiting state agencies, local governments and universities from violating federal discrimination laws with initiatives promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. That bill also would have required private businesses with government contracts to certify they don’t violate federal discrimination laws.
SC House passes bill banning ‘illegal’ DEI across schools and government

“I am proud the members of the House began addressing these issues during last year’s legislative session,” Smith, of Sumter, said in a statement. “Discrimination is wrong, and its misguided use as a remedy is worse. The House will address this when we return in January.”
The Senate, however, has yet to take up the measure.
During the House debate, Democrats argued the loss of DEI programs would leave those who face economic or other disadvantages that more often impact minority populations without support to overcome hurdles not encountered by more affluent peers.
“This is no longer the anti-DEI bill to me. This is the anti-opportunity bill,” Rep. Wendell Jones, D-Piedmont, said on the House floor in April. “You’re closing the door on so many people.
House Republicans trumpeted the measure as South Carolina leading the national anti-DEI movement by adopting the framework of executive orders signed by President Donald Trump banning DEI initiatives at the federal level.
In his executive order, the governor cited those same Trump policies.

(Screenshot | WisEye)Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Annette Ziegler misquoted a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a recent dissent, stating that the country’s highest court said the opposite of what it ruled in a 2023 redistricting decision. Ziegler’s opinion pushed back against  the state Supreme Court’s decision to appoint a pair of three-judge panels to decide challenges to Wisconsin’s  congressional maps. 
On Nov. 26, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 5-2 that two lawsuits alleging the state’s congressional maps are unconstitutional should be heard by the panels because of a 2011 law requiring that action. The Court’s four liberal justices were partially joined in the decision by conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn, who wrote in a concurring opinion that he disagreed with the majority’s decision to appoint the six judges who will sit on the panels. 
In a dissenting opinion written by Ziegler and joined by Justice Rebecca Bradley, the two conservatives argued the decision was made “in furtherance of delivering partisan, political advantage to the Democratic Party.”
But Ziegler wrote in her opinion the U.S. Supreme Court had recently affirmed that “the role of state courts in congressional redistricting is ‘exceedingly limited.’” 
Ziegler cited the Court’s 2023 decision in Moore v. Harper — which was about the North Carolina Supreme Court’s authority to weigh in on congressional redistricting. The phrase “exceedingly limited” does not appear once in the decision.  In that case, a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court found the opposite of what Ziegler claimed.
“State courts retain the authority to apply state constitutional restraints when legislatures act under the power conferred upon them by the Elections Clause,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. 
The misquote was first reported by Slate and Urban Milwaukee’s Bruce Murphy. 
The day after the decision was published, the opinion was withdrawn from the state court’s website and replaced with a different version. The change wasn’t publicly acknowledged by the Court and only removes the quotation marks around the phrase “exceedingly limited.” The correction does not change Ziegler’s mischaracterization of the decision in Moore v. Harper.

Free.,Federal judge blocks sweeping immigration arrests in D.C. without warrants,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-blocks-sweeping-immigration-arrests-dc-without-warrants,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge late Tuesday barred federal agents from carrying out warrantless arrests in the District of Columbia unless they can demonstrate probable cause, after immigration advocates sued.Under the preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Senior Judge Beryl A. Howell, immigration agents can only arrest a person in the district without a warrant if they can establish that the individual is in the United States unlawfully and poses a flight risk before a warrant can be obtained from an authority. Advocates who brought the suit had said they believed Latinos were being targeted for arrests in the district, even those with legal status.“Consequently, viewing all immigrants potentially subject to removal as criminals is, as a legal matter, plain wrong,” wrote Howell, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama.Howell noted Trump administration officials' public comments on the need to meet immigration arrest quotas, rather than focusing on targeted enforcement and probable cause.“Here, ‘the record’ as a whole ‘leaves no doubt’ that defendants in practice have consummated a decisionmaking process that resulted in the implementation of a new policy of conducting warrantless civil immigration arrests based on a lower standard than probable cause,” according to Howell’s order.National Guard presenceThe suit stems from President Donald Trump’s August emergency declaration in the district that flooded the 68-square-mile capital with federal law enforcement and National Guard troops. As a result, there has been an uptick in aggressive immigration enforcement by federal officers, both in plain clothes and masked, in neighborhoods with high immigrant populations.The four individual plaintiffs in the case are all immigrants with some form of legal status, such as a pending asylum case or temporary protections. But all were arrested and detained by federal officers, sometimes for days. In statements to the court, they described feeling like they were being kidnapped and argued they were targeted because of their ethnicity. They said they feared they will continue to be targeted because they are Latino.The legal organizations representing the plaintiffs pushed for two class certifications, which means others who were affected would be represented in the suit. Howell said in her order that she would make a determination on those two class certifications at a later time. ACLU, others praise preliminary injunctionLegal groups representing the plaintiffs celebrated the preliminary injunction.“Despite the Trump administration’s attempts at fear and intimidation, everyone in D.C. has rights, regardless of who they are and their immigration status; and all federal agents are required by law to respect these rights,” according to a joint statement from the legal groups who brought the suit against the federal government. Those legal groups included the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia; the American Civil Liberties Union; Amica Center for Immigrant Rights; CASA; National Immigration Project; the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs; and the law firm of Covington & Burling LLP.",,,,2025-12-03 13:59:07.951382

It came as no surprise whatsoever Tuesday night when Ole Miss Rebel Trinidad Chambliss stepped to the podium to a standing ovation to receive the C Spire Conerly Trophy as Mississippi’s  most outstanding college football player.
No, the bigger surprise is that Chambliss, a dynamic quarterback largely responsible for the Rebels 11-1 season and coming NCAA playoffs berth, has for the most part been omitted from the lists of viable candidates for the Heisman Trophy, the one that goes to the best college football player in America. I can’t say for certain Chambliss is the best in the country, but I know he belongs in the first sentence of any 2025 Heisman discussion. I know he deserves to go to New York as one of the finalists for the ceremony on Dec. 13.
The Heisman Trophy Trust normally invites four finalists to the New York Downtown Athletic Club for the presentation. I haven’t seen a prediction yet that expects Chambliss to be there.
Rick Cleveland
On3, the network of sports websites, recently published a poll of college football experts around the country that had Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia leading the list of likely Heisman winners, followed, in order, by Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, Ohio State quarterback Justin Sayin, Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love and Alabama quarterback Tyler Simpson. In sixth place, with far fewer votes than the top four, was Chambliss.
Pavia, the leader (and a great player), has completed 71 percent of his passes for 3,192 yards and run for 826 yards and nine touchdown. He has thrown 27 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Chambliss has completed 66 percent of his passes for 3,016 yards and run for 470 yards and six touchdowns. He has thrown for 18 touchdowns, only three interceptions. He seems at his best when it matters most. He makes plays when there doesn’t seem one there.

The individual stats are quite similar, especially when you consider Chambliss didn’t start the Rebels first two games and largely missed the opportunity to pad his stats against Georgia State and Kentucky. Chambliss’s numbers are as good or at least slightly better than those of the other three quarterbacks ahead of him.
Most Heisman voters are sports writers and sportscasters who presumably love a good story. There is no better story in college football than Chambliss, unless its Pavia (Vanderbilt? 10-2!), than Chambliss. Last year, Chambliss led Division II Ferris State to the Division II National Championship and transferred to Ole Miss only after assistant coaches Joe Judge and Charlie Weiss Jr. saw some Ferris State tape on him last spring and couldn’t believe what they were watching.
Said Judge, who accompanied Chambliss to the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame Museum Tuesday night, “The more we watched, the more impressed we were. He was clearly a great athlete. You couldn’t tell from that tape whether he was an SEC calibre quarterback but we knew he was a guy with the ability to help us win as a slot receiver or a punt returner.”
Turns out, Chambliss was a quarterback deluxe. As Judge, the former New York Giants head coach, put it, “Trinidad has impacted our team both on and off the field. He’s great in the locker room. His teammates love him and believe in him. In my career, I have been around a lot of great football players and I can tell you with absolute certainty he is one. I don’t have a Heisman vote obviously, but I can tell you Trinidad Chambliss is without question one of the best college football players in America.”
Patrick Kutas, the mammoth Ole Miss junior offensive tackle who Tuesday night took home the Kent Hull Trophy as the state’s most outstanding offensive lineman, says he didn’t know what to expect when learning that Ole Miss had signed a Division II quarterback in the transfer portal.
“The first thing you saw was the competitiveness in him,” Kutas said. “Trinidad is the ultimate competitor. He’s been fantastic all season long. He 100 percent deserves to be in the Heisman race.”
One strike against Chambliss – strange as it sounds – might be that he came to Ole Miss from Division II. The thinking: How can anybody who wasn’t even recruited by a DI school be the best player in America?
Said Chambliss Tuesday night, “There are great players at every level of college football.” 
Myriad examples exist, including a Super Bowl hero named Malcolm Butler, from Vicksburg, Hinds Community College and the University of West Alabama, and former Pro Bowler Fred McAfee, from Philadelphia (the one in Mississippi) and Mississippi College. For the record, 40 former Division II  players currently play in the NFL.
Said Chambliss of his storybook season and the Conerly Trophy, “This is all a dream come true for me. I am blessed.”
Asked about the Heisman Trophy, Chambliss smiled and mentioned that not starting those first two games probably hurt his chances but that, “I really do feel like I am one of the best players in college football. I really do.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-03 18:18:13+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘For such a time as this’: Resource bank to open after last south Jackson supermarket closed,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/03/resource-bank-to-open-in-jackson/,"Magnolia Medical Foundation, a network of clinics and resource centers across the state that focus on providing holistic care to low-income Mississippians, is expanding to the most under-resourced part of Mississippi’s capital city.","Dozens of defunct buildings line Terry Road in south Jackson. Business owners have been leaving the area for more than a decade. 
But one vacant bank may hold promise for the future. Come January, it will open as a different kind of bank – one where resources, referrals and health services are offered for free or low cost. 
Magnolia Medical Foundation, a network of five clinics and resource centers across the state that focus on providing holistic care to low-income Mississippians, is expanding to the most under-resourced part of Mississippi’s capital city. The bank will retain its layout: a drive-through where patients pick up prescriptions, a counter where tellers dole out supplies, such as diapers, and offices where patients meet with providers, social workers and other patient navigators. The bank will take walk-ins, as well as appointments.
“We all at some point in our life are able to make deposits, and sometimes, we’re just only able to make withdrawals,” said Dr. Erica Thompson, founder and executive director of the Magnolia Medical Foundation. “It’s important to have a space where you feel comfortable and you feel safe and you’re able to get the things you need.”
The expansion is made possible by a $200,000 donation from Molina Healthcare, a company based in Long Beach, California, that is a one of the entities that manages the care of Mississippi Medicaid beneficiaries. 
A vacant bank at 3311 Terry Road in south Jackson will reopen as a health clinic and resource bank in January. 
“We are grateful to be a part of the Magnolia Medical Foundation,” said Laurie Williams, assistant vice president of growth and member engagement at Molina Healthcare, during a press conference at the new space Monday. “Dr. Thompson, your vision has just always been epic from the very beginning … We’re not going to be last anymore.”
Mississippi ranked last in the nation for its rate of preterm births – and has failed every year for nearly two decades – a recent report card from March of Dimes showed. While the bank will serve everyone, regardless of insurance status, it will also have services focused on improving outcomes for women, such as pregnancy and birth support from doulas. 
Other patient navigators will include medical providers, mental health providers and social workers, who will help low-income people traverse the complex processes surrounding applications for benefit programs – or help them understand their rights in legal matters. Thompson hopes that businesses and community members will make “deposits” when they can by partnering with the bank, volunteering, making donations and adding to the services offered. 
“Just like a regular bank brings in their investment brokers and all that, we want to bring in other folks who are able to make an investment in south Jackson,” said Thompson. 
Providers at the Magnolia Medical Foundation Midtown clinic spend at least an hour with each patient, according to Belinda Mundora, the foundation’s project director. That’s more than triple the average amount of time family physicians spend with their patients. When providers spend more time with patients they strengthen patients’ trust in them and get a better sense of how circumstances such as unstable housing may influence physical and mental health. 
Kathryn Carroll Barham, a nurse practitioner currently working at the foundation’s Midtown clinic, said the work she does is more often social than medical. Carroll said she’s excited to continue that work in a place where the need for it is great. 
“That’s why I want to work in a place like this – that has something that’s so holistic, working with people who think about every part of the patient rather than just the physical aspect,” Carroll Barham said.  
The Midtown clinic also operates a food pantry Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thompson said she hopes to do food drops at least once a month at the new location. 
The foundation’s expansion couldn’t come at a more opportune time. Food Depot, the last remaining full-service grocery store in south Jackson, shuttered two weeks ago. Kroger and Piggly Wiggly of south Jackson closed in 2015. 
Food Depot on Terry Road was the last full-service grocery store in south Jackson before it closed in mid-November. 
Living in a food desert means people either go without fresh meat and produce, or they travel to supermarkets where their tax dollars support cities other than their own. In these areas, local economies collapse and people tend to be sicker. 
Those effects are expected to be exacerbated by major changes to social safety net programs coming down the pipeline. Tens of millions of dollars previously covered by the federal government for programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid will shift to states, due to the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill signed into law by President Donald Trump over the summer. Experts predict this will force states to limit benefits, cap enrollment or shut down services altogether. 
Thompson knows these changes will impact most of the patients she sees. Jackson’s median income is $43,000 – well below the state median income of $54,000. Mississippi is among the poorest states in the nation. To be eligible for SNAP, individuals must make less than about $20,000 annually. New work requirements from the federal budget bill are expected to make it harder for eligible people to remain enrolled. 
“I always think about the scripture, ‘for such a time as this,’” Thompson said. “This is the perfect place for the storm.”

Austin-based Saronic Technologies will spend $300 million at its facility in Franklin, where it purchased the former Gulf Craft shipyard in April. Its expansion will include three new boat slips, a larger warehouse and a new production line where it will build larger vessels.
The additional jobs announced Wednesday will have an average annual salary near $88,000, officials said. 
Saronic builds vessels that operate without a crew for military and commercial purposes. The company laid the keel of its first 150-foot ship, the Marauder, in August. The shipyard workforce has increased from 35 after the April acquisition to more than 100, according to the state agency. 
According to online federal contract records, the U.S. Navy agreed in May to hire Saronic to build an unspecified fleet of unmanned vessels for $392 million. The “small craft” contract calls for the work to be completed by May 30, 2031, and the Navy awarded about half that dollar amount to the company in July. 
Saronic launched in 2022 and has previously worked with the Defense Department on autonomous watercraft technology. In October, the company revealed plans to mass produce a 24-foot boat called the Corsair to meet the Pentagon’s call for more unmanned resources. 
Saronic has also developed 6-, 14-, 40- and 60-foot vessels. 
In addition to its Louisiana shipyard, Saronic is outfitting a 420,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Austin.

The appeal was filed in New Britain Superior Court by Eversource, Aquarion’s owner, and the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority, known as RWA, which is seeking to buy the water company and turn it into a quasi-public entity.
PURA rejected the sale last month after regulators raised concerns with the governance structure of a new quasi-public authority set up to oversee Aquarion and said that the sale “contravenes the public interest.”
In their complaint filed on Tuesday, however, attorneys for the two utilities pointed out that the structure of the newly-created Aquarion Water Authority was dictated by a law passed during a special session of the legislature in 2024 to facilitate the sale of the private utility. While the law also required PURA to review and approve the sale, the utilities argued that regulators had no authority to second-guess how lawmakers chose to structure the authority.
“This appeal is an opportunity to address legal aspects in a regulatory decision that praised AWA and RWA for their operational expertise, financial management, and customer service,” Aquarion President Lucy Teixeira and RWA Chief Financial Officer Rochelle Kowalski said in a joint statement following the filing of the lawsuit. 
“The proposed sale to AWA is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shift ownership to a model that truly benefits all parties involved: residential customers, communities, and businesses for years to come and puts affordability and predictability at the forefront,” the statement continued. 
A spokesperson for PURA did not respond to requests to comment on the appeal Wednesday. 
Critics of the deal, including Attorney General William Tong, have argued that the sale would result in higher water rates for Aquarion’s roughly 250,000 customers, as well as a loss of sales tax revenues in dozens of towns where the company owns reservoirs, pipelines and other assets. (As part of the deal, Aquarion planned to sell off its assets New Hampshire and Massachusetts to the utility company Unitil.)
“Eversource is desperate to offload Aquarion after not getting the massive rate hike they wanted,” Tong said in a statement Tuesday. “They need to take no for an answer — no one wants this deal. PURA was right to reject this costly loser, and we are prepared to vigorously defend this decision on appeal.”
While officials at both Aquarion and RWA had pledged not to immediately increase rates as part of the deal, filings submitted to PURA projected that Aquarion’s customers would have seen annual rate increases of between 6.5% and 8.35% over the next decade under the new quasi-public authority.
After PURA announced its decision to block the sale last month, Eversource Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer John Moreira released a statement saying the company would seek a rate increase of between $60 million and $70 million for Aquarion customers sometime in 2026.
Rates for privately-owned utilities must be approved by PURA. In Aquarion’s last rate case prior to its proposed sale, regulators opted to cut the company’s rates by nearly 11%. 
Since then, PURA has undergone a shakeup with its former chief, Marissa Gillett, stepping down in October. Gillett was replaced by interim Chair Thomas Wiehl along with two new commissioners and a third on the way.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/saugatuck.jpg,,,2025-12-03 13:59:07.951382

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The chair of the Rhode Island House Committee on Education plans to submit a bill in the 2026 legislative session that would craft a new, statewide anti-hazing policy after two recent incidents in Newport and Smithfield. 
Rep. Joseph M. McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, announced Tuesday that he has “pre-filed” a bill which would create a zero tolerance policy for hazing and set up clear disciplinary standards for student athletes who engage in such behavior. The possible punishments for hazing include suspension from a team and potential cancellation of a team’s season as appropriate, according to a press release on McNamara’s current draft of the proposal.         
“As a retired educator, coach and former student athlete, I can state without reservation that hazing is degrading, abusive and dangerous,” McNamara, who once served as the director of the Pawtucket School Department’s Alternative Learning Program, said in a statement. 
“We’ve all worked hard to make schools safer, more welcoming and more inclusive,” McNamara continued. “Athletics should not be an exception to that rule. Regardless of what form it takes, hazing creates an environment of trauma and humiliation, and we have to take it more seriously.”
McNamara cited two high-profile cases of hazing this school year, both involving football teams, as the impetus behind the bill. In late September at Smithfield High School, a freshman player was trapped in a locker room bathroom and allegedly sprayed with aerosol cleaner. Amid accusations that the hazing also included antisemitic slurs, players who participated in the hazing were suspended but later reinstated. 
At Newport’s Rogers High School in late November, four football players were arrested and the team’s season canceled after a student with special needs was assaulted in the locker room, an incident which was recorded on students’ phones. The Newport School Committee met in closed session on Nov. 26 and voted to hire an independent investigator of the incident.
James Dring, the Newport School Committee’s chair, confirmed in an email Wednesday that the committee has hired retired Rhode Island State Police Superintendent Steven O’Donnell to carry out the investigation.    
“He started his investigation on Monday and we hope to have it wrapped up by the end of this month,” Dring said. 
The Newport police department’s own investigation is ongoing, Newport Police Capt. Joseph C. Carroll said via email Wednesday. He said there were no further updates at the moment. 
“We need a statewide policy where every student-athlete, coach and administrator will understand that these behaviors will no longer be acceptable and there will be consequences to both athletes and teams,” McNamara said in his statement. 
Legislators can pre-file bills ahead of the upcoming Jan. 6 legislative session from Nov. 15 to Jan. 5. McNamara intends to submit his bill in January.
Larry Berman, a House spokesperson, said in an email Tuesday that around 200 bills have been pre-filed in the past several years. The bills typically hit the floor of their respective chamber within the first few weeks of the new legislative session in January, he added. 
Pre-filed bills are not usually highlighted publicly ahead of the legislative session unless they involve high-profile issues. Pre-filed bills publicized in the past have included legislation related to reproductive health care, insulin prices, hit-and-run accidents, and extending the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse.  
The state does not have a specific statewide policy on addressing hazing, Victor Morente, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Education, said via email Tuesday. But there is a policy called the Safe School Act, which, according to the act, seeks to “ensure a consistent and unified statewide approach to the prohibition of bullying at school.” 
Morente added that Rhode Island General Law prohibits hazing at educational institutions across grade levels, including colleges and universities. The law allows for misdemeanor charges for hazing and, with conviction, potential fines of up to $500 or imprisonment between 30 days and one year.  
Morente said that the education department will “carefully review the proposed legislation” which McNamara submitted in draft form to the agency. 
McNamara also sent the bill to the Rhode Island Interscholastic League, with whom he intends to collaborate to craft the bill’s final version. The Interscholastic League is the non-governmental body responsible for regulating scholastic sports in Rhode Island.

Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi in a Jan. 6 special election for her Richmond-area Senate seat. (Photos courtesy of campaigns)Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, has set a Jan. 6 special election to fill the soon-to-be vacant seat of Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, clearing the way for a fast, intraparty fight in one of the state’s safest Democratic districts.
Two Democrats — Del. Debra Gardner of Chesterfield County and Del. Michael Jones of Richmond — have already launched campaigns to succeed Hashmi. The party has not yet set its nomination process, though officials expect a firehouse primary given the compressed calendar.
Hashmi, first elected to the Senate in 2019, won the lieutenant governorship last month and will vacate the 15th District seat just a year into her second term. 
Under state law, the responsibility for calling a special election falls to the Senate’s highest-ranking member while the chamber remains in session. Lucas, a Hampton Roads Democrat who has long held the pro tempore role, exercised that authority after weeks of anticipation from party leaders.
Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, who chairs the Democratic Party of Virginia, said the timing of the contest leaves little room for error.
“I feel good about our chances of winning the district, but we still have to run through the tape and do the work and not take it for granted,” Bagby told the Virginia Mercury last month.

Democrats caution that even overwhelmingly blue seats can tighten when turnout is unusually low — a common dynamic in Virginia special elections, which often fall during holidays or legislative deadlines. “You can’t just assume that you put a Democrat on the ballot and folks are just going to come,” Bagby said.
The 15th District, redrawn in late 2021, includes large portions of Richmond and northern Chesterfield. According to the Virginia Public Access Project, it has reliably supported Democrats running for statewide and federal office in recent years and is home to more than 133,000 registered voters. 
Analysts say shifting demographics — including diversifying neighborhoods in south Richmond and growing Black and Latino communities in Chesterfield — have only strengthened the party’s advantage.
No Republican had formally declared. Hayden Fisher, the GOP’s 2023 nominee, said in an email last month that he would not seek a rematch. 
The Democratic field, however, is already taking shape. 
Gardner, first elected to the House of Delegates two years ago, said she intends to build on Hashmi’s legislative work and pointed to her background in social work, advocacy and local government. “I’ve spent my career serving Virginia families — from protecting survivors of abuse to fighting for fair wages and affordable health care,” she said.
Jones, a former Richmond City Council president who also entered the House in 2024, emphasized his progressive record on public safety, housing, education and health care. He also noted his work on Confederate monument removal and police reforms. “I am eager to continue to provide strong, progressive, compassionate, energetic leadership to Chesterfield County and Richmond in the state Senate,” he said.
Because Jan. 6 falls just days before lawmakers return to Richmond for the 2026 General Assembly session, Democrats expect a tight turnaround for voters and campaigns alike. 
Special elections traditionally draw modest participation, and the early-January timing — following the holidays and coming on the heels of statewide turnover — may push turnout even lower.

Cox proposes millions for homeless campus while also hoping for federal funds,Katie McKellar,,,,,https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2025/12/03/utah-gov-cox-proposes-millions-for-homeless-campus/,"As part of his $30.7 billion state budget recommendation unveiled Wednesday morning, Utah Gov.

(Courtesy of the Utah Office of Homeless Services)As part of his $30.7 billion state budget recommendation unveiled Wednesday morning, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox proposed the Utah Legislature — which controls the purse strings — use $25 million in one-time money and $20 million in ongoing funding for “homelessness and criminal justice high utilizers.”
The governor’s budget recommendation doesn’t explicitly say that money should be used to fund a 1,300-bed homeless campus that the state’s stop homelessness leaders have proposed in northwest Salt Lake City. But the governor recently said that campus — envisioned to help Utah be a “pilot” state to fulfill President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” — is a top priority for his administration. 
The “intent” is to use that funding for the proposed homeless campus, Sophia DiCaro, executive director of the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget, told reporters in a briefing ahead of Cox’s announcement Wednesday morning. But she also said specifics for that funding and its uses are still being fleshed out. 
Utah Gov. Cox says homeless campus — envisioned to fulfill Trump’s order — is a ‘top priority’

“The details are still being developed in terms of what exactly that would look like,” she said. “But the idea is the target market is the population that is tending to be the high utilizers of the criminal justice system.” 
Plans for the campus are still taking shape. The Utah Homeless Services Board last week fielded input from homeless service providers, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County and others within Utah’s homeless services network. 
But over the last several months, the state’s top homelessness leaders have proposed including in the campus hundreds of beds for people who are civilly committed — or court ordered into mental health treatment. They have also envisioned an “accountability center” or a “secure residential placement facility” for substance abuse treatment as an alternative to jail, where people who are “sanctioned” to go there would not be able to leave voluntarily. 
DiCaro noted that the governor’s newly appointed state homeless coordinator, Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, is slated to start his new position in March after the state’s current homeless coordinator, former Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, retires in December. 
Clancy won’t start in his new role until after the Legislature’s 2026 general session concludes, so “there’s going to be some time needed to develop exactly what” the proposed funding entails, “but the idea is for that to be flexible as that gets developed,” DiCaro said. 
“It’s fair to say that the intent is for that (funding) to be used for a campus. It’s what kind of services go into the campus that I’m not able to answer at this time because those kind of details will likely require involvement by the courts, corrections, public safety, as well as the other service providers,” DiCaro said, adding that figuring out those details will require “collaboration and partnership.” 
Some homelessness, housing and low-income aid advocates have criticized the proposed campus project and expressed concerns about forcing drug or mental health treatment on people while shifting away from “Housing First” strategies. But Cox has defended it as a way to bring more “accountability” but also more “compassion” into Utah’s homelessness system by not letting people addicted to drugs or those with mental illness to languish on the streets. 
Homelessness advocates, environmentalists rally against homeless ‘mega shelter’

“Gov. Cox remains committed to ending the harm and prevalence of homelessness and addressing criminal activity associated with substance use and behavioral health,” the governor’s budget proposal says, adding that the additional funding “will help Utah align” with Trump’s executive order. 
Trump’s order encourages cities and states to enforce stricter anti-camping laws, expands power to involuntarily treat and civilly commit people experiencing homelessness, and directs federal officials to end support for “Housing First” strategies, an approach to homelessness that prioritizes providing housing while offering — but not requiring — treatment. 
“Legislative adoption of this recommendation will signal Utah’s commitment to doing its part to address a nationwide problem while leveraging matching federal dollars to fund solutions that work,” the governor’s budget recommendation says, while adding that Cox’s administration “recognizes that this will entail a long-term effort.”
The campus — which state officials have estimated will cost at least $75 million to build, plus north of $34 million a year to operate — is a long way from becoming a reality, which largely hinges on funding. 
Last year, the Utah Homeless Services Board initially voted to set a deadline of Oct. 1 of this year for it to be built, but after state leaders spent more than a year searching for a property, that deadline was pushed. Now state leaders estimate the first phase of the campus won’t be built until sometime in 2027. 
Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature usually doesn’t finalize the budget until the final days of its general session, which is slated to begin in January and end in early March. Even if lawmakers agree to fund all of Cox’s 2026 and 2027 budget recommendations, the campus would still need tens of millions of dollars more to be fully funded.

That’s where the Trump administration may come in. 
The governor has said he’s “hopeful” the federal government will “see the wisdom in this, and they expressed interest in helping these types of projects.” But whether the federal government does help fund the campus or related projects remains to be seen. 
“There’s going to be some federal grant opportunities that will be connected to (Trump’s executive order),” DiCaro said, pointing to the Continuum of Care Competition and the Youth Homeless Demonstration Program as grants state leaders will “try to compete for.” 
“We think we’ll be in a good position in terms of competing for the opportunities there,” she said. “So we definitely want to use this to leverage federal opportunities and large private contributions as well.”

(Getty Images)Indiana will begin allowing some state employees to bring their infants to work under a pilot program announced Tuesday by Gov. Mike Braun and detailed in a newly issued policy.
The move comes months after Braun’s administration ended hybrid schedules for most state workers and rescinded thousands of remote-work agreements as part of a broader return-to-office directive that requires employees to report in-person unless granted narrow exceptions.
The “Family First Workplace” initiative has already launched for staff in the governor’s office, the Indiana Department of Health and the State Personnel Department, according to Braun’s announcement. 
The governor said the effort is part of Indiana’s commitment “to strengthening families, supporting parents in the workforce, and promoting healthy early childhood development.”
“Indiana is going to lead the nation in pro-family policy. The parental bonding that happens in the first months of a child’s life are irreplaceable, and our new Family First Workplace pilot program helps parents stay connected to their newborns while continuing their careers,” Braun said in the news release. “Indiana is building a culture that puts families first.” 
The governor’s announcement followed an executive order issued earlier this year that expanded paid childbirth leave and parental leave, as well as paid leave for state employees who experience a stillbirth or infant loss.
SPD policy sets standards, restrictions
The new, four-page policy officially took effect Dec. 2 and aims to “provide a framework for a pilot program that will allow parents to bring their infants to the workplace where operational needs and the environment make such opportunities feasible, safe, and effective without impeding productivity,” according to the document.
The policy states that time spent with parents in the first six months of a child’s life “is important to their health and wellbeing, and that having opportunities to have their infants nearby can generate higher morale, increase job satisfaction, and motivate higher productivity in employees who are new parents.”
Story continues below.
Infants-at-Work-Policy
 
But the document emphasizes that participation in the program “is a privilege, not a right,” and it’s only available to employees once an agency establishes its own formal program.
SPD defines eligible state workers as full-time employees of the governor’s office, IDOH, SPD and any other agencies later authorized to participate in the pilot program by Braun’s office. Participants must be employed by the state at the time the infant is born.
An “infant” is specifically described in the policy as “the biological or adoptive child of an eligible employee who is between four weeks and six months of age, and who is not yet able to crawl or walk without assistance.”
Children can only be in tow for up to six months. An infant becomes ineligible at the end of the calendar week in which they turn six months old — or when they become mobile — “whichever occurs first,” per the policy.
What the program requires
Before bringing an infant to work, an employee must submit a written request at least 10 business days in advance and complete a series of documents, including a participation agreement and waiver, a pediatrician clearance form, and a supervisor sign-off confirming the details of participation.
Indiana governor expands paid parental leave for state employees

Signatures are also required from coworkers who agree to serve as “alternate care providers” — defined in the policy as fellow employees “who ha(ve) expressly agreed to step in to care for the Infant for not more than one-hour per workday if the eligible employee must attend to duties that cannot be effectively performed if the infant becomes disruptive at that time.”
Alternate providers are prohibited from providing care more than a total of one hour per workday, and supervisors cannot assign subordinates to serve in that role.
The policy does not make clear how many coworkers must agree to help, however.
Participating employees must also “maintain productivity,” including meeting quality, quantity, and timeliness” performance standards; keep the infant’s area clean and sanitary; ensure the child has all required vaccinations; and remove the infant if management deems the child disruptive.
Agency management is responsible for determining if a child is disruptive. In such instances, employees “will use appropriate leave for the remainder of the workday.”
Where infants are — and are not — allowed
Agencies must determine which workplace locations are safe and appropriate. 
But the policy lists several areas where infants can’t be present, including:

stairwells
state vehicles
laboratories
fabrication, maintenance or construction areas
storage rooms
kitchens with hot appliances
loading docks
utility or mechanical rooms
server rooms
fitness rooms during active use
locations accessible by incarcerated individuals or federal detainees
Family and Social Services Administration/Division of Mental Health Addiction hospital patient areas
any posted restricted or high-noise area


Infants have to remain in the employee’s regular work station or designated infant-care areas unless being taken to a lactation or diaper-changing space.
Employees are additionally prohibited from placing their Infant in state vehicles and taking their Infant with them while traveling for conferences, inspections audits or other field work.
Participating agencies have obligations, too, like creating lactation spaces; identifying coordinators to handle questions and approvals; determining which positions and work locations are suitable; and enforcing safety and productivity requirements.
They’re also directed to terminate an employee’s participation if operational needs or performance standards aren’t being met.

(Screenshot from TikTok)When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials swept into North Carolina, Governor Josh Stein urged people to pull out their phones and record any inappropriate behavior. 
It’s good advice. Filming law enforcement in public is one of the few tools ordinary people have to hold powerful federal agents accountable. The right to record police in public is also protected by the First Amendment. 
But federal officials have repeatedly chased, assaulted, and even arrested Americans, including North Carolinians, for recording them. This isn’t just unconstitutional. It’s dangerous.
Take Charlotte resident and U.S. citizen Miguel Angel Garcia Martinez. On November 16, after Martinez photographed federal agents in public places around the city, Border Patrol officers stopped his car and told him to step out “voluntarily.” When Martinez refused and drove away, agents chased him for nearly two miles through busy streets.
Video shows ICE agents suggesting smashing Martinez’s vehicle and imagining him being shot. They laughed that the chase was “fun,” even as Martinez swerved into oncoming traffic and medians to avoid crashes. Martinez was arrested and charged with two felonies. A court later dismissed the charge accusing him of using his vehicle as a deadly weapon, finding that it was federal agents who tried to hit Martinez with their vehicles, not the other way around.
Or look at Oregon, where a U.S. citizen, Berenice Garcia-Hernandez, took pictures of unmarked ICE cars in a Chick-fil-A parking lot. ICE officers pursued her in their cars down public streets and violently arrested her. They accused Garcia-Hernandez of aggressively following and obstructing them, but a cellphone video showed that wasn’t true. 
In Chicago, federal agents surrounded three members of a local “rapid response” group with multiple vehicles and arrested them in September, simply because they were filming the officers. 
Federal officers in Chicago also shot Marimar Martinez multiple times on a public street after she followed them in her car. The Department of Homeland Security accused her of using her vehicle as a weapon and said she had a history of “doxing” officers. Martinez said it was agents who had rammed her. Prosecutors dismissed the charges against her after inconsistencies in the government’s story emerged.
Maybe you think some of these people should have complied or shouldn’t have fled. But what’s more important is that federal agents never should have stopped them in the first place. Exercising your constitutional rights isn’t a crime. 
And when people flee an illegal stop, federal officers put everyone at risk by giving chase. Police chases kill innocent people every year. That’s why many local police departments rightly restrict them. Officers in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, for instance, may only pursue someone when there’s a threat to life or risk of public harm.
Recording federal agents isn’t a threat to anyone’s life. The government claims that recording agents puts them at risk of doxxing and harassment. But law enforcement already has criminal statutes to handle cases of actual threats or harassment. What they can’t do is punish people for recording in public. 
The dangers don’t stop with car chases. They also show up at protests, where federal agents often use dangerous crowd control munitions against journalists and others photographing or filming them. These weapons can maim or kill. 
Ask photojournalist Nick Stern, who had shrapnel surgically removed from his leg after being struck by a “less lethal” munition while covering a protest in June. Or Lisa Tirado, a journalist blinded in one eye and left with a traumatic brain injury after she was struck by a crowd control round during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in Minneapolis. Tirado is now in hospice care, dying from the injuries she suffered. 
Federal courts have said repeatedly that attacking journalists at protests violates the First Amendment. But what’s received less attention is that these actions put innocent people in grave danger: journalists, peaceful protesters, and even bystanders.  
And for what? So federal agents can operate without the public seeing what they do?
These tactics aren’t about safety. They’re about control. Federal agents don’t want cameras pointed at them because it can force accountability. When they lash out at people who record them, it’s not just those targeted who are in danger; everyone around them is at risk too. Agents’ reckless responses to being recorded are threatening both our constitutional rights and the public’s physical safety.

Jeff Landry speaks in the Louisiana House of Representatives on the opening day of a legislative special session, Nov. 6, 2024, at the State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Gov. Jeff Landry left no room for doubt in late October when asked whether then-LSU Athletics Director Scott Woodward would hire the university’s next football coach. With harsh criticism of the buyout terms in Brian Kelly’s contract, the governor all but said outright that Woodward would also be dismissed for having crafted the deal that will pay Kelly nearly $54 million not to coach the Tigers. 
Landry strongly suggested LSU make an incentive-based offer to its next football coach, implying any losses would directly impact their pay. 
“We’re going to make sure that he’s compensated properly, and we’re going to put metrics on him because I’m tired of rewarding failure in this country and then making the taxpayers foot the bill,” Landry said during an Oct. 29 news conference. 
Setting aside the fact that taxpayers have never been on the hook for LSU’s coaching buyouts, the governor appeared intent on reining in the soaring salaries of college football coaches.
Then market forces entered the conversation.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When Lane Kiffin became the primary target for new LSU Athletics Director Verge Ausberry, it became crystal clear he would have to be made one of the highest-paid coaches in the nation to leave Ole Miss. Kiffin’s seven-year, $91 million deal with LSU elevates him from 10th on the college football compensation list to No. 2, with an annual pay of $13 million. That’s barely behind Georgia’s Kirby Smart and just ahead of Ohio State’s Ryan Day, who both have national championship trophies on their mantles.
Should Kiffin lead LSU to a national title, with a single trophy being the minimal expectation from Tiger fans, his contract calls for him to become the highest paid coach in the country.
While he apparently placed no limits on what LSU could spend to corral Kiffin, the governor certainly seemed intent on ensuring the new coach’s buyout terms would be far more modest than Kelly’s.
Not so fast, my friend.
If LSU wants to fire Kiffin just because he loses too many games, he would be owed 80% of his remaining salary. His contract doesn’t include any contingencies to offset what he’s owed if he is terminated and then takes another coaching job.
LSU is also covering the $3 million Kiffin owes Ole Miss to get out of his contract there, plus it will cover any post-season bonus he would have made had he remained the Rebels’ coach. It’s all but certain that will include $150,000 for Ole Miss playing in the first round of the playoffs, and it could mean $1 million more if the Rebels win the national title.
Landry is far from the first Louisiana leader to take an active interest in LSU athletics. It’s well known that Huey Long did everything but suit up for the Tigers during his tenure as governor and U.S. senator, helping flesh out the school’s new campus along Highland Road with a state-funded football stadium that doubled as a dormitory. 
John McKeithen, the governor from 1964-72, was arguably a more ardent booster, regularly attending LSU football practices and away games as well as actively recruiting future legends like Bert Jones and Tommy Casanova. McKeithen also put in motion plans to build what’s now the Pete Maravich Assembly Center.
It’s too soon to tell whether Landry will rival these predecessors with his involvement in LSU sports, though he set a clear precedent when he okayed the rental of a live tiger to appear on the sidelines for last year’s Alabama game. 
Landry easily wields more power over the university than any other governor in modern history. He has the loyalty of not only his personal appointees to LSU’s Board of Supervisors but also those who predate his administration. 
Scott Ballard, Landry’s hand-picked board chairman, has helped implement the governor’s higher education agenda, exorcising campus policy and curriculum linked to diversity, equity and inclusion. Ballard also orchestrated the hiring of a Landry-favored candidate for LSU president, Wade Rousse. 
But for all the might the governor has displayed when it comes to LSU administration, the Kiffin contract reveals Landry’s limits. Even he seemed to acknowledge as much Monday during an interview with Fox News, when he was asked about LSU’s “poach” of the Ole Miss coach with the Rebels heading into the playoffs.
“You don’t hate the player,” Landry said. “You can hate the game if you like, but that’s where we are in college sports right now.”

Oct. 1, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceMichigan’s Republican House Speaker Matt Hall has come under fire for receiving tickets to a Detroit Lions game supplied by a lobbyist, which is also now the subject of a lobbying law complaint from a campaign finance attorney with a long history in Michigan politics.
The lobbyist involved in the matter has also since said that he has a copy of the check he says shows Hall, of Richland Township, paid the full market price of the tickets before he took possession of the tickets, in line with current law.
Hall has said that he paid for the tickets, which were allegedly purchased for just under $600. The game in question was the Nov. 2 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings, which the Lions lost. It’s unclear where Hall sat during the game, but in September, the starting value of the lowest priced tickets of a Lions home game was around $260 each. It was also reported that other matches had market ticket values ranging $266 to more than $400.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The complaint, filed Monday by Bob LaBrant, asserts that Hall received the tickets from William Wortz of Public Affairs Associates.
Wortz, in an interview with Michigan Advance, said Hall did pay the full market value for the tickets and that he had a copy of the check. Wortz also said that he plans to comply with the Michigan Bureau of Elections, and quite possibly the Michigan Department of Attorney General if the complaint advances that far, by providing the agencies with copies of the check.
“I have the check. It’s full for full market value, and I got it three days before the game,” Wortz said. “It came from a personal account, not a political account of any sort. From Matt Hall’s personal account.”
LaBrant is the former general counsel for the Michigan Chamber of Commerce. He has filed various complaints against Republicans and Democrats alike for lobbying and election law concerns over the past several years.
In the complaint filed Monday, LaBrant references The Detroit News’ reporting on the tickets, which said Hall obtained them through a lobbying firm. 
The Nov. 2 game occurred in the days leading up to Hall saying he would not entertain expanding the state’s Freedom of Information Act laws to cover the governor’s office and the Legislature. At present, current FOIA law does not extend to the executive office and lawmakers’ offices, but a group of legislators, led by state Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield), is hoping to change that.










I don't know what we could have done wrong then. We believe we did what we were supposed to do under the new law.


– William Wortz of Public Affairs Associates


In the interim, there is no current process through FOIA to compel Hall to release a receipt or a reimbursement check that he provided to Wortz or his firm for the tickets.
Enter LaBrant’s complaint, which specifically states that he flagged the potential lobby law violation to compel Wortz to release the amount allegedly paid for the tickets and a photo copy of the reimbursement check.
“This would allow for administrative, investigative and prosecutorial economy of resources,” LaBrant wrote to the state.
LaBrant also noted his belief that, if the transaction was found to violate the state’s lobbying, gifts and disclosure laws, Public Affairs Associates could be charged with a misdemeanor for violating the current reimbursement rules on tickets valued more than $79 a month.
LaBrant asks the state to determine if the check was drawn from Hall’s personal checking account; if the check was made payable to the firm or Wortz, both of which is prohibited under current law; if the check was received before or after the game; and if the check was sufficient to cover the fair market value of tickets provided.
If the check was not drawn out of Hall’s personal account, LaBrant asks the state to determine if the check was drawn using a non-profit fund account linked to Hall.
“Past Speakers have used a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization linked to them to pay for personal expenses,” LaBrant wrote. “This would not be a violation of the Michigan Lobby Law if the 501(c)(4) organization is not registered as a lobbyist or lobbyist agent. If this is the case, when notified by BOE, as the undersigned complainant, I will immediately withdraw my complaint.”
LaBrant also said that if Wortz or the firm refuses to voluntarily comply with the request, should the Michigan Bureau of Elections open an inquiry, the complaint should be forwarded to the Michigan Department of Attorney General.
“Upon a showing of probable cause, the Attorney General can seek an investigative subpoena to obtain emails, bank records,and other documents from (the firm),” LaBrant wrote.
That said, Wortz told the Advance that he was willing to provide the check and any other information to the proper authorities, whether that be the Bureau of Elections or the attorney general’s office.
The Detroit News reported that it had asked Wortz for a copy of the check but he declined to provide it or show the reporter a copy. Wortz told the Advance on Wednesday that he didn’t feel it was his place to do so, especially considering that it had Hall’s personal information on it and he wasn’t sure if the speaker would be OK with sharing that personal information. 
He did not provide a copy of the check to the Advance.
Wortz also said that he was willing to provide the state with a letter that he sent to Hall, indicating that Wortz notified Hall that he has to pay for the tickets in advance of the game as required by new changes in the law.
The law change in question bans lawmakers from receiving gifts from lobbyists more than $79, although sports tickets and concerts are allowed. However, that’s only if the fair market value of the tickets is provided before the lawmakers take possession of the tickets.
“It was sent over to him. He then wrote a personal check and sent a copy of that letter back to us, so I have the letter we sent, the copy of the letter he sent back, and his check,” Wortz said. “I don’t know what we could have done wrong then. We believe we did what we were supposed to do under the new law.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA015559-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:56:39.209113

Raised in rural West Fairlee, Ailyn Langley followed her fascination with nature to Dartmouth. Now a first-generation college student exploring marine biology, she’s embracing new opportunities as she charts her path toward a future shaped by curiosity and discovery.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dreaming big, diving deep: Ailyn Langley’s road to colleg[...]","Raised in the hills of rural West Fairlee, Ailyn Langley has always gravitated toward nature—woods, water, and everything in between. As she grew older, her interest turned seaward, sparked by a school trip to the Boston Aquarium with her class at Rivendell High School. Her job in the fish and reptile department at the West Lebanon Aquarium Center deepened that curiosity.
Now a first-year student at Dartmouth College, Ailyn hasn’t declared her major quite yet—but time around salt-water creatures has stuck with her. Ailyn is leaning toward majoring in biology with a focus on marine life.
“I’m headed toward the ocean,” she says confidently. “It’s fascinating and beautiful and I want to be able to look deeper into it. Many parts of the ocean are misunderstood in one way or another,” she says. And Ailyn means sharks, in particular. “People are generally very scared of them. But take hammerhead sharks as an example. You have to use special equipment to swim with them that doesn’t produce bubbles because they are afraid of them. It’s fascinating.”
Ailyn is focusing deeply on marine biology, but she’s also fascinated by neuroscience. Both interests are rooted in classes she took with the same teacher at Rivendell High School. And although she’s only been at Dartmouth for a few months, she is already thinking about the possibilities in front of her. Ailyn says that she wants to take full advantage of every opportunity, especially as Dartmouth was the school that was always in the back of her mind as the place she wanted to be. “I enjoy being here,” she smiles. “The faculty are wonderful and I’ve made some really good friends.” 
There are even some programs at Dartmouth that give students the opportunity to dive, says Ailyn, and she’s excited to learn more about those options. “I really want to use all the opportunities I have here to look into more specifically what I can do. There are still so many things about sharks that haven’t been researched yet, or there are still a lot of questions out there about them, like the fact that no one really knows why hammerheads have heads shaped like a hammer! What if I could help answer those?” 
Working to Reach Her Dream School
Ailyn’s mom passed away from melanoma when Ailyn was 11. Her father is very supportive of Ailyn’s choices, but he wasn’t necessarily well-versed in the college process. Getting into Dartmouth wasn’t easy, Ailyn says.
Ailyn participated in VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program in high school, and she began working with VSAC Outreach Counselor Kassidy Moore at the end of her junior year. Narrowing her interests and selecting schools to apply to was a journey. 
Initially focused on online art programs, she later shifted toward psychology and then biology. “During the summer before my senior year in high school I started realizing that I wanted art to be my hobby but not something I wanted to be doing in a job setting. I turned my attention toward psychology first, looking into neuroscience,” she says. Whenever she made a college list, Dartmouth was always on it.
Working with VSAC was a critical part of her process. “I was always going to Kassidy, every time she was available, I would be there. She helped me figure out the ideas I wanted to bring into my essays and the colleges I might want to think about,” she says. 
Kassidy also helped her with her essays. “My essay, the general one especially, went through so many drafts. Kassidy’s office was always full, but she would always fit me in,” she says. After acceptance, Kassidy helped connect Ailyn with the first-generation office at Dartmouth and brought her to the school for a campus tour.
Navigating financial aid was another area where Kassidy provided guidance. “My financial aid packages came in, and I had no idea what I was looking at. Kassidy helped me set up a spreadsheet to look at my financial aid, helped me look at scholarships, what else I could apply for, and what it meant for me. She also helped me figure out the documents I might need and what the different schools were asking for,” she says.
Ailyn says that doubts she would be at Dartmouth without help from VSAC. “I don’t know if I would have gone to college without Kassidy. There were so many people at Rivendell helping me, but Kassidy helped me with so many details and explained so many things I had no idea what they meant or what they were doing. We’d be in a totally different situation, and I doubt I’d be at Dartmouth without her help,” she says.
Receiving her acceptance brought on a mix of anxiety and excitement for Ailyn. “When Dartmouth decisions came out, the website took so long to load because so many people were looking at the same time. I was so tired. It was the last college decision I had coming in. I was nervous and anxious. I had no idea if I’d get in. I really hadn’t expected to get in, although I’d dreamed about that moment so many times. A big part of me thought it wasn’t going to happen. I was by myself upstairs in our house. I quietly went downstairs and showed Dad my computer and we really just freaked out together,” she says.
Narrowing Her Focus: “You Can Do Anything—But You Can’t Do Everything”
Ailyn is a first-generation student, and she’s tapped resources offered by Dartmouth College to help provide additional guidance and support to students whose parents did not graduate with a four-year degree. The director of the Dartmouth first-generation office helped her get oriented, she notes. “He always says, ‘you can do anything, but you can’t do everything at Dartmouth.’ It kind of helps narrow my focus a bit,” she explains. 
Ailyn especially appreciates the support system the office provides. “The director has a tissue box in his office signed by everyone who’s cried in there. There are a lot of names. You can get so overwhelmed in college, but that helps you know it’s normal to feel that way,” she says.
Ailyn says Dartmouth’s first-generation community is one of the biggest reasons she feels successful in her first term. “I have challenges with anxiety,” she shares, “so having that support system and these people around me has made a great college experience possible.”
Thinking back to the moment that she found out that she was accepted to Dartmouth, Ailyn feels a little surreal that it all happened. She’s wrapping up her first semester at Dartmouth now. And as for her future? The ocean is calling.

,DC,2025-12-03 16:32:12+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration puts a hold on immigration applications from 19 nations,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-puts-hold-immigration-applications-19-nations,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration late Tuesday paused all immigration applications from 19 countries the president earlier had listed for restricted travel into the United States, a move that freezes processing for green card holders and citizenship applications.After two West Virginia National Guard members were shot in the District of Columbia by an Afghan national who was granted asylum, the Trump administration has moved to halt and reexamine all forms of legal immigration, which is handled by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. One guard member, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died, and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains critically wounded, although his condition is said to be stable. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, pleaded not guilty to several charges on Tuesday. The memo says that USCIS will place a hold on processing benefits requests — including citizenship processing — from immigrants hailing from the 19 “high-risk” countries and the agency will re-review any of those approved requests for immigrants who entered the U.S. after Jan, 21, 2021, or under the Biden administration. The 19 countries with travel restrictions into the U.S. are: Afghanistan, Burma, Burundi, Chad, Cuba, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela and Yemen. In June the president issued a travel ban on those 19 countries. The hold will remain in place until otherwise directed by USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, according to the memo.The memo also states that USCIS will delay action on all applications for asylum and withholdings for removal, regardless of country of origin, “pending a comprehensive review.” A withholding of removal is granted by an immigration judge when a country is deemed too dangerous for an immigrant for deportation, so a third, safer country must be chosen.“USCIS has considered that this direction may result in delay to the adjudication of some pending applications and has weighed that consequence against the urgent need for the agency to ensure that applicants are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,” according to the memo. “Ultimately, USCIS has determined that the burden of processing delays that will fall on some applicants is necessary and appropriate in this instance, when weighed against the agency’s obligation to protect and preserve national security.”President Donald Trump and his administration have often criticized immigrants who were granted temporary legal protections under the Biden administration, arguing they were not properly vetted. That has included a special program created for Afghan allies fleeing the Taliban takeover after the chaotic withdrawal by the U.S. in 2021, as well as Latin Americans granted humanitarian parole from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.",,,,2025-12-03 11:56:39.209113

September 17. (Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services)The Minnesota Department of Human Services’ effort to quash fraud has led to a new problem: Disabled Medicaid recipients aren’t getting the services they need and are legally entitled to, according to attorneys for the disabled.
Most affected thus far: People who receive Integrated Community Support services, or ICS, which help people with disabilities live independently in the community rather than in an institution.
The ICS program also helps Minnesota stay in compliance with the law, as set forth in the U.S. Supreme Court case Olmstead v. LC, which ruled that the unnecessary segregation of people with disabilities from their community is a form of discrimination.
Attorneys for people with disabilities say their clients are being cut off from ICS following DHS’s suspension of payments to ICS providers in an effort to crack down on fraud that has riddled some other programs. A Minnesota Disability Law Center client with bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, PTSD and ADHD was receiving laundry, cleaning and check-in services from her ICS provider for six months before her services were abruptly suspended in October from DHS’s payment pause.
“There was no real transition; they just stopped providing the services,” said Chad Wilson, an attorney for the Minnesota Disability Law Center.
DHS did not respond to multiple emails from the Reformer, including inquiries about how 14 “high-risk provider types” — including ICS — were chosen for an upcoming audit.
The agency has, however, released a “Medicaid program integrity” website, which offers various charts and statements such as: “We strive for transparency, but sometimes the work requires secrecy.”
Fraud in Minnesota’s human services has become a high-profile political issue, recently drawing attention from President Donald Trump, who used the issue to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community. Following federal charges against dozens of people alleging they defrauded a child nutrition program, an autism treatment program and Housing Stabilization Services, DHS moved to address fraud in other services, turning its attention to ICS starting in September and 13 other programs starting in December.
But DHS has gone too far and is now hurting people who need help, the attorneys say.
Brianna Boone is an attorney at the Southern Minnesota Regional Legal Services, an organization which represents multiple ICS recipients who’ve been cut off from services without clear guidance from DHS on how to proceed.
“Due process is the main thing I want. DHS should at least be explaining and notifying recipients about what is going on,” Boone said.
The Minnesota Disability Law Center has also been helping several clients neglected by DHS after being cut off from services. Wilson said that one of his clients didn’t receive clear information from DHS on how to get a new provider after the client’s provider was put under investigation in September.
Providers affected by the September ICS payment pause have not yet been told by DHS why their services were flagged as suspicious, according to Josh Berg, director of services at Accessible Space, a disability services provider. While his organization was not flagged, Berg said he has spoken to providers who were. Wilson confirmed that a notice from DHS sent to an ICS provider stated that DHS couldn’t give any detail into why payments to that provider were being withheld exactly.
In Boone’s view, DHS is not doing enough to notify recipients about what’s happening or provide assistance to transfer providers; instead, she said, DHS is relying on providers and case managers to pass along information to clients.
“Our clients are not hearing from DHS at all, so they’re just confused and don’t understand what’s happening,” she said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091725-PHOTO-fraud-committee-MJ-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:56:39.209113
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-03 16:25:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"No, a vehicle didn’t try to run Lane Kiffin off the road, says Mississippi Highway Patrol",Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/03/lane-kiffin-run-off-road-mississippi-highway-patrol/,Kiffin said in a Monday press conference in Baton Rouge that an angry Rebel fan tried to run him off the road while driving with his son Knox.,"There is no evidence that a driver tried to run former Ole Miss football coach Lane Kiffin off the road while he was on his way to the Oxford airport to accept a new head coaching gig at rival Louisiana State University, according to state and local law enforcement agencies.  
Kiffin announced last weekend that he was leaving Mississippi’s flagship university after helping it clinch a spot in the playoffs for the first time in the program’s history. He said in a Monday press conference in Baton Rouge that an angry Rebel fan tried to run him off the road while he was driving with his son Knox to the airport in Oxford.  
Bailey Holloway, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, told Mississippi Today that Kiffin had a safety escort from the Mississippi Highway Patrol when he traveled to the airport. The agency’s officers have no record of an automobile trying to push the football coach’s car off the roadway, Holloway added.
Sean Tindell, the DPS commissioner, weighed in on the situation by posting a satirical social media video Tuesday night, stating that there were no incidents involving Mississippi Highway Patrol officers trying to run the coach off the road. 
In the video, Tindell wore a visor, something Kiffin is known for wearing, and walked a dog on a leash. Tindell said that the pet was not even his dog, a reference to lingering questions about Juice Kiffin, a dog that has become an unofficial mascot of sorts at Ole Miss. 
“He had a safe trip, and he’s on his way,” Tindell said of Kiffin. “I’m sorry, this is not even my dog. Y’all be safe.” 
Tindell runs the state’s top law enforcement agency and was poking fun at the situation that has inflamed an already bitter rivalry between two SEC schools and caused a wave of internet memes. 
Still, attempting to run a car off a roadway is a criminal offense in Mississippi, and if someone attempted to harm the football coach, state and local police could launch an investigation. 
Breck Jones, the public information officer for the Oxford Police Department, also said that the local police department received no calls or complaints about the alleged incident, and they have not been asked by anyone to look into it. 
Communications officials with LSU athletics and the university did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
This is not the first time Kiffin, now persona non grata among the Ole Miss fan base, has made national headlines over situations that occurred around an airport. The University of Southern California famously fired him in 2013 on the tarmac at the Los Angeles International Airport after the team’s plane landed.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/30155400/AP23324674514427.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:56:39.209113

(Photo by Jamie Kelter Davis/Getty Images)A stepped-up immigration enforcement operation in and around New Orleans, first reported by the Associated Press last month, launched Wednesday morning, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced.
Dubbed operation “Catahoula Crunch,” the department press release did not provide any details on the planned scope of the operation. But according to internal plans reviewed by the AP, which reported the name of the operation as “Swamp Sweep,” the Trump administration plans to deploy 250 Border Patrol agents to the region, with a goal of arresting 5,000 people in Louisiana and Mississippi.
Catahoula Crunch follows similar operations in Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina, where Border Patrol agents were accused of using overly aggressive tactics — including dangerous maneuvers during vehicle chases and the deployment of crowd control projectiles — against both those suspected of being in the country illegally and those protesting the enforcement action. In both cities, agents have also been accused of racial profiling.
The Department of Homeland Security press release says the operation will target “criminal aliens,” highlighting a small number of cases of area residents suspected of being in the country illegally who have criminal records.
The press release says those people were released from local custody as a result of the so-called “sanctuary” policy adopted by the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office more than a decade ago.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The policy, which state Attorney General Liz Murrill has recently fought to dissolve, prohibits the Sheriff’s Office from honoring detainer requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Such requests, if honored, allow local jails to hold arrestees up to 48 hours past their release date in order to allow ICE to bring them into its custody. The Sheriff’s Office policy was adopted in 2013 to settle a federal lawsuit. The plaintiffs in that suit, arrested in New Orleans on minor charges, were held for months under ICE detainer requests.
“Sanctuary policies endanger American communities by releasing illegal criminal aliens and forcing DHS law enforcement to risk their lives to remove criminal illegal aliens that should have never been put back on the streets,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.




Though DHS has repeatedly claimed it is targeting criminals, a large number of people with no criminal records have been swept up in earlier operations. In Chicago, for example, of 4,000 people arrested as part of operation “Midway Blitz,” only about 120 have been identified as having a criminal record, The Washington Post reported. Agents have also reportedly arrested a number of American citizens.
The news of the operation has been met with mixed reviews from local and state officials. Conservative Trump allies such as Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry have come out in strongly in support, while New Orleans Councilmember and Mayor-elect Helena Moreno and fellow Councilmember JP Morrell have pointed to allegations of abuse by Border Patrol agents in other cities recently subjected to stepped-up immigration deployments.
Moreno recently released a brief “know-your-rights” guide for those stopped by federal immigration enforcement agents, along with a list of legal resources.
New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick has been more restrained in her response to the deployment, saying that the department would act as a “partner,” providing assistance to federal immigration agencies when needed for public safety, but at the same time pledging that NOPD officers would not be directly involved in immigration investigations or arrests. Other local, such as the Kenner Police Department — located in the city with the highest concentration of Hispanic residents in the region — have already been working with immigration enforcement agencies.
Asked Wednesday about Catahoula Crunch and how the operation would impact local policing, an NOPD spokesperson referred Verite News to DHS. “There are no updates from NOPD,” the spokesperson said.
The news of the impending sweeps has rattled the region’s immigrant communities. Some businesses have closed in an effort to protect workers and customers, and once-busy gathering spots for immigrant day laborers looking for work were largely abandoned in recent days.

GEAR Board’s Ninth Annual Report Also Highlights Modernization Efforts Across Delaware Government
WILMINGTON, Del. — Gov. Matt Meyer on Monday touted the state’s latest Government Efficiency and Accountability Review (GEAR) Board report, which claims more than $110 million in projected long-term savings and highlights efforts to modernize Delaware’s bureaucracy.
Supporters say the ninth annual report shows progress toward a more transparent and efficient state government. But some lawmakers and fiscal watchdogs note that many of the savings are projections and caution that Delaware’s government has grown significantly in recent years, even as officials promise to “do more with less.”
GEAR report claims long-term savings, modernization
Created in 2017, the GEAR Board was designed to promote a culture of “continuous improvement” in state government by modernizing systems, streamlining processes and expanding data-driven decision-making across agencies.
According to the 2025 report, more than 175 state employees are currently advancing 160 improvement initiatives that are projected to save an estimated $110 million over their lifespan. The report covers work across 23 agencies.
“State government should be honest, transparent, and efficient. Through innovative, collaborative suggestions that are driven by data, the 2025 GEAR report will help ensure that Delawareans’ tax dollars are being used effectively,” Meyer said in a statement. “From streamlining permitting to modernizing digital services, they are making sure state government better serves all Delawareans.”
Among the highlighted initiatives:

Expanded continuous improvement capacity: Employees are being trained in Lean and related methods to identify waste and redesign processes.
A permitting “efficiency blitz”: Using Lean and Agile methods to support the state’s “Ready in Six” initiative, officials say permitting turnaround times were cut by four business weeks, saving at least $1.2 million annually.
State Land Inventory Management (SLIM): A new centralized platform tracks state-owned property to help agencies make more informed decisions about land use, surplus assets, environmental impacts and economic development.
Cost controls and service changes: The report cites initiatives such as lease restructuring, fleet cost management, healthcare cost containment, streamlined employee onboarding, improved correctional officer retention, online environmental permitting, a unified school library catalog, modernized background checks and upgrades to financial, HR, criminal justice and IT systems.

The GEAR program also recognized several technology-driven projects with its Public-Private Partnership awards, honoring teams from the Department of Education, the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families, and DelDOT.
Questions about “projected” savings and growth
The administration frames the $110 million figure as proof that efficiency efforts are paying off. But some center-right critics argue that “projected” savings are not the same as audited, realized reductions in spending, and say taxpayers should see clear, line-item evidence that programs are smaller, more efficient or eliminated altogether — not just reorganized.
They also argue that while digital upgrades and new platforms can improve service, they can bring their own ongoing costs for software, consultants and cybersecurity. Some fiscal conservatives say they want to see whether long-term operating budgets actually shrink or whether new systems simply become another permanent layer of government.
Recommendations: more training, more tech — and more AI
To “build on current momentum,” the report recommends:

Continuing to expand employee training in leadership, continuous improvement and project management through the First State Quality Improvement Fund.
Broadening Ready in Six permitting reforms across DelDOT, DNREC and OMB, and exploring a virtual one-stop permitting system for better predictability and faster turnaround times for businesses and developers.
Scaling digital services through the Go DE platform so residents and visitors can access government services from any device at any time.
Adopting emerging tools, including artificial intelligence and business process analytics, to speed up work and improve measurable outcomes.

Good-government advocates generally welcome better data and faster permitting, but some on the right warn that using AI inside government must be paired with strong safeguards, transparency and clear limits to protect privacy and civil liberties.
Charles Clark, Exec Director of GEAR from Delaware.gov website.
“With more than 175 State employees engaged in training, applying Lean methods, and leading projects across Delaware government, the drive for greater efficiency and a culture of continuous improvement continues to grow,” said the GEAR Program Management Team — Executive Director Charles Clark, Deputy Director Daniel Madrid and Bryan Sullivan, OMB’s Director of Management Efficiency.
They emphasized the importance of strong return-on-investment analysis, standardized business processes and improved project management to ensure measurable outcomes rather than simply new layers of reporting.
The full 2025 GEAR report is available through the Office of Management and Budget and outlines next steps in the state’s modernization agenda for residents, businesses and taxpayers.
New Office of Inspector General aims at oversight — with questions about independence
In a related move, Meyer in August signed Senate Bill 4, creating Delaware’s first independent Office of Inspector General, a long-discussed reform that passed with bipartisan support. The state is now accepting applications for the position through Dec. 15.
“Creating an Office of Inspector General is a major step toward a more open, accountable, and trustworthy state government,” Meyer said when signing the bill. “We are looking for applicants with unquestionable integrity, deep experience in oversight or investigations, and a demonstrated commitment to public service.”
The new office will investigate waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement or corruption in state government. It is expected to coordinate with — but not replace — the Attorney General’s Office and the Office of Auditor of Accounts.
Under the statute, a selection panel appointed by the Secretary of State will review candidates and recommend a short list to the governor. From that list, the governor will nominate one candidate for Senate confirmation to a five-year term.
Supporters say the structure will give the office independence and stability across administrations. Some skeptics, however, note that the governor and his appointees still play a central role in the selection process and argue that stronger separation from the executive branch would better insulate the Inspector General from political pressure.
The office is expected to work alongside existing oversight bodies such as the State Auditor, Attorney General and Public Integrity Commission and issue public annual reports outlining investigations, findings and recommendations.
Delaware Budget Cost vs. potential savings
The office is expected to require an annual budget of about $1.5 million. Backers argue that Inspector General’s offices in other states have routinely saved or recovered many times their operating costs through audits, investigations and enforcement actions.
More than 30 states operate some form of an Inspector General’s office, though their structure and powers vary widely. Supporters in Delaware say the new office, if given sufficient independence and resources, could be one of the few initiatives that truly pays for itself by rooting out fraud and waste.
Fiscal conservatives largely welcome the concept of a watchdog but say the real test will be whether the office is willing to challenge powerful agencies, publish uncomfortable findings and recommend actual spending cuts — not just new policies and training.
For now, the GEAR Board’s report and the creation of an Inspector General mark parallel efforts: one focused on internal process improvements and technology upgrades, the other on independent oversight. Taxpayers who have watched state spending climb in recent years will be watching to see whether either effort produces lasting, measurable savings — not just new reports and new offices.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gear-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:56:39.209113

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)With a new governor poised to take the reins in January, a public policy group has issued a roadmap for New Jersey’s future, warning that runaway housing costs, public health and educational inequities, and public transportation gaps undermine the potential of many residents.
The Fund for New Jersey convened policy experts, community leaders, and residents for a series of conversations earlier this year to come up with the policy priorities released Wednesday.
Brandon McKoy, the nonprofit’s president, hopes policymakers at all levels, from Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill “down to the dog catcher,” regard the report’s recommendations as marching orders from New Jersey’s 9.5 million residents.
“We listened closely to what New Jerseyans told us,” McKoy said. “These recommendations reflect the priorities that surfaced repeatedly and the areas where leadership is needed most.”
McKoy’s group, which has provided two grants to the New Jersey Monitor, listed seven policy priorities they deemed most urgent:
 Public health, climate, and the environment

Officials should step up ongoing efforts to eliminate lead exposure, which can cause developmental delays, behavioral changes, and other health harms, especially in children. As climate risks escalate and the clean-energy workforce expands, policymakers should create a statewide hub to train people for green jobs such as stormwater management and urban forestry.
Officials should revive a ban on trucks older than 2007 from ports operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reduce diesel emissions in Newark, Elizabeth, and surrounding areas already disproportionately impacted by pollution.
Officials should do a cost-benefit analysis of beach replenishment projects, including climate change considerations. Such work has cost more than $3 billion in federal, state, and local tax funds, according to NJ.com. The feds typically foot the bulk of the bill, but the Trump administration has cut hundreds of millions in beach renewal funds this year.
“It is a losing proposition to keep spending taxpayer dollars to replace sand that washes away in extreme weather,” the report says.
 Criminal justice reform

Officials can make the criminal justice system fairer by shortening the state’s speedy-trial timeline, in which defendants can languish for up to two years in prison waiting for their case to go to trial.
Rather than cracking down on low-level crimes like disorderly conduct, officials should divert such offenders to social services, sparing them convictions that later can block access to jobs, housing, and education, the report says.
They should also reduce barriers that threaten the successful reentry of people who leave prison. That could involve providing transitional housing, eliminating employment restrictions and driver’s license suspensions, and funding health care, educational, and vocational programs.
Allowing people with felony convictions to serve on juries also should be a priority, the report says. Excluding them separates them from a civic duty and keeps their lived experience out of jury deliberations.

 Schools

The state should shift away from a census-based funding model to cover the cost of special education services. That model uses a statewide average to fund special education, leaving districts with more special-education students than average scrambling to close budget gaps.
The state also should spend more on higher education, with the broader goal of increasing the number of residents who earn college degrees. Gov. Phil Murphy cut more than $100 million from New Jersey’s colleges and universities in the current budget. That means New Jersey’s already expensive institutions could hike tuition to make up the loss, leaving degrees out of reach for low- and middle-income students, according to the report.
Already, fewer than half — about 43% — of New Jersey residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher, the report says. And thousands of college students take longer than four years to complete a degree, adding to their debt burden.
 Affordable housing

McKoy’s group recommends reestablishing the state public advocate’s office, a watchdog former Gov. Chris Christie abolished in 2010, and making fair housing one of its key mandates.
Christie also dissolved the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission in 2015 by merging it with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. The commission had used regional tax-base sharing, which enabled 14 towns to share the costs and benefits of development. McKoy’s group recommends restoring the commission as an independent agency, as well as its tax-base-sharing, to ensure stronger enforcement of environmental standards.
Enacting statewide rent controls and growing the Affordable Housing Trust Fund also should be priorities for policymakers.
 Jobs and the economy

The state should repeal the New Jersey Parking Offenses Adjudication Act, which enables officials to suspend the driver’s license or vehicle registration of people who don’t pay parking fines. That disproportionately impacts lower-income residents, who may be unable to afford parking fines. Losing their license or registration could threaten their jobs, so New Jersey should follow the lead of states including Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Illinois, where lawmakers ended license suspensions over most non-moving violations.
New Jersey’s unemployment rate is higher than the national average. And 9% of residents age 25 to 64 don’t have a high school diploma or general-equivalency degree — the minimum requirement for many jobs, according to the Kids Count Data Center. Those trends show that the state should provide more and better education and vocational training.
Making child care more affordable would help, the report says. While the state has expanded free preschool, universal child care is “vital for helping families succeed,” McKoy said.
“It’s really becoming a major, major crisis that’s preventing families from being able to be economically stable, let alone successful,” he said.
The report also recommends that New Jersey establish a guaranteed basic income, in which low-income families could count on state support for their essential needs.
“It is a crucial safety net addition for today’s economy, where full-time work does not guarantee financial stability,” the report says.
Baby bonds also would help erase disparities by giving low-income infants a savings endowment they can access at age 18.
 The state’s fiscal responsibility

The record $58.8 billion budget state lawmakers approved in June contained controversial cuts, diversions, and funding freezes on affordable housing, child care, and opioid settlement funds, among other things, that left angry advocates demanding reversals. At the same time, lawmakers tacked on more than $700 million in last-minute pet projects critics have condemned as pork.
“Budgets are statements of decisions, and every budget has things in it that I would say are driving towards community benefit, and unfortunately, some things that are not,” McKoy said.
To ensure better fiscal responsibility, the fund recommended that officials review and reduce the tax breaks the state has increasingly given out to lure businesses to New Jersey.
“The effectiveness of this strategy is being questioned. At present, New Jersey does not monitor tax expenditures closely to control their growth and to determine whether they deliver their intended economic benefits,” the report notes.
New Jersey also must restore its “rainy day” reserves, which are meant to cover state operations during emergencies. The state now ranks last in the nation, with just enough money in its rainy day fund to cover two days of operations; Wyoming, in comparison, leads the nation, with enough in its reserves to run the state for 302 days, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.

 Public transit

Public transit agencies in other states can rely on regular operating funds from the state. NJ Transit’s funding, though, is marked by “constant scarcity and instability,” the report says.
The agency consequently diverts $400 million annually in federal transit dollars meant for capital improvements to cover budget shortfalls, which contributes to chronic service disruptions, according to the report. Establishing a stable and permanent state funding allocation would improve service.
The group also called on NJ Transit, the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, and the South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization to work together to conduct long-range planning.
“A lack of public transportation options in South Jersey in particular was a major sore spot for folks,” McKoy said. “Not only will that help folks have different ways of getting around, but also alleviate traffic on the road.”
 Other emerging issues

The report listed several other “emerging” priorities, including expanding government oversight and accountability.
Eliminating or weakening government watchdogs leaves public programs and systems vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse, the report says.
McKoy pointed to lawmakers’ current effort to strip the state comptroller’s office of its investigative powers. Such an effort goes against what his group heard during their community conversations, he said.
“Folks want to know that the government is properly spending public money and also cracking down on fraud, waste, and abuse,” McKoy said. “They talk about the state being expensive and needing to do a better job of officially using funds. So we need to actually invest more in these offices that are providing oversight of government processes.”
The report recommends making the state comptroller an independent position, rather than one appointed by the governor and subject to state Senate approval; reestablishing the state Office of the Public Advocate to give residents a stronger voice in holding government accountable; and expanding the Open Public Records Act to reduce exemptions that allow officials to keep records secret. Lawmakers last year instead added new restrictions to public records.
Policymakers also should embrace policies that support immigrants, who comprise 29% of New Jersey’s working population, the report says. Strategies could include boosting funding to the state Office of New Americans and creating pathways for immigrants to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities.
The report urges policymakers to expand access to voting by passing same-day voter registration and a Voting Rights Act.
McKoy’s group also implored officials to get an early start on ensuring the state’s population is correctly counted in the 2030 Census. Federal officials use census data to determine federal funding, so an accurate count is especially important as states endure unprecedented cuts made by the Trump administration, McKoy added.
“The census is the biggest non-wartime effort in the history of the nation, so it requires a lot of forethought,” he said. “Making sure we do a good job on the Census is actually really crucial over these next couple of years to make sure that we are getting all of our federal funds possible.”

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline. 
But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.
Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it. 
Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.
Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.
The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop —  is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.
Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it. 
The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it. 
Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions. 
At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.
Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices. 
Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?
How corn took over America
Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.
Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.
In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”
In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.
Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.
“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”
Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions. 
That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight. 
In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.
Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.
Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims
Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.
But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel. 
The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.
“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.
Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement to Floodlight that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.
“Biofuel producers are making investments today that will make their products net-zero or even net negative in the next two decades,” the statement said.
But some research tells a different story.
A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.
“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.
Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.
A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste. 
The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land. 
“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”
Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.
As corn production rises, so have emissions 
Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021. 
That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.
Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found. 
In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.
The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.
Emissions of nitrous oxide — an extremely potent greenhouse gas — have soared in America’s Corn Belt in the years since nitrogen fertilizer use became widespread. (Environmental Working Group visualization of nitrous oxide data from Iowa State University researcher Chaoqun Lu and colleagues.)
Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.
According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure. 
The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.
For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said. 
Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.
One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home. 
“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”
When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”
What cleaner corn could look like
Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.
And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.” 
University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.
Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference. 
Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.
Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.
In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer. 
“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said. 
Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer. 
Under the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.
“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”
The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer. 
“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked. 
In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs. 
“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.
But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said. 
And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.
Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.
“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”
The next corn boom?
Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to  boost ethanol demand. 
One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.
Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.
Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.
Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions. 
“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”

But first, they had questions about the project’s growing price tag and what that might mean for power customers.
State-owned Santee Cooper and Virginia-headquartered Dominion have agreed to partner on a 2,200-megawatt power plant on the site of a former coal plant along the Edisto River near Canadys.
The power companies now estimate the cost of that plant at $5 billion — up from a $2.5 billion told to senators last August.
That early estimate was based on historical costs to build similar units. But prices have increased dramatically since then as utility companies globally rush to build similar plants, said Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton.
Here’s what SC landowners should expect from a proposed 71-mile natural gas pipeline

The sticker shock had some legislators questioning whether a gas plant was still the best choice for meeting the state’s growing power needs.
Rep. Leon Stavrinakis raised concerns over whether the same demand driving up the cost of the plant’s turbines would also make the gas needed to run them more expensive.
“If everybody is going to be drawing on that same power source, it seems logical to me that that power source is going to get more expensive,” the Charleston Democrat said.
Stavrinakis went on to say the rising cost of electricity is becoming too much for residents who need it to keep the lights on in their homes and small businesses.
“My constituents, I’m going to be honest with you, can’t afford any more rate increases,” he said. “People are hurting.”
Staton acknowledged the price of natural gas has gone up in the past year and a half as the United States has started to export more to other countries.
The U.S. is the world’s largest producer and exporter of natural gas, and gas exports have tripled in the past five years. By 2030, it will double again, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Energy published in December 2024.
Meanwhile, use of natural gas in the U.S. is expected to hit a new record this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
However, Staton said, the cost of other fuels has been on the rise as well. He said coal prices, for example, are two to three times higher than they were four years ago.
Staton said Santee Cooper has accounted for a potential increase in natural gas prices as part of its long-term plans.
“And in every case, what we find, is this: These are still the best dispatchable resources for us to invest in,” he said of the gas-fired power plants.
Santee Cooper will start by spending $120 million for its share of equipment costs at Canadys.
How much customers ultimately will pay on their monthly power bills for the new gas plant remains to be seen. But Staton told legislators he expects any price increases to match the general rate of inflation.
The power companies still need the permission of state regulators before it can begin construction. Staton said Santee Cooper and Dominion plans to file that application on Dec. 15.
Legislators also signed off on spending related to two other natural gas-related projects: nearly $300 million for a pair of natural gas turbines on the site of an existing coal plant near Georgetown and more than $270 million for the expansion of an existing natural gas plant.
The coal plant, Winyah, came online in 1975 and Santee Cooper plans to close it down within the next decade.
There’s already gas pipelines and power lines that run to the Winyah plant, Staton said, making it an ideal location for the gas turbines and providing a potential future use for the site.
The small turbines will produce about 100 megawatts of electricity and Santee Cooper can fire them up quickly at the time of day when power usage is at its highest.
They would also work well with solar power, Santee Cooper spokeswoman Mollie Gore said, because they can be turned on on days when the sun isn’t shining.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC_0320-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:01:13.127380
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-03 15:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,More industries want Trump’s help hiring immigrant labor,Tim Henderson | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/03/immigrant-workers-industries-seeking-break/,"Restaurants, construction and landscaping businesses lost a combined 315,000 immigrant workers through August, according to a Stateline analysis.","As food prices remain high, the Trump administration has made it easier for farmers to hire foreign guest workers and to pay them less. Now, other industries with large immigrant workforces also are asking for relief as they combat labor shortages and raids.
Visas for temporary foreign workers are a quick fix with bipartisan support in Congress. And Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ office told Stateline that “streamlining” visas for both agricultural and other jobs is a priority for the Trump administration.
[RELATED: Trump allows more foreign ag workers, eases off ICE raids on farms]
But some experts warn that such visas can be harmful if they postpone immigration overhauls that would give immigrant workers a path to green cards and citizenship.
“Lack of permanent status is costly to migrants, employers, and the broader economy,” wrote Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, in a report published in June. Workers are “vulnerable to policy changes triggered by a change in administration, most recently the threat of mass deportations.”
In a Nov. 25 interview with Stateline, Orrenius said the crackdown on illegal immigration could be a good thing if it leads to permanent solutions.
“If you can stop undocumented immigration, then great. This is a great time to work on comprehensive immigration reform,” Orrenius said. “Where is there a scarcity of workers and how do we address those legally instead of illegally?”
Restaurants, construction and landscaping businesses have lost a combined 315,000 immigrant workers through August this year, more than any other industries, according to a Stateline analysis of Current Population Survey data provided by the University of Minnesota at ipums.org.
The construction industry needs more foreign worker visas like those already being provided for agriculture to prevent more delays in building everything from homes to highways, business owners say.
The industry needs help to “provide lawful workers while working to prepare more Americans for permanent careers in construction,” said Jaime Andress, testifying at a congressional hearing last month on behalf of the Associated General Contractors of America trade group. About 92% of contractors with open positions are having trouble finding enough skilled labor, whether it’s for construction of buildings, highways or utility infrastructure, she testified.
There are about 145,000 fewer immigrants working in restaurants, on average, through August of this year compared with the same period in 2024, the Stateline analysis found. There are about 127,000 fewer in construction and 43,000 fewer in landscaping.
One landscaping firm, which did not agree to an interview, lost $50,000 in contracts this year when workers stopped showing up because of rumored immigration raids, said Rebecca Shi, chief executive officer of the Chicago-based American Business Immigration Coalition, which advocates for employers seeking immigration changes.
“He had 75 workers and 50 of them didn’t show up one day because there were rumors ICE was going to be in the area,” Shi said. “Many of them were citizens and legal workers, but they were worried about family members and neighbors, so they didn’t show up either. It’s bad for the economy when you lose a worker, but it’s also the fear and uncertainty. We know restaurants that have lost 50% of staff and are at risk of closing because people just aren’t showing up.”
The coalition organized a “fly-in” in October to Washington, D.C., to ask members of Congress for more help to legalize immigrant workers through work permits in hospitality, agriculture, construction, elder care, health care and manufacturing.
In a letter dated Dec. 2, thousands of businesses in all 50 states asked the administration for an additional 64,716 H-2B visas, saying they rely on them for seasonal surges in hospitality, tourism, landscaping, forestry, seafood production and other industries.
And a bipartisan group of 33 U.S. senators from 22 states signed a letter Nov. 13 by Maine Independent Sen. Angus King and South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds asking for more H-2B seasonal employment visas.
“Employers’ workforce needs cannot be met with American workers alone,” the letter said.
Construction contractors say they need visas that are similar to the H-2A visas for agriculture that the Trump administration streamlined in October to make them easier and cheaper for farmers to hire temporary foreign workers.
The Associated General Contractors of America wants visas like the proposed new H-2C visas floated by Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker. Those would allow up to 85,000 less-skilled temporary workers in construction, hospitality and other fields to stay in this country up to nine years. The bill, introduced in September, has not advanced.
The association also supports a pathway to legal status for some workers already in the country, as proposed by Florida Republican U.S. Rep. María Elvira Salazar and Texas Democratic U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar. The bill, introduced in July, also has not advanced.
“Workforce shortages are the leading cause of construction project delays,” said Brian Turmail, a vice president at the association. “Nearly 1 out of 3 contractors have been impacted in one way or another by enhanced ICE enforcement activities. That number is almost certain to increase now that ICE has received significant boosts to its budget as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
Those industries are asking for more help as the latest federal immigration raids further affect workforces in Illinois, Maryland and North Carolina, with more raids planned in Louisiana. Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization at Syracuse University, reported a “massive redeployment of government military and civilian personnel to immigration enforcement” in recent months, with total detentions reaching more than 65,000, according to a Nov. 24 report. Nearly three-quarters of those arrested have no criminal convictions.
Construction, landscaping and other industries are already heavy users of H-2B visas for temporary non-agricultural foreign workers, according to government figures reviewed by Stateline.
In fiscal year 2025, which ended in September, there were about 209,000 H-2B visas, with Texas (20,051), Florida (18,515), North Carolina (8,634), Colorado (7,723) and Louisiana (7,234) getting the most. The most common occupations were building and grounds (94,152); food service (31,403); construction (16,729); farming, fishing and forestry (15,665); and personal care (12,170).
Some of the largest users of the visas last year were Core Tech Construction of New York City, a concrete coring and cutting firm (2,619 visas); ABC Professional Tree Services of Texas, which provides land clearance services (1,913); and Progressive Solutions LLC of Arkansas, which provides herbicide application to utilities (1,882).
The H-2B visa program needs to be streamlined and expanded to be useful for employers and workers, said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian CATO Institute, who has written about the visas.
Employers don’t always get the workers they want because the United States limits H-2B visas to 33,000 twice a year. Requests for the visas have already surpassed the 33,000 cap for the first half of fiscal 2026.
“The paperwork is a nightmare for employers and there are a lot of steps for workers also,” said Bier. “And there are so few visas available that your chance of getting all you need is almost nil.”

U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is leading the bipartisan proposal with support from U.S. Reps. Eugene Vindman, D-Woodbridge, and Republican David Valadao of California. Kaine told the Mercury Tuesday that the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would boost access to essential tech skills for job seekers. 
More than 90% of today’s jobs require digital skills, according to a report published by the National Skills Coalition and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, but more than a third of workers lack such skills, creating a challenge for employment.
“I think the workforce is the key ingredient to getting the American economy right, and if we do, we’re going to be fine, and if we don’t, we’re going to regret it, and this bill kind of fits into that space,” said Kaine.
On July 22, 2014, the WIOA was signed into law, shaping the nation’s public workforce development program and replacing the former Workforce Investment Act of 1998.
Stakeholders, including labor unions, workforce and education associations, and local and state governments, view the WIOA reauthorization as a critical tool for modernizing the workforce system. Some factors in labor market changes include evolving employer skill needs and demographic shifts.
Stakeholders are seeking local flexibility and governance over training, partnerships, and service delivery, increased and more targeted funding, stronger alignment with employers and industry needs, equitable access for underserved populations, and strengthened education and training pathways. 
As part of the proposal, the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would amend WIOA to establish a new Digital Skills at Work grant program to expand digital skills training within postsecondary education, adult education and workforce development systems. 
“Virginia is a place where anyone willing to work hard should be able to land their first job, keep a job they love, or build their first company. The jobs of today require new skills that can be mastered with the right training, helping employers retain seasoned workers and attract top talent,” Vindman said in a statement. “I’m proud to introduce bipartisan, bicameral legislation that helps Virginians and people across the country build digital skills that are essential in today’s economy.” 
Targeted investments in digital skills training — such as data entry, email communication and spreadsheet processing — would help Americans seeking jobs or upskilling opportunities, as well as those with barriers to employment, learn or build digital skills.
The Act would create digital skills training programs by awarding formula funding grants to states based on a combination of factors including population, the number of working-age residents, and the number of residents with low digital literacy skills, as determined by educational attainment, earnings, and limited English proficiency.
The Act would also increase digital equity by creating competitive grants for localities and organizations, and by requiring performance accountability for states, localities and organizations that receive a grant under this bill to report their awards publicly.
“We’re not shying away from the equity issue,” Kaine said. “Increasing digital equity is one of the three purposes of this bill, and making sure that the allocation of funds looks at … individuals who traditionally have barriers to employment and historically underrepresented populations.”
Kaine said he expects the proposal to gain bipartisan support as the Senate prepares to take up reauthorizing the WIOA. He added that roughly a third of the proposal’s endorsements are from Virginia, including the Fredericksburg Chamber of Commerce, Greater Roanoke Workforce Development Board, and the Virginia Community College System.
“By including digital skills and related performance metrics as requirements for grants issued under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), this legislation would ensure that our workforce is being prepared for today’s and tomorrow’s jobs,” VCCS Chancellor David Doré said in a statement.
He added that “successful passage of this legislation will strengthen education and workforce development systems. In addition, business and industry employers will minimize turnover, and workers will be better prepared to achieve better jobs and greater economic success.”

,California,2025-12-03 15:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Workforce, Communities, and Housing",sponsor,,,,,https://calmatters.org/sponsored/2025/12/workforce-communities-housing/,"Communities, labor, and government will each play a role in building the 2.5 million homes that Californians need.","It’s no secret that California faces a severe shortage of affordable housing, particularly for low- and moderate-income residents. In 2025, the state had 1.3 million more lower-income renter households than available affordable units. Between 2015 and 2023, California exceeded its production goals for higher-priced housing but fell dramatically short for affordable units— missing targets by over 270,000 units for very low-income housing. During this same period, median rent increased by 37% while renter incomes rose only 7%. 
Since 1969, California has required that all local governments plan to meet the housing needs of everyone in their communities. This is called the Regional Housing Needs Assessment, and it determines how much housing is needed at each level of affordability in a certain area. Local governments must then develop a local Housing Element – which is a plan that details how they will meet these various housing needs. The cycle repeats every eight years to gauge progress towards meeting existing goals and then reevaluating to assess new needs. The state ran its fifth cycle of planning to meet housing needs between 2013 and 2020. California is currently in its sixth cycle of planning, which sets a goal of building 2.5 million new homes by 2032.

The State Weighs In
To address the current housing crisis, California is seeking to fundamentally restructure how and where housing gets built. While land use decisions have historically been made at the local level, the state has recently taken on an assertive new role. Through the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process, all California jurisdictions are now required to plan for a certain number of new housing units, determined by state government. 
This isn’t merely advisory guidance from the state; there are real consequences for failure. Laws like SB 35 (2017) and SB 423 (2023) give the California Department of Housing and Community Development authority to penalize jurisdictions that fail to build their RHNA-determined supply. For cities and counties that do not meet their housing unit targets, the state can preempt local zoning ordinances and make certain multifamily housing eligible for automatic “by-right” approval. This means localities that don’t meet their housing goals risk losing control over what gets built in their communities.
Community Engagement: Where will housing be built?
Critics of community engagement processes who support new housing construction have legitimate reasons for concern: Participants at traditional public hearings often aren’t representative of the larger community. Instead, people who participate in local debates about housing tend to be disproportionately white, wealthier, older, and homeowners rather than renters. And given that people who oppose a proposed development are four times more likely to show up at a public meeting than people who support it, it’s no surprise that some pro-housing advocates and elected officials view community engagement as an obstacle to getting things done.
The current moment calls for new ways to bring diverse community perspectives into the housing process and foster effective dialogue between communities, developers, and government. Rather than sidelining community input in the name of progress, California can take advantage of this moment to experiment with new models for engagement that enable broad public input and ensure that the benefits of new construction are widely shared.
Read the Report: Approaches to Balancing Meaningful Community-Engagement with Increased Housing Production in California
Workforce Capacity: Who will build new homes?
In addition to navigating local political dynamics, progress towards solving California’s housing crisis faces a practical problem. California’s Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) estimates a need for 2.5 million new units over the next eight years. However, the industry struggles with labor shortages: 62% of California construction firms report difficulty filling positions.
Some argue that labor standards like prevailing wage laws (PWLs), which require workers on public projects to receive comparable compensation to private sector rates, can increase housing costs. While research does show some cost impacts, there are also documented benefits for PWLs, including increased apprenticeship enrollment, improved safety, and higher worker retention. Additionally, when workers are provided portable insurance, the increase in retention actually rises further.
Labor shortages and poor labor conditions can reinforce each other: worker retention rates are harmed by poor labor conditions, while contractors have less incentive to provide additional training when retention rates are low. There may also be ways to offset increased wage costs associated with PWLs. For example, higher labor standards can attract more skilled and productive workers.Read the Report: Building the Residential Construction Workforce in California: An Introduction to Labor and Housing Costs
The “Both/And” Path Forward
In a recent Possibility Lab survey, 71% of California voters reported difficulty accessing suitable housing at a price they can afford. Solving California’s affordable housing shortage requires holistic thinking that doesn’t pit housing production against workers or communities. Strategic investments in workforce development can simultaneously increase productivity, reduce delays from labor shortages, and improve workers’ quality of life—ultimately benefiting both subsidized and market-rate housing. Likewise, finding ways to engage communities in decision-making that allow for meaningful dialogue and reward solution sourcing, instead of enabling obstruction, can benefit neighbors and neighborhoods – as well as Californians as a whole.
By addressing both where housing gets built through effective community planning and who builds it through workforce investment, policymakers can pursue solutions that build housing capacity and workforce capacity, together.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-03 15:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"As Mississippi’s opioid settlement council finalizes its recommendations, a member calls for committee reforms",Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/03/mississippi-opioid-group-last-plan/,The council decided which applications to recommend to state lawmakers for funding during the 2026 regular legislative session.,"As the sun set over Jackson late Tuesday afternoon, the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council members wanted to end their meeting.
They had finished making the final recommendations for how the state should spend tens of million dollars paid by companies that contributed to thousands of deadly Mississippi overdoses. Moderator Caleb Pracht offered his final remarks of the nearly three hour meeting, wishing the committee safe travels home from the state capital. But one council member paused the concluding remarks to share some concerns. 
James Moore, a Hattiesburg recovery advocate and father of a son who died of an overdose, pointed out some of the ways in which the council had struggled with its role in distributing most of the hundreds of millions of lawsuit dollars the state is recouping to address the opioid epidemic.
Sitting at a desk away from most of the other members, Moore spoke about the inconsistent grading of the over 100 proposals the council received. Subcommittees, each made up of a few council members, initially reviewed and scored the applications. But the groups graded differently. The average score of the Public Health subcommittee was in the highest of five grading tiers, and the average score of applications reviewed by the Family subcommittee was in the second lowest tier.

He highlighted perceptions of conflicts of interests within the council, as many of the grants recommended for funding came from organizations with representatives on the committee.
“I don’t believe there was anything improper,” he told the other council members. “But obviously there was an appearance when we’re sitting across the table grading each others’ applications and multimillion dollar requests.” 
To address these and other issues, Moore asked the council if it would consider seeking help the next time it evaluated opioid settlement grants. Mississippi should be receiving the lawsuit money until at least 2040, and the review process is expected to happen yearly. 
He suggested to the council that outside groups, ones that have provided guidance to other states, could improve a process that many of the Mississippians who’ve been most impacted by addiction have raised concerns about since its first meeting. Moore said he had spoken to opioid settlement experts that day, and they said they would be happy to help the state. 
“It wouldn’t supplant us,” he said. “It would support us.”
For the prior two and a half hours, at what’s expected to be the council’s last meeting of the year, the members worked without that additional help. They decided which applications the committee would recommend state lawmakers fund in the 2026 regular legislative session. 
The council spent most of its time reviewing the dozens of applications the subcommittees had ranked in the highest two tiers and continued to make major adjustments to the process for distributing funds from the lawsuits. 
They significantly changed which organizations are eligible to receive opioid settlement funding. After Moore raised concerns about an applicant group that did not allow participants to use medication for opioid addiction and other psychiatric conditions, the council voted in favor of requiring that any group receiving money allows the people they serve to continue being on prescribed drugs. 
While medications like buprenorphine and methadone are considered the gold standard addiction treatments, many organizations across the country prohibit participants from using them. Wendy Bailey, the Mississippi Department of Mental Health executive director and co-vice chair of the council, said after the meeting that the council’s new rule could help change that for organizations serving Mississippians.
“We need to look to make sure there is more acceptance and understanding of it,” she said.
Andy Taggart, another council member, also successfully made a motion to remove all the applications from local first responder agencies from the list of opioid-related projects the committee will submit to the Legislature. Some of those first responder proposals did not appear to qualify as addressing addiction as defined by the lawsuit settlements.

Instead, the council chose to include them in a list of projects the Legislature could fund with opioid settlement money Attorney General and Council Chair Lynn Fitch has allowed lawmakers to use on non-addiction expenses.
A bill state lawmakers passed last spring, the one that created the council, says this portion of opioid settlement funds will be spent without any recommendations from the council. Taggart told the council members that the body should still make its suggestions.
“It strikes me that they would not be offended if we say, ‘Hey, here’s some non-abatement projects we recommended,’” he said. 
The council also tinkered with the priority and funding amounts they recommend for individual applicants. The biggest change was to adjust an application from Mississippi’s Administrative Office of Courts, a roughly $61 million request to improve the state’s drug court system — programs to divert people who use drugs away from the criminal justice system and toward treatment. 
Joseph Sclafani, a lawyer with Gov. Tate Reeves’ office, successfully proposed a motion to move the request to the highest-ranking tier and recommend that the Legislature reduce the funding to $12 million. 
The council also revived one application, a proposal from a company called Stercus Bioanalytics to create an opioid wastewater surveillance program, for recommendation. The application asked for roughly $9 million and was graded in the middle category, but the members passed Taggart’s motion to reduce the proposal to $2 million and include it in the second highest tier. 
Taggart told the council he thinks wastewater data could be an effective way for law enforcement and other state officials to figure out where there’s frequent opioid use. Recent MacArthur “Genius” grant recipient Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill who researches street drug supply, told Mississippi Today in November that while opioid wastewater surveillance can provide some surface-level information, it doesn’t do much to protect those most at risk of overdosing. 
“It’s big money for a small idea,” he said of Stercus’ unadjusted application.

After the meeting ended, Michelle Williams, chief of staff for Fitch, said the Attorney General’s office would look into Moore’s idea of incorporating outside help next year, in addition to other process changes. 
Just before Pracht dismissed the council members, Williams told them she thought they did a great job of making recommendations for the money on a tight timeline.

Craig Haggard, R-Mooresville, intends to run for the 4th congressional district. (Photo from Indiana House Republicans)A Republican state legislator says he supports the proposed Indiana congressional redistricting even though it would place his home outside the district where he’s planning to run.
Rep. Craig Haggard said he intends to continue his campaign against U.S. Rep. Jim Baird for the 4th District nomination in 2026.
That’s despite the Republican-proposed congressional districting plan shifting Morgan County — where Haggard lives near Mooresville — from the 4th District into the 9th District now held by Republican U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin.
Haggard joked that the proposed map is “not ideal” for him but that he would keep up the campaign he announced in August against Baird, who is seeking his fifth term in 2026.
“I’ve been working with those counties,” Haggard told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “The reason I have the endorsements I have and the support I have is, I believe, the majority of the 4th Congressional District feels like it’s not currently being served by their current congressman.”
Baird and Indiana’s six other Republican U.S. House members in August all endorsed the redistricting push initiated by President Donald Trump.
Baird responded to Haggard’s campaign plans in an email to the Capital Chronicle saying “Hoosiers expect their representative to come from the community they want to serve. I’ve always believed public service is about showing up for your neighbors, not shopping for a district that fits your political ambitions.”
U.S. House members are required to live in the state they represent but do not have to live in the district.
Haggard and other congressional candidates around the state have had their campaign plans scrambled by the redistricting possibility. The proposed new maps might not even be adopted as it is uncertain whether the state Senate will endorse the redraw.
All of Morgan County has been in the 4th District since the current congressional maps were enacted in 2021. 
Haggard said he would vote in support of the new map, even though he said it was “a little suspect” that his home county was shifted. He said he believed he could overcome any complaints where he lives.
“I was in the 4th when I started this process two years ago,” Haggard said. “I’m still right next to the 4th. I’m not some carpetbagger from another state or area that moved into this. No, I don’t think it’s an issue.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/54352686495_83bb39a8b5_c.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:01:13.127380

The minimum hourly wage for workers will increase in dozens of cities, counties and states in January. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The minimum wage for workers will increase in 19 states and 49 cities and counties next month, with the wage floor reaching $15 per hour in dozens of localities, a new report found.
Though the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour has not increased since 2009, many state and local governments continue to increase minimums through legislation or scheduled increases tied to inflation. 
An annual report from the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit advocating for workers’ rights, found that 88 jurisdictions will raise their minimum wages by the end of 2026.
In January, Nebraska’s minimum wage will increase from $13.50 to $15 per hour, while Rhode Island will see an increase from $15 to $16 per hour.
Minimum wage set to increase in 15 cities, states despite lawmaker pushback

All workers in Denver will see the minimum wage increase from $18.81 to $19.29 in January and the minimum in Flagstaff, Arizona, will increase from $17.85 to $18.35 per hour. 
The increases come as rising costs of housing, food and utilities are pinching more workers across the country, said Yannet Lathrop, senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project who authored the report. Those costs are particularly challenging for lower-income workers, who are most likely to be affected by minimum wage changes.
“They are really struggling right now,” she said. “These wages basically mitigate the effects of inflation, the effects of the rising cost of living, and the difficulties so many people are having paying for basics, for food, for housing, for medicine — just the basics of life.”
Lathrop said research increasingly finds that higher wages improve educational outcomes, mental and physical health.
“Things that are going to benefit not just the workers, but also the communities and society as a whole,” she said. “I think that’s an important thing to keep in mind.”
Inflation has significantly eroded the buying power of the federal minimum wage since 2009. 
Advocates say raising the wage floor helps low-wage workers cover the rising cost of essentials and boosts the economy by putting more money into the pockets of people who are likely to spend it. But many employers, especially small businesses, argue that raising the minimum wage forces them to cut workers or raise prices.
In Rhode Island, lawmakers this year proposed legislation that would raise the minimum wage $1 per year, culminating with a $20 per hour minimum in 2030. But backlash from business groups and economic uncertainty led the Democratic sponsor to successfully push for a “more measured approach” that includes hikes for the next two years rather than five, reaching a $17 hourly minimum by 2027.
That compromise didn’t persuade Republican opponents, who said even the more modest minimum wage change will force layoffs and consumer price hikes. 
Cities could dramatically cut childhood poverty with new tax credits, research finds

“The real minimum wage is $0,” said state House Minority Whip David Place, according to the Rhode Island Current. “That’s what they make when they get fired because business can’t afford to keep them.”
The minimum wage remains stagnant at $7.25 in 20 states, according to the National Employment Law Project. Those are primarily conservative-led states including Alabama, Iowa, Texas and Wyoming. 
Last year, Missouri voters approved a ballot measure ensuring paid sick leave and boosting the minimum wage to $15 per hour, with future increases tied to inflation. 
But Republican lawmakers took aim at the changes in Jefferson City this year.  
In a move Democrats called “absolute disdain” for workers, GOP lawmakers passed a bill repealing the paid sick leave provision and nixing the annual minimum wage increases tied to inflation. Missouri’s current $13.75 minimum wage will still rise to $15 next month but is no longer subject to future increases.
“Today, we are protecting the people who make Missouri work—families, job creators, and small business owners—by cutting taxes, rolling back overreach, and eliminating costly mandates,” Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe said in a July statement when he signed the bill into law.

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday expanded its legal campaign to force states to turn over voter lists containing sensitive personal information, suing six more states that have refused to provide the data.
The Justice Department has now sued officials in a dozen states for the voter lists, following a first round of lawsuits filed in September. The lawsuits are aimed at mostly Democratic states that won’t turn over unredacted copies of the lists, which include driver’s license and partial Social Security numbers.
For months, the Trump administration has demanded that states provide copies of their voter lists, calling the information necessary for election integrity efforts. While some states have turned over lists that withhold sensitive personal data, most have declined to offer all the information on their lists.
DOJ files suit against six states that refused to share voter data

Democratic election officials have raised privacy concerns over how the Trump administration plans to use the data. They are especially concerned that the Justice Department will share the data with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is building a powerful citizenship verification tool. The Trump administration previously confirmed to Stateline it plans to share the data.
The new wave of lawsuits target Delaware, Maryland, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, the Justice Department announced in a news release. The department has already sued California, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.
“Accurate voter rolls are the cornerstone of fair and free elections, and too many states have fallen into a pattern of noncompliance with basic voter roll maintenance,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a news release on Tuesday. “The Department of Justice will continue filing proactive election integrity litigation until states comply with basic election safeguards.”
Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore in September offered the Justice Department a free copy of his state’s publicly available voter list. The information is typically provided upon request with a $25 fee, but he refused to provide confidential personal information absent legal action.
“This lawsuit, like those filed in other states, is a continuation of the current presidential administration’s unconstitutional attempts to interfere with elections processes across the country,” Amore said in a statement on Tuesday. “One of my most important responsibilities as the chief state election official is safeguarding the data privacy of Rhode Islanders, who entrust us with their personal information when they register to vote. I will continue to fight to protect it.”

(Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two years ago, Kansas ranked dead last in a national assessment of mental illness and access to behavioral health care.
In 2025, that ranking rose to 18th in the nation, and state officials say the shift is a direct outcome of investment in quality care.
A $72.5 million grant recently awarded to Kansas and two other states is expected to push the state’s progress further by bolstering access to quality behavioral health care.
“This initiative represents a pivotal opportunity for Kansas to lead in behavioral health innovation,” said Laura Howard, secretary of the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, in a Nov. 18 news release.
Kansas, Illinois and Michigan will share the $72 million over the next three years. The Washington, D.C.-based National Council for Mental Wellbeing will administer the funds, which come from the Ballmer Group, a philanthropic organization founded by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife, Connie.
The national council will use the grant to help states establish or expand Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, which offer 24/7 crisis care, counseling, case management, outpatient services, psychiatric rehabilitation, treatment planning and mental health care for veterans.
The grant will focus on building a range of services, including crisis care, outpatient mental health and substance use services, primary care screening and monitoring, community-based mental health care for veterans, and partnerships with community organizations such as law enforcement, schools and homeless shelters.
Connie Ballmer said in a national council news release that community behavioral health clinics have been successful in addressing community behavioral health needs, especially those of kids and families.
“Access to comprehensive, high-quality care provides people with the opportunity to achieve stability,” Ballmer said.
A 2024 study of Kansas clinics found that establishing community behavioral health clinics, which expanded upon existing services, increased annual visits from about 24,000 to about 42,000. The state’s annual costs also increased, rising from $52 million to $74 million, according to data from the state aging and disabilities department. However, the study hypothesized clinics may result in $5 million in costs avoided from would-be emergency room visits and $42 million in costs avoided from inpatient stays.
Kansas has 26 clinics. The state Legislature passed a bill in 2021 to certify and fund those clinics, a move regarded as one of the most significant changes to mental health care in Kansas in decades. 
Community behavioral health clinics first opened in 2017 when a federal project established 66 clinics in eight states. More than 500 clinics now exist in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. They are largely funded by Medicaid.
Cara Sloan-Ramos, a spokesperson for the Kansas department, said it’s unclear how recent federal Medicaid changes could impact the state’s community behavioral health clinics.
“The state knows that federal policy changes are coming,” Sloan-Ramos said, “but the precise financial and operational impact on Kansas CCBHCs remains undetermined.”
The 2023 assessment that ranked Kansas last among all 50 states and Washington, D.C., cited youths with substance use disorders, adults with any mental illness and adults with serious thoughts of suicide as major factors for the state’s low ranking.
The state’s future efforts will focus on behavioral health workforce shortages, rural access to care, financial longevity, quality services and expanded partnerships to better coordinate wraparound care.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SEKMHC-2025-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-03 09:57:19.841600

After leaving a position in Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration in September, Booker announced Wednesday morning that he would run for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat. In a campaign video, Booker emphasized that his platform includes supporting initiatives for Medicare, affordable housing, better wages, lowering utility bills and universal childcare. 
“What story would we write if we let ourselves dream again?” Booker says in the video. “The story I’d write is one where everyone in the commonwealth can prosper, one where government shows up for us instead of stomping on us.” 
Booker has run for the chance to represent Kentucky in the U.S. Senate twice before. In 2020, Booker lost the Democratic nomination to former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, who later failed to unseat longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell. Booker then ran against Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul in 2022 and lost. 
McConnell announced earlier this year that he would not seek reelection to the U.S. Senate seat he’s held since 1984, paving the way for politicians on both sides of the aisle to jockey for the open seat. 
McGrath launched her 2026 campaign for the seat in October. Other Democrats in the race include racehorse trainer Dale Romans, former Secret Service agent Logan Forsythe, former CIA officer Joel Willett and Kentucky House Democratic Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson.
Republicans are also facing a crowded primary. GOP candidates in the race U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, former state Attorney General Daniel Cameron and businessman Nate Morris have campaigned for months, often facing each other at Republican and campaign events.

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
There are still people living on streets and sidewalks throughout the state, but Californians are starting to care a little less about the issue of homelessness, according to a recent survey. 
Only 37% of Californians asked in October said they were “very concerned” about homelessness — down from 58% in 2019. Another 41% of Californians surveyed this year said they were “somewhat concerned.” That’s according to a survey of 1,707 people by the Public Policy Institute of California.
And while 20% of Californians said homelessness was the state’s top issue in 2020, just 6% said so this year. The drop was most notable in the Bay Area, where 28% of residents said they were very concerned about homelessness, compared to 63% in 2019.
Even so, most Californians still regularly see evidence of the homelessness crisis in their communities. More than half said they cross paths with an unhoused individual every day, and two in 10 said they do so every few days. 
This change in attitude comes amid several shifts in the state’s homeless policy landscape. A U.S. Supreme Court decision last year gave cities more freedom to penalize unhoused people for sleeping outside, followed by an increase in homelessness-related arrests and citations in cities across California. 
There were more than 187,000 Californians sleeping in shelters, on the street and in other places not meant for habitation, as of the last official estimate in January 2024. This year, several California counties reported a decrease in their homeless populations, suggesting the state may finally be making progress. But experts worry upcoming funding cuts for permanent housing and other services at both the state and federal level will undermine those wins.

SF sues Big Junk Food

In a first-of-its kind lawsuit, San Francisco plans to take on some of the biggest names in the food industry over the health harms linked to eating chips, cereal, packaged meals and other ultra-processed foods.
On Tuesday the city’s top attorney, David Chiu, said San Francisco is suing 10 food companies that manufacture ultra-processed foods, including Kraft Heinz Company, The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, General Mills, Nestle USA and Kellogg. 
Filed on behalf of the state of California in San Francisco Superior Court, the lawsuit seeks damages for the health costs local governments pay to treat residents suffering from illnesses related to eating ultra-processed foods. These foods make up about 70% of the country’s food supply, and have been linked to obesity, diabetes, cancer and other serious diseases.

Chiu, at a press conference: “Like the tobacco industry, they knew their products make people very sick but hid the truth from the public, profited from untold billions and left Americans to deal with the consequences.”

The lawsuit follows California passing a law in October phasing out ultra-processed foods from school meals. It also comes at a time when President Donald Trump’s administration — led by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and his “Make America Healthy Again” campaign — is seeking to curb Americans’ consumption of ultra-processed foods. 



Competing insurance ballot measures: Never mind

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
Proponents of two competing ballot initiatives on insurance regulations have withdrawn their proposals from the 2026 ballot. Proposition 103, the law that governs property insurance in California, remains intact. 
In August, an independent insurance agent filed a measure to weaken Prop. 103, and in a subsequent filing added a provision that would have thrown out California’s ability to approve insurers’ rate increases. Consumer advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, whose founder wrote Prop. 103, in September filed a counter-measure that included calling for a policyholder bill of rights. 
Both parties agreed to withdraw their petitions on Tuesday, Consumer Watchdog President Jamie Court told CalMatters. But his group said “there is still a huge need for many of the other protections in the ballot measure,” and that it may try again for the 2028 ballot. 
The insurance agent, Elizabeth Hammack, confirmed to CalMatters that she withdrew her proposal, but said she did not care to explain why at this time.

This story by Cassandra Hemenway was first published in The Bridge on Dec. 1, 2025.
With the Monday announcement that Montpelier’s Acting City Manager Kelly Murphy is leaving her role by the end of the year, the urgency has picked up for the City Council to fill the vacancy left by long-time City Manager Bill Fraser, who’s 30-year tenure ended in June.
The council has plans to announce finalists for the position this week, and that list will not contain Murphy, the former city finance director and assistant city manager who stepped into the role of acting city manager this summer. Murphy has accepted a job as the education finance director with the Vermont Agency of Education, according to a Dec. 1 press release from the city.
Murphy will prepare and submit the City Manager’s Fiscal Year 2027 budget to the city council before her departure “to ensure continuity in municipal financial planning,” the release stated.
City Councilor Pelin Kohn told The Bridge that 30 people applied for the city manager role. The council chose eight of those applicants for the first round of interviews, then honed the list down to four for the second round of interviews, which, she said, was being completed on Monday.
“Any one we choose of those three finalists will be a good fit,” Kohn said, saying she felt confident about the candidates because of the in-depth process of vetting, interviewing, and discussing candidates undertaken by the full council.
The finalists will be invited to come to Montpelier to meet with the city staff, department heads, and business leaders and will be available in a public forum where residents are invited to ask their own questions, Kohn said. And, according to the release, the council will discuss the next steps for interim leadership at its Dec. 17 meeting. 
Mayor Jack McCullough said in the release that “Kelly has provided steady, thoughtful leadership during an extraordinarily challenging time for our community. We are grateful for her service and wish her the very best in this next step.”

Emily Talkington
Dr. Emily Talkington is a wildlife veterinarian specializing in primates


I’m a wildlife veterinarian specializing in monkeys, so I know there are ways to prevent the recent incident in Mississippi where eight monkeys escaped during transport from a research lab in New Orleans. 
Five of the monkeys were killed by authorities, two others were shot dead by members of the public and only one was recovered alive.  
This was not an isolated incident. Over the past two decades, there have been at least 15 publicly reported monkey escapes in transit and directly from labs. 
Earlier this year, the California National Primate Research Center at the University of California – Davis was cited by the USDA after a monkey was severely injured from a malfunctioning cage closure. 
These incidents demonstrate a pattern of incompetence that harms monkeys and illustrates the risks of infectious disease and injury for those who handle or are exposed to monkeys. They are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the harm caused by animal experimentation. 
I’ve experienced firsthand the dangers of infectious disease transmission while working with wild, captive and rescued macaques in Southeast Asia. After I was bitten by a wild macaque in Malaysia, I was immediately administered post-exposure rabies prophylaxis. 
For those of us who capture or transport wild macaques, there is a risk of contracting infectious diseases they are known to harbor, such as herpes B virus, tuberculosis, yersinia pestis (plague), rotavirus, and leptospirosis, a blood infection.
Infectious disease research is the most common use for monkeys in taxpayer-funded U.S. labs. The research often requires forcefully infecting monkeys with dangerous pathogens and subjecting them to miserable and fatal outcomes. 
Tulane University’s National Biomedical Research Center — the New Orleans primate research facility funded by the National Institutes of Health — reports that the escaped monkeys harbored no known pathogens. But veterinary medical records and necropsy reports have not been released, which illustrates an ongoing lack of transparency in what occurs behind locked laboratory doors. 
For decades, medical research and product safety testing have subjected monkeys to life in the lab. While the animals have some superficial similarities to humans, this research is largely futile and ignores biological differences that lead to difficult and rare translation to human biology and clinical benefit.  
Some of the most common monkey species used in research include rhesus and long-tailed macaques. They live in social groups in the wild. For monkeys in labs, the isolation, transport  and restraint often lead to a reduction of their immune system’s ability to fight infections and diseases and to harmful self-directed behavior, such as self-mutilation, hair plucking, and biting the cage bars, which can impact the reliability of experiments.

In place of monkeys, there are a variety of more effective methods available to researchers. Some federally-funded monkey studies investigate human nutrition or marijuana use, research that can be and has been conducted with human volunteers. 
Researchers also are increasingly turning to human-based methods called “new approach methodologies,” which use human cells, tissues, and data to model human biology and disease more accurately than animals. Such methods as tissue chips, organoids (lab-grown cells that model organs) and artificial intelligence are advancing rapidly and can overcome species-specific barriers. 
Governments are starting to take steps to overhaul research infrastructures that favor animal use. The Netherlands recently passed a budget that includes a five-year phase-out of public funding for the largest monkey laboratory in Europe, while reallocating funds to animal-free research.
Here in the United States, both the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration have committed to moving away from animal experimentation.  
These changes signify an important shift, but if we continue to fund unnecessary and dangerous research using monkeys, the development of new treatments will slow, and the public will be at risk of deadly zoonotic diseases. 
Halting this research and refocusing funding on human-based methods will ensure that human health research actually benefits humans, and that it doesn’t come with detrimental risks to humans or animals.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/102925-Research-Monkey-Mississippi-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-03 08:56:36.442191

Gavin Newsom, Santa Clara County and San Francisco are suing the Trump administration over a huge shift in homelessness policy.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom, Santa Clara County and San Francisco are suing the Trump administration over a huge shift in homelessness policy.  


California is fighting back after President Donald Trump’s administration instigated homeless housing cuts that local service providers said would be “devastating.”
Two recently filed lawsuits accuse the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development of illegally going over Congress’ head to make massive changes to the way federal homelessness funds are distributed. 
“HUD’s new grant rules would effectively defund permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing programs across the nation, eliminating proven tools that help residents exit homelessness sustainably,” Santa Clara County Counsel Tony LoPresti said in a statement. “This is another instance of the Trump administration prioritizing its political agenda above the needs of our most vulnerable community members.”
Santa Clara County and San Francisco sued the Trump administration this week, in conjunction with the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition. A separate lawsuit was filed last week by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration and a handful of other states. It marked the 47th time California sued the Trump administration in 44 weeks.
Now, homeless service providers are waiting anxiously to see how the litigation plays out and wondering if the impending legal battle will further delay the money they desperately need.
“It’s just the matter of how long it’s going to take that concerns me,” said Robert Ratner, director of Santa Cruz County’s Housing for Health, which coordinates the county’s homelessness response. “Because while we’re waiting for these issues to get resolved, we have programs that are going to run out of money to support people.”
The Department of Housing and Urban Development did not respond to a request for comment. 
In a statement last month, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said the changes are aimed at “stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values, and incentivized never-ending government dependency.”
At issue are changes the Trump administration made to its funding policy last month. Jurisdictions applying for a piece of about $4 billion in federal homelessness funds now can’t spend more than 30% of that money on permanent housing — a significant decrease. Los Angeles County, for example, currently spends more than 80% on permanent housing. Instead, the federal government wants localities to prioritize emergency shelter and temporary housing programs that require participants to be sober or participate in treatment. 
While shelters offer a temporary respite from the streets, permanent housing can end someone’s homelessness. For years, the federal government has prioritized funding permanent housing using the “housing first” method — a strategy that moves people into housing as quickly as possible, without requiring them to first get sober or agree to addiction treatment. Veering away from both of those principles marks a major policy shift.
Last year, California communities won more than $683 million in federal homelessness funds through what is called the Continuum of Care program. About 90% of that went to permanent housing projects, which currently house tens of thousands of Californians, according to Newsom. The new rule threatens to put those people back out onto the street, he said in a news release. 
“While we’re waiting for these issues to get resolved, we have programs that are going to run out of money to support people.”Robert Ratner, director, Housing for Health
The new policy also prohibits the use of federal funds for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients, and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely. And it gives preference for projects in cities, counties and states that ban homeless encampments. 
Both lawsuits allege that the Trump administration’s funding changes violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution by defying the rules Congress set out for distributing the funds. Congress authorized a two-year grant cycle in 2024, meaning local jurisdictions wouldn’t have to reapply for funds in 2025. The Trump administration flouted that decision when it suddenly forced jurisdictions to reapply, the lawsuits allege. 
The lawsuits also claim the administration didn’t go through proper protocol before enacting the changes to its funding strategy, which would have included giving cities and counties more time to comply with the new rules, and allowing stakeholders to comment on the changes.
In Santa Cruz County, Ratner is of two minds about the lawsuits. On one hand, he believes the abrupt way the Trump administration rolled out the funding changes was “very inappropriate.” But he worries a lengthy court battle could tie up funds his county needs to pay people’s rents. 
The National Alliance to End Homelessness sued the Trump administration over similar allegations tied to a smaller, $75 million pot of homelessness funding in September. A judge sided with the Alliance, and temporarily barred the federal government from distributing those funds. But now that money is frozen, unable to help unhoused residents as the case moves forward.
Ratner worries that could happen again in this case. Santa Cruz County is set to start hitting serious financial problems as soon as February, Ratner said. That’s when a $1.2 million supportive housing grant, which currently houses about 50 people in different apartments around the county, is set to expire. 
The Trump administration doesn’t expect to start awarding Continuum of Care money until May. It’s unclear how the lawsuits will affect that timeline. 
In the meantime, Ratner and other homeless service providers are trying to remain optimistic.
“At this point, we don’t know how long the litigation process will take, but we’re hopeful it leads to a more workable path forward,” Sacramento Steps Forward CEO Lisa Bates said in a statement. “Of course, any delay in federal funding would have real impacts on communities across the country, including ours, to operate shelters, rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, and essential system coordination.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/080924_SF-Sweep_MO_CM_15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-03 08:56:36.442191

The plaintiffs say Zillow violated their rights by tricking buyers into using a Zillow homebuyer agent and pushing them to use Zillow Home Loans to finance their purchases.
The lawsuit claims when prospective buyers select the “contact agent” link on Zillow thinking they are contacting the listing agent, instead they are routed to a Zillow-affiliated buyer’s agent.
Some of the contracted Zillow agents urge buyers to pay more for homes so they can get a bigger commission, as the agent is required to give up to 40% of their cut to the company, according to the lawsuit.
The Norwalk resident purchased a home in Norwalk and did not feel she had any other options after requesting a house tour and being connected with a Zillow-contracted buyer’s agent, according to the lawsuit.
The law firm of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro is representing the 10 leading plaintiffs.
“From the CT plaintiff’s perspective, specifically, the lawsuit alleges that she was deceived by Zillow’s website in multiple manners,” Ash Klann, with the firm, said. “The lawsuit alleges that Zillow’s website violates consumers rights by shoehorning Zillow agents into the process, to receive fees, without the consumer’s knowledge or consent.”
After the initial complaint was filed in September, a dozen former Zillow employees corroborated the lawsuit’s claims, according to the firm representing the plaintiffs.
“Twelve current and former agents and loan officers have bravely stepped forward to help our clients build a comprehensive case against Zillow, and with their added information, we believe this lawsuit has the potential to bring major changes to Zillow’s policies and practices,” Steve Berman, managing partner and co-founder of Hagens Berman, said.
The lawsuit claims Zillow’s goal is to “monetize every step of the home buying process—even if illegally—and to encourage, incentivize, and ultimately coerce agents into violating their fiduciary duties by disregarding their clients’ interests.”
Plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages for the company’s deceptive practices, according to the lawsuit. Zillow did not respond to Connecticut Public’s request for comment.
If a homebuyer purchased a house using a Zillow agent, beginning in 2019, or financed a home using Zillow Home Loans, they may qualify to join the class action lawsuit.

(Photo by Bonnie Cash / Getty Images)The United States Department of Justice announced on Tuesday it had filed lawsuits against New Mexico and five other states for failing to produce statewide voter registration lists.
The agency began asking state election officials for their voter rolls last July. As Source reported at the time, New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver’s office also received requests at that time, and told Source NM her office was “reviewing whether or not we are legally able to prevent sending the private data, which would be Social Security, all dates of birth and driver’s license numbers.”
Rocking the Vote

Last month, Toulouse Oliver signed a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing concern about the federal government’s request for states’ voter rolls.
The Nov. 18 letter, as Colorado Newsline originally reported, was signed by 10 Democratic secretaries of state, and raised concerns about inconsistent information from the federal agencies about how they are using and sharing voter data requested from states in recent months.
Toulouse Oliver told Source NM last month she had two main concerns about the federal government’s request for voter data rolls. First: “What is the data being used for outside of verifying citizenship? That’s a big concern, because we’re not in the business of creating citizenship lists or providing information to [Immigration Customs Enforcement] that would potentially harm people who are legally here in the United States. We’ve seen from many, many news reports, there are a number of people that ICE have detained that are either US citizens or have legal status, so to me, that’s deeply concerning.”
She also said the state had provided the federal government with “the publicly available file that anyone has access to,” which does not include Social Security Numbers and only years of birth.
In a news release Tuesday, US Attorney General Pamela Bondi called “accurate voter rolls” a “cornerstone of fair and free elections,” and said “too many states have fallen into a pattern of noncompliance with basic voter roll maintenance. The Department of Justice will continue filing proactive election integrity litigation until states comply with basic election safeguards.”
In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said that “states that continue to defy federal voting laws interfere with our mission of ensuring that Americans have accurate voter lists as they go to the polls, that every vote counts equally, and that all voters have confidence in election results.

Secretary of State Director of Communications Alex Curtas confirmed that information to Source NM on Wednesday morning.

Curtas, in a statement provided to Source, said the office had only “just received the DOJ’s complaint letter,” and could not speak to the “content of the lawsuit until we have reviewed it further. However, New Mexico’s election administration is the most secure, accurate, and voter-focused in the entire nation. Any suggestion otherwise is baseless. Our office has already provided the DOJ with publicly available voter data, but we are legally prevented from providing them with personal private voter information. New Mexico state law requires the protection of personal private voter data and Secretary Toulouse Oliver has been consistently clear on that point. Secretary Toulouse Oliver will not compromise the safety of New Mexico’s voter data. Our office will always vigorously defend New Mexico’s voters and the integrity of our election system.”

The Alabama Public Service Commission Tuesday approved a request from Alabama Power to freeze some electricity rates for two years. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Public Service Commission Tuesday approved a rate moratorium requested by Alabama Power.
The consent order imposes a two-year halt on increases to the fuel cost to generate electricity; the cost for operating Alabama Power’s  power-generating plants; the cost of purchasing power from other companies, the cost of complying with government regulations and rate that guarantees a specific rate of return for the company, known as Rate Stabilization Equalization (RSE).
“We know budgets are tight, and power bills are a real concern for many families and businesses,” said Moses Feagin, Alabama Power’s executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer. “This commitment gives customers more certainty and predictability around electric rates at a time when many other household and business costs are rising.”

The move came amid growing concerns over affordability around the country, particularly as electricity rates continue to rise. In Georgia, where Alabama Power’s sister company Georgia Power operates, concerns over electricity rates led voters to elect two Democrats to that state’s Public Service Commission, the first time Democrats won a statewide constitutional office in Georgia since 2006.
Alabama historically has some of the highest residential power rates in the South.
Renewable energy advocates, while pleased with the rate freeze, do not believe they go far enough to provide relief for residents who pay for electricity.
“The rate is still generally high, especially for a southeastern state,” said John Dodd, policy manager for Energy Alabama, a nonprofit that advocates for more renewable energy use in Alabama, in an interview after the meeting. “We have one of the highest power rates in the southeast right now. Rate payers are not going to get any relief. They are not going to get any rebates either.”
The process to freeze electricity rates began when Alabama Power filed a request with the Public Service Commission at the end of November to fix several of the rates that it charges customers for its operations.
“Working with Commission staff, Alabama Power has considered its forecasted and estimated cost of service across cost years 2026 and 2027, respectively, and believes it can offer other commitments to provide customers with additional rate certainty in both 2026 and 2027,” Feagin said in the filing.
In exchange, the company asked the commission to allow it to apply the money that it would have used to refund customers from the Rate RSE to the Natural Disaster Reserve fund — dedicated to restoring utility services after a natural disaster — to “forestall an increase associated with Rate NDR” because of a current negative balance in the account.
“This would wipe out that negative balance, and as we have said, take that off the table and better position the company to deal with inevitable storm damages that got us to where we are that transpired last spring over the course of the last couple of springs,” said John Garner, executive director of the Alabama Public Service Commission.
The company also requested permission to use nuclear production tax credits to help offset the cost of the rate freezes.
Without the moratorium,  electricity costs for residents would have increased at least in part to fund the purchase  of the Lindsay Hill natural gas power generating station in Billingsley. Alabama Power said the plant was needed to address a forecasted surge in electricity demand from data centers in the state over the next few years.
Alabama Power requested the PSC to allow it to increase the monthly electricity rates on customers by $3.32 starting in the middle of 2027.
The Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of the environment, represented Energy Alabama and the Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution at the PSC to prevent Alabama Power purchasing the plant. SELC said that the company did not consider all the available alternatives before it chose to purchase the power plant in Billingsley and that it overestimated the electricity demand of data centers.
Groups such as Energy Alabama remain critical of the process that eventually led to the rate freeze that began when Alabama Power made the request in its filing.
“What I would have wanted to see is a comprehensive plan where the power company, rate payers, and the commission come together with a public rate case hearing and talk about what is really at the center of why rates are so high,” Dodd said. “What can we do to bring down this record-breaking profit that Alabama Power rakes in every year and lower the return of equity while simultaneously protecting the Natural Disaster Reserve Fund that they were talking about in the meeting.”
Prior to the start of Tuesday’s meeting, Energy Alabama submitted a petition signed by almost 700 people requesting that the PSC reject the proposal from Alabama Power to fix some of the utility rates.
“Cost recovery is simply pushed into future years, which could increase the total amount customers pay, particularly if deferred balances accrue interest,” said Energy Alabama Executive Director Daniel Tait said in an email along with the petition.
PSC President Cynthia Almond said in an interview after the vote that the PSC followed the process it had in place now.
“This is what we have to work with,” she said. “Who is to say what the future may hold, but right now, that is where we are, and that is the process that we go through. This is the law that we have to work within.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250805_100011-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-03 08:56:36.442191

The group of 60 spoke Monday about the future of the parks with Karen Budd-Falen, the associate deputy interior secretary. They discussed how the state will help in any future government shutdowns, the timed entry reservation program at Arches National Park and the rollout of a new plan to charge higher fees from international visitors, among other issues, two state officials said.

They described the all-day session as a brainstorm, with no commitments made. Regardless of any immediate results, the discussion provided local and state leaders a direct line of communication to top brass in the Trump administration overseeing much of the nation’s public lands. More than two-thirds of Utah is federally managed. 
“Ultimately, it truly was a workshop just to get all of the partners in the room and talking about, ‘How do we improve our parks and how do we support them?’ Because they’re the lifeblood to our state,” said Natalie Randall, managing director of the Utah Office of Tourism. 
The meeting follows a June Interior Department order recognizing gateway communities near national parks as “key stakeholders” in management and planning. 
It also comes as one such community, Grand County, is pitching a plan to add more parking and other changes to accommodate more visitors at Arches National Park – changes that critics say go against the National Park Service mission of preservation. 
Those not invited to the meeting, including a Utah News Dispatch journalist, were not permitted to enter. The closed doors raised suspicion for conservation groups opposing the state’s efforts to wrest control of public lands and pushing back against arguments the parks should work to allow more visitors inside at a single time.
“It was pretty secretive as to what the purpose was going into it,” said Neal Clark with the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. “The way that that meeting came together looks to be the state really trying to push its way into dictating management direction for parks.”

The event was designed as a “government-to-government meeting,” said Redge Johnson, director of the Public Lands Policy Coordinating Office and the host of the event. Johnson recalled telling some state lawmakers and others they couldn’t attend as he tried to keep attendance from growing too unwieldy for productive conversation and debate. 
“It’s not like we were there saying, ‘Thou shalt not,’ because that’s not what the meeting was,” Johnson said. “It was just, ‘Hey, here are some concerns, and we just have an open discussion about it.’”
He said the group debated timed entry programs, which Utah’s congressional representatives have criticized.
In August, the state’s congressional delegation urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to say no to reservation systems designed to limit traffic to parks, like the timed entry program in Arches National Park and a similar proposed setup for Zion National Park, arguing it corresponded with a dip in visitor spending. 
But Clark said the program ensures visitors can access the trails and sites they came for, instead of spending much of their time stopped in traffic along the way. 
“The superintendents, the management, the staff at these parks, have all thought through a lot of alternatives on how to do this,” Clark said. “And they’ve landed at these pretty sensible management decisions.”

,California,2025-12-03 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s new labor law could have unintended and unwanted consequences,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/labor-law-consequences-california/,"A new law allows a state board to intercede in labor disputes involving private employers. But is the law legal, since it usurps a federal role?","The California Legislature has a bad habit of writing new law in the moment and paying little or no attention to its potential consequences.
While legislative history contains many examples, the most spectacular occurred three decades ago when legislators and then-Gov. Pete Wilson massively overhauled how electricity is generated, distributed and priced, telling consumers it would make power more affordable and reliable.
The real world impact was just the opposite. Power became less reliable, prices skyrocketed and the state’s investor-owned utilities were pushed into insolvency.
Other examples of unintended consequences in California include launching a bullet train project without comprehensive construction or financial plans, sharply increasing public employee pensions without considering costs and doing the same with unemployment insurance benefits.
One could also add the current practice of draining emergency reserves to cover budget deficits that result from overestimating revenues and underestimating spending, leaving the state’s finances vulnerable to an inevitable economic downturn.
Then there is Assembly Bill 288, one of many measures the Legislature dominated by Democrats and Gov. Gavin Newsom have passed in recent years to thwart — or so they hope — President Donald Trump.
AB 288, sponsored by California labor unions and carried by Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, an Inglewood Democrat, expands the authority of California’s Public Employment Relations Board — which oversees union-management activities in state and local governments and school districts — to include private sector employment.
The bill aims for the Public Employee Relations Board, or PERB, to step into the role performed for many decades by the National Labor Relations Board because, McKinnor and other advocates maintain, the NLRB is frozen by a dispute over its membership.
Early this year, Trump removed Dwynne Wilcox, the NLRB’s chair, leaving the board without a quorum and unable to decide pending cases. Trump’s action is being fought in the courts.

“Well, I’ll just say that if we have no board, no quorum, no board, no justice to state workers, for state workers,” McKinnor told the state Senate Judiciary Committee just before AB 288 passed. “And so, we need to make sure that, you know, that PERB can hear these cases, because if there’s no forum for workers to resolve unfair labor practices, then where do they stand?
“What do we do for them? We can’t just leave them out in the cold because the NLRB doesn’t have a quorum. We also can have loss of union protections, like bargaining rights, organizing protections and reinstatement after retaliation. And so, we can’t have our workers unprotected, because employers will take advantage of that.”
Private employer groups opposed the measure, contending the existence of the NLRB, even though it’s stymied, preempts a state from usurping federal authority.
Generally, states can legislate on labor relations only in economic sectors not covered by federal law. That’s why, a half-century ago, California could create the public employment board and the Agricultural Labor Relations Board to oversee employment on farms and in food processing plants.
The NLRB and interests that opposed AB 288 are suing in federal court, contending that the legislation is illegal under federal law.
AB 288 represents a potentially disruptive, even dangerous, precedent. Were it to survive the legal challenge, every state would be free to create its own set of laws governing unionization of workers.
Blue states such as California could virtually mandate unionization of private sector employees, as it already has for public employees and farm workers.
Meanwhile, red states could virtually prohibit unions from organizing workers, to make the states more attractive to industry and insulated from NLRB oversight even if Democrats regain the White House.
Balkanizing labor-management relations would create chaos in the national economy. It also could potentially work to the overall disadvantage of union organizing efforts. Do California’s unions and their political allies really want to take that chance?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/121924_Amazon_Strike_SF_CM_27.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-03 08:56:36.442191

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)This story is the first in a series on the connections between housing instability and child welfare. This project was supported by the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s National Fellowship and Fund for Reporting on Child Well-Being. 
Homelessness alone is rarely the reason children are removed from their families and placed in the child welfare system throughout the state of Nevada. 
Yet in the recent instances where children have been placed in foster care because of homelessness or “inadequate housing,” state and local officials can’t provide firm details as to what made those cases exceptional. 
 Nevada, like much of the nation, has seen rising homelessness as housing costs have soared. 
Whether by compounding reasons that lead to a child being removed on the front end, or becoming a barrier that delays family reunification, and at multiple points in between, unstable housing takes a deep, and often lasting, toll on children’s well being.
The county has tried to bolster resources, including additional rental assistance and opening noncongregate shelter spaces for families to try to catch people on the front end, said Abigail Frierson, Clark County’s Deputy County Manager who currently serves as the interim director for the county’s department of Family Services. 
“We’ve had in recent years some additional resources come into play that can be accessed at the front end of cases, or even before a case is filed, to try to avoid court oversight of the child,” she said. 
Homelessness or inadequate housing is noted as the reason for removal in a little more than 10% of child welfare cases in recent years. 
Of the 2,590 families that had children removed statewide in 2024, there were 361 incidents where inadequate housing or homelessness were listed as a reason for removal, according to data from the Nevada Department of Family and Child Services (DFCS). The overwhelming majority had additional reasons attached to the removal. 
“Before a child is removed from a home, the government’s obligation is to make reasonable efforts to prevent that removal,” Nevada 8th Judicial District Court Family Division Judge David Gibson said. “Those aren’t the kinds of cases that should, except in the rarest circumstances, ever even come before a judge.” 
Child welfare services should intervene and provide the family resources before involving the court, he added.
Statewide there were 30 children removed due to inadequate housing or homelessness with no other additional reason in 2024, according to DFCS data. There have been 26 instances as of July 2025, the most recent available data.  
Three children were removed from their family’s supervision due to housing inadequacy alone in rural Nevada, while 27 children were placed in child welfare services in Clark County in 2024.
The three incidents when children were removed for inadequate housing in rural Nevada was from a single family and stemmed from “a filthy house,” said Betsey Crumrine, the Deputy Administrator with the Division of Child and Family Services.
“That house would have needed to pose a safety threat for removal to occur for that reason alone,” she said. 
The meaning of inadequate housing varies, she explained. In some instances, it’s the lack of heat or air conditioning.  It could also include unsanitary and unsafe conditions that present health risks and hazards for children. 
“It could be a dirty house which could look different for the age of the kids,” Crumrine said. “If you have toddlers crawling around the floor and you have animal feces on the floor and they are putting things in their mouths, that could be considered inadequate housing.”
The same scenario wouldn’t necessarily apply to older children or teenagers. “It’s all situational,” she said. 
The 27 families in Clark County that had children removed just for homelessness or inadequate housing last year is the highest number in 10 years of data provided by the state.
While still low compared to the number of overall child removals, the figures seemed high, Frierson said.
“I would tend to think that there would be more going on than just homelessness,” Frierson said. “The court would not be very friendly to a homelessness-only removal when the parent is functional in every other way.”


There were four instances of homelessness-only family removals in Washoe as of July this year, but ”due to the confidentiality of the families we serve, we are unable to provide specific details regarding individual cases, outcomes, or circumstances of their involvement,” Tammi Williamson, the Division Director Washoe County Human Services Agency, said in an email.

“It is uncommon for WCHSA to remove children solely on the basis of a parent’s lack of housing resources or homelessness,” she said. “Typically, there are additional contributing factors related to parental circumstances or behaviors.”
The Department of Family and Child Services provided Nevada Current data since 2016 for instances where children were removed for homelessness only or homelessness combined with an additional reason. There were 53 children placed in child welfare services  in 2016 due homelessness or inadequate housing statewide. The number of children removed from households plummeted to single digits in 2017 and remained that way through 2022. Statewide it was nine that year. In Clark County it was six.
The number slowly began to increase in 2023.
There have been efforts to get more publicly available data from child welfare agencies on things such as the breakdown on race, said Amanda Haboush-Deloye, the executive director for the Nevada Institute for Children’s Research & Policy.
The last time the state Legislature mandated an independent review of child welfare cases was in 2008, resulting in a study conducted by Nevada Institute for Children’s Research & Policy. Haboush-Deloye couldn’t recall what prompted lawmakers to authorize the review at the time, only that it provided insight into the system. 
“We were able to go in and randomly pull cases and read through all of the case notes,” Haboush-Deloye said. “That way we could determine if it seemed like there were any patterns or any issues.”
Haboush-Deloye wasn’t aware of any efforts in Nevada to analyze the child removal cases that dealt with housing to determine underlying causes. 
“I do think having external reviews on a regular basis would be helpful,” she said. 
Rapidly rising family homelessness
The bulk of the cases where children are removed from their families due to homelessness and the court is needed to intervene include additional reasons, often involving mental health issues. 
“Typically, what you’re finding is housing instability is riding on the back of substance abuse, issues of domestic violence in the home, or mental health,” Gibson said. “What you find is if resources are playing a part in a child coming under the court’s formal supervision, there are usually other more important underlying issues that are causing the homelessness.”
Of the 361 statewide cases last year when homelessness was cited in the removal, 331 cases identified additional reasons.
As of July 2025, there have been 275 children removed for homelessness or inadequate housing with 249 including additional reasons. 
These numbers coincide with a rising homelessness number at large. 
Statewide, homelessness increased by 17% in 2024, according to the U.S. Housing and Urban Development data. The Southern Nevada Point-in-time count –  a yearly snapshot of those experiencing homelessness that is considered an undercount –  found of the 7,906 experiencing homelessness, roughly 20% — more than 1,500 — were families with children. 
That’s nearly double the 794 families identified as homeless in 2023, and that was a 54% increase from 2022.   
Nevada, like most states, has long contended with an affordable housing shortage. The pandemic exacerbated that. When eviction protections expired and Covid-era relief assistance began to be scaled back, some families fell through the social safety net.  
“We have the same individuals that were evicted, struggling to find affordable rental units,” said Brenda Barnes, the social services manager for Clark County. “We have families that struggle with managing that stress. A lot of it is triggered because of everything spiking, cost of living increasing, … It’s just one thing after another that ends up becoming a negative outcome for a child at times.” 
The way a parent reacts during that time of crisis “can make all the difference on whether a referral to child protective services will be opened up or not,” she said.  
During times of intense stress, some parents might turn to self-medication to cope.
“If you can’t think of any way that you’re going to get out of this, or see any positive or light at the end of the tunnel, you’re going to get depressed … Then you start using other substances to help you feel better. Then it’s just that rolling pin that goes over and over,” Haboush-Deloye said.
The lack of stable housing might not always be the underlying incident that brings people into the child welfare system. 
But for many families who enter the system, the need to find stable housing “becomes more crucial to the family on the back end,” Gibson said. 
Once children enter the system and a court begins to monitor cases, social services establish case plans for parents to follow in order to reunify with children which include things like mental health and substance abuse treatment. 
The county isn’t able to quantify how many case plans include some sort of housing component, Frierson said. Though nonprofits who work with families that have child welfare cases say it is constantly a barrier for their clients.  
“If somebody has literally addressed every other issue in their case plan, and it’s only housing that’s holding up the reunification, most of the judges that are overseeing those cases set them for a fairly rapid set of status checks to try to turn the heat up on everybody involved, to help that family find a place,” Gibson said.
There are only limited housing resources available and whether or not housing is deemed adequate for reunification is determined case by case, Frierson said. 
Extended stay or weekly motels, often a last resort for people when no other housing is available, is typically considered stable housing, she added.  
Family Promise of Las Vegas, a nonprofit that provides shelter and support services for families and children experiencing homelessness, has run into those issues when helping families reunite. 
Before opening a 10-bed facility this year to house families at risk of homelessness, Family Promise of Las Vegas, a nonprofit that provides shelter and support services for families and children experiencing homelessness, would pay for extended stay rooms to serve the sheer volume of clients in need of help and help families reunite.  
“There was a situation where we actually tried to take a family where their housing was the last resort and the last step was to need to be reunified with the child,” said Marisa Cervantes, the executive director for the nonprofit. “We placed them in the weekly but then later found out that it did not count as housing because it was not long term,” and the child remained in protective services.
There were times when housing resources became an issue for families, and the family court judges would order welfare services to allocate those resources.
The Nevada Supreme Court ruled last year that district courts can’t order governmental social service agencies to pay for housing assistance.
According to court documents in that case, Clark County family services removed children and placed them with a paternal aunt, who lived with their paternal grandmother. Prior to becoming a foster parent, the family asked, and was granted, rental assistance from family services. 
After becoming a foster parent to the children the family asked for additional rental assistance  for $1,000, but the county’s division declined – the agency noted the family was receiving foster care subsidies. The attorney went to the district court, which ruled the county must pay. 
The county then sued.
“We conclude that the district court lacked statutory authority to order DFS to pay rental assistance to a foster parent,” the Nevada Supreme Court ruled Dec. 5, 2024. 
A judge’s hands are often tied for how much they can mandate and the courts “can’t tell an agency how to spend their number,” Gibson said.
Delayed reunification
Even for parents going through substance abuse treatment, and successfully complete it as a requirement set out by the court, housing becomes a final barrier to reunifying with their children, said Irma Magrdichian, the director of residential services at WestCare Nevada, which provides substance abuse treatment. 
The result, she said, has led to delayed reunifications because of the lack of stable housing. 
The organization has about 20 women who are reunified with children who had previously been removed to foster care while still in treatment, said Leo Magrdichian, WestCare’s vice president of operations. 
“We’re able to allow mom to participate in treatment, reunify with her children, and then begin the process of really learning how to balance motherhood or parenting and treatment,” he said. 
The organization provides a 30-bed facility at its Women and Children’s Campus where women can participate in treatment while they have their children.  
Challenges to paying for treatment and cost of living are adding more obstacles to families with child welfare cases
In previous years, Medicaid had paid for up to six months of treatment. During the time, “a lot of DFS caseworkers were okay with placing children while in residential treatment,” said Irma Magrdichian. 
The courts “considered that to be ample time for mom to gain employment and, you know, secure, more stable housing after treatment,” she added. 
More recently, the amount Medicaid paid for treatment was reduced to 90 days, just as rents began to increase and affordable housing became even more out of reach for people. 
Ninety days is not nearly enough time for a person to save enough money and secure housing, said Leo Magrdichian. 
“We’re looking at women that have had evictions or ladies that have been out of the workforce for a long time,” he said. 
Shorter treatment timeframes combined with fewer affordable housing options to make welfare services “a little bit more reluctant to place” children with mothers until they find more stable living, Irma Magrdichian said. 
Using extended stay motels often isn’t an option, as it puts women back in environments that could jeopardize sobriety, Leo Magrdichian said. 
“What do you do when you’re at risk? You stop thinking clearly, and you go back to doing some of the things that you did before,” he added. 
The organization is in the process of completing an 84-unit apartment complex for women and children to transition to after they complete treatment, which is expected to begin housing women in January.  
“Just based on need and funding, this campus will be for women or women and children only,” he said.  “We will have the opportunity in the future to expand, because the reality of it is, you need to treat the entire family at the same time if you really want to see good success.”
Residents won’t be required to pay rent, giving them an opportunity to save up for when they eventually transition to their own apartment down the road once they are ready. 
Opening the complex will complete a long time goal, and fill a growing need among women they serve,” Irma Magrdichian said.
“I can tell you right now, when it’s done, it will not be enough,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0087-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 08:56:36.442191

Mohammad Ali Dadfar had been held in the Greene County Jail in Springfield since early October, when he was detained and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
On Monday, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri, Southern Division,  agreed that Dadfar, an asylum-seeker, was arrested without a warrant and that his permission to be in the U.S. was unlawfully terminated without a hearing or written notice.
The court noted that while immigration detentions are administrative, they are still subject to due process reviews.
Officials for ICE had argued that the Missouri court did not have jurisdiction.
The court disagreed, noting that the case challenged Dadfar’s unlawful detention, but not other proceedings the government might use to remove him from the country.
“Respondents also did not provide a hearing before a neutral decisionmaker where ICE was required to justify the basis for re-detention or explain why Petitioner is a flight risk or danger to the community,” the ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Harpool said.
Harpool also forbade the Department of Homeland Security from moving Dadfar out of the Missouri court’s jurisdiction before they complied with the order to release him.
Afghan asylum seeker who fought the Taliban now held by ICE in Missouri

Dadfar was released on Monday and will be driven by a friend to reunite with his wife and young children in another state, said Rekha Sharma-Crawford, a Kansas City immigration attorney who filed the case challenging his arrest and detention.
Dadfar had been granted parole into the U.S. in 2024. His parole is effective until June 17, 2026.
The decision to grant him parole “creates a liberty interest intimately tied to freedom from imprisonment,” the ruling said.
“Freedom from imprisonment — from government custody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint — lies at the heart of the liberty that the (due process) Clause protects,” the ruling noted, citing previous court decisions.
Dadfar requested asylum after arriving at the U.S. southern border. He had traveled  through the dangerous Darien Gap jungle with his family.
The asylum claim is based on his assertion that he was among the thousands of Afghans who aided the U.S. military, battling to keep the Taliban from overtaking his native Afghanistan.
Dadfar, an over-the-road trucker, was taken into custody by Indiana State Police on Oct. 10. Police detained him during a routine stop at a weigh station. He was then handed over to ICE in Chicago before being placed in detention in Greene County, Missouri.
Dadfar is a 37-year-old father of four children, all under the age of 12.
Reached at the family’s home, Dadfar’s wife said she was elated. She’d been worried earlier in the day while awaiting word from the court.
The family lives outside of Missouri.
The case argued that the government’s actions violated a prior consent decree, ICE’s own regulations and Dadfar’s due process.
Dadfar’s case is among a spate of federal lawsuits contesting warrantless arrests by ICE and is part of continued legal attempts to hold the Trump administration accountable to the 2022 Castañon Nava federal consent decree.
Dadfar, the Missouri ruling said, had timely filed his asylum application with a Colorado immigration court. He also had a valid work permit.
The next hearing in the asylum application is February 2026.
Dadfar is represented by a Colorado immigration law firm in the asylum request.
Sharma-Crawford said Dadfar’s arrest and detention are another example of the Trump administration violating policy. She also said the case shows how even immigrants who follow the rules are threatened with removal.
“Even doing what they are supposed to do, in the way the law requires, does not keep them safe,” Sharma-Crawford said in a social media post. “That is what is happening right now in America.”

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline. 
This ear of corn is part of a larger climate story: Nitrogen fertilizer — which is used heavily in Corn Belt states like Wisconsin — is driving a surge in nitrous oxide emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. (Dee J. Hall / Floodlight)
But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.
Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it. 
Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.
Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.
The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop —  is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.
Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact. 
Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it. 

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it. 
Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions. 
At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.
Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices. 
Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?
How corn took over America
Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.
Cattle and other livestock eat more than 40% of the corn grown in the United States. A similar amount is used to make ethanol. Just 12% ends up as food for people or in other uses. (Dee J. Hall / Floodlight)
Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.
In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”
In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.
Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.
“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”
Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.
When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions. 
That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight. 
In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.
Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims
Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.
But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel. 
The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.
“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.
Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.
But some research tells a different story.
A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.
Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.
“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.
Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.
A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste. 
The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, requires that gasoline be blended with ethanol, which in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drives up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it. Ethanol producers say that was good for the climate, but recent research has concluded otherwise. (Ames Alexander / Floodlight)
The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land. 
“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”
Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.
As corn production rises, so have emissions 
Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021. 
That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.
Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found. 
In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.
The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.
Emissions of nitrous oxide — an extremely potent greenhouse gas — have soared in America’s Corn Belt in the years since nitrogen fertilizer use became widespread. (Environmental Working Group visualization of nitrous oxide data from Iowa State University researcher Chaoqun Lu and colleagues.)
Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.
According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure. 
The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said. 
Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.
One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.
“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”
When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”
What cleaner corn could look like
Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.
And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.” 
University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.
Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference. 
Iowa farmer Levi Lyle planted this corn in soil with mulch made from cover crops instead of synthetic fertilizer. This type of mulch suppresses weeds, enriches soil and reduces or eliminates the need for nitrogen fertilizer. It’s a “huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” Lyle says. (Photo courtesy of Levi Lyle)
Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.
Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.
In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.
“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.
Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.
Under the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.
“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer. 
“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked. 
In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs. 
“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.
But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said. 
And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.
Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.
“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”
The next corn boom?
Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to  boost ethanol demand. 
One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.
Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority. 
Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.
Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.
Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions. 
“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”

Read this story in English.
Con el aumento de la inseguridad alimentaria y los cambios en programas como el SNAP (Programa de Asistencia Nutricional Suplementaria), algunos legisladores de Connecticut están intensificando sus esfuerzos para aprobar una legislación durante la sesión de 2026 que garantizaría comidas escolares universales para los estudiantes de todo el estado, independientemente de su distrito escolar. Actualmente, los estudiantes tienen acceso a una combinación de comidas gratuitas, a precio reducido y de pago, según los ingresos familiares, y algunos distritos optan por ofrecer comidas gratuitas a todos los niños.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre las comidas escolares universales en Connecticut y por qué podría tratarse en la sesión legislativa del próximo año.
¿Quiénes son elegibles para recibir comidas escolares gratuitas en Connecticut?
Hay tres maneras en que funcionan las comidas escolares en las escuelas de Connecticut.
Primero, están los estudiantes que reciben comidas gratuitas, es decir, desayuno y almuerzo. Una familia de cuatro personas califica si gana menos de $41,795 antes de impuestos para el año escolar 2025-26.
También hay estudiantes cuyas familias pagan una tarifa reducida por las comidas escolares. Para una familia de cuatro, los ingresos antes de impuestos deben ser inferiores a $59,478.
Y hay estudiantes cuyas familias pagan el precio completo porque sus ingresos superan los límites para comidas gratuitas o a precio reducido. El almuerzo para estos estudiantes suele costar entre $3 y $4.50, según el distrito escolar.
Sin embargo, algunos distritos ofrecen comidas gratuitas a todos los niños. ¿Cómo funciona esto?
Según la Disposición de Elegibilidad Comunitaria (CEP), si más del 25% de la población de una escuela cumple los requisitos para recibir comidas gratuitas, la escuela puede optar por servir desayuno y almuerzo gratuitos a todos los estudiantes. La escuela puede entonces recibir un reembolso con fondos federales, a una tasa del 1.6%. Esto significa que, si el 40% de los estudiantes de la escuela cumplen los requisitos para recibir comidas gratuitas, la escuela recibirá un reembolso de 1.6 veces esa cantidad, o el 64%. La escuela deberá entonces encontrar fondos dentro de su presupuesto para las comidas del 36% restante. Algunos distritos tienen un porcentaje suficientemente alto de estudiantes que cumplen los requisitos como para no tener que aportar fondos adicionales.
También hay algunos distritos que ofrecen desayuno universal, pero no almuerzo.
¿Cuántos distritos escolares de Connecticut ofrecen comidas gratuitas a los estudiantes?
Actualmente, 63 distritos participan, pero en 12 de ellos el programa solo está disponible en algunas escuelas. Esto representa un total de 202 distritos escolares en el estado.
Mi distrito solía ofrecer comidas universales, pero ya no lo hace. ¿Por qué?
En 2023, la FDA (La Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos) modificó la disposición del CEP para que las escuelas con un 25% de estudiantes que calificaban para comidas gratuitas pudieran optar por ofrecer comidas universales. Anteriormente, el umbral estaba establecido en el 40%. Algunos distritos escolares de Connecticut que se encontraban dentro de ese rango del 25% al ​​40% decidieron optar por participar, pero posteriormente determinaron que el programa era demasiado costoso para continuar y optaron por retirarse.
¿Qué tipo de alimentos reciben los estudiantes como parte de las comidas universales en Connecticut?
No existe un menú universal que los distritos escolares deban seguir en Connecticut, por lo que cada distrito contrata a diferentes proveedores. Pero todos los almuerzos estudiantiles deben incluir cinco componentes: un lácteo, proteína, almidón, verdura y fruta.
¿Por qué legisladores y defensores quieren ofrecer comidas escolares universales en Connecticut, incluso en distritos ricos?
La inseguridad alimentaria está afectando duramente a los residentes de Connecticut. Las interrupciones en programas como el SNAP causadas por el cierre del gobierno y la exclusión total de poblaciones del programa han renovado los llamados para que el estado haga todo lo posible para garantizar que los niños reciban alimentación. La ley “One Big Beautiful Bill” excluye a ciertos grupos de los beneficios del SNAP, incluyendo a refugiados y solicitantes de asilo, así como a algunos adultos jóvenes, veteranos y personas sin hogar.
Pero incluso antes de que se implementaran estas restricciones, los legisladores de Connecticut abogaban por las comidas escolares universales por diversas razones.
Si bien algunos distritos escolares de Connecticut pueden tener un bajo porcentaje de estudiantes que califican para comidas gratuitas, legisladores y defensores afirman que universalizar estas comidas tiene varios beneficios. En primer lugar, cuando las comidas están disponibles sin costo, aumenta la participación en estos programas.
“Cambia la cultura del programa de comidas escolares”, afirmó Marlene Schwartz, directora del Centro Rudd de Políticas Alimentarias y Salud de la Universidad de Connecticut. “Deja de ser solo un programa considerado exclusivo para niños de bajos recursos, se convierte en algo que todos hacen”, reduciendo el estigma y garantizando que los niños con hambre reciban comida. Los niños con el estómago lleno, según los defensores, pueden concentrarse en su aprendizaje.
Universalizar este programa también reduciría el costo y el tiempo del papeleo asociado con la selección de comidas disponibles para cada estudiante. Esto permitiría a los directores de los programas de alimentación dedicar su tiempo y energía a brindar alimentos de la mejor calidad a sus estudiantes. Alimentar a más niños también otorgaría a los distritos más pequeños un mayor poder adquisitivo para realizar acuerdos de compra al por mayor con los proveedores.
En Connecticut, el alto costo de vida también significa que muchas familias no califican para comidas gratuitas, pero que tienen dificultades para cubrir el costo de los alimentos y se beneficiarían enormemente, según Schwartz.
“La diferencia entre lo que se puede ganar para dejar de calificar y lo que se necesita para mantener a una familia de cuatro en Connecticut es de muchos miles de dólares, y en esa diferencia hay muchas personas que necesitan ayuda y no la reciben”, dijo. Dado que las familias de bajos ingresos califican para almuerzos gratuitos, Schwartz dijo que la mayoría de la gente asume que todos los niños que necesitan comidas gratuitas las reciben. “¡No, no es así!”, dijo. “¡No es así!”.
¿Cómo financiaría Connecticut las comidas universales?
Eso está por verse, pero una de las propuestas sobre la mesa es un impuesto a las bebidas azucaradas. Schwartz, por su parte, está a favor de esta idea.
“Pensé que era la idea más brillante que había escuchado”, dijo. “Un éxito rotundo en salud pública”. Debido a que bebidas como los refrescos están asociados con consecuencias negativas para la salud, ciudades de todo Estados Unidos han utilizado estos impuestos para combatir la obesidad y la diabetes, a la vez que recaudan fondos para mejorar la calidad de vida de sus ciudadanos.
Filadelfia, por ejemplo, grava estas bebidas con 1,5 centavos por onza y ha utilizado esos fondos para financiar un programa preescolar gratuito, entre otras iniciativas.

The T will soon have enough equipment in place to roll out the first Green Line trolleys featuring on-board alerts about stalled vehicles or other obstacles on the tracks, more than 16 years after a fatal crash prompted federal regulators to recommend the system.  
A partial shutdown set to begin next week will allow the T to take another major step toward the “Green Line Train Protection System,” the first phase of which is now expected to be complete by next summer after a series of stops and starts. 
As one veteran official put it, the agency is “at a point where we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.” 
The technology relies on two primary features: equipment built into the cars and hundreds of “anchors” built alongside the tracks and platforms throughout the system. The anchors communicate with the on-board devices as trolleys move, allowing each vehicle to detect how close it is to others. 
In the first phase of implementation, Green Line operators will receive audible and visual alerts if the system detects a collision risk. The second phase, which is projected to be done in 2028, will add automatic speed control and braking. 
Crews will use the upcoming 15-day shutdown of the Green Line’s central trunk, primarily intended to replace the roughly 130-year-old wooden catenary wire trough, as an opportunity to finish installing anti-collision anchors underground. 
By the end of the year, T officials think they will have equipment in place for the Green Line Train Protection System from the endpoints at Union Square and Medford/Tufts through Kenmore Square, and also for the full D branch. Work to finish installation on the B, C, and E branches — the three other above-ground segments — will take place in the spring. 
The first trains using the new technology will roll out this winter, with full implementation set to be complete by the summer. 
“Each time the T introduces a trolley with the car-borne equipment between [December] and summer 2026, Green Line safety is enhanced more and more,” said MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo. 
While the project moves ahead, the timeline has also been pushed back from prior public updates. 
In February, T officials said the first phase would be complete by December. A presentation MBTA general manager Phil Eng gave on November 20 slid that completion date back to mid-2026. 
Officials argue the MBTA is still ahead of schedule because the contract with equipment manufacturer Piper calls for the first phase to be done by March 2027, and that the earlier dates mentioned publicly instead represented Eng’s preference. 
“GM Eng challenged the GLTPS team and the contractor with an aggressive schedule to have Phase 1 fully implemented by the end of this year,” Pesaturo said. “While significant progress has been made, supply chain issues and design challenges made it difficult to meet the aggressive schedule.” 
The push for automated anti-collision technology on the Green Line traces back to Gov. Deval Patrick’s first term in office. 
In 2008, an operator on the Green Line’s D Branch ran through a red signal in Newton, crashing into the back of a stopped train. The operator, Ter’rese Edmonds, died and seven passengers were injured.  
The National Transportation Safety Board in 2009 said the incident could have been prevented if the MBTA, which already had anti-collision technology on most of its other rail lines, deployed a protection system on the Green Line. (That year, another Green Line crash injured dozens of passengers.) 
Little progress happened in the ensuing years. The T contracted with German firm BBR in 2019; five years later, after Eng took the helm as general manager, the agency scrapped the deal and reset the project. 
One of the recurring problems along the way has been the aged infrastructure on the Green Line, which officials say makes it difficult to slot in an off-the-shelf option for anti-collision technology. 
“The Green Line cars are not only old, but their body varies, even within the same model,” said Sam Zhou, the T’s chief engineer and assistant general manager. “What that means is it really creates design challenges for our team [and] made the integration work far more complex than it would be for a newer fleet.” 
In February, the MBTA’s board of directors approved a new $112 million contract with Piper. 
For some T employees, the fresh momentum carries special significance. 
Alicia Gomes, the MBTA’s executive director of light rail transportation, recalled starting her career at the agency as a light rail operator in 2007, one year before the fatal crash. 
The Green Line operator killed was a classmate of Gomes’s during training, and they came from similar backgrounds. Detailing her experience at a recent public meeting, Gomes said the incident left her questioning whether she wanted to continue to drive a trolley. 
“I experienced firsthand the 16-year-long wait without much movement on any sort of installation for Green Line Train Protection — lots of talk, but not much movement,” Gomes said. “Just in the last two years, with the current leadership and the administration, we have finally begun to see real, tangible progress, progress that many of us believe should have started more than 17 years ago, before the fatality.” 
“At this point,” she added, “we are finally at a point where we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/20231114_093105-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C664&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

But it’s unclear whether the state Senate, which has given the plan a cold shoulder since it was first proposed almost two years ago, is any more favorably disposed toward it today than before.  
Boston continues to struggle with the aftereffects of the pandemic, which reshaped in-person work patterns and sent commercial property values falling as office vacancy rates rose. That has put added upward pressure on residential taxes in a housing market that continues to see home values rising.  
In letters to the city council and business leaders on Wednesday, Wu warned that residential property taxes are poised for a second double-digit year-over-year increase in a row, with officials projecting a 13 percent rise next year. For homeowners, the pressure of these continued hikes is “unsustainable,” Wu said.
The Boston City Council has three times voted to send a Wu-sponsored home rule petition to the State House that would let the city adjust its tax rates to relieve the burden on residential property owners by nudging up the tax rate paid by commercial property owners.  
But it has stalled on Beacon Hill as lawmakers say they are reluctant to burden already struggling commercial property owners with higher tax bills. A coalition of business leaders involved in shaping a more moderate version of the home rule’s language has also taken a step back. 
Commercial property owners in Boston are taxed at a higher rate than residential taxpayers, but Massachusetts communities are limited by state law to setting the commercial rate at no more than 175 percent of what the overall rate would be if all property were taxed at the same rate. 
Wu originally proposed boosting that to 200 percent and then gradually ratcheting it down over five years. But she reached a compromise last year with business leaders on a plan that would allow the commercial rate to go higher for three years, setting the maximum commercial rate at 181.5 percent for the first year, 180 percent the second year, and 178 percent the final year before returning to 175 percent in the fourth year. 
The measure also includes some additional tax relief for seniors and small businesses.  
With tax bills due to be sent out a few weeks from now, Wu said at a press briefing on Tuesday that getting the home rule passed is “an urgent matter.”  
The Legislature started its year-end break before Thanksgiving, however, and is not scheduled to return to formal sessions until January. 
Each year, the city assessing department updates the values of the city’s parcels and determines what the tax levy needs to be to support the city budget, roughly 70 percent of which is dependent on property tax revenue.   
In fall 2024, the picture looked grim for homeowners, with the Wu administration projecting that residents’ taxes could increase by 33 percent without state action allowing Boston to shift the burden. 
Business groups initially got behind the compromise proposal, which would have limited annual increases for residential property owners to 9 percent by increasing the tax burden of commercial property owners. 
Though the House signed off on the plan last year, the final expected residential property tax increase of 10.5 percent was far less than the worst-case scenario under Boston’s projections. The coalition of business leaders then got cold feet, and the home rule died without a vote in the Senate, where Sen. Nick Collins, of Boston, emerged as the measure’s most vocal opponent.   
Without naming Collins, the mayor on Tuesday noted the path to approval “was blocked by a single state senator.”  
According to the city assessing department, residential property values climbed 3 percent and commercial values dropped by 5 percent last year, which led to an actual 10.4 percent tax increase for the average single-family homeowner, or $575 year-over-year. For all residential property types – including multi-family homes and larger apartment buildings where the increased cost may get passed on to renters – Wu said, it was a 14.9 percent annual tax increase. 
This year, Boston assessing officials expect the trend to continue. Based on numbers that are “as close to final as they will be before the ultimate, final step” of Department of Revenue certification, Wu told reporters that 2025 residential valuations look like they will rise 2 percent and commercial valuations will drop by 6 percent.  
If the numbers hold, she said, the average single-family homeowner will now be facing a tax increase of 13 percent, or roughly $780, next year. By contrast, the average Class A office building will have a 4.4 percent decrease in its tax bill. 
Wu said Tuesday that she still finds the compromise number to be “too high and unsustainable year after year.” But that’s where the compromise with business leaders landed, she said, under the multi-year proposal. “Ultimately, not only were we at the 9 percent — we were beyond it,” she said of last year’s residential tax increase, “and this year, we are even further beyond it. So I continue to call for passage – immediate passage – of our home rule petition.” 
If the final certified numbers show a still-foundering commercial sector and booming residential market, Tamara Small, CEO NAIOP Massachusetts, which represents the commercial real estate industry, says it continues to be the wrong time to shift more of the tax burden on commercial owners.  
“We have been saying for quite some time that the commercial sector is very much struggling,” she told CommonWealth Beacon. “And if, as a result of this, we have seen reduced property valuations, NAIOP does not believe that the solution is to further punish a sector that is struggling by increasing its tax burden.” 
While urging quick action on the home rule, Wu did not point to any indication of a breakthrough that would have the Senate ready to get on board.  
Asked if Senate leadership has requested any stipulations to get the bill moving, and whether she has spoken recently with Collins, Wu said she or her team have reached out to members of the Boston delegation and Senate leadership but “have not received any specific requests of what needs to happen.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/20240109_200721-scaled-e1704861461383.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

The company was one of three applicants with casinos in Las Vegas to win a recommendation Monday from the New York State Gaming Facility Location Board to be licensed in that state. 
The New York board’s selection report noted that Resorts World, asked to disclose disciplinary actions within the past five years, reported none brought against several Genting (Resorts World’s parent company) subsidiaries, “omitting violations resulting in fines at Resorts World Catskills, Resorts World Hudson Valley, and its current video lottery gaming facility at Aqueduct.” Resorts World, the report said, “disclosed a settled disciplinary action involving Genting Berhad – RW Las Vegas LLC without providing details.”
The New York board “views this lack of transparency as concerning and recommends that the Commission weigh this in its licensing evaluation.” 
The Nevada Current was first to report in 2023 that federal authorities from the Central District of California were investigating a variety of allegations involving Resorts World Las Vegas,  MGM Grand, and Scott Sibella, who served as president of both hotels. 
Resorts World terminated Sibella weeks after the story’s publication for violating internal policy. Sibella later pleaded guilty in federal court to failing to comply with anti-money laundering laws while president of MGM Grand. He later lost his Nevada gaming license. 
Resorts World LV agreed to a $10.5 million fine imposed by state gaming regulators for allowing illegal bookmakers Mathew Bowyer and Damien LeForbes to gamble at the casino. The two, who lost close to $24 million at Resorts World LV, were permitted to gamble despite the lack of documented sources of income required by casinos. Both pleaded guilty to money laundering and illegal bookmaking.  
Federal prosecutors have yet to file charges or impose a long-anticipated fine against Resorts World. 
Taxing matters
Resorts World is planning a $3.3 billion investment in the New York property, which is slated to have more than 2,000 rooms. 
Resorts World NY, along with Bally’s and Hard Rock, the other applicants recommended for New York gaming licenses, would pay a much higher gaming tax in the Empire State than in Nevada, where unrestricted licensees are assessed a maximum gross gaming tax of 6.75% on casinos with  monthly revenue that exceeds $134,000.  
The New York State Gaming Commission determines the tax rate each applicant would pay, according to the state’s selection process. 
“An applicant may propose a tax rate on gross gaming revenue as part of its application, so long as the tax rate is at least 25% for slot gross gaming revenue and 10% for gross gaming revenue from all other sources,” says the state website.
Resorts World, in supplemental information provided to regulators, proposed a 56% tax on slot machines and a 30% tax on table games and other sources of gambling, far more than the 6.75% tax Nevada casinos pay. The company is also offering to contribute $25 million a year to a workforce housing fund. 
The other two companies recommended by regulators, Bally’s and Hard Rock, which have casinos in Las Vegas, also proposed paying higher taxes than they are assessed in Nevada. 
Bally’s suggested a 30% tax on slot machine games and 10% on table games and other gambling, while Hard Rock Metropolitan Park proposed a 25% tax on slot machine games and 10% on table games and other sources. 
“Assuming licensing at each Applicants’ proposed tax rates and stability in the existing gaming facility landscape, incremental gaming tax revenue is projected to reach approximately $1 billion annually by 2036, totaling approximately $7 billion in incremental tax revenue from 2027 to 2036, plus $1.5 billion in licensing fees,” says the Gaming Facility Location Board’s selection report.  
Gaming tax revenues in Nevada totaled $1.1 billion in fiscal 2024.
The willingness of gaming casino companies to pay significantly higher taxes in New York raises longstanding concerns about Nevada’s lowest-in-the-nation gaming tax.
Industry advocates have long argued that limited competition in other jurisdictions, where states often establish the number of licenses that may be granted, justifies the higher tax rates. Nevada, however, has no cap on the number of gaming licenses issued by the state, rendering licensees subject to widespread competition.  
But does the argument hold water now that nearly all adults hold a virtual casino in the palm of their hand?  
Former California gambling regulator Richard Schuetz notes electronic gambling and brick-and-mortar casinos “are not the same product. Sports betting really dominates phones. And going to Caesars for three days is different from sitting in your backyard playing slots or blackjack.” 
The competition argument remains valid today, says Alan Feldman, a former MGM executive who now serves as Director of Strategic Initiatives for UNLV’s International Gaming Institute.  
States with “monopoly systems” such as tribal exclusivity, limited licenses, or even a single operator, “can impose higher tax rates, because operators can still be profitable with no competition,” he says, while competitive markets “often use lower rates to attract multiple operators.” 
Feldman cites sports betting as an example, “as states with limited licenses often charge higher rates,” such as New York’s 51% tax rate.
“As gaming is regulated on a state-by-state basis, the competitive landscape is incredibly significant in determining a tax rate that’s reasonable,” says Feldman. 
Factors to be considered, he says, include: 

states have different fiscal needs: Some states rely on casinos as economic drivers, others as revenue sources;
tourism markets differ;
labor costs vary; and,
political attitudes toward gambling differ.

“If you look at the higher tax rate states, they are all likely to have a lower level of investment in the properties they attract,” Feldman says. “New York believes it’s different and can both charge a high tax and expect significant investment.”
MGM Resorts, he adds, pulled out of the New York competition “because they don’t believe the market can sustain both. They likely have a point as the winners are all located in fairly close proximity to one another.”  
MGM owns the Empire Casino in Yonkers “and will continue to operate without needing to invest $10+ billion,” Feldman noted. 
“The fact remains that no state can match the level of economic impact as Nevada when it comes to investment, jobs or per-capita taxes generated,” he said.
The gaming tax rate is the sacred cow of Nevada tax policy. Increasing the rate is a bridge too far for almost all Nevada politicians and most business interests.
Rebecca Dutro, president of the Nevada Taxpayers Association, says she’s unaware of the organization’s position on the gaming tax.
Former State Sen. Joe Neal, a Democrat, spearheaded two ballot initiatives in the early 2000s that would have increased the gaming tax rate from 6.25% to 11.25% on casinos with monthly revenue exceeding $1 million. Neither garnered the signatures to qualify for the ballot. 
Neal also sponsored several bills to increase the tax rate, however, they were killed in committee.
A 2022 ballot initiative sponsored by the Clark County Education Association would have increased the gaming tax rate to 9.75% on monthly revenue that exceeds $250,000. While the measure garnered enough support to qualify for the ballot, the Nevada Resort Association filed a legal challenge, and a judge eventually ordered that the measure be removed from the ballot.
Former Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, who currently serves as president of the University of Nevada Reno and as chairman of the Resorts World board of directors, declined to say via his UNR office whether the willingness of Resorts World and other casinos companies to swallow a double digit tax rate in New York is an indication the gaming tax in Nevada could be tweaked to the benefit of residents and public institutions such as UNR. A spokesman directed the Current to Resorts World, which did not respond. 
Sandoval’s fellow Republican, Gov. Joe Lombardo, also did not respond.   
Washoe County Commission Chairwoman Alexis Hill, a Democrat who hopes to run against Lombardo next year, wants an overhaul of the state’s tax system, which she says needs to be modernized. A hike in the gaming tax, she says, is not off the table.
“It needs to be broad based and equitably distributed, which it is not right now,” Hill said Tuesday. “We tax poor people disproportionately more because of our very high sales tax.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The board overseeing health insurance for public education employees plans to seek additional funding from the Legislature to keep premiums down, but an Alabama lawmaker says the board will need to help. 
The Public Education Employee Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) Board plans to ask for a $380 million increase from the state for the 2027 fiscal year, which begins next October. It got a $129 million increase for fiscal year 2026, a budget in which education employees did not get an across-the-board cost-of-living raise.  
Neah Scott, legislative counsel for PEEHIP, said at the board’s meeting Tuesday morning that there is no guarantee the Legislature will approve the additional funding.

“I think it’s going to be a little bit longer before they’ve decided how to address the PEEHIP funding problem,” Scott said. “There’s still a lot of work to be done, both in the governor’s office and her budget and on the legislative side, what they’re going to, what direction they’re going to go.”
Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation Education Committee, which oversees the Education Trust Fund (ETF) budget, said in an interview Tuesday he talked with the board last week about the request. 
“They are going to have to seriously help us, for us to be able to meet our overall obligations,” Orr said.
A message seeking comment from Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, which also oversees the ETF, was left Tuesday. 
Scott told the board to be prepared to withdraw funds from the Retiree Trust Fund. Investment revenue is the sole source of funding for the trust and withdrawals are limited to 10% of its prior-year market value. As of September, the trust held $2.6 billion, according to Diane Scott, chief financial officer for PEEHIP.
“We’ve only taken out monies twice. In 2015 we took out $92 million, in 2016 we took out $32 million,” the CFO said. “Here we are in 2026, 10 years later, and we’re looking at taking out $118.9 million.”
The ETF has far fewer burdens than the General Fund, which will see increased requests from the Department of Human Resources and the Department of Public Health due to federal cuts. 
Orr said there are multiple priorities for the ETF, which funds PEEHIP and public education in the state. The PEEHIP increase, he said, is the newest and most expensive topic, but he also wants to include pay raises for teachers and a bonus for retired public educators. 
“Inflation is clicking along, and it’s better than it was, but it’s still present, and we don’t want them to fall behind,” Orr said.
David Bronner, CEO of the Retirement System of Alabama, said the Legislature is facing a higher demand for funding than it has in years. 
“The one that always bothers me is the projections for the next couple of years is $100 to $150 million more a year. That’s an attention getter,” Bronner said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1223-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

Respecting the process requires acknowledging when we got it wrong. Anything less fails to honor the people whose land we are discussing.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Troy Headrick: In response to the recent opinion piece, ‘Respect the process, honor the people’.","This commentary is by Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, sponsor of H.362, a bill relating to State recognition of Native American tribes and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
In response to the piece “Respect the process, honor the people” —



The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is not an optional or peripheral document. It is the global consensus on how governments must engage with Indigenous peoples when decisions involve their lands, histories, or cultures. Several articles are especially relevant here.
Article 19 requires states to “consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them.”

READ MORE

Article 14 states that “Indigenous peoples have the right to establish and control their educational systems and institutions providing education in their own languages,” and it requires states to work with Indigenous peoples to ensure access to education in their own culture and language.Article 31 affirms the right of Indigenous peoples to “maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions.”
Taken together, these articles form a clear message. When a government addresses topics related to Indigenous culture, heritage, identity or history, that government must involve the actual Indigenous peoples whose heritage is being discussed. Anything short of that fails to meet the standard set by UNDRIP.
In the recent commentary titled “Respect the process, honor the people,” the author claims that Vermont’s state recognition process was inclusive and rooted in meaningful engagement. When this claim is measured against the standards in UNDRIP, it does not hold. The state of Vermont got it wrong when we developed the state recognition process.
Consultation without consent is not free, prior and informed consent. If the process did not include the Abenaki First Nations at Odanak and Wôlinak as full decision-makers, it did not meet the required standard. A legislative process that occurs within an overwhelmingly white decision-making body cannot substitute for the authority of the Indigenous nations whose history and identity are being legislated.
There is also no distinction between “Canadian Abenaki” and “Vermont Abenaki.” There is only Abenaki. The border that separates Vermont from Quebec was drawn long after the original caretakers of this land lived, traveled, governed and survived here. Their displacement into the northernmost portions of their territory happened before either Canada or the United States existed.
To use a colonial border to exclude the rightful nations from consultation today is another continuation of the same colonial pattern. Article 36 of UNDRIP confronts this practice directly by affirming the rights of Indigenous nations to work across borders that were imposed on them.
The commentary also describes the state recognition process as respectful and inclusive. That claim is impossible to reconcile with what actually happened. Decisions were made by a legislature that was almost entirely white.
The self-identified communities in Vermont that claim Abenaki identity were given institutional advantages, while the recognized Abenaki nations of Odanak and Wôlinak were not given the authority or even the meaningful inclusion required under UNDRIP. Those advantages now persist with significant conflicts of interest that determine continued indigenous status through the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as it is currently constructed, reinforces these processes without confronting the actual truth of the matter. We will not have honest reconciliation without reckoning with this truth. The result is a continuation of a process that appeared inclusive in form yet excluded the very nations whose voices should have carried the greatest weight. That is not inclusion.
Recognition laws and educational curricula are not neutral acts. They shape how future generations understand the history of this place and the people who have lived here for thousands of years. UNDRIP makes it clear that Indigenous nations have the right to control their own cultural heritage and historical narratives. Vermont has an obligation to meet that standard when creating legislation, developing curriculum, designing public programming, or taking any action that relies on Indigenous knowledge.
If we want to respect the process, we must begin with a process that honors Indigenous rights.  The historical and archeological record is clear and undisputed on the history of the original caretakers of the land we now call Vermont.
Respecting the process requires centering the Abenaki First Nations at Odanak and Wôlinak, respecting their authority, and aligning Vermont’s practices with the obligations set out in international law.
Respecting the process requires acknowledging when we got it wrong. Anything less fails to honor the people whose land we are discussing.

Oct. 27, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAs tax incentives have marked Michigan open for business on data centers, an influx of proposals has drawn frustration and concern from residents across the state as landowners and local officials seek to bring these resource intensive facilities to their community. 
While proponents of these facilities – which house servers, storage devices and other pieces of online infrastructure – point to the role data centers play in the development of technologies like artificial intelligence and the potential economic boons that could come with them, environmental advocates and nearby residents are pointing to the burden the projects could put on their communities. 
Chief among the concerns with the projects making their way to the state is the large amount of energy needed to power these facilities, with an analysis from Bloomberg News finding a 267% increase in energy prices in communities located near data centers.

The facilities can also demand large amounts of water in order to cool the computer servers housed within, with some U.S. communities reporting issues accessing water after data centers began operating nearby. There are also concerns about pollution, as the water can be treated with chemicals to prevent corrosion or bacterial growth, making it unsuitable for human consumption or agricultural use.
Even for facilities that do not treat their water with chemicals, returning heated water into nearby bodies of water after it is used for cooling creates concerns for local ecosystems, Molly Kleinman, the managing director for the science, technology and public policy program at the University of Michigan’s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, told Michigan Advance. 
Some data centers utilize a closed-loop system, Kleinman said, which uses less water and does not return the water to the source. However, she said those facilities tend to use more energy.
Although water and energy are receiving the most attention, Kleinman said there are also concerns about light pollution and noise pollution from fans and generators at the facilities. 










Are the products that they’re running – the sort of generative AI general use kinds of tools like ChatGPT – are those serving a purpose in society? Those start to become big questions, but when you think about the trade offs, I think they’re worth asking.

Air pollution is also an issue, with some facilities running diesel generators around the clock to ensure they have enough power, Kleinman said, noting this is often a concern in communities that are already facing environmental injustices.
Breanne Green, a community organizer with Livingston County Residents for Responsible Development, which opposes the development of a data center in Howell Township, said she first started reading about data centers while researching climbing energy rates.
“That’s when I really started to understand about the more ethical implications of using AI and how much water it uses,” Green said. 
While water and energy use are prime among her concerns, Green is also wary of the financial risks that come with bringing what is billed as a $9 billion investment into their small community. 
“We don’t know what happens when the AI bubble bursts. I know what it’s like to live in a community where one corporation supplies all of the income and then they go out of business. It’s devastating for a community, and I do not want that to happen here,” said Green, who grew up just outside of Flint as the child of two General Motors employees.

How are data centers regulated
When looking at the state’s current regulations on data centers, Katie Duckworth, a senior associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center pointed to requests from Michigan’s largest energy providers on how to handle the large energy demands stemming from these facilities. 
In the case of Consumers Energy, the state’s energy regulators approved the company’s request to modify its rate structure for energy intensive facilities like data centers to ensure these large energy-load customers do not shift their costs onto other ratepayers. 
However, DTE Energy took a different approach, asking the Michigan Public Service Commission to approve contracts to supply power to an Open AI data center planned in Saline Township. 
While the Commission’s order in the Consumers Energy case prioritized protections for other customers and emphasized that other residents and businesses should not have to shoulder the costs of providing power to data centers, Duckworth emphasized that this order only applies to Consumers Energy customers.
Ahead of a public hearing on the Michigan Public Service Commission’s long-term plan for energy reliability and affordability held in late October, the chair of the commission, Dan Scripps, told reporters that consumer concerns about data centers would likely be addressed on a utility by utility basis.

Although DTE has repeatedly asserted that the Saline Township project will not raise rates for customers, its argument that Michigan law bars them from shifting costs onto other ratepayers hinges on a technicality. 
Under the laws creating the sales and use tax exemption for data centers, facilities looking to receive the tax break are barred from accepting an energy rate that would require residential customers to subsidize the cost of providing energy to the facility.
But Duckworth said the devil is in the details. 
“That’s not necessarily the same as saying that DTE is not allowed to ever serve a customer in a way that is being subsidized by their ratepayers,” Duckworth said.
While the public service commission is taking the lead on regulating energy use from data centers, Duckworth said there’s a gap at the state level when it comes to regulating the water these facilities use for cooling.
Because these decisions are made at the local level, there’s less transparency and scrutiny around how much water these facilities are consuming, Duckworth said.
“One of the things that I think would be really valuable in any legislation, would be a lot of required transparency around environmental and other impacts,” Kleinman said.
How does this impact Michigan’s energy goals?
Alongside concerns on how large-scale data centers will impact Michigan residents in the present, several environmental organizations and energy consumer advocacy groups have warned that these facilities could also pose a threat to Michigan’s goal of requiring energy providers to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040. 
The issue extends beyond Michigan, as energy demand from data centers within the U.S. outpaces growth from renewable energy. As a result, energy companies are keeping fossil fuel plants online longer than expected and reopening shuttered plants to ensure data centers have enough power, Kleinman said, which will continue to contribute to climate change.
During a roundtable discussing concerns with DTE’s proposed contracts for the Saline Township data center, Charlotte Jameson, the chief policy officer for the Michigan Environmental Council, explained that while the state must rely on renewable energy sources like wind and solar to meet its goals, utilities often rush to build natural gas plants when significant new energy demand is added to the grid.

While natural gas plants are included in the state’s legal definition of clean energy systems, they must utilize 90% effective carbon capture and storage technology. However, the Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis has questioned the effectiveness of the technology,  and warned that it could increase carbon dioxide emissions.
Additionally, a policy brief from U of M’s Ford School created in partnership with the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition warns that data centers have derailed energy goals in other states.
There are ways to ensure that increased energy demand from data centers does not jeopardize the state’s energy goals, Duckworth said, but it will take scrutiny from the Michigan Public Service Commission.

Michael Craig, an associate professor in the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability and the Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, said extending the lifespan of fossil fuel plants and building new ones is ultimately a coordination, time scale and willingness problem.
“There’s no physical reason, no engineering reason, why a data center is any different than more homes being built in Michigan, right?” Craig said. “We would not be having this conversation if people were gradually moving into Michigan and increasing our demand over time. That demand is no different than the demand at the data center, really, from the state perspective, except the size of the data center demand is way larger, and it’s concentrated in one place.”
There are many options on how utilities can help meet the demand from these facilities, including renewables, Craig said. Data centers could also supply their own renewable energy generation alongside their facility, addressing the increase for demand, Craig said. 
“It takes time to build power plants, so if you don’t build them before you bring that data center online, the energy has to come from somewhere,” Craig said. “So you need a certain long term perspective, so that when you want a data center to come online, you have the energy from renewables available coming online to provide it.”

However, when it comes to meeting the state’s clean energy standard, data centers are not a fundamental game changer at the moment, Craig said.
“There was already lots of load growth that people were aware of. These data centers are another source.” Craig said. “The estimates are so wide nobody knows how much demand growth is actually going to happen from data centers as a whole.”
As more energy demand is placed on the system, more renewables will be needed, and the more clean energy buildout there is, the more difficult it could be to build more, Craig said, noting potential issues with community pushback and energy transmission. However, that doesn’t mean the state needs to scrap its policy and try something new. 
“You’re still going to have to work with communities, still deal with resistance and find solutions that work for everybody, still deal with transmission congestion, still deal with scaling up the technology,” Craig said. “All these things are going to happen one way or the other.”
How can Michigan mitigate potential harm
When looking at concerns around data centers, Kleinman noted that these facilities are not new, and that at a smaller scale, they can operate without creating major disruptions. 
Part of the new problem stems from how large these facilities can be, and how energy hungry the computers can be, Kleinman said. In turn, she believes part of the answer is to ask whether the large scale of data center projects is necessary. 
“Are the products that they’re running – the sort of generative AI general use kinds of tools like ChatGPT – are those serving a purpose in society?” Kleinman said. “Those start to become big questions, but when you think about the trade offs, I think they’re worth asking.”

As far as how these facilities can minimize their impact, Kleinman pointed to requirements for data centers to supply their own energy from renewable sources.
In order to receive the tax break in Michigan, data centers must source 90% of its expected annual energy usage from clean energy sources through either on-site generation; a long-term contract with the electric utility, energy cooperative, or municipal utility serving the geographic area where the facility is located; or participating in a voluntary green energy pricing program. 
Another piece would be ensuring the cost of supplying energy to these facilities are not placed on ratepayers, Kleinman said, pointing to the Ford School policy brief, which offers additional recommendations including mandating energy audits, performance standards, renewable energy use and public reporting requirements to ensure a sustainable model for data center growth.
Duckworth said the Environmental Law and Policy Center would also like to see the state take a more proactive approach to clean and renewable energy as data centers come online.
“With the correct incentives and planning and requirements, it’s possible for data centers to be developed in the state while minimizing the environmental impacts and not jeopardizing Michigan’s clean energy goals.” Duckworth said. “But that will just require ensuring that the data centers are paying the full cost of their power needs, and that they’re being powered by the right mix of clean and renewable energy.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6816-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

Statewide, a little more than 2 million people cast ballots, a turnout of 39% of Washington’s registered voters, according to statewide figures. Five counties — Columbia, Garfield, Jefferson, San Juan and Wahkiakum — exceeded 50% participation.
In the most high-profile and expensive legislative contest, Democratic state Sen. Deb Krishnadasan beat Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier in the 26th District that spans parts of Pierce and Kitsap counties.
Nearly $4 million was spent in the race, viewed as Republicans’ best opportunity to gain a seat in the Senate, where Democrats hold a 30-19 advantage. 
A duel between two Democratic candidates in the 33rd District incited the most intrigue as Rep. Edwin Obras defeated Kevin Schilling after trailing on election night. Obras edged in front of Schilling, who is mayor of Burien, on the third day of ballot counting and wound up winning the south King County district by nearly 6%.
The other seven lawmakers who won were Sens. Victoria Hunt (5th district), Vandana Slatter (48th district), Tina Orwall (33rd district), and Emily Alvarado (34th district), and Reps. Janice Zahn (41st district), Osman Salahuddin (48th district), and Brianna Thomas (34th district).
Meanwhile, voters overwhelmingly approved the lone statewide ballot measure, Senate Joint Resolution 8201. It amends the state constitution to allow the state to make stock market investments with payroll taxes collected for Washington’s new long-term care program.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Three years to the day after a preliminary injunction first paused parts of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban for a limited group of Hoosiers with religious objections, a Marion County court heard final arguments Tuesday over whether the law violates the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
Superior Court Judge Christina Klineman presided over the summary judgement hearing on Tuesday in Indianapolis but her ruling is still at least two months away.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana represented the plaintiff class, while the Indiana Attorney General’s Office defended the state’s medical licensing board and other defendants.
The underlying lawsuit, filed in September 2022, claims that Indian’s abortion ban imposes a substantial burden on the religious practice of a particular group of plaintiffs whose faiths permit or even require abortion under circumstances broader than those allowed by the statute.
The abortion law, which was enacted in a special 2022 session, only allows for exceptions in the case of a mother’s health, rape or incest, or a fatal fetal anomaly — though each with varying time limits.
Indiana Court of Appeals affirms RFRA-based abortion ban challenge

The ACLU asked the court to convert a preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction protecting the remaining individual plaintiffs — currently two anonymous women of different faiths — and the certified class, Hoosier Jews for Choice, ensuring that the state cannot enforce the abortion ban against them in ways that conflict with their sincerely held religious beliefs.
“There is a direct conflict between the state’s law and plaintiffs’ religious beliefs,” said attorney Stevie Pactor. “The law forces them to carry pregnancies that their faith teaches could be terminated.”
The state, meanwhile, argued that the plaintiffs have not shown any concrete example of an individual attempting to obtain an abortion for religious reasons and being denied under the law.
The existing preliminary injunction — issued Dec. 2, 2022 — applies only to the plaintiff class and prevents the state from enforcing the ban against those individuals in ways that conflict with their religious beliefs. 
It does not block the abortion law statewide, however, and it also does not require providers to perform abortions.
The attorney general’s office also noted that no one has come forward during the last three years to obtain an abortion for religious purposes under the injunction, and even if they had, doctors would not have been permitted to perform one because they are not covered by the injunction.
“Despite three years of litigation, the plaintiffs have not identified a single instance under (the abortion ban) which one of them — or the thousands of class members they sai Solicitor General James Barta, representing the defendants. “They haven’t even identified the precise circumstances under which that might occur.”
‘Forced’ to act against faith
Central to the ACLU’s argument is that Indiana’s abortion statute violates RFRA by banning abortions even in cases when their clients’ sincerely held religious beliefs require them.
In written filings, ACLU lawyers stressed that the law imposes criminal penalties and medical risks on those acting according to their faith, and that the state has not demonstrated the ban is the least restrictive means of pursuing any compelling interest.
Pactor emphasized that the law imposes an “exceedingly straightforward” burden on the religious rights of the women and organizations represented in the case.

“The individual plaintiffs are unnamed women of multiple faiths whose beliefs require them to obtain abortions in situations not allowed by the virtual ban on abortions,” Pactor noted.
She said that has forced many to “change their behavior to avoid pregnancies that they will not be able to terminate, even when compelled to do so by their religious beliefs.”
Pactor emphasized, too, that both the trial court and the Indiana Court of Appeals have already recognized abortion as a protected religious exercise under RFRA.
“The state must show that the ban meets the most stringent form of legal analysis — strict scrutiny — to survive,” she said.
The state has argued a compelling interest in enforcing the ban — “protecting the unborn” — and that the ban is the last restrictive way to further that interest. But the appeals court agreed with the trial court in 2024 that the state hadn’t successfully established either.
“While the Court of Appeals certainly recognized that the government has a permissible interest in protecting prenatal life, it explicitly rejected that this interest was compelling as to the plaintiffs in this case under RFRA,” Pactor said.
“The state simply cannot, and has not, adequately explained this differential treatment,” she continued, referring to the law’s secular exceptions “that allow abortions in certain cases but deny religious exemptions.”
The ACLU has maintained that refusing religious exceptions, while allowing secular ones, is unconstitutional discrimination. 
“The state simply cannot meet its burden under strict scrutiny to justify offering some exemptions for non-religious reasons, and refusing to offer the same exemption for those whose religions require them,” Pactor told the court.
AG holds the law is ‘neutral’
But Barta argued that the abortion ban is a “neutral” law that applies equally to all Hoosiers and does not single out religious beliefs.
“RFRA does not allow individuals to opt out of neutral, generally applicable laws,” Barta said. “Nothing in the statute gives plaintiffs a religious veto over a law that applies to everyone.”
James Barta, solicitor general at the Indiana Attorney General’s Office (Photo from IN.gov)
He further insisted that the state’s interest in protecting prenatal life is “no less compelling than other interests courts have found compelling, such as protecting bald eagles, ensuring the payment of taxes, or protecting other symbols of the nation.”
Barta said the exceptions baked into the abortion ban are not meant to privilege or target religious versus non-religious reasons. He additionally held that those exceptions are not “gaping holes,” either.
He referenced statewide data showing that abortions have “fallen dramatically” from about 2,300 in the first quarter of 2022 to only 28 in the first quarter of 2025.
Barta said that sharp drop demonstrates that the exceptions are narrowly tailored and not undermining the state’s overarching goal of protecting prenatal life. Thus, he argued, the existence of those exceptions does not mean the law lacks a compelling interest or is not the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.
“The plaintiffs’ response to this has been to say that the state can’t make ‘secular exceptions’ while denying religious exceptions. But that’s not what the state has done,” Barta said. “These exceptions do not say people of religious faith, or people who have no religious faith, get abortions, while the others do not. The exceptions are equally open to all.”
Judge to weigh arguments
Later in the hearing, Klineman pressed both parties on how RFRA’s substantial burden test should apply, which requires courts to determine whether the law places a meaningful constraint on religious exercise, not just a theoretical one.
“If the law forces someone to act contrary to their religious beliefs at risk of criminal prosecution, why isn’t that a substantial burden?” she asked.
Barta responded that the statute itself provides all the mechanisms for enforcement and inquiry and that the plaintiffs can’t outsource those duties to private parties, such as physicians.
The judge also questioned the ACLU on the limits of relief, asking how the court could administer exemptions “without effectively creating individualized abortion standards.”
Pactor replied that the injunction is narrowly tailored to the plaintiffs and the certified class, ensuring their religious exercise is protected without requiring courts to rewrite the statute or impose obligations on other Hoosiers.

(Getty Images)This past June and July, my family’s electricity bill jumped by more than 30% compared to last year. I know we’re not alone. Hoosiers everywhere are seeing higher electric bills — and unless we change course, they’ll keep climbing. Cost pressures are pushing from multiple places.
For decades, Indiana saw little growth in electricity demand, and investment in utilities stagnated. The result is a grid that hasn’t kept pace with our needs. Meanwhile, severe storms are hitting more often, and hotter summers mean higher demand for cooling. Utilities will need to spend more just to maintain reliability, let alone improve it.
On top of that, new gas pipeline proposals and rapid price inflation for natural gas turbines, the machines that turn gas into electricity, are raising costs. For example, GridLab reports that the price of a new combined-cycle gas turbine has nearly doubled to $2,000 per kilowatt. That expense will land on someone’s bill.
Indiana energy secretary blasts local moratoriums, calls energy development ‘patriotic’ task

But the biggest pressure of all comes from the explosive growth of artificial intelligence and the data centers needed to run it. By 2035, AI-driven data centers are expected to add the electricity demand equivalent or greater than building a second Indianapolis, a second Fort Wayne, a second Gary, and a second Evansville combined.
Take the planned data center campus in New Carlisle for example. It alone is projected to use 2.2 gigawatts of power — almost 10% of Indiana’s entire current electricity demand. 
Lawmakers and economic-development officials see data centers as a fast track to economic growth. But in this race to attract them, we’re ignoring an essential truth: in every race, there are winners and losers.
Even Wall Street is voicing concern as many analysts are warning of a looming data center bubble. According to The Center for Public Enterprise’s Bubble or Nothing report, some major developers are building data centers using circular financing — borrowing from one another while depending on one another’s cash flows — and betting that AI profits will justify these risky financial relationships. But as we learned when the dot-com bubble, even transformational technologies aren’t always profitable and can collapse under unsustainable economics.
So let’s imagine what would happen if AI profits don’t materialize as hoped, data center companies will falter, and operators shut down. The massive, custom-built electric and water infrastructure serving them, paid for in part by ratepayers, becomes underused or abandoned. Those costs don’t disappear; they shift to households and businesses.
And the power plants built to serve these centers, especially large gas plants, could become stranded assets, leaving Hoosiers to pay for billions in infrastructure that no longer has customers. Meanwhile, communities that approved these projects would be left with empty shells of data centers designed for a single purpose and unusable for anything else.
Where to go from here
While this picture is bleak, it is also avoidable. Indiana has the opportunity to benefit from economic growth related to AI, strengthen our grid, and improve our utility cost structure. How?
First, Indiana should repeal the data-center sales-tax exemption. Adopted in 2019, it was crafted for modest data centers, not today’s behemoths. Right now, the state forgoes about $5 million each year in electricity sales tax for just one 100-megawatt facility. Scale that to 5 gigawatts of projected data-center growth, and Indiana could lose $250 million annually in revenue. Restoring this tax would cool speculative development and provide a stable new funding stream for our state.
Second, we must require large data centers to operate flexibly. Our grid is built around meeting peak demand — the most extreme hours of usage each year. If data centers run full-tilt during those peak moments, they could trigger billions in new spending on generation and transmission. But if they reduce demand during key hours, Indiana can avoid new peaks altogether.
And flexibility isn’t only for giant companies. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission is writing new rules for distributed energy resources — everything from smart thermostats to batteries to EV chargers. These resources can shift demand, cut bills, and relieve stress on the grid. When deployed at scale, they help integrate more affordable clean energy, reduce costs for everyone, and reduce harmful environmental impacts that come with new fossil fuel generation.
Third, data-center developers must be transparent with the communities they hope to join. Local governments should require enforceable commitments before granting zoning approvals. That includes long-term power-purchase commitments that shield other ratepayers from unforeseen challenges; developer-funded infrastructure upgrades; cleaner backup-power options rather than fleets of diesel generators; and strong protections for local water resources, including avoiding groundwater withdrawals for cooling.

These expectations are reasonable, practical, and essential to safeguarding communities.
Hoosiers deserve honest conversations about the risks and rewards of data-center expansion. Utilities, local officials, and state leaders must fully understand what’s at stake — not just for economic development, but for affordability, reliability, and environmental stewardship.
Electricity prices are rising from every direction. If Indiana rushes headlong into unchecked data-center development, we risk burdening families and businesses with higher bills, strained infrastructure, and stranded assets. The tech giants sprinting to build these facilities understand that not everyone will win this race.
Indiana shouldn’t sprint blindly alongside them. Instead, we must chart our own course — one that protects ratepayers, strengthens our grid, and safeguards our natural resources.
Hoosiers value responsibility, fairness, and foresight. Now is the time to apply those values to the energy decisions that will shape Indiana for generations.

Both came from religious families. Lee’s father was a pastor and Herrington’s grandfather the founder of a church in Grenada. 
Both were hard workers. Lee was known for organizing supply drives, and Herrington operated his own moving company. He would later use the company’s box truck to transport Lee’s body to a rural dumping ground near his parent’s home. 
Both were young Black men who had just graduated from the University of Mississippi. Some of Lee’s final Instagram posts before he went missing on July 8, 2022, were of photos taken at his graduation; same for Herrington weeks before his arrest.
But there was a crucial difference between the two men, said Braylyn Johnson, a friend of Lee’s who also knew Herrington from college: Before the murder, Lee lived authentically and proudly as a gay man and Herrington did not.

“Jay Lee and Tim were identical in their education, their achievements, their family, their church life,” she said “They were a lot alike. … Jay Lee trusted Tim. He saw something in Tim. I’m not sure what it was, but he trusted him.” 
Herrington first went to trial for Lee’s murder in 2024, before detectives had located Lee’s remains. During that first trial, the state’s theory of the case was that Herrington killed Lee to preserve the secret of their sexual relationship. Lee had gone to Herrington’s apartment the night before he went missing, and they’d had a fight, prosecutors alleged. 
Only one living person knows exactly what happened in the apartment that night – Herrington. He pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder and tampering with evidence.

Aafram Sellers, a Jackson-area defense attorney who became counsel for Herrington after the first trial, said he had spoken with Herrington about taking responsibility and grieving the life that he, at 25 years old, might’ve otherwise had. 
Gwen Agho, a Hinds County prosecutor brought onto the case by Lafayette County District Attorney Ben Creekmore, also wanted people to know that Lee lived his life openly and Herrington did not. 
“What’s done in the darkness will always come to light,” she said. “All of this happened to cover something up and everyone found out anyway.” 
Indeed, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen said one of the Carroll County deputies who found Lee’s remains earlier this year told him that it was as if the sun shined down on a gold nameplate necklace bearing Lee’s name – the first sign they had finally found him years after he went missing. 
“They were just digging and looking and a piece led to a piece led to a piece,” he said. “They didn’t stop.”

At a press conference after the sentencing, McCutchen said his force spared no resources and didn’t stop looking for Lee until officers found him. 
“This case highlights everything special about policing, and each one of you should feel like a hero today,” he said. 
Lee’s mother Stephanie Lee cried as she thanked the Oxford Police Department and the prosecutors for their work securing justice in the case and finding her son. She said McCutchen told her this was not an ordinary case for him. 
“OPD has been faithful from day one,” she said. 
A queer, young Black man, Lee falls into a demographic of people whom, when they become victims of violence, police have long been scrutinized for disregarding. 
But McCutchen said his force treated the case as if Lee was their own missing child. He choked up while recalling the moment when, one month into the search for Lee, a detective’s wife asked if he would take a break to get dinner. 
“The detective responded, ‘If that was our kid missing, would you want that detective to take a break and be with his family, or spend every moment trying to find our child?’” McCutchen said. “To which that wife responded, ‘Don’t you come home until you find him.’”

McCutchen said the police fought for Lee’s phone records, they scoured for security camera footage across Lafayette and Grenada counties, and they worked with state and federal law enforcement to scope out Herrington’s cellphone – then searched every possible place they believed he might have dug a grave. 
“This was not just another homicide,” he said. “This case became our life.” 
But all the technology in the world did not find Lee. During Herrington’s first trial, the absence of a body proved a hiccup in the case, and was partly to blame for the hung jury, a TV news outlet reported.
Instead, detectives found Lee’s remains by chance in rural Carroll County, after a property owner whose land is used as a dumping ground reported he’d found a skull wrapped in duct tape and a blanket. 
“You cannot in a hundred years convince me otherwise that God did not have a hand in Carroll County when that property owner called the Carroll County Sheriff’s Department and said, ‘I think I have human remains,’” Creekmore said. 
For as much effort as McCutchen says his force expended, the Oxford police faced community pressure, too: From a small but mighty group of Lee’s friends who used social media to organize a movement in Oxford called Justice for Jay Lee. 
Its members have come and gone from the transient college town, but two of Lee’s close friends powering the group saw the case to its end – Johnson and Jose Reyes, who performed drag alongside Lee as a fellow member of Oxford’s LGBTQ+ community.

“We’ve watched people transition these past three years, we’ve watched queer couples meet each other in Justice for Jay Lee and get married and graduate,” Johnson said. 
Johnson and Reyes kept the town’s and the media’s attention on their friend through colorful Instagram posts displaying a count of the days Lee had been missing. Their advocacy for Lee pushed the police to acknowledge the fear his disappearance had incited in Oxford’s LGBTQ+ community. 
Reyes summed up their role in the case in two words: “Accountability and awareness.” 
The two view Justice for Jay Lee’s role now as carrying on Lee’s legacy. Before his death, Lee was preparing to begin a graduate degree in social work. His friends have been trying to establish a scholarship at the University of Mississippi in Lee’s honor, because Johnson said that higher education was important to him. 
“Jay Lee was raised with love,” she said. “He didn’t go through the world thinking that people were going to do him wrong. Jay Lee went through the world very optimistic and with a loving outlook and part of me thinks he tried to share that with Tim.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02163004/20251202_JayLeeTrial_4509.jpg,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

Last year, voters enshrined the right to abortion in the state constitution. The GOP-dominated legislature responded six months later by voting to put a new constitutional amendment on the ballot that would reimpose an abortion ban. 
Proponents of abortion rights filed a lawsuit in July arguing that the summary of the proposed abortion ban amendment that will appear on ballots was intentionally deceptive because it failed to state the amendment would repeal the abortion rights amendment. A Cole County judge agreed, in part, and ordered Secretary of State Denny Hoskins to rewrite it. 
On his second attempt, Hoskins crafted a summary that Judge Daniel Green deemed “fair and sufficient.”

But attorneys representing Dr. Anna Fitz-James — who submitted the language for the reproductive rights initiative petition in 2023 — believe Green was too hasty in giving the language the OK, arguing the current language “fails to tell voters that a right is being eliminated and replaced with fewer rights.”
They filed an appeal of Green’s ruling, which will be argued before the Western District Court of Appeals Wednesday afternoon in Kansas City. 
The Missouri Attorney General’s Office, which is representing Hoskins, said the court doesn’t need to determine if the current ballot language is the best wording possible, “but whether it gives the voter a sufficient idea of what the proposed amendment would accomplish.”
The ballot language reads:
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:



Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Repeal Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest;’
and Prohibit sex-change procedures for children?”



If approved by a majority of voters, the abortion ban amendment would be slightly less restrictive than the near-total ban implemented in June 2022. Unlike the prior ban, it would allow abortions for survivors or rape or incest up to 12 weeks gestation, though it is not clear if or how a survivor would need to prove the assault in order to receive medical care. 
All other abortions would be banned, aside from cases of medical emergencies.
Attorneys Chuck Hatfield and Tori Schafer, in briefings to the court of appeals on behalf of Fitz-James, argue the proposed amendment is a “mess” and violates a statute that prevents ballot measures from encompassing more than one subject. They are asking the higher court to remove the amendment from the ballot or re-write the summary.
The crux of the issue, they say, is that gender-affirming health care is separate from reproductive health care. Including a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, they say, “logrolls” two unrelated subjects to make the amendment more popular. Gender-affirming health care for minors is currently banned in Missouri, though a challenge to the law is before the state supreme court. 
The attorney general’s office on behalf of Hoskins said Fitz-James’ interpretation of the single subject rule is too narrow. Gender-affirming health care, they contend, includes “procedures that frequently render children sterile.” 
Fitz-James’ attorneys said assuming gender-affirming surgeries always involve reproductive organs is flawed.
“A wide variety of surgeries accomplish that purpose — from breast augmentation to hair reconstruction—that never implicate a reproductive organ,” they wrote. 
Judge approves ballot language for amendment reinstating Missouri abortion ban

Fitz-James’ attorneys argue the current wording “obscures” the fact that the proposed amendment would ban most abortions by making it sounds as if the abortion rights it keeps in place would be new, rather than rights that are already protected.  
Most voters, they argue, will have no idea what Article 1, Section 36 of the Missouri Constitution is. 
“The words ‘approved in 2024’ are similarly devoid of context or meaning,” Fitz-James’ attorneys wrote in court filings. “Approved by whom? Some random bureaucrat? The legislature? Good Housekeeping? The voter is left to wonder.”
The attorney general’s office argues Missourians should be given more credit when they show up to the polls.
“Voters are certainly intelligent enough to know that ‘random bureaucrat[s]’ and ‘Good Housekeeping’ do not approve constitutional amendments,” the attorney general’s office wrote.
Court filings briefly delved into the use of a semi-colon in the fourth bullet point, with attorneys for Fitz-James lambasting its misuse while the attorney general’s office called on grammar gurus Strunk and White to defend the punctuation. 
However the court of appeals rules, the case will almost certainly end up in hands of the Missouri Supreme Court.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_abortionaccess2-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

He teaches at Kenrick-Glennon Seminary, our families are here and we’ve made a lot of friends who have welcomed us in and treated us like family.
In recent years, one of those families, along with another we befriended at a previous place of employment,  have both gone through tremendous difficulties as the prices of critical medical treatments have skyrocketed. One family has a son with Type 1 diabetes; the other has a daughter with allergy problems. Both families have had to revamp their budgets — in the first case, simply to keep their child alive, and in the second to forestall possible worst-case scenarios.
None of this is a surprise when Big Pharma has put profits ahead of people for decades. Even recent news that some weight-loss treatments may become more affordable can’t hide how expensive medicine is in America.
For example, the EpiPen that cost $100 in 2007 was over $600 in 2017, and prices continue to rise. Weight loss drug Ozempic went from roughly $675 in 2017 to almost $1,000 today — with a 50% reduction if you can pay in cash. Insulin costs have nearly tripled since the early 2000s. Even common antibiotics and asthma inhalers now come with shocking price tags.
EpiPens, insulin and many other critical drugs and medications are not optional for families. They are everyday essentials for quality of life and even to just stay alive.
Our friends whose child experiences anaphylaxis from contact with certain allergens need her to have an EpiPen 24/7. At current prices, their family budget revolves around the cost of these life-saving devices.
For the friends whose child has Type 1 diabetes, every refill of insulin means cutting corners — cheaper meals, waiting for car repairs and reducing holiday spending even if it impacts family traditions.
I understand that pharmaceutical companies need to make a profit. Research and development takes time, expertise and risk, and companies have to somehow incentivize those who make it all happen.
But the profit motive goes too far when it comes at the expense of human life.
With most things that we buy, like gas, groceries, and clothes, there are plenty of options for people with different levels of income and desires. The same isn’t true for pharmaceutical companies that provide critical and rare medications. My friends have to pay what the company decides, unless their insurance company can somehow negotiate the price down.
And it’s not as though Big Pharma behaves like a cash-strapped industry frantically trying to find the next life-saving cure. The industry is the biggest lobby in Washington and is generating hundreds of billions of dollars annually with plenty of cash for investor stock buybacks. The digital and television ads seem endless.
If Big Pharma can spend billions convincing us that we should buy its products, surely it can afford to put people ahead of profits, especially since Americans a) provide tens of billions of tax dollars to Pharma’s research and development, b) pay multiples of what other countries pay and c) are one of the only targets of Pharma ads in the world (among high-income nations, only New Zealand also allows unrestricted direct-to-consumer advertising).
Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley has proposed a bill that could make a difference, advocating for tariffs that will pressure pharmaceutical companies to finally put Americans first. He’s also introduced bipartisan legislation to rein in drug prices. Whether or not you agree with these solutions, it’s good that Missouri has a senator trying to make the system work for ordinary people.
It also shows that this issue doesn’t belong to one party or ideology. High drug prices hurt Democrats, Republicans and independents alike. They harm people who live in cities and on farms, young families and retirees and especially the sick.
Medicine should heal — not bankrupt — the people it’s meant to help. It’s time for both parties to show the same level of commitment to families as these companies show to their shareholders.

(Photo by Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)A Senate panel advanced legislation this week that would add new steps for state agencies enacting regulations and would grant immense power to individuals seeking to block the readoption of expiring rules.
The Senate’s state government committee on Monday unanimously approved a bill that would require cost-benefit analyses of all proposed regulations, a proposed move that elicited cheers from the business community and criticism from environmentalists and other critics.
“This is not a pro-business bill. It’s not an anti-environment bill. This is a good government bill. This is about broadening the process so that as much information is brought to the regulators as possible before a rule is put out there so we have the best possible result,” said Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
The bill would create a 12-member commission staffed mostly by a governor’s cabinet members and task it with reviewing all regulations and certain executive orders issued in the state to see whether their costs outweigh their benefits.
If the panel finds a regulation or executive order would burden state businesses, workers, or local governments, the bill requires it to recommend how the policy ought to be changed or whether it should be repealed.
The commission would be required to hold its public comment process parallel and independent of the process agencies are already required to follow when proposing and enacting new regulations.
Opponents said they fear the bill, called S4373 and sponsored by Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), does too little to require the commission to consider the benefits of some rules. They cautioned that the cost-benefit analysis might exclude economic losses averted by, for example, stricter flood rules.
“No serious economist would ever evaluate only one side of the ledger, but S4373 forces state agencies to focus on costs rather than benefits,” said Lindsey Kayman, membership chair of the New Jersey Environmental Lobby.
Other critics likened it to the Department of Government Efficiency, a federal cost-cutting program once headed by Elon Musk that made broad federal cuts but failed to produce meaningful savings.

The commission’s recommendations would be non-binding and have no force of law, meaning a governor or administrative agency could ignore them.
The Senate committee’s vote came as regulators weigh two major rules proposals that have drawn opposition from business groups.
One set to be adopted in January would place new requirements on construction in Jersey Shore areas and expand the state’s flood plains, among other things. The other would enshrine in regulation the Department of Labor’s interpretation of a test to measure whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee entitled to benefits.
The bill advanced Monday would give immense power to a single person to blunt existing regulations that are set to expire, including people who live outside of New Jersey.
Existing law allows state agencies to extend expiring regulations for up to seven years. The bill would require agencies to take public comment on those extensions, and a single comment in opposition would force regulators to restart the rulemaking process anew. That process can take a year or more.
“What we’re going to have is a government that, instead of becoming more efficient, becomes less efficient, becomes less able to enact the mandates that have been set out by this Legislature,” said Peter Chen, a senior policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective.
Chen added that another provision requiring agencies to use the “best available science” could open the door to lawsuits by litigants who disagree on what science is best.
Proponents said the bill could give new means to oppose regulations.
“Unless an impacted entity is going to challenge a rule or regulation, agencies are free to just dismiss comments, not respond, and not be robust about them,” said Nicholas Kikis, vice president of legislative and regulatory affairs at the New Jersey Apartment Association. “So, this really puts more teeth in ensuring the process is followed.”
Under existing law that the bill would not change, the governor can, with the recommendation of one of their cabinet heads, extend expiring regulations indefinitely.
Other changes would allow agencies to make substantial changes to regulations when adopting them if the changes “are a logical outgrowth” of the proposed regulation. Presently, state law requires another period of public comment for proposed regulations that see major changes.
The bill, which has no Assembly companion, would also require state agencies to annually report how quickly they process permit applications, among some other things.

(Photo by Darren Hauck/Getty Images)Two environmental groups filed a petition late last month challenging the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources’ decision to grant a permit allowing a West Band dairy farm to operate as a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO). 
The dairy, Rob-n-Cin Farms, has been operating as a CAFO for several years without a permit. Under state law, CAFOs are required to obtain Wisconsin Pollution Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) permits, which regulate the pollution industrial activities such as factory farms are allowed to discharge into local waterways. 
CAFOs are industrial farming facilities with more than 1,000 animal units — one animal unit is equivalent to a 1,000-pound cow. Rob-n-Cin plans to expand its herd from 1,300 cows to 2,000. After expanding, the herd will produce more than 18 million gallons of manure every year which the farm plans to  spread on fields in Ozaukee and Washington counties. 
In 2023, the DNR investigated the farm for operating as an unpermitted CAFO and issued a notice of noncompliance against the farm. 
Since then, Rob-n-Cin has been going through the process to obtain a permit, drawing complaints from local residents and community groups. Those complaints include the farm’s failure to list two satellite locations where it plans to spread manure in its permit application, the lack of sanctions on the farm for operating unpermitted and the effect on local groundwater. 
Residents are worried about the farm’s effects on the Milwaukee River watershed and the Cedarburg Bog, which is protected as a state natural area and national natural landmark. 
On Nov. 26, the environmental-focused law firm Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a petition for a contested case review of the DNR’s permit approval on behalf of Milwaukee Riverkeeper and area residents. The residents include a nearby organic farm and neighbors of Rob-n-Cin. 
The petition alleges that the DNR has not proven the expansion will comply with the state’s groundwater quality standards, particularly the limits for phosphorus and nitrates. The permit includes statements that the farm will follow statewide best practices for manure spreading but the petition argues that’s not enough and the DNR should have done more to prove the groundwater will be protected.
“DNR’s issuance of a permit relying solely on standard practices that are not intended to ensure compliance with groundwater quality standards is unreasonable,” the petition states. “This is particularly true in an area of high susceptibility where many members of the public raised credible concerns of groundwater contamination and examples of excessive nitrate levels. Rob-n-Cin needed to demonstrate, and DNR needed to find, that issuance of a permit would not lead to continued or widespread groundwater contamination in excess of established standards. Simply relying on default nutrient management practices without performing analysis or investigation was unreasonable.” 
The petition also argues the DNR should require monitoring of the local groundwater after the expansion is complete, stating that state regulators can’t know if the farm is violating its standards if it isn’t tracking how the expansion affects the groundwater. 
And the petition states that the DNR did not complete a sufficient environmental review before approving the permit. 
“DNR conducted no substantive evaluation of environmental or socioeconomic impacts of the WPDES permit, including effects on groundwater, Cedar Creek, Mole Creek (a Class II trout stream), the Milwaukee River watershed, which is subject to an EPA-approved [Total Maximum Daily Load] for nutrients and sediment, or the Cedarburg Bog,” the petition states. 
In a news release, MEA attorney Adam Voskuil said the DNR’s authority requires it to prove that the expansion won’t violate state water standards and it has failed to do so. 
“State law is clear that the DNR is required to affirmatively determine — not merely assume — that Rob-n-Cin’s manure-spreading plan will not violate groundwater quality standards. Without off-site groundwater monitoring, there’s simply no way to obtain the data necessary to make that determination,” Voskuil said.
If the petition for a contested case hearing is granted, a hearing on the permit approval will be held by an administrative law judge. That decision would be appealable to the state circuit court system.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — While state leaders, the business community and political candidates intensify their focus on improving Oklahoma public education, complaints have grown among teachers that they should have a more prominent role in those policy discussions.
“I’ve been begging people for years, for years, to ask actual teachers, ‘What do you need? What do you think would make these improvements?’” longtime Oklahoma public school teacher Jami Cole said. “We know what would do it, but we’re never asked. We’re just passed over for people who have more influence and power than what we have.”
Education, particularly reading proficiency, is primed to be a top legislative issue over the coming year, with the Oklahoma State Chamber and new state Superintendent Lindel Fields already suggesting policy changes. Student literacy has emerged as a priority issue in the 2026 governor’s race, as well.
Two weeks ago, the State Chamber announced a platform of literacy-focused policies that would have struggling readers repeat a grade. Fields, who said improving reading levels is among his top priorities, floated the idea of adding days to Oklahoma’s minimum school year length, which currently sits at 181 days or 1,086 hours. 
Both ideas have generated debate and opposition from educators, particularly among the 64,000-member Oklahoma Edvocates Facebook group, which Cole administers. Educators in the group have contended the suggestion of grade repetition and a longer school year are a sign that teachers aren’t consulted often enough in education policy conversations.
Cole said she opposes both ideas and sees a different set of needs from within her second-grade classroom. She has 23 students of widely varying education levels, she said, ranging from advanced to bordering on needing special education services.
More teaching aides, tutors and reading interventionists paired with smaller class sizes and properly trained teachers “is where the focus has to be” for state policymakers, Cole said.
“There’s so much going on in my classroom right now that I just have such a hard time with someone who has never been in the realm of teaching or education saying, ‘Oh, we just need to do this,’” she said.
The State Chamber’s plan, known as “Oklahoma Competes,” proposes a greater investment in reading coaches to assist teachers and more training in the phonics-based science of reading, along with retaining struggling readers.

The chamber announced its education plan at its State of Business Forum with endorsements from business leaders and Republican lawmakers, but not educators. 
However, when developing “Oklahoma Competes,” the chamber sought input from classroom teachers, reading specialists, literacy coaches, superintendents, higher-education experts and school leaders across the state, President and CEO Chad Warmington said in a statement. 
He said the chamber’s role is “not to dictate classroom practice, but to support the people who do this work every day.” 
“Teachers are the frontline of this effort, and any meaningful policy solution has to reflect their experience and earn their buy-in,” Warmington said. 
However, teachers still “don’t feel like they’re being heard,” said Tori Luster Pennington, president of the Oklahoma City American Federation of Teachers union, which collectively bargains on behalf of teachers in Oklahoma City Public Schools.
More interest from different groups, like the chamber, in improving education is a positive thing, she said. But her union members, who see the day-to-day realities within public schools, have given a very different list of solutions.

They cited a need for more support for students’ mental and behavioral health, she said. Chronic absenteeism also remains a persistent issue.
“Since COVID, even though we’re not in that same time, there’s still so many lingering effects of kids just not being ready and just not having the support that they need,” Pennington said. “So, we really just need more support and more engagement and helping those issues and those behaviors, and we really have to start there before we can add (school) days.”
Fields said his remarks on lengthening the school year weren’t a formal proposal, but rather a “very preliminary discussion” made during a TV interview. He said he had little dialogue with educators about the idea before floating it.
But, he’s since invited teachers to complete an educator survey to share their thoughts on a longer school year and to contribute other ideas for improving academic outcomes. The survey received nearly 4,000 responses after a week, Fields wrote in a Nov. 24 letter to teachers.
Fields said he intends to follow that up with visits to schools, education groups and teacher meetings with the goal of having open communication with teachers as he leads the Oklahoma State Department of Education. 
Former state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ combative and polarizing brand of politics frayed the relationship between the agency and many educators. After Walters resigned on Sept. 30 to lead an anti-teacher-union nonprofit, Fields, a longtime CareerTech center leader, came in with a different approach, one focused on repairing those ties. 
“I want to visit with teachers, hear from teachers, hear their hearts and what’s on their minds,” he told reporters after an Oklahoma State Board of Education meeting Nov. 20.

State leaders should consult teachers or risk losing valuable feedback, said Rep. John Waldron, D-Tulsa. 
Waldron is a former public high school teacher elected to office amid a groundswell of support for public education in 2018.
“If teachers aren’t part of the discussion, you’re not going to get to hear from teachers who have seen what a third-grade retention test does to 8 year olds,” he said. “And if you talk about adding 15 days to the school year at a time when teacher burnout is at historic highs, then yeah, you’re not going to develop a policy that makes more people want to be teachers or stay teachers.”

Some households face service shutoffs, in part, due to a delay in the program caused by the federal government shutdown.
The post Feds resume low-income heating help in Wyoming days after temps plunge appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration has resumed a heating assistance program for low-income households, days after much of Wyoming saw temperatures plunge into the single digits.
The Wyoming Low Income Energy Assistance Program rebooted on Monday after a 45-day pause due to the federal government shutdown. The shutdown ended Nov. 12. Nevertheless, an appropriation for the federal program wasn’t released until Friday. Wyoming received $9.6 million, according to Wyoming LIEAP, allowing assistance payments to resume immediately, officials announced.
“With the restoration of federal funding, the LIEAP team has begun notifying applicants whether they are eligible to receive benefits and, if eligible, the amount of the benefit,” Wyoming LIEAP said in a press release.
Though the program, managed by the Wyoming Department of Family Services, was forced to idle payouts in mid-October, state officials still urged people to submit applications during the pause so staff could determine eligibility and quickly resume processing disbursements. The agency received and reviewed about 4,000 applications during that time, in addition to about 1,100 before the shutdown impacted the program.

Wyoming LIEAP distributed $6.1 million to 8,236 Wyoming households last winter season, according to the agency.
The program helps pay “a portion of winter heating bills for natural gas, electricity, propane, coal, wood and other fuel types” for households earning less than 60% of the state’s median income, which was about $75,000 in 2024. Priority is given to elderly and disabled residents, and families with children under 5 years old. 
Payments on behalf of qualifying households typically begin on Nov. 1 each year, and the program continues through early spring. Delays this year, however, left some in the cold and facing utility service shutoffs for unpaid bills, according to Wyoming 211 Executive Director Ann Clement.
“We mostly hear from our callers that many are unable to make any payment arrangements to avoid shutoff,” Clement told WyoFile. People with medical issues “are being disconnected, lots of broken furnaces and no resources to assist with repair or replacement,” she said. “Things just start to pile up.”

Another energy assistance program, Energy Share of Wyoming, began accepting applications Monday. The nonprofit organization, comprised of several utility and energy companies, serves as a backup “when unusual circumstances create financial needs not met through existing energy assistance programs,” according to the group. Energy Share raised $108,000 in private and corporate donations to help 236 Wyoming households last winter. “Total distributions for energy bill and propane bill assistance totaled $75,422.58,” the group said.
This year, Energy Share shifted its qualifying threshold upward to consider higher household incomes, casting a wider net for those who might qualify.
While the average residential cost of electricity in Wyoming remains lower than the U.S. average, customers here are experiencing a national trend of rising monthly utility bills. Wyoming homes experienced a year-over-year increase of about 4% in August, according to a report by the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources, compared to a national average increase of 6%.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)It is heartening to learn two paired Republican-led congressional committees have determined to scrutinize the merciless killing of two “stragglers” who survived the aerial attack on their small boat, suspected of running drugs, only then killed on direct orders from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth – for no military purpose.
As virtually every person (except Hegseth?) who has served in the U.S. military knows, the killing of stragglers in combat is prohibited by the Uniform Code of Military Justice as well as the Geneva Convention – and President Trump has declared we are on a war-footing against South American drug cartels.
The Senate and House Armed Services Committees also seek to determine the legality of the 20-and-counting attacks on suspected drug-running, née fishing boats.
Montana’s junior senator, Tim Sheehy, is a member of the Senate committee. As a graduate of the Naval Academy and combat service as an elite SEAL, we can expect him to participate fully.
Now that these two committees have found the backbone to assert their Constitutional prerogative to question the Trump administration, it is time for other committees – and members of Congress – to do likewise.
They should start by deciding whether it is in America’s best interests to watch Ukraine be subsumed by Vladimir Putin’s Russia or to determine that the country is vital to U.S. interests and that the secretive Steve Witkoff-Jared Kushner-Kirill Dmitriev machinations give the dictator everything he wants. 
While Americans turned to holiday football games after their Thanksgiving  feasts, Putin showed his true intentions by pounding Ukraine civilians with dozens of missiles and hundreds of drones over 10 long hours. Mind you, civilian targets in the capital city of Kyiv, not military. Such is Putin’s war.
Pure and simple, Putin wants to re-create the empire known as the Soviet Union and bring its 15 former “republics” back into the fold after they became more-or-less independent when the USSR dissolved in 1991. Putin is an unapologetic Stalinist who is taking advantage of Trump’s hunt for a Nobel Peace Prize by playing along.
In addition to Sheehy’s leadership role on the Armed Services Committee, two of our other congressmen are in roles one would think might influence their interests and actions:

Our senior U.S. senator, Steve Daines, serves on the Foreign Relations Committee where he is chair of the Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation.
Ryan Zinke of Montana’s First Congressional District serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Even with the reported U.S. financial dealings being dangled in front of Putin in Trump’s transactional, “me-oriented” diplomacy, the cost of Putin’s war is not high enough for him to be dissuaded from his ultimate goal. His KGB history and actions are testimony to his ruthlessness.
Congress has considerable Constitutional authority to question foreign policy set by the president and to influence it through the power of the purse. It is heartening to see these two Armed Services Committees exercising their responsibilities. It is up to senators and representatives to convene them, not the president.
Ukraine as a free country is vital to U.S. and European interests – indeed, to the entire free world. It’s time to stop working around the edges in a misguided effort to woo a despotic dictator to the peace table.
The similarities between Ukraine today and appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938 are frighteningly similar. 
The U.S. knows what Ukraine needs to hold back the modern-day Red Army. Is Congress and our Montana delegation willing to participate in appeasement?

The one-time Senate hopeful is on social media blitz. But it’s unclear what office he’s actually gunning for, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post What’s the deal with Reid Rasner? appeared first on WyoFile .","You can’t swing a dead cat in the Big Empty these days without hitting an advertisement or social media post by Reid Rasner, extolling his own virtues as the savior of all things Wyoming. The dude is forking out some serious cash to grab our attention. What’s he up to?

Opinion

Rasner’s glitzy media blitz has the distinctive aroma of a political campaign, not just a sales pitch for a stock jockey, but he hasn’t announced for any elective office. Whenever I see someone exert this much effort to gain name recognition and Cowboy State trail cred for no apparent reason, my bullshit detector kicks into overdrive. I become curious and suspicious.
Because I honestly can’t calculate why Rasner is spending all this money, I ran my rumor trapline from Pine Bluff to Evanston and from Baggs to Big Horn. Nobody could enlighten me; they’re all as mystified as I am. What’s the deal with Reid Rasner?
So, not wanting to get ahead of the lead horse, I called Rasner on Friday and left a voicemail that I have a question or two, and informed him that my deadline is Monday evening around happy hour. As of deadline, all I’ve heard is crickets from Rasner.
Without hearing from the horse’s mouth, we are left with a bit of history, what is heard on the sagebrush telegraph and what has been the public record.
Here’s a bit of political history. Rasner ran for a seat on the Las Vegas City Council in 2017. The Sin City council is widely regarded as a springboard to statewide political office in Wyoming, but alas, he collected only 74 votes in that race.
That experience prepared Rasner for the drubbing that he endured when he unsuccessfully tried to primary Sen. John Barrasso in 2024. That lesson only cost him a million bucks and change. Strike two.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

On Rasner’s Facebook page, he self-identifies as a politician, but, for the life of me, I can’t think of a significant office in Wyoming that he has a snowball’s chance in hell of winning. Rep. Harriet Hageman will likely defend her seat in Congress, and Chuck Gray will probably run for re-election as secretary of state, since neither relishes the prospect of butting heads with state Sen. Eric Barlow in a contest for governor.
And all three aforementioned names would squash Rasner like a bug if he tested their political prowess at the polls.
Here’s a thought. Rasner could run for Wyoming treasurer and, if he could somehow pull off a political miracle, he would have enough ready cash at his fingertips to buy TikTok. Rasner drew a lot of attention when he announced plans to buy the social media app, and in March said the Trump administration was “very interested” in his bid. Four months later, he announced a pause on the deal. But he’d have to beat Curt Meier at the ballot box.
It certainly appears as if Rasner is no lightweight, though. He sued former state Sen. Anthony “Romeo” Bouchard for defamation when Bouchard accused Rasner of sexual misconduct while working as a drama teacher at Casper College. Rasner said he was a student, not a teacher, and that he did not sexually abuse anyone. The judicial outcome of that soap opera is pending, and popcorn futures are up to the limit in anticipation.
So we are left to examine chicken entrails, read smoke signals and follow Rasner’s footprints in the dust as we try to figure out what is going on in his noggin.
His ads and Facebook page have the look of expensive Madison Avenue media pros, so it’s not like he’s nickel-and-diming his dream, or cobbling things together in Mom’s basement.
Rasner’s media extravaganza smacks of uber-MAGA orthodoxy, Honor Wyoming outrage, Project 2025 faux patriotism and folksy Freedom Caucus populism, but where is it pointed? If he’s not running for office, he’s spending a wagonload of cash to do nothing more than raise political consciousness in Wyoming. I am on record testifying that a “raised consciousness” and seven bucks will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks.
As far as ego-driven, snake-oil sales pitches go, I’ve seen ‘em all. But if I’m understanding the citizens of Wyoming correctly, they’ve already had a bellyful of snake oil forced on them in recent years and are weary of the taste.
If Rasner lacks the transparency to tell his friends and neighbors why he is going through all these contortions to promote himself, he will remain nothing more than a noisy bobble-head doll trying to hijack our attention when we have other, more pressing chores.
And we’ll be left with the annoying unanswered question, “What’s the deal with Reid Rasner?”

A letter by the Idaho Sheriffs’ Association is the latest in a string of concerns over cuts by a state Medicaid contractor that stem from the state’s attempts to avoid a projected budget shortfall.
Idaho Medicaid contractor to cut critical services for people with severe mental illness

The contractor that runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits, Magellan of Idaho, plans to cut specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine settings starting Monday. It isn’t immediately clear whether the cuts are already in effect. 
In a Monday letter to Gov. Brad Little and Republican leaders in the Idaho Legislature, Idaho Sheriffs’ Association President Samuel Hulse urged elected officials to recognize and address the situation. He called the state’s budget situation “self-inflicted.”
“We acknowledge the State’s budget challenges which are self-inflicted by an overly aggressive tax reduction stance of the Legislative Branch and a complicit Executive Branch continuing to reduce tax revenue creating a budget shortage,” Hulse, who also serves as Bonneville County sheriff, wrote. 
“These reductions to mental health services represent a significant public-safety concern,” he continued. “As sheriffs, our foremost duty is to protect the people of Idaho. We urge State leadership to recognize the real-world public-safety consequences of these decisions and to work with counties to ensure Idahoans in crisis — and the agencies who respond to them — are not left without support.”
The state’s projected budget deficit is coming after the Legislature and Little approved $450 million in tax cuts during the 2025 legislative session, following years of income tax cuts that have reduced the state’s revenue by $4 billion, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Magellan and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare could not be immediately reached for comment.

The Idaho Sheriffs’ Association echoed concerns by some mental health providers, warning that the cuts could worsen mental health crises, shifting costs onto jails, emergency medical services and local taxpayers “who will bear the operational and financial burden of managing the consequences.” 
On Monday, Magellan also announced more cuts to Idaho Medicaid mental health services that will start Jan. 1. The cuts include:

Blocking providers from billing for skills training and development groups for adults starting Jan. 1 in some cases, except for people age 17 and younger and adults who are receiving the early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment benefit. 
Requiring more frequent prior authorization for two services: adult intensive outpatient services, and adult skills-building/community-based rehabilitative services. All adults receiving the adults skill-building/community-based rehabilitative services will need prior authorization. 

Jason Coombs, founder of Brick House Recovery, a substance abuse treatment center in Boise and Idaho Falls, told the Idaho Capital Sun in a statement the cuts could limit care access in Idaho.
“These reductions across multiple levels of care raise serious concerns about our ability to adequately serve one of Idaho’s most vulnerable populations,” he said. “While I initially understood the need for greater accountability and some level of tightening within the system, the cumulative impact of these changes may unintentionally limit access to essential mental-health and substance-use treatment.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)MEMPHIS — The alert went out to volunteers at about 8 p.m. on a Friday: a woman hiding in a closet with her twin toddlers was on the phone to a community hotline unsure what to do as dozens of federal and local law enforcement officers converged outside, demanding entry.
Yuleiny Escobar, a volunteer for Vecindarios 901, which operates the hotline, hustled over to the woman’s home, located in the same heavily Latino Berclair neighborhood as her own.
A tow truck driver blocked the road leading to the house at the request of law enforcement, blared the pro-police anthem, “Bad Boys.” By the time Escobar reached the home, a Border Patrol officer and a U.S. Marshal each held a toddler in one arm as their mother was placed inside an unmarked SUV. Holes in the home’s windows marked entry points for chemical agents that had been thrown inside to force the family out, neighbors told Escobar.

Escobar pulled out her phone and began recording.
“These are scenes people need to see, as a reflection of our state and our country right now,” Escobar said.
Thousands of Memphians now rely on the videos, photos and eyewitness reports by volunteers with Vencendarios 901 — V901 for short — to chronicle the activities of the Memphis Safe Task Force, the multi-agency law enforcement force launched Sept. 15 by President Donald Trump. 
V901 was established as a rapid response network to report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities during the first Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. In Trump’s second term, the all-volunteer V901 has kicked into high gear.
Seven years ago, V901 received three to five calls per day from Memphis residents reporting immigration enforcement activities to its hotline, said Hunter Demster, a longtime local activist who co-founded the effort seven years ago with Maria Oceja, a community organizer.
“Now we’re getting up to 140 calls a day,” he said. “The vast majority of calls are people scared to leave their houses or pulled over. But we’ve also pushed this number out at community events and, now, the average person sees something and calls us.”
Tracking the task force 
V901 dispatchers answer calls while volunteers drive two-hour patrol shifts to confirm reported Task Force actions before they are sent out as text blasts and social media posts. The information serves both as a warning to avoid locations with a heavy law enforcement presence and an ongoing documentation of Task Force activity. 
About 100 people a month have attended V901 volunteer training since the Task Force launched, Demster said. The group is diverse, but Demster said he has noticed more older white women and individuals motivated by their religious faith have turned out to help in recent months.

Hundreds of videos and photos posted by volunteers to the group’s Instagram and Facebook pages have captured traffic stops, forcible home entries and arrests that have taken place since September. 
V901 volunteers continue to stay in touch with families impacted by an arrest, linking them to counseling, food pantries, legal assistance and help navigating the online Immigration and Customs Enforcement locator system to track detained loved ones and add money to their inmate accounts, Demster said.
Volunteers are also trained to try to obtain car keys after traffic stops to ensure vehicles get to family members instead of being towed by private companies that typically refuse to release a car to anyone who is not the registered owner.
The day after the mother with toddlers was detained was her twins’ birthday, Demster said. V901 volunteers bought them presents. Their mother was later released with an ankle monitor and reunited with her children, he said. The woman’s 16-year-old niece, driven home from the laundromat by a family friend in a car that law enforcement pursued to the home that night, remains in ICE custody and is subject to deportation, he said.

Task Force targets Hispanic neighborhoods
On a different Friday night, just before Thanksgiving, Demster and fellow volunteer Lucii Chambless took a shift driving the streets of the Berclair neighborhood watching for signs of Task Force activity. 
A half dozen members of the Tennessee National Guard strolled up and down a sidewalk in front of a busy Kroger store on Summer Avenue, the main commercial route through the Berclair neighborhood. Guard personnel lingered in front of a van parked in an empty lot in the hip and artsy Cooper-Young neighborhood. In neither location would Guard personnel respond to questions about their assignment, referring questions to a public information officer.
The National Guard, whose presence in the city is being challenged in court by the Shelby County mayor and other elected Democrats, typically serves in a support role, Demster said. 
Task Force law enforcement actions follow a pattern that distinguishes them from other police work, Demster said.
Task Force stops typically are initiated by Memphis police, state troopers and Shelby County Sheriff deputies, while Homeland Security Investigations and ICE officers either ride along with them or follow in unmarked dark-colored vehicles. 
Task Force traffic stops that Demster has observed have included up to ten unmarked vehicles driven by federal agents identifiable by their uniforms.

Most of the stops reported by V901 volunteers appear to be aimed at drivers in two of Memphis’ biggest Hispanic neighborhoods: Hickory Hill and Berclair, he said. 
The Memphis Safe Task Force has made over 3,100 arrests, 1900 of them for nonviolent offences, and initiated more than 35,000 traffic stops since Oct. 1, according to a dashboard maintained by the city that has received community pushback for its lack of detail.
The data made public by the city and U.S. Marshal’s office, which spearheads the task force, does not include the locations of arrests or demographic data on individuals arrested. Task Force officials initially reported immigration arrest numbers but have since stopped providing that data. 
In the absence of data, Demster said V901 volunteers said they have witnessed immigration arrests as a key priority.
“They may say this isn’t strictly an ICE operation, but when you flood the two largest Hispanic communities in the city, we see it’s an ICE operation under the false pretenses of we’re here to stop violent criminals,” he said.

Climate change is one of the top threats to vulnerable species around the world, driving widespread losses of plants and animals that can’t adapt fast enough. But at the same time, rising temperatures are in some cases opening the door for certain organisms that can thrive under these changes: invasive species.
From melting sea ice to longer growing seasons, global warming is unlocking new pathways for the spread and proliferation of certain non-native plants, animals, fungi and bacteria, according to a growing body of research. These new arrivals can wreak havoc on ecosystems and agricultural land, sometimes outcompeting native species and costing the global economy more than $400 billion in damages annually—including $21 billion in the United States alone, estimates suggest.
Despite these threats, the Trump administration has poked holes in invasive species research funding and mitigation efforts across the country in recent months. Scientists say this decrease in resources could have major long-term ecological and economic consequences.

Unintended hitchhikers
The rise of long-haul transportation and trade has made the world more connected than ever before. Unfortunately, the cars, trains, planes and boats that carry us, food and products can also pick up some unintended hitchhikers along the way in the form of seeds, insects, bacteria and even birds and mammals. Whether attaching to the bottom of a boat, stowing away in a cargo plane or even getting stuck on someone’s shoe, these species often incidentally travel from their ecosystem to new places where they can spread.
That’s exactly what happened with the spotted lanternfly, an insect from China that scientists believe made its way to the U.S. on a shipment of stone in 2012. Since then, the lanternflies have spread to at least 15 states across the Eastern U.S., reaching populations of up to 150,000 some years in Pennsylvania alone, The Guardian reports.
While these polka-dotted insects may look harmless, a 2019 study estimated that spotted lanternflies can cause $324 million in damages and cause the loss of 2,800 jobs by killing trees that are crucial for apple and wine production or support birds, bats and reptiles in the region. Similar destruction has followed as other invasive animal species spread across the world, from Burmese pythons in Florida to brown rats in New Zealand.


Invasive species already present in Louisiana include air potatoes, apple snails, Asian carp, Chinese tallow trees, citrus greening, emerald ash borers, feral hogs, giant salvinia, guava root knot nematodes and Mexican rice borers.

Many non-native species in the U.S. are plants, said Bethany Bradley, an invasive species expert at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The term “non-native” is used to describe organisms that do not naturally occur in an area and are introduced by human activities, but they are only classified as “invasive” if the species causes harm to the broader ecosystem, according to the National Park Service.
The reason that many invasive plants outcompete native ones is that they are fast-growing, produce numerous seeds and can better handle shifts in temperature or soil.
Once an invasive species is well-established, “basically, you end up with this introduced plant taking over an ecosystem,” Bradley said. She co-authored research published in 2023 that found certain common invasive plant species may be able to spread more rapidly under climate change in the Northeastern U.S. Though these states are currently unsuitable for certain invasive plant growth, rising temperatures could change that.
Some invasive plant species may be what’s known as a “sleeper,” which are “right on the edge of its tolerance, and so if it warms up a little bit more, maybe you transition from an established population to one that is actively invading,” Bradley said.
Silver lining: Her research also found that 62% of currently abundant invasive species will see a decrease in habitat for large populations in the Eastern U.S. under 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of warming. That being said, close to a third of global species overall will be at risk of extinction if temperatures rise by even 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a 2024 study.
Climate-fueled invasion
Other climate impacts could also drive the spread of invasive species, such as longer growing seasons or new shipping routes opening up as sea ice melts, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. On the flip side, invasive species can also exacerbate climate impacts.
For example, the deadly wildfire that tore through Lahaina in 2023 was made worse by the highly flammable, fast-growing, nonnative grasses introduced by farmers decades ago. Invasive grasses frequently fuel fires in the Western U.S.—and are typically the first to grow back after the fire, as well.
The most critical and least expensive stage to tackle invasions is when there is a small number of the species in a particular area, according to Sara Kuebbing, a researcher at the Yale School of the Environment.
“You need someone to identify, ‘Oh no, there’s something that we think is about to take off [and] it’s ready to spread’—and that usually happens,” she told me. “What fails is the institutions and the will a lot of times to contain it at that point.”
She pointed back to the spotted lanternfly, which would have required several states to come together at the early detection phase and dedicate the resources necessary to study how best to tackle the invasion and shut it down. This did not happen, as evidenced by the many spotted lanternflies I saw fluttering through the forest on a recent trip to upstate New York.
But governments are working to better collaborate on invasive species issues. In the Midwest, the U.S.-Canadian Great Lakes Fishery Commission has been working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control invasive sea lamprey populations in the Great Lakes, which span the Canadian border. A single one of these toothy, eel-like critters can eat 40 pounds of fish a year, so the commission targets the lamprey by spraying pesticide while they are still in the larval stage.
My colleague Anika Jane Beamer reported in February that the program was affected when the Trump administration laid off a large swath of USFWS employees, including several who worked with the commission, and enacted a travel ban and hiring freeze that delayed the remaining staff’s ability to carry out lamprey control measures.
She checked back in earlier today with Greg McClinchey, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. He said the team raised this issue with supportive members of Congress, got the changes reversed and have had no complications since then, but did lose about five weeks “before we got everything back on track.”
The team is not yet sure if the delay will result in more lamprey later this year.
“What we know for sure is we can’t have what happened in ’25 happen again in ’26,” McClinchey said.
Also in the Midwest, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum in May directing the administration to “expeditiously implement the most effective mechanisms, barriers and other measures” to keep invasive Asian carp out of the Great Lakes, a rare show of support for environmental projects by the administration. However, other invasive species projects have been hit hard by Trump administration actions.
Since 2012, the federally managed Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center, hosted at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, has worked to increase collaboration on invasive species management in the region. Bradley, who works in the center, helped create a regional network that has become a primary source for mapping invasive plant movement and sharing research on the subject across the region.
She said that states recently asked the center to develop a database of current and emerging invasive plants across the Northeast, but the project largely stalled after the Department of the Interior rejected a proposal for the university to continue hosting the center when it was up for a rebid in February. The Interior Department did not respond when I asked why the administration made this decision and if it will fund the invasive species work through a different mechanism.
Because of lapsed funding, graduate student researchers have been shifted to other projects or are focusing on teaching instead of research. Bradley isn’t sure when she’ll be able to prioritize the project again and is worried that she won’t have the resources to accept students in the future.
“It means that we’re just in this … zombie mode,” Bradley said. “Basically, we’re not dead, but we’re not alive, and it’s been a weird space. We’re still in this long waiting period of hoping that Congress’ support will ultimately be enough to convince the administration that this is a program that does good things.”

(Getty Images)The Trump administration’s plan to shift homeless services funds away from permanent housing programs toward transitional housing could cause more than 850 West Virginians to lose their housing, according to estimates by a national homelessness advocacy organization.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last month issued a notice of funding opportunity with major changes to its plan to distribute about $3.9 billion in funding for continuums of care, the local agencies that coordinate services and funding for homeless people. 
According to the notice, no more than 30% of the funding for next year can be used for permanent housing programs. In past years, as much as about 90% of continuums of care funding has gone to permanent housing.
In West Virginia, 858 people may lose their housing because of a loss of more than $7 million in funding for programs that provide permanent housing, according to the analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
Nationally, the changes could cause 170,000 people to lose their housing, advocates say. 
HUD has for years used a housing first approach, which prioritizes getting homeless people into housing with no prerequisites for treatment or other requirements and then offering voluntary supportive services like case management or mental health and substance abuse treatment.
Now, the Trump administration will prioritize projects with onsite substance use treatment, required service participation, those with sufficient treatment bed capacity and 24/detox or inpatient access, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The new guidance also prioritizes continuums of care in communities that have camping bans aimed at homeless people.
In a new release, HUD wrote that the notice “restores accountability to homelessness programs and promotes self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans.” 
In the past four years, the agency said, roughly 90% of the continuum of care funding supported the “failing Housing First ideology,” which it said “encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.”
“Our philosophy for addressing the homelessness crisis will now define success not by dollars spent or housing units filled, but by how many people achieve long-term self-sufficiency and recovery,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in the release. “We are stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values, and incentivized never-ending government dependency. These long-overdue reforms will promote independence and ensure we are supporting means-tested approaches to carry out the President’s mandate, connect Americans with the help they need, and make our cities and towns beautiful and safe.”
Traci Strickland, executive director of the Kanawha Valley Collective, said the continuum of care that covers Kanawha, Clay, Boone and Putnam counties, estimates the changes will lead to a loss of between 90 and 100 permanent supportive housing beds in those four West Virginia counties.
“It’s not just [that it will be] requirement based, it’s also going to be time limited,” Strickland said. “So the move from [permanent supportive housing] to transitional housing is a move from a continual program that can serve people as long as they need served to transitional housing, [which] has a 24-month cap on it.”
Permanent supportive housing targets people with the most barriers to housing, she said, including mental health and physical health needs. 
“We’ve had people that to some limit, you know they’re going to be in permanent supportive housing for a really long time because their disabilities are really severe,” she said.  
Permanent supportive housing also includes rental assistance, which people often need even if they no longer need supportive services, she said. That will be true even as the administration shifts toward transitional housing programs because a disproportionate number of people in West Virginia pay more than 50% of their income for housing, she said. 
“If someone’s in a program getting rental assistance, and that rental assistance stops, how are they going to afford their housing?” she said. “And to me, that’s a more pressing, important issue, because we can try to get support services in for people as well as we can, but we don’t have funding for all these people’s rental assistance. They pay a portion of their income. The program pays the rest. There’s nothing to make that up.”
Mark Phillips, CEO of Catholic Charities of West Virginia, the lead agency for the Northern Panhandle Continuum of Care, said that continuum of care would likely have been under the 30% limit for permanent housing programs anyway, but permanent supportive housing has been identified as a need in the area. 
“There are individuals here, particularly folks who are a little bit older or who have a disability, who need permanent supportive housing, and because that’s been deprioritized in this (order), it would be really difficult for us to make an argument that we’re going to build that in this area,” Phillips said.
Lawsuits challenge HUD changes
Last week, a coalition representing 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the changes to HUD funding, which they say “will lead to predictably disastrous results.’ West Virginia did not take part in the lawsuit. 
On Monday, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, National Alliance to End Homelessness and a coalition of local governments and nonprofit organizations, also sued HUD over the changes in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island.
In a news release, Renee M. Willis, CEO and president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said the order “represents a destructive departure from decades of homelessness policy, and will put an estimated 170,000 additional households into homelessness.
“These actions will destabilize communities across the country. CoC funding must prioritize evidence-based housing practices, housing stability, and local decision-making rather than undermine them,” she said. “The harm to families and individuals who rely on these programs will be irreversible and felt for generations to come. Federal policy should fuel stability — not contradict it.”
Timeline also raises concerns 
The timeline that continuums of care have to apply for funding is also a concern for agencies. 
As of Monday, the federal government had not released the official application for the funding, Strickland noted.
“We’re 16,17 days in and we still don’t know what the application looks like,” she said. “So we still don’t know what they’re going to be asking us for. We have the guidelines, but there’s a lot of specifics and details that we don’t know yet.”
This year, the notice of funding opportunity was released Nov. 13 and the application is due Jan. 14. 
HUD had been phasing funding of transitional housing programs over the past few years. The Kanawha Valley continuum of care has not had a HUD-funded transitional housing program since 2019, she said. 
“It’s really having agencies doing a 180-degree turn or creating an entire new program in 30 days,” she said. “So that is also a concern.”
Strickland said while the housing first model has been viewed as housing without requirements and services, to her, it’s a way to house the people with the most needs and barriers.
“It used to be that housing was the reward,” she said. “So if you need psychiatric meds and you take them, then you’re going to be rewarded with housing. Housing First was the opposite. You’re going to get housing because you are a human being that needs housing, and we’re going to work with you on your mental health needs or your substance use needs, or your physical health needs, or helping you get income, helping you get employment.”
Phillips said few transitional housing programs and treatment first programs exist in the Northern Panhandle and the rest of the state. There’s not a lot of time for agencies to adjust their programs in time for this funding cycle, he said.
“Our shelter in Morgantown does function a little like transitional housing, but we only have so many beds and we’re full already,” Phillips said. “So if money gets pulled out of a funding emergency shelter or whatever and toward transitional housing, we can’t respond immediately, because we can’t just add beds overnight. So to move toward developing processes like these, takes a little bit of time, and the timeline here is less than two months.”
It would be more effective to shift the funding away from permanent supportive housing and toward transitional programs over a number of years, he said. 
“We could argue whether we think that’s effective or not, but having a few years to transition would at least leave vulnerable individuals with a little bit of time for agencies to catch up,” he said. “But we don’t have that right now, so it’s going to be difficult.”

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA)The Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Native Ecosystems Council, and Council on Wildlife and Fish filed a federal lawsuit to protect habitat for three rare wildlife species — grizzly bears, lynx, and sage grouse — on the Continental Divide, just north of  Lemhi Pass, where Lewis and Clark first crossed the Continental Divide from present day Montana into present day Idaho.
This area provides a critical wildlife corridor connecting the greater Yellowstone ecosystem to the Northern Continental Divide and Bitterroot ecosystems in Montana and Idaho.
The challenged Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest action, called the “Selway-Saginaw” project, allows destructive logging, road-building, and burning activities across thousands of acres of public lands in this 66,884-acre or 104.5-square-mile project area in a critical wildlife corridor.
We are deeply disappointed that the government would authorize this destructive project on our public lands considering the number of court rulings that have found similar projects illegal because such projects violate a number of federal laws designed to protect threatened wildlife.
The project area is enormous. It is located about 16 miles west of Bannack, Montana, Montana’s first territorial capital, and calls for bulldozing 69.3 miles of new and rebuilt logging roads to enable logging and burning 9,138 acres or 14.28 square miles of prime wildlife habitat.
The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest recently pulled its decision for the Greenhorn project in the Gravelly Mountains when we filed a similar complaint. But the U.S. Forest Service is forcing us to sue them again to make them follow the law.
The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest is also violating its forest plan’s requirements prohibiting burning sagebrush within 18 kilometers of sage grouse leks. Yet the Forest Service concedes that “Burning would temporarily reduce sagebrush cover in some areas . . . ” And the Forest Service’s own maps show almost the entire project area is within 18 kilometers of dozens of sage grouse leks. The project area contains 1,590 acres of priority habitat and 1,235 acres of general habitat for sage grouse.
Grizzly bears have been documented in the Big Hole Landscape and are suspected to occur in the project area. Currently, about 41% of the project area provides secure habitat for grizzlies. The Selway-Saginaw Project will further reduce grizzly bear secure habitat by 834 acres. There is no scientific research that finds that maintaining secure habitat at less than 42% is sufficient to maintain grizzly bears. The effect of this project would be long-term, approximately 15 to 20 years keeping grizzly bears with cubs from successfully denning in the area.
At the same time the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks is trucking grizzly bears from the Northern Continental Divide ecosystem to the Yellowstone ecosystem for genetic connectivity.
Why not just follow the law, protect the grizzly corridor, and let grizzlies walk there on their own? This is an important corridor where grizzlies from Yellowstone could travel to breed with grizzlies from other isolated grizzly populations, and do it without trucks and for free.
Almost everyone wants grizzlies to recover and eventually be removed from the protection of the Endangered Species Act, but before this can happen we once again need one connected population of grizzlies in the Northern Rockies.
Yet the Forest Service is pushing ahead with this logging and burning project which the Forest Service own estimates say will cost taxpayers $555,000. Yet, at the same time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is spending millions trying to recover grizzly bears. This makes no sense and this project as a whole makes no sense and is illegal, which is why we are suing to stop it.

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Secretary of State's Office Facebook)  “It is hard to watch other states and cities across our nation leap toward socialism… Let’s keep our state moving forward by always rejecting the falsehoods sold by the radical left.” — Secretary of State Kris Warner, Facebook post November 5, 2025.
Although I should be accustomed to it, it is always disturbing when MAGA politicians go off halfcocked about socialism. Here are some of the “radical left” socialist programs that Warner must be complaining about:

Medicare
Medicaid
The Affordable Care Act
Social Security
SNAP (food stamps)
Meals on Wheels and Office of Aging services

Oh, these are not the programs he was referring to? Many of my friends would be insulted if I told them they and their families are dependent on liberal “socialist” programs. People have such short memories.
Every single one of these programs were once characterized by right wing politicians as a “socialist program.”  For example, let’s remember what Ronald Reagan said about Medicare before it was enacted: a) “From [Medicare] it’s a short step to all the rest of socialism;” b) ”Medicare will usher in federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country.”; and c) if Medicare is passed “we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it once was like in America when men were free.”
I’m a capitalist who spent decades as a high-level executive in corporate America, working in states like West Virginia. Yes, government on all levels is generally not efficient. However, it’s very effective in many areas. And, in some cases, it has proven to be more efficient than the private sector.
For example, Medicare overhead/marketing is 2% versus 12% for private insurance companies. In this instance, socialized health insurance is clearly more cost-effective than private insurance. We are simply being held back from Medicare for All by the health care industrial complex (insurance companies, providers, drug companies) that like things the way they are, with tens of millions of dollars in compensation to their CEOs. They say that universal coverage is unaffordable, but studies show differently. Canada and other democracies with universal health care all have per capita health expenditures a fraction of ours … with better results.
Traditional Medicare was clearly an expansion of government when enacted 50+ years ago, but it’s one that the public supports. Before Medicare, only about half of all seniors were covered by private insurance. Polls have shown that virtually no voters, even the MAGA folks, want to do away with it now.
Will Medicare for All cause our insurance system to fall apart as Trump said in his 2018 USA Today editorial? Numerous polls show support for Medicare for All, including one recently illustrating 59% in favor. That poll showed support was strong in every category of Americans — except the MAGA faithful. A Gallup poll used the words “universal coverage” and had the same result — 62% supportive. Even almost two-thirds of independents were in favor. Again, the MAGA people were the only ones opposed.
America is still free and capitalistic despite what Reagan said about Medicare prior to enactment. Likewise, the sort of rhetoric spouted by West Virginia Secretary of State Kris Warner is simply a way of scaring American voters away from expansion of domestic programs designed to help the less fortunate. Programs that wealthier people like Warner’s financial backers will pay for and therefore dislike.
I’ve used Medicare as an example, but I could use many others. Social conservatives like Warner have a bad habit of talking about the ills of “socialism.” However, I don’t hear them asking that we convert our government employees in our military into private mercenaries. And, when we have used military “contractors,” the expense to the U.S. has been much greater.
In the above Facebook post, Warner also stated, “Let’s always hold fast to our Christian conservative values that made our state the best to raise a family in the country.” Yet, the numbers tell a different story about the state and its needs for public program expansion. For example, West Virginia has the fourth highest poverty rate in the nation at 14%… and the second highest mortality rate. It also has the third highest incarceration rate and third lowest income.
Instead of preaching about Christian values, West Virginians would be better off if Warner practiced Christianity by supporting the “socialist” programs he criticizes. As the bible (Proverbs 14:31) states, “Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God.”

A girl reads a book in a school library. (Getty Images)The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) released data on the first year of annual literacy screenings this week, finding about 36% of 4K through third-grade students fell below the 25th percentile for reading.
Wisconsin Act 20, a 2023 law that made major changes to literacy education in the state, requires school districts to provide short literacy screenings to students as a way of identifying “at-risk” students. Students who scored below the 25th percentile on the reading screener are required under the law to receive a personal reading plan and additional support. Schools must report data on the screenings to the DPI, which is required to compile a report. 
The first annual report covers screenings done in the 2024-25 school year. 
The response rate to the reporting requirement was 98% with 428 out of 437 local education agencies submitting data.
State Superintendent Jill Underly said in a statement that the rate represents a strong commitment to the state’s literacy efforts, and that the report overall provides the state with a baseline.
“These data are critical in helping schools guide instruction and intervention — not to define a student’s potential,” Underly said. “School districts have already demonstrated their strong commitment to this effort, and I am encouraged by how fully they embraced the work from day one.” 
According to the report, 36.8% of Wisconsin students in 4K through the third grade — or 97,414 students — scored below the 25th percentile on their assessment of fundamental skills on universal screening assessments. 
The report also provides information on the number of students who have started receiving interventions. 
For students in 5K through third grade, a total of 86,228 students — or 40% of the total enrollment — began receiving interventions. Students in 4k are not required to have a personal reading plan.
The implementation of the law has been drawn out over the last couple of years. According to DPI, schools have also started receiving funding from the $50 million that was initially set aside in the 2023-25 state budget to help with professional development and training requirements as well as curriculum costs, but wasn’t released until the budget approved this year due to disagreements between lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers.
“With time and a sustained investment in strengthened classroom instruction and, as needed, additional reading support, we can move steadily toward our goal of making sure every Wisconsin child excels at reading by the end of third grade,” Underly said.
Sen. John Jagler (R-Watertown), who assisted with leading the law through the Legislature, said in the statement that the results show the depth of the issues that Wisconsin students are facing.
“This shows why this law was needed in the first place. Hopefully, education leaders will focus on getting these students the interventions they need,” Jagler said.

At the same time, wages for most workers have not kept up with growth in the economy since the 1970s. (Getty Images)Every poll tells us that affordability is the major concern facing hardworking Americans. Many are increasingly angry as they watch the cost of goods and services spike — from groceries to housing to medical care. At the same time, wages and incomes fail to keep up. 
What’s behind this cost-of-living crunch? And what will our leaders do about it?
There are two sides to affordability: how much things cost, and how many resources people have to buy them. Both are a problem.
First, many Americans rightly believe that the price of basic needs has gotten out of control. Inadequate public investment means higher out-of-pocket costs for everything from child and health care to higher education. Corporate monopolies and financial speculation in industries ranging from housing to meat production to retirement savings have made things more expensive. And now across-the-board tariffs put in place by the Trump administration are raising costs further.
At the same time, wages for most workers have not kept up with growth in the economy since the 1970s. Wage growth comes from how much power workers have to bargain with their employers. And as policies have intentionally weakened unions and other forms of worker leverage, wages have fallen behind.
Thankfully, there are actions that can be taken now at the state level to address the problem of affordability. As KyPolicy outlines in a new report, “Building a Kentucky Workers Can Afford,” there are dozens of state policies that would grow worker power and family incomes while addressing the costs of basic goods and services.
For example, the state could repeal harmful laws undermining unions (like so-called right-to-work), expand collective bargaining rights and restore prevailing wage and minimum wage laws so there are more living wage jobs. Kentucky could also offer two years of tuition-free public higher education, and fund programs that help young people enter apprenticeships for good union employment.
The state could make historic one-time and annual investments in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund to vastly expand the supply of houses and apartments. Kentucky can reinvest in public schools, helping kids succeed in life and families address child mental health and food costs while also giving teachers a real, much-needed raise. 
The legislature could also create a Resiliency Fund to make infrastructure investments that can withstand extreme weather and spiking energy costs, creating good construction jobs in the process. That effort could include employing vulnerable young adults in a Kentucky Colonel Corps where they do one year of living wage public service after high school.
And the state could support families, including by enacting a child tax credit allowance that lifts 20% of kids out of poverty; providing paid family leave, universal preschool and affordable child care; and creating more options to make health insurance affordable using the state’s purchasing and regulatory power to crack down on corporate profiteering. Kentucky could also join 20 states that help put a secure retirement in reach by creating a state-managed retirement option for employees of all businesses and expand public investment in high-quality home care as our population ages.
Many of the ideas in the report build on successes in Kentucky’s past or policies that are proven to work in other states. And we can pay for this agenda from its economic benefits and savings and by balancing the tax code so that those at the top chip in for the investments that benefit us all. The richest 5% of Kentuckians are now pocketing $3.4 billion more a year because of state and federal tax cuts over the last decade. A windfall tax on those at the top could easily fund the ideas described above.
Affordability will be the political word of the year in 2026. Will it have real actions behind it?",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/housing-market-1024x685.jpeg,,,2025-12-03 05:58:34.457305

Wes Moore, and Mayor Muriel Bowser join other officials in signing the revised Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)“We have a shared future here, and if we don’t address that shared future in a collaborative way, every single one of us will lose,” Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer said Tuesday in Baltimore, where Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other regional representatives enacted a new, 15-year agreement to reduce pollution, build habitats, and protect the Chesapeake Bay.
The Bay is part of a network of over 180,000 miles of streams, creeks, and rivers and is the largest estuary in the country. The states surrounding the 64,000 square mile watershed have been working for decades to clean up the water, combat climate change impacts, and make the water more accessible. The Bay is the common denominator between the localities, which have unique environmental needs but a singular objective when it comes to the Bay, the officials acknowledged.
“But regardless of what separates us, we’re all united here with a common goal: protect the Bay, protect its history,  protect the people who are alive and rely on this for livelihood,” said Maryland’s Gov. Wes Moore. “Protect the chance that for each and every one of our future generations, they can have something that they can flourish in and enjoy.”
The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement was originally drafted in 1983 to bring the states surrounding the bay together to clean up the water and preserve critical habitats and wetlands. The last agreement was signed by Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, and Environmental Protection Agency officials in 2014. 
The 2025 agreement focuses on four main goals and has 21 outcomes the states can strive for over the next 15 years. 
Reducing pollution remains a key focus 
Part of the agreement requires states to reduce the amount of pollutants each allows into the Bay. 
The EPA established Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) in 2010, which calculated the amount of sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus reductions needed at that time to restore the bay to a healthy level. Since then, Virginia’s progress towards the goals has been mixed, with the state having met 49% of the nitrogen reductions, 64% for phosphorus, and 100% of sediment reductions. 
The TMDL is managed by the EPA and the maximum amounts allowed in the Bay will not be changed in the new agreement. It would take federal approval to put more enforcement behind the requirements.
Models by Chesapeake Progress, a tool that helps track states’ progress towards TMDL goals,  show that while Virignia has greatly reduced its phosphorus running off into the waterway, it is still the largest polluter of the surrounding states and the third largest for nitrogen.
Virginia’s progress
Virginia’s gains in reducing sediment and other harmful chemicals in the Bay has been largely thanks to efforts through the cost share program that allows producers to apply for grants to help them implement best practices that reduce the amount of runoff from their farms.
Virginia has made strong strides in sediment reduction, oyster reef growth, blue crab abundance, and many of the 31 outcomes and ten goals laid out by the agreement in 2014. The commonwealth is behind in its goals for wetland protection, aquatic vegetation, forest buffers, and climate adaptations.
“I think we’ve settled on a very good framework that sets 2040 as the next huge milestone date and yet provides intermediate checkpoints along the way,” Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said. “Checkpoints that hold ourselves accountable so that we will indeed see the kind of progress that we’ve made in the last four years continue.”
Tweaked language concerning climate
Unlike the 2014 agreement, which included a goal for the Bay “to withstand adverse impacts from changing environmental and climate conditions”, the 2025 agreement does not state the word “climate” once. It uses language like “changing environmental conditions” to describe the goals for wetlands, habitats, and healthy landscapes. 
When asked about this shift in messaging, Chesapeake Bay Commission Chair Sara Love said climate resiliency hasn’t been removed from the ultimate goals of the agreement.
“We are taking climate change and resiliency, not as a single goal, but taking it throughout every single goal, every single outcome. It is the lens through which we look at everything,” Love said. “So rather than actually taking it out, we’re spreading it throughout the entire agreement.”
More opportunities to invest in the Bay
This version of the agreement presents a broader scope of projects and waterways that can contribute to the restoration efforts. 
Chris Moore, Virginia executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said that the agreements’ efforts to have more direct connections between habitats, healthy landscapes, clean water and public education will help keep Virginia on track to meet the goals of the compact over the next 15 years.
“Virginia still is not investing, honestly, the resources that are peer states are when it comes to the Bay agreement, when it comes to education funding,” Moore said. ”So that’s obviously something right there that’s kind of directly out of the agreement that hopefully will come up during the General Assembly.”
With Tuesday’s singing, the governors also agreed to make recommendations for the best ways to bring the tribal nations of the Chesapeake Bay to the table for future discussions. Members of the seven federally recognized tribes in Virginia asked to be signatories on the agreement but were blocked by red tape.
The revised Bay agreement also includes new benchmarks for wetland restoration, crab, fish, and oyster population goals, and a promise to try and include more localities in the regional goals and outcomes of the agreement.
“I think this is a moment of hope and a moment of optimism for the Bay and for our respective states and the District of Columbia,” Shapiro said.

(Photo by Pixabay/Creative Commons license)Virginia lawmakers took another decisive step Tuesday toward launching a legal cannabis retail market in 2026, unveiling a revised legislative blueprint that scraps local opt-outs, tightens ownership rules and aims to favor small, independent operators over deep-pocketed national brands.
The Joint Commission on the Future of Cannabis Sales met for the final time before the General Assembly gavels in this January, capping months of hearings, stakeholder briefings and community meetings. 
After Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed last year’s bill, the commission’s revised framework attempts to salvage and overhaul earlier attempts — and to address what legislators described as persistent loopholes around consolidation, equity and uneven local control.
“Over the past few months, our commission has worked diligently to review existing law and develop a bill that will not only establish a much needed adult use retail market here in Virginia, but also reflect what Virginians want it to be,” said Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, the commission’s chair, who opened the two-hour meeting by thanking the room packed with industry players, farmers, faith leaders and public-health advocates. “And we’ve listened to you.”
Krizek made clear, however, that while the commission is aligned on many major components, the exact bill text remains under revision. 
“We are not actually unveiling the actual bill, because there’s still a lot of tweaking going on,” he said, adding that commissioners remain “100% on the same page” about the structure needed to launch retail sales by Nov. 1, 2026. 
“We’ve got some things that we still need to work on, and we’re going to continue to do so.”
 A long road from 2021 to a full retail market

Tuesday’s meeting reflected how close lawmakers now are to completing the work that began when Virginia legalized possession, home cultivation and limited personal sharing of cannabis in 2021. 
Even after that important step, lawmakers never finalized the second stage of legalization — the commercial framework — leaving Virginians able to legally possess marijuana but with no legal place to buy it. 
That gap spurred the growth of an unregulated market of vape shops, hemp-derived THC products and illicit storefronts that regulators and police say have outpaced the state’s ability to monitor them.
Lawmakers revived the effort after Youngkin rejected a previous retail legislation, pushing forward with a new commission structure and a set of goals centered on safety, equity and protecting small businesses. 
Krizek said the new draft reflects those priorities — and the need for a regulated marketplace with testing, labeling and age verification. 
“Our biggest concern has been public safety,” he said. “A regulated retail market will replace the illicit market.”
He said the legislation “builds a new market that supports hundreds of small businesses and strengthens Virginia agriculture, reduces the racial disparities created by the prohibition on marijuana, and, most importantly, protects public safety and health.”
 Local opt-outs removed — a defining policy shift

One of the most closely watched shifts is the removal of the local opt-out provision.
Local governments would no longer be able to ban cannabis retail through referenda. Krizek said the change was rooted in lessons learned from other states where patchwork rules allowed robust illicit markets to flourish in “dry” counties.
“The one big change is that we do not allow localities to opt out,” he said. “So there will not be any dry counties, like in the days of alcohol (prohibition).”
Local governments would still control zoning and could levy up to a 3.5% local cannabis tax, giving them flexibility to shape how sales operate in their jurisdictions.
The change drew immediate objections from socially conservative groups. 
“I think we’re extremely discouraged by the fact that we’re not going to have some type of local referendum,” said Todd Gathje of The Family Foundation. “(Localities) may not want this, and they should be able to let the citizens decide.” 
Gathje argued legalization would not curb illegal sales and cited national research showing illicit markets remain active.
Another major pillar of the proposal is preventing large multistate companies from dominating Virginia’s market. 
Taylor Mey, an attorney with the Division of Legislative Services, said the draft incorporates months of expert testimony and adjusts language from the previous vetoed bill.
“These proposed changes should be understood as changes to the statutory language that was in the bills last year,” Mey said, adding that stakeholder input shaped the revisions.
Under the new framework, the Cannabis Control Authority would have broad authority to review ownership deals and financial arrangements for signs of vertical integration or undue influence. 
All owners would be traced to their “ultimate beneficial” identity, transfers would require state approval, and no one could hold more than one Tier IV cultivation license. The CCA would publish a public registry of ownership and submit annual reports to the commission.
 Supporting small businesses through impact licenses

Krizek said equity and access remain central, describing a system designed to prioritize small operations over large corporate entrants. “Equity is not an afterthought though, it’s a foundation as well,” he said.
Under the proposal, microbusiness licenses are reframed as “impact licensees.” Applicants must meet at least four of seven race-neutral criteria tied to past criminalization, agricultural distress or geographic disadvantage. 
The license would allow limited cultivation, processing and direct-to-consumer sales, including delivery.
A temporary direct-to-consumer microbusiness track — capped at 100 — would allow qualifying hemp growers and processors to begin cultivating and selling cannabis earlier than full retail stores, beginning no sooner than Nov. 1, 2026. 
Krizek said the early access could help small operators establish themselves before larger retailers enter the market.
Rural leaders urged lawmakers to ensure those pathways remain inclusive. 
The Rev. William Avon Keen of Halifax County warned that production caps could sideline minority farmers, as happened historically in tobacco. 
“The limited licenses and the limitations may, in one area, cut out certain people to be in this business,” he said.
Speakers also pressed the commission to prioritize youth protections and enforcement. 
Cynthia Phillips of Danville said communities need more education about secondhand smoke and how cannabis use affects employment eligibility. “And the other one is services for those that become addicted to this product,” she said.
The Rev. Ricky Hailstock of Lynchburg urged lawmakers to address illegal vape and smoke shops that he said are selling unsafe and untested products to minors.
“I just ask the commission to consider … determining the legal limits on the amounts of the product that individuals could possess,” he added.
Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, said Virginia’s current $25 penalty for public consumption is too weak to deter smoking cannabis on sidewalks or near restaurants. 
“I think that’s much too lenient a penalty,” he said, adding that expanded inspections of vape shops could help uncover violations.
 Remaining disagreements and the road to January

Commission members signaled broad support for the overall structure but acknowledged continuing disagreements. 
“It’s kind of a mixed bag on this bill,” said Del. Buddy Fowler, R-Hanover. “There’s some things that I really like, and there’s some things there I really hate.”
Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, said the commission is still balancing “today’s political and economic realities” with the need to avoid strengthening the illicit market. “I think we have a little bit more work to do to achieve that balance,” she said. “Please keep your comments coming, we really do read every single one.”
Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, the commission’s co-chair, emphasized that the draft remains fluid. 
“You will hear support for some of those recommendations, and you will hear continued opposition,” she said. “They are simply recommendations that will continue to be fluid … through the legislative process.”
Advocates raised concerns about the timeline. 
Chelsea Hicks Wise of Marijuana Justice Virginia said the Cannabis Control Authority may not be staffed in time for a Nov. 1, 2026, retail launch. “If the micros and the hemp conversions are not ready … it would only be the medical folks that are there and able to sell,” she said.
Krizek reiterated the timeline: license applications on July 1, 2026, early microbusiness operations starting in September and the full market opening Nov. 1. “This is just a step in the process,” he said. “We continue to require your feedback.”
For the first time since legalization in 2021, lawmakers now have a clear path to a regulated market — and a proposal that Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger has vowed to sign into law following thorough review.

	The Trump administration, which has promised “radical transparency,” said in an FAQ that it plans to publish the “project summary” for states that win awards. Following the lead of federal regulators, many states are withholding their complete applications, and some have refused to release any details.
“Let’s be clear,” said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association. “The hospital CEOs, the clinic administrators, the community leaders: They’re going to want to know what their states are doing.” The NRHA’s members include struggling rural hospitals and clinics, which federal lawmakers promised would benefit from the Trump administration’s Rural Health Transformation Program.
Morgan said his members are interested in what states propose, which of their ideas are approved or rejected, and their budget narratives, which detail how the money could be spent.
Improving rural health care is an “insanely complicated and difficult task,” Morgan said.
The five-year Rural Health Transformation Program was approved by Congress in a law — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — that also drastically cuts Medicaid spending, on which rural providers heavily depend. It’s being watched closely because it’s a much-needed influx of funds — with a caveat from the Trump administration that the money be spent on transformational ideas, not just to prop up ailing rural hospitals.
The law says half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application. The rest will be distributed through a points-based system. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on each state’s rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that, in part, mirror the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” objectives.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly promised to open the government to the American people. His agency has a webpage devoted to “radical transparency.”
“We’re working to make this the most transparent HHS in its 70-year history,” Kennedy said in written testimony to lawmakers in September.
Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University, said HHS is “acting in a way that utterly lacks transparency” and that the public has the right to demand “greater openness and clarity.” Without transparency, the public cannot hold HHS accountable, he said.
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services spokesperson Catherine Howden said the agency will follow the federal regulations governing competitive grant materials when releasing information about the rural health program.
Grant applications are “not released to the public during the merit review process,” Howden said, adding, “The purpose of this policy is to protect the integrity of evaluations, applicant confidentiality, and the competitive nature of the process.”
Democrats and many health care advocates are concerned politics will affect how much money states get.
“I am very concerned about retaliation,” said Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.). Because Democrats control her state’s politics, “our application might not be as seriously considered as other states that have Republican leadership,” she added.
Illinois’ Democratic members of the U.S. House sent a letter to CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz in November asking for “full and fair consideration” of their state application. Illinois officials have not yet released their state’s proposal to KFF Health News, which has a pending public records request.
Heather Howard, a professor of the practice at Princeton University, said she is “pleasantly surprised at how transparent the states have been.”
Howard directs the university’s State Health and Value Strategies program, which is tracking the rural health fund, and praised most states for publicly posting their project summaries.
“To me, it speaks to the intense interest in this program,” Howard said. Her team, reviewing about two dozen state summaries, found themes including expansion of home-based and mobile services, increased use of technology, and workforce development initiatives like scholarships, signing bonuses, and child care assistance for high-demand positions.
“I think it’s exciting,” Howard said. “What’s great here is the experimentation we’re going to learn from.”
Telerobotics appeared in Georgia’s and Alabama’s applications, she said, including a proposal to use robotic equipment for remote ultrasounds.
Another theme that “warms my heart,” Howard said, was the effort among states to create advisory groups or committees, including in Idaho, where work groups are expected to focus on technology, workforce development, tribal collaboration, and behavioral health.
All 50 states submitted applications to federal regulators by the Nov. 5 deadline and awards will be announced by the end of the year, according to CMS.
As of late November, nearly 40 states had released their project narrative, the main part of the application, which describes proposed initiatives, according to KFF Health News tracking. More than a dozen states have also released their budget narratives.
A handful of states — Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina, and Wyoming — released all parts of the application.
KFF Health News filed public records requests for states’ complete applications. Some states have refused to release any of their application materials.
Nebraska, for example, rejected a public records request, saying its application materials are “proprietary or commercial information” that “would give advantage to business competitors.”
Kentucky shared its application summary but said the remainder of the application is a “preliminary draft” not subject to release under state laws.
Erika Engle, a spokesperson for Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, said the governor “is committed to transparency” but declined to share any of the state’s proposal.
Hawaii and other states are still processing formal public records requests.
The rural health program is part of the July law projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years.
Those cuts are expected to affect rural health facilities’ bottom lines, threatening their ability to stay open. A recent Commonwealth Fund report found that rural areas continue to lack access to primary care. But the guidelines for the rural health program say states can use only 15% of their new funding to pay providers for patient care.
Between the Medicaid cuts and funding boost from the new program, “there’s real opportunity for national policy to impact rural, both in the negative and the positive potentially,” said Celli Horstman, a senior research associate at the New York-based policy think tank who co-authored the report.
Among the publicly available rural health transformation proposals, Democratic-leaning states show support, or are willing to adopt, some of the administration’s goals but will lose out on points from eschewing others.
For example, New Mexico said it would introduce legislation requiring students to take the Presidential Fitness Test and physicians to complete continuing education courses on nutrition. But it won’t prevent people from using their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to buy “non-nutritious” foods such as soda and candy.
Many states want to invest in technology, including telehealth, cybersecurity, and remote patient monitoring equipment. Other themes include increasing access to healthy food, improving emergency services, preventing and managing chronic illnesses, and enlisting community health workers and paramedics for home visits.
Specific proposals include:

Arkansas wants to spend $5 million through its “FAITH” program — Faith-based Access, Interventions, Transportation, & Health — to enlist rural religious institutions to host education and preventive screening events. Congregations could also install walking circuits and fitness equipment.
Alaska, which historically relied on dogsled teams to bring medication to remote areas, is looking to test the use of “unmanned aerial systems” to speed up pharmacy deliveries to such communities.
Tennessee wants to increase access to healthy activities by spending money on parks, trails, and farmers markets.
Maryland wants to start mobile markets and install refrigerators and freezers to improve access to fresh, healthy food that often spoils in rural areas with few grocery stores.

State Sen. Stephen Meredith, a Republican who represents part of western Kentucky, said he still expects rural hospitals to close despite his state’s rural health transformation program.
“I think we’re treating symptoms without curing the disease,” he said after listening to a presentation on Kentucky’s proposal at a state committee meeting.
Morgan, whose organization represents rural hospitals likely to close, said the state’s ideas may sound good.
“You can craft a narrative that sounds wonderful,” he said. “But then translating the aspirational goals to a functioning program? That’s difficult.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)If Virginia’s election last month was more than an unleashing of anti-Trump sentiment (and it definitely was that), it was about affordability. Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger made the cost of living the focus of her campaign, frequently mentioning high energy bills. House Democrats, whose majority has been boosted by the addition of 13 new members of their party, are also expected to focus on these bread-and-butter issues. 
In Virginia, the cause of these high bills is not hard to identify: Data centers are driving up demand well beyond the available supply, and high fossil fuel prices are pinching a state that relies on natural gas for most of its electricity. Spanberger has committed to making data centers “pay their fair share,” and both she and legislators will be looking for other opportunities to lower costs.
With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

The bad news is that adding ever more data centers across Virginia means the upward pressure on electricity prices will continue. If the governor and legislators don’t want to kick tech companies to states with spare capacity, and if the administration of President Donald Trump continues to throttle the energy supply with its war on wind and solar, lowering energy costs in the near term likely isn’t possible. 
Even so, there is a lot that Spanberger and the General Assembly can do to protect residential consumers from these higher prices. 
Making data centers pay their fair share means more than tweaking rate structures. Several Virginia utilities have created special rate classes for large load users like data centers. The utilities will require data center operators to sign long-term contracts committing them to paying for a large percentage of the electricity and transmission they say they need, even if they don’t end up using that much or leave the Virginia market prematurely. 
These new tariffs can help protect other customers from some – though not all – of the risk involved in serving data centers, but they don’t address the “fair share” issue. The current allocation of transmission costs, with residential ratepayers picking up most of the tab for new lines that don’t benefit them, needs to change. If the SCC determines it doesn’t have authority to do that on its own, the General Assembly and Spanberger should pass legislation to make it happen. 
The harder problem is how to make residents whole for rate increases that result from data centers gobbling up all available power. The supply and demand problem has been compounded by a lot of bad decisions, with plenty of blame to go around. The federal government has driven up fossil fuel prices by allowing the export of increasing amounts of natural gas, while hindering and even blocking solar and offshore wind projects that could make up the deficit. 
Outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin is to blame for illegally pulling Virginia out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), removing the market incentive for Virginia utilities to increase investments in low-cost renewable energy instead of burning expensive fossil fuels. (His promotion of the false narrative that gas is “cheap” doesn’t help.)

Virginia utilities share the blame for relying too much on natural gas and high-priced electricity imported from other PJM states. And grid operator PJM is to blame for failing to approve enough new generation, including wind and solar facilities that make up the vast majority of projects waiting for approval to interconnect.
This history leaves Spanberger with a fine mess. Keeping prices in check now requires two things that can actually be accomplished during the next four years: a greater buildout of solar generation and energy storage to get more capacity on the grid; and investments in energy efficiency and rooftop solar to take pressure off the demand side.    
Solve utility solar siting with agrivoltaics. Virginia needs more energy, and solar is the only source that can be built quickly. Yet one of the knottiest problems confronting the General Assembly in the past few years has been the rise of anti-solar sentiment in rural counties. 
Landowners who want to lease their property for solar, or even to install arrays for their own use, find themselves stymied by opposition from neighbors who don’t like the look and are able to persuade county boards to deny permits. As we’ve seen, sometimes denial of a solar permit even follows approval of an energy-sucking data center.
Data centers approved, solar farms rejected: What is going on in rural Virginia?

Last year the General Assembly came close to passing a bill that would require solar developers to implement industry best practices. Passing legislation like that this year will address the legitimate concerns of localities around controlling erosion and maintaining native plant buffers. But more can be done to make solar look and function like a normal part of Virginia’s agricultural economy.
Already, solar facilities have become integrated with agriculture, as sheep and sometimes cattle take over vegetation management and farmers learn which crops do well growing between rows of solar arrays. It’s a trend that offers benefits to the land and the community alike. Farmers are struggling; solar can provide a stable income while protecting land from permanent development and putting much-needed energy on the grid. 
Businesses are ahead of public policy on this. Virginia-based Gray’s Lambscaping manages vegetation with over 800 sheep at solar farms across the state, and the company plans to grow to over 5,000 sheep by the end of this year. Meanwhile, solar panels have proven compatible with a wide range of food crops.  
Virginia should take a leading role in expanding agrivoltaics. Virginia law already recognizes the right to farm as an exception to localities’ authority over land use decisions, and this should be extended to farmers who put solar on their land, as long as they are also using the same land for traditional agricultural practices like grazing and crops. 
Install solar on new public buildings and schools. Heck, put it everywhere.  In the past ten years or so, Virginia’s commercial solar sector has blossomed while saving taxpayers money. To date, an estimated 150 Virginia schools have installed solar panels, saving schools about 25% on their energy bills. Solar on every sunny school rooftop would add up to more than 1,000 MW of carbon-free generation. Extend the effort to the roofs of all suitable public buildings across the state, and that number can go much higher. 
Dominion and APCo have long tried to squelch competition from rooftop solar, a war that looks increasingly foolish as Virginia finds itself short on energy for all customers. Earlier this year Congress drastically accelerated the phase-out of solar tax incentives, but the savings remain available for commercial and utility-scale projects for the next two years. There is no shortage of good ideas out there to be acted upon. Spanberger and legislators should take full advantage of that opportunity to install as much solar as possible. 
Battery storage at data centers does triple duty. While solar is the cheapest, cleanest, and fastest way to generate power, it needs batteries or other forms of energy storage to make it into a 24/7 resource, and storage remains relatively expensive. For tech companies, however, the calculus makes more sense.
Data centers need backup power anyway; they typically have three layers of redundancy so that they never risk losing power when the grid goes down. Today the backup power is mostly provided by massive diesel generators, sometimes three times as many as they might actually need. Most of these have no pollution controls and are therefore not supposed to run except in emergencies and for testing and maintenance. 
Some tech companies are now installing generators with selective catalytic converters that produce fewer emissions. The catch is that these can legally be used in non-emergency situations, raising the possibility that they might be used for demand-response or peak shaving. In effect, data centers would be solving the peak demand problem with one of the dirtiest forms of energy. The cumulative effect on air quality could be worrisome, and Virginia’s carbon footprint would grow at a time when the law says it should be shrinking. 
What if, instead of diesel generators, data centers installed storage as their first line of defense against power outages, leaving diesel generators to be used only in the rare case of extended grid outages? Air quality would benefit, carbon emissions would decrease, and the data centers would have the backup power they need. The tech companies would pay more upfront but could be compensated by utilities for using their storage capability for grid services and demand response, lowering their draw from the grid at peak demand times. 
All the data centers in Virginia today use 6 gigawatts of power. That much storage would exceed the targets set in the VCEA for Dominion and APCo combined.  Even limiting the requirement to two hours of storage at new data centers would bring enough storage online quickly to eliminate the expensive demand peaks that drive the high price of energy.

Require data center operators to source their own zero-carbon electricity. Most of the tech companies have sustainability commitments that they aren’t meeting, so it isn’t asking too much of them to put them in charge of this effort. Legislation to require this as a condition of accepting Virginia’s generous tax subsidies has been defeated for the past two years. The difference this year is that rising energy prices are now affecting everyone. 
Under this proposal, the zero-carbon electricity doesn’t have to come from Virginia, as long as it is available to customers here. Maybe the tech companies could even tap into their considerable influence with the Trump administration to make electricity more plentiful and affordable by reversing its war on solar and wind energy.
Why, after all, should Virginia residents sacrifice for the richest corporations in the world? If “paying their fair share” means anything, it should mean that data centers, not residents, bear the costs of making enough energy available to Virginia, and complying with our clean energy mandate.
Lower demand with energy efficiency and distributed solar. The gap between energy supply and demand does not have to be filled entirely through supply-side solutions. Lowering demand should also be part of the solution. Virginia utilities, Dominion in particular, have done a poor job of running energy efficiency programs. Looking on the bright side, though, that means plenty of opportunities remain.
House Democrats have already started work on this issue, with a focus on lowering winter heating costs for lower-income households. As reported in the Mercury last week, HB 2, from Farifax Del. Mark Sickles, requires Dominion and APCo to make their “best, reasonable efforts” to provide energy efficiency and weatherization to 30% of income-qualified customers by the end of 2031. HB 3, from  Del. Destiny Levere Bolling, D-Henrico, sets up a task force to study income-qualified energy efficiency and weatherization.  
These steps are okay for starters, and they would be juiced by the influx of money from RGGI carbon auctions (see next section), earmarked for low-income energy efficiency. But Dominion has repeatedly failed to meet the energy efficiency targets the legislature sets for it, and after all, why stop with 30% of low-income customers when all households could benefit from more comprehensive programs? Virginia can do much better.  
My last column discussed Rewiring America’s proposal to have tech companies pay for heat pumps, solar and batteries in the residential sector, saving money for households and freeing up capacity for data centers to come online sooner. An independent provider could run the program and verify the energy savings.  
(If the tech companies complain that an awful lot of the solutions I’m proposing come at their expense, it’s true. But the industry benefits from a state tax subsidy that has reached nearly a billion dollars per year, and will only grow further as the number of data centers doubles and triples. They can afford to give back.) 
Use RGGI for long-term affordability. Gov.-elect Spanberger has committed to seeing Virginia rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the compact of northeastern states working to lower carbon emissions by 30% by 2030. RGGI works by requiring owners of carbon-emitting generating plants to buy carbon allowances at auction, penalizing carbon-intensive generation and rewarding investments in zero-carbon facilities like wind, solar and nuclear. States collect the auction proceeds, which in Virginia are dedicated to low-income energy efficiency and climate adaptation measures.
Republicans have already renewed their attacks on RGGI, calling it a tax on energy consumers. To the extent that’s true, it’s a tax mostly paid by the largest consumers (including data centers) for the benefit of low-income residents and people most vulnerable to storms and sea level rise. Moreover, all energy consumers benefit over the longer term as low-cost clean energy increasingly replaces expensive fossil fuels. 
Beef up efficiency standards in the residential building code. Most people who buy a new home assume that modern building codes incorporate the latest standards for insulation and efficient technology. In Virginia, they do not. Buyers would be dismayed to learn that their homes are costing them more on their utility bills than they saved on a purchase price supposedly made more affordable by poorer-quality insulation and appliances. Buyers are rarely consulted on these trade-offs, and few have the expertise to question a builder’s choices. Building codes are supposed to do that job.
Unfortunately, Virginia’s Board of Housing and Community Development, which writes the code, is dominated by the homebuilding industry. The industry wants to build homes as cheaply as possible to ensure the highest profit possible on the homes it sells. Even as national model code standards have become more rigorous, homebuilders have protected their own interests by keeping weak energy efficiency requirements in Virginia’s residential building code. 
In 2021, Virginia adopted legislation requiring the board to consider and adopt energy standards “at least as stringent as” the latest national model code standards when the benefits over time to residents and the public exceed the incremental costs of construction. But the board simply didn’t do it. Will this be the year legislators realize that a board dominated by the industry it regulates won’t act in the public interest without explicit directions? 
This is Virginia’s moment. Since the passage of the Virginia Clean Economy Act in 2020, renewable energy and storage have only gotten cheaper, while energy efficiency opportunities remain plentiful. Coal has solidified its place as the most expensive baseload source, and fossil gas remains stubbornly expensive compared to solar. Spanberger and the Democratic majority have an opening this year to go big on clean energy. An aggressive legislative agenda this year will demonstrate national leadership on managing the data center buildout while delivering climate, health and economic benefits to all Virginians.

(Photo by Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)As food prices remain high, the Trump administration has made it easier for farmers to hire foreign guest workers and to pay them less. Now, other industries with large immigrant workforces also are asking for relief as they combat labor shortages and raids.
Visas for temporary foreign workers are a quick fix with bipartisan support in Congress. And Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ office told Stateline that “streamlining” visas for both agricultural and other jobs is a priority for the Trump administration.
But some experts warn that such visas can be harmful if they postpone immigration overhauls that would give immigrant workers a path to green cards and citizenship.
Trump allows more foreign ag workers, eases off ICE raids on farms

“Lack of permanent status is costly to migrants, employers, and the broader economy,” wrote Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, in a report published in June. Workers are “vulnerable to policy changes triggered by a change in administration, most recently the threat of mass deportations.”
In a Nov. 25 interview with Stateline, Orrenius said the crackdown on illegal immigration could be a good thing if it leads to permanent solutions.
“If you can stop undocumented immigration, then great. This is a great time to work on comprehensive immigration reform,” Orrenius said. “Where is there a scarcity of workers and how do we address those legally instead of illegally?”
Restaurants, construction and landscaping businesses have lost a combined 315,000 immigrant workers through August this year, more than any other industries, according to a Stateline analysis of Current Population Survey data provided by the University of Minnesota at ipums.org.
The construction industry needs more foreign worker visas like those already being provided for agriculture to prevent more delays in building everything from homes to highways, business owners say.
The industry needs help to “provide lawful workers while working to prepare more Americans for permanent careers in construction,” said Jaime Andress, testifying at a congressional hearing last month on behalf of the Associated General Contractors of America trade group. About 92% of contractors with open positions are having trouble finding enough skilled labor, whether it’s for construction of buildings, highways or utility infrastructure, she testified.
There are about 145,000 fewer immigrants working in restaurants, on average, through August of this year compared with the same period in 2024, the Stateline analysis found. There are about 127,000 fewer in construction and 43,000 fewer in landscaping.


One landscaping firm, which did not agree to an interview, lost $50,000 in contracts this year when workers stopped showing up because of rumored immigration raids, said Rebecca Shi, chief executive officer of the Chicago-based American Business Immigration Coalition, which advocates for employers seeking immigration changes.
“He had 75 workers and 50 of them didn’t show up one day because there were rumors ICE was going to be in the area,” Shi said. “Many of them were citizens and legal workers, but they were worried about family members and neighbors, so they didn’t show up either. It’s bad for the economy when you lose a worker, but it’s also the fear and uncertainty. We know restaurants that have lost 50% of staff and are at risk of closing because people just aren’t showing up.”
The coalition organized a “fly-in” in October to Washington, D.C., to ask members of Congress for more help to legalize immigrant workers through work permits in hospitality, agriculture, construction, elder care, health care and manufacturing.
In a letter dated Dec. 2, thousands of businesses in all 50 states asked the administration for an additional 64,716 H-2B visas, saying they rely on them for seasonal surges in hospitality, tourism, landscaping, forestry, seafood production and other industries.
And a bipartisan group of 33 U.S. senators from 22 states signed a letter Nov. 13 by Maine Independent Sen. Angus King and South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds asking for more H-2B seasonal employment visas.
“Employers’ workforce needs cannot be met with American workers alone,” the letter said.
Farmworkers sue over Trump’s low wages for foreign guest workers

Construction contractors say they need visas that are similar to the H-2A visas for agriculture that the Trump administration streamlined in October to make them easier and cheaper for farmers to hire temporary foreign workers.
The Associated General Contractors of America wants visas like the proposed new H-2C visas floated by Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker. Those would allow up to 85,000 less-skilled temporary workers in construction, hospitality and other fields to stay in this country up to nine years. The bill, introduced in September, has not advanced.
The association also supports a pathway to legal status for some workers already in the country, as proposed by Florida Republican U.S. Rep. María Elvira Salazar and Texas Democratic U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar. The bill, introduced in July, also has not advanced.
“Workforce shortages are the leading cause of construction project delays,” said Brian Turmail, a vice president at the association. “Nearly 1 out of 3 contractors have been impacted in one way or another by enhanced ICE enforcement activities. That number is almost certain to increase now that ICE has received significant boosts to its budget as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”










Workforce shortages are the leading cause of construction project delays.

Those industries are asking for more help as the latest federal immigration raids further affect workforces in Illinois, Maryland and North Carolina, with more raids planned in Louisiana. Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization at Syracuse University, reported a “massive redeployment of government military and civilian personnel to immigration enforcement” in recent months, with total detentions reaching more than 65,000, according to a Nov. 24 report. Nearly three-quarters of those arrested have no criminal convictions.
Construction, landscaping and other industries are already heavy users of H-2B visas for temporary non-agricultural foreign workers, according to government figures reviewed by Stateline.
Trump migrant deportations could threaten states’ agricultural economies

In fiscal year 2025, which ended in September, there were about 209,000 H-2B visas, with Texas (20,051), Florida (18,515), North Carolina (8,634), Colorado (7,723) and Louisiana (7,234) getting the most. The most common occupations were building and grounds (94,152); food service (31,403); construction (16,729); farming, fishing and forestry (15,665); and personal care (12,170).
Some of the largest users of the visas last year were Core Tech Construction of New York City, a concrete coring and cutting firm (2,619 visas); ABC Professional Tree Services of Texas, which provides land clearance services (1,913); and Progressive Solutions LLC of Arkansas, which provides herbicide application to utilities (1,882).
The H-2B visa program needs to be streamlined and expanded to be useful for employers and workers, said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian CATO Institute, who has written about the visas.
Employers don’t always get the workers they want because the United States limits H-2B visas to 33,000 twice a year. Requests for the visas have already surpassed the 33,000 cap for the first half of fiscal 2026.
“The paperwork is a nightmare for employers and there are a lot of steps for workers also,” said Bier. “And there are so few visas available that your chance of getting all you need is almost nil.”

An oversight group for Ohio’s electric grid operator, PJM Interconnection, is asking federal officials to weigh in on the future of data centers. Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent market monitor, contends reliability should be PJM’s priority. But recent proposals contemplate bringing data centers online despite the possibility of periodic blackouts.
Monitoring Analytics wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to clarify that PJM can, and should, halt data center interconnection if it doesn’t have adequate power.
Ohio background
There are more than 200 data centers in Ohio already, and American Electric Power has claimed 30 gigawatts-worth of proposed data center projects want to connect to the grid.
For context, peak load for the entire state of Ohio was 9.4 gigawatts in 2023.
To manage that demand, AEP instituted a moratorium on new data centers and lobbied state regulators for a new data center-specific tariff with minimum purchase requirements and exit fees if a facility folds.
Ohio regulators approved the pricing plan, over the objection of The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association and others.
The group is currently challenging the tariff in the Ohio Supreme Court.
The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association contends AEP didn’t have the right to declare a moratorium in the first place, and that it hasn’t backed up its claims about prospective demand.
Ohio regulators turn down appeal, OK utility’s data center billing plan

In September, after regulators approved the tariff, AEP cut its forecasts from 30 gigawatts to 13.
A recent study funded by the Ohio Chamber Foundation indicated companies like Amazon, Google, Meta and others have committed more than $40 billion in Ohio projects over the next decade.
The chamber’s analysis suggests data centers will need 7.6 gigawatts of additional power by 2030 and quoted a study by the Ohio Business Roundtable projecting demand to grow to 15 gigawatts by 2034.

The company reviews PJM’s procedures, rules, and structure to ensure its energy market is operating competitively.
In November, Monitoring Analytics joined several other stakeholders to try to agree on new rules governing data centers.
They voted on a dozen ideas but couldn’t reach consensus.
Following the meeting, PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields issued a statement explaining “PJM opened this conversation about the integration of large loads and greatly appreciates our stakeholders for their contributions to this effort. The stakeholder process produced many thoughtful proposals, some of which were introduced late in the process and require additional development.”
Shields stressed the vote was always advisory in nature and said the PJM board still plans to act on data centers in the next few weeks.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will have to sign off on whatever they propose.
The independent monitor left the meeting concerned that PJM and other stakeholders are working from a false premise.
“The solutions offered by PJM and most stakeholders simply assume that PJM must agree to add large loads to the system when the loads cannot be served reliably,” Monitoring Analytics’ FERC complaint states.
In short, the organization contends PJM has the authority to make data centers wait. And if PJM’s central obligation is reliability, then those data centers should wait.
Monitoring Analytics noted many of the unsuccessful proposals stakeholders considered included “mandatory curtailments” — blackouts — for new loads.
The fact that those considerations are included, the group argued, underscores the point that PJM doesn’t have adequate capacity for proposed data centers.
“The logic is simple. The question is clear,” Monitoring Analytics wrote. “If PJM has an obligation to provide reliable service to all PJM loads, is it just and reasonable for PJM to add new loads that it cannot serve reliably?”
“The answer to that question is no.” it added.
The independent monitor is asking federal regulators to issue a ruling directing PJM to add new data centers only when it has the infrastructure in place to serve those new customers as well as its existing ones.
PJM declined to comment on the independent monitor’s complaint.

Kelly Ayotte signed Senate Bill 295 into law at the State House in June. The bill expanded the voucher-like education freedom account program. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire’s education freedom account, or EFA, program has 10,510 students participating this year, nearly double the number last year, according to figures released by the Department of Education last month.
The state is expected to spend $51.6 million in total this school year, compared with $30.3 million last year. 
But in the months since lawmakers removed the income limits on the program — allowing wealthier families to participate — the proportion of low-income EFA students has dropped.
In the 2024-25 school year, 39% of the 5,765 students participating were from families making less than 185% of the federal poverty level. This school year, 19% of EFA recipients fall into that income category.
In the 2021-22 school year, the program’s first year, when access was capped to families making up to 300% of the federal poverty level, 54% of participants were in that lowest income bracket. 
In addition to the proportion, the actual number of lower-income participants has also dipped. 
Though the overall number of EFA recipients rose from 5,765 to 10,510, the number of students from families making up to 185% of the federal poverty level dropped from 2,261 students last school year to 2,017 students this school year.
Meanwhile, the percentage of EFA recipients who directly left a public school to take an EFA has dropped since the income limits were raised. 
Last school year, 297 out of the total 5,765 EFA recipients had left their public school the year before for an EFA — 5.1%. This year, 343 out of the 10,510 did so, or about 3.3%. Put differently, 96.7% of EFA recipients were already in a private or home school program in the year before the 2025-26 school year, the data shows. 
The numbers are based on a count of EFA students as of Oct. 1. They were reported by the department on Nov. 15. And they underscore some of the initial effects of the expansion of the EFA program — and, to supporters, evidence of the program’s popularity. 
First created in 2021, the education freedom accounts allow families to access the state’s per-pupil spending amounts it sends to public schools and use those grants toward private education and home-schooling expenses. 
Republicans, who have championed the program, say it offers a valuable path to alternate education options for families whose children are not thriving in public school. Democrats have denounced the program, arguing it siphons off state tax revenue to send funds to private schools that should be reserved for public schools. 
Wealthier EFA recipients, lower per-pupil cost
Since their creation, education freedom accounts have seen two major updates to eligibility. In 2023, Republican lawmakers increased the income cap, allowing families making up to 350% of the federal income level to participate, up from the initial 300%.
And in June 2025, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed Senate Bill 295, removing the income limits entirely but imposing a 10,000 student annual cap for most families making more than 350% of the federal poverty level. The law allows some students to enter the program even after that cap is hit. And it includes a provision to automatically increase the cap the following year if the cap is hit in the current year. 
That expansion took effect immediately upon Ayotte’s signature. 
The removal of income limits appears to have brought some EFA program demographics in line with those in public schools. For instance, the current 19% of EFA recipients from households making up to 185% of the federal poverty level is close to the 23% of students in that same bracket across New Hampshire public schools, according to the Department of Education. 
But in other specialty areas, students appear to be preferring public schools. For instance, 19% of New Hampshire public school students qualify for some form of special education, while just 8% of current EFA recipients do so, according to the data.
And while about 5% of public school students are designated English language learners, only 0.19% of EFA recipients have identified as English language learners. 
Identifying a student as an English language learner, a special education recipient or a free and reduced-price lunch recipient is optional for families opting into EFAs, so the numbers may not be exact totals. But doing so increases the size of that family’s annual EFA grant under the state’s differentiated aid system. 
Moving to universal income eligibility has affected how much the state is spending per pupil on the EFAs. 
Last school year, the program sent an average of $5,265 per student, while this year, the average amount will be $4,911 per student, according to the Department of Education. 
As a result, though the number of students receiving EFAs increased by 82%, the total cost of the program increased 70%. 
That drop appears to have occurred largely because the state is spending a smaller proportion of its EFA budget on “differentiated aid” payments to lower-income students this year than it did last year, according to the data. With the addition of wealthier participants who don’t qualify for that aid, the state spends less on average per student. 
Last school year, the percentage of total EFA state spending devoted to the increased aid payments to students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was 17.5%; this year it was 9.4%.
Opposing reactions
The new numbers are unlikely to shake entrenched opinions for and against EFAs in Concord.
For Republicans like Sen. Victoria Sullivan, of Manchester, the data has one clear takeaway: demand is high.
“It’s just a signal to me that we have more families in need that want to utilize the education freedom accounts, and the intention was for it to be universal, and it really should be,” she said. 
In addition to appeals to school choice, Republican lawmakers have argued the EFA program saves money for local property taxpayers because when a student leaves a public school district, the residents no longer pay the local portion of public school tuition for that student.  
In an analysis published in November, the Department of Education estimated that the program had saved $30.6 million in cumulative local taxpayer dollars from the students who have switched from public school to EFAs alone. If all EFA recipients attended public schools, local taxpayers would have cumulatively paid $266 million more, the department calculated. 
“The wildly successful Education Freedom Account Program has been transformative for thousands of students all around New Hampshire,” said Rep. Valerie McDonnell, a Salem Republican, in a statement issued when Ayotte signed the expansion bill in June. 
“On top of saving taxpayers over $266 million in its opening years, this program has operated with absolute transparency, with every single cent audited and accounted for by the Children’s Scholarship Fund,” McDonnell said.
But Democrats have countered that the departure of students from public schools does not reduce the fixed costs to run the schools, meaning taxes will likely not drop proportionally. 
They have also argued the relatively low percentage of EFA recipients who have left their public schools indicates the program is not fulfilling its mission of providing school choice to those who don’t want to attend public schools. 
“It is a tiny fraction of the number of students who are served by the public school system. And this tiny fraction of students … is costing us millions and millions and millions of dollars with no accountability,” said Sen. Debra Altschiller, a Stratham Democrat, in an interview.
Budget battles continue
The latest data from the department shows wildly different take-up rates of EFAs in specific towns. While many school districts like Manchester — which houses the largest number of EFA recipients but is also the largest school district — have seen about 9% of their students take EFAs, some towns have seen much larger percentages.
In Rindge, 28.7% of resident students are using an education freedom account. In New Ipswich, 16.3% of students are in the program. 
And while counties like Belknap, Cheshire, and Merrimack have seen a dip in the percentage of EFA enrollees in their district since 2021, others are seeing a swell. Last school year, 10% of Rockingham County students had taken an EFA; this year, the proportion is 15%. 
Amid the rapid changes, some lawmakers are pushing to expand the law further. A bill proposed by Sullivan for the 2026 session would remove the 10,000 student cap entirely. Sullivan said demand for EFAs would eventually plateau if the program were made universal, and she argued the state’s Education Trust Fund can absorb the additional cost.
“We’ve increased (public school) spending significantly, and the outcomes haven’t changed,” she said. “… So I think people are looking for more of a return on their dollar, which is why they’re supporting the EFAs.”
Democrats such as Altschiller are advancing bills to subject the EFA expenditures to greater accountability. Rep. Ellen Read of Newmarket is bringing forward legislation to allow cities or towns to opt out of allowing their residents to participate in the EFA program. 
In an interview, Read argued that rather than saving money when a public school student leaves to take an education freedom account, school districts lose money by no longer receiving the state’s portion. She said her bill had been requested by a Newmarket constituent who wanted an option to stop that potential result. 
“It only makes sense to allow the people of the town to determine whether or not they’re going to allow the costs of their education to be driven up by this voucher program, thereby increasing their own property taxes,” Read said. 
Sullivan said she expects her bill to remove the cap from the program to pass the Senate next year, but predicted a more difficult fight in the more fiscally conservative House.
“I know we’ll be up against the same arguments,” Sullivan said of the criticism from Democrats. “They didn’t work last time. Hopefully they don’t work this time, and we can truly give universal EFAs to every New Hampshire family that wants them.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ayottebills-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-12-03 05:58:34.457305
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-03 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,More young adults in CT finding a home in the Republican Party,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/03/ct-young-republicans/, The Connecticut Young Republicans group has been building its ranks in recent months as the party courts younger generations to get involved.,"Amber Webster was a Democrat.
Then the pandemic happened, and the 32-year-old mother from Colchester grew frustrated with how it was handled. She said she and others started questioning “a party that we were loyal to for a long time” and made the switch.
Webster isn’t the only relatively young person looking to the Republican Party for an ideological home. She was among several dozen people who attended the Connecticut Young Republicans’ first social meeting of the year in late October. 
“Our generation has seen so many struggles that our parents didn’t — the cost of homes going up, things being unaffordable and unattainable financially. So I think that’s why most of us are getting involved — just to try to change the future, keep Connecticut affordable, safe and things like that,” Webster said.
That was a popular sentiment of the group, whose membership ranges from 18 to 40 years old: the high cost of living in states like Connecticut are putting things out of reach that were commonplace for older generations.
For much of the past two years, the Connecticut Young Republicans was relatively inactive. But the group has been building its ranks in recent months. It comes as the party actively courts younger generations to get involved — and even as Connecticut turned bluer in the recent municipal elections.
Republicans aren’t quite facing the same reckoning as Democrats, with calls for generational change forcing Democratic primaries in Connecticut and beyond. But the group’s chairman, Patrick Burland, 26, sees a noticeable shift since he tried to secure a spot on a Republican Town Committee seven years ago.
“For the first time in many years, Republican Town Committees are not just tolerating younger Republicans but seeking them out,” Burland said. “The entire attitude has changed toward younger people.”

A new generation of GOP politics
On a rainy evening the day before Halloween, a restaurant in the Plantsville neighborhood of Southington filled up with a broad cross section of Republicans in the state ranging from candidates running for local offices to newcomers who had never gotten involved in politics before.
There were a lot of commonalities: concerns about safety, political rhetoric, government dependence and costs of living.
And yet how they got involved in GOP politics varied widely.
After Webster’s political evolution, she worked to get Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Connecticut’s ballot as an independent in the 2024 election. She considers herself to be a “MAHA mom,” a reference to the slogan “Make America Healthy Again.” Kennedy ultimately endorsed President Donald Trump after ending his bid and now serves as head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Sine then, Webster got more involved in local Republican Party politics. She’s fresh off of managing Republican Steve Orosco’s campaign against New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker as well as running her own race for Colchester Board of Finance. Both Webster and Orosco lost their respective elections last month.
Others who attended the meeting are even newer to politics and Connecticut.
Ryan J. Wells is a 20-year-old intel specialist in the Marine Corps Reserve who currently resides in Naugatuck after living in North Carolina a year ago. He said he wanted to get involved after conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s fatal shooting and now wants to go into policymaking. Kirk gained a big following of young conservatives after mobilizing students on high school and college campuses.
Wells said he’s concerned with homeownership in a state struggling with a housing shortage and high prices. It’s likely to become a top issue in the 2026 governor’s race, especially after the General Assembly passed a renegotiated version of a sweeping housing bill in the special session.
Federal nutrition assistance also came up during the meeting, as the state was in the throes of figuring out whether to fund benefits with federal funding in limbo. At the event, House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, spotlighted it as an issue that both parties in the state got behind during the government shutdown. 
Wells said he didn’t want to see benefits immediately removed, but argued it’s a larger policy failure of a social services program because 10% of Connecticut’s population relies on federally funded benefits to help them afford groceries.
“That’s a travesty and we need to evaluate every single politician and we need to evaluate the history of this,” Wells said. “That is a greater systematic failure of policy.”
Maintaining momentum
Connecticut’s Young Republicans chapter expanded significantly since the new board of officers took over in recent months.
The group ramped up from three dues-paying members to 60 active members — 20 of whom signed up because of the October event. That’s on top of the associate members who have given contributions but are over the age of 40.
They have local chapters in Windham, Hartford and New Haven counties and want to help with door-knocking and phone-banking for the 2026 elections. They will soon have additional groups in Litchfield, Fairfield and New London counties.
Connecticut’s top three GOP leaders view them as one of the keys to success in a state currently dominated by Democrats. They have their eyes on next year’s highly anticipated governor’s race, which could see a younger Republican take on a 71-year-old incumbent.
“This is a really important segue into what’s going to be a very important and consequential election in 2026,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield, a young Republican himself, told the group in October. “It starts Tuesday and it moves right forward into a 2026 election cycle where it’s going to be exclusively devoted towards protecting our state … The Democratic Party has controlled this state for a generation now. Their level of arrogance has grown beyond words.”

But five days later, Connecticut Democrats had an electoral romp. They flipped control of 28 cities and towns that were once held by Republicans. After Democrats had a tough presidential cycle a year earlier, they now feel openly optimistic about 2026.
Still, the objective for Republicans remains the same. How do they rebuff the leftward pull of an already blue state as they head into a consequential election year?
One of their answers is to build up a pipeline of younger Republicans willing to engage in local politics either through grassroots organizing or running for their local town committees. It’s a long-term goal that’ll take time, with the hopes of starting to reap those rewards as early as 2026.
Connecticut Republican Party chairman Ben Proto offered a blunt directive to those in the room that night: Get involved locally and encourage their peers to vote — something he said younger generations don’t do.
“The reality of the situation is you have so much to offer us that sometimes we don’t know enough to ask for it. We can help do this, but it’s not our future. It’s your future,” Proto said. “You need to be in the present so that your future is better. Because if you wait for the future, folks, it’s going to pass you by and the Democrats are going to control it.”
Even with tough losses in the local elections, there were some bright spots: 14 of the Connecticut Young Republicans’ endorsed candidates won their municipal races.
One of those was Amybeth Laroche, who won her race for Newtown Board of Finance. She attended the Connecticut Young Republicans’ meeting and got involved after seeing a post about the group on Instagram. She said it’s incumbent on her party to do more for younger generations, especially those with young families.
Laroche said she’s heard from other mothers and parents about the difficulty of making local meetings because they are at inconvenient times that don’t work with raising young kids.
“We’re supposed to be the party of families, but we’re making it impossible, so we should be thinking that should we do more” to accommodate those with young families, Laroche said. “Whether it’s Democrat or Republican, those small things are so important to keep the future stuff moving forward, and we’re just not thinking like that.”
Republicans argue that the focus on identity politics by some in the Democratic Party has overshadowed bigger issues that are consuming younger generations.
“Those sort of identity politics … are starting to backfire, and I think that’s brought that generation I would say toward the Republican Party,” Candelora said. “What I see from my children, especially the males, they’re just kind of fed up with, not just with authority and with all the labels that they’re being told, but also with the fact that this is probably the first generation that might not be as well off as the next.”
Moving past the texting scandal
The Connecticut group was just starting back up again in earnest when a leaked texting controversy rocked the national Young Republicans organization and a few chapters in other states.
The chat was the behind-the-scenes push of an insurgent campaign looking to lead the Young Republican National Federation. The messages used racist, homophobic and other explicit language.
The months-long chat came from one wing of the group, the Restore YR campaign, led by New York State Young Republicans Chairman Peter Giunta. He was challenging the incumbent chairman, Hayden Padgett, during the elections held over the summer. In addition to New York, others involved in the chat were affiliated with chapters in Kansas, Arizona and Vermont.
Some of the texts embraced Adolf Hitler and joked that people who don’t vote for Restore YR are “going to the gas chamber.” That prompted some state affiliates involved to disband and specific members involved in the chat to lose their leadership roles and, in some cases, even their day jobs.
The Connecticut chapter was not involved in the Telegram group chat and didn’t support the slate of candidates at the center of the controversy. The state group backed the current chairman, Padgett, who ended up winning another term.
The Young Republican National Federation said the chat was “vile” and “inexcusable” and called on those members to resign from their positions. But the Connecticut chapter never addressed the revelations about the chat on its public channels and said they didn’t have their own statement beyond the one issued by the national group.
That was a different approach from the one they took after Kirk’s assassination. The young Democratic and Republican groups in Connecticut issued a joint statement denouncing the shooting and political violence.
When asked if there were concerns the chat could hurt the reputation of the Young Republicans, members of the group condemned it, but believed they would move past it and shouldn’t be a blemish on the organization as a whole.
“Those comments were highly inappropriate and very disrespectful and definitely something that should not be tolerated from either side of the aisle,” Webster said. “This chapter is fairly new, so I think the best thing that we can do is just lead with integrity and our own actions and hold ourselves and each other accountable here in Connecticut.”
National v. local politics
There have been glimmers of hope for Connecticut Republicans in recent years.
Trump improved his standing in about 150 towns in 2024, even as he lost the state by a double-digit margin for the third time. And GOP voter registration grew by almost 6% over the course of four years, and that uptick is happening in some of the biggest cities, like Hartford and New Haven.
Yet Republicans saw losses in mayoral and first selectman seats this year, including in redder pockets of the state. The reason for Democrats’ string of victories could be explained by a multitude of reasons: backlash to Trump’s first year in office, a record-long government shutdown, local issues that dwarfed the national narrative, or a strained economy.
“Obviously, there was a lot of underlying concern about the dysfunction in Washington, D.C., the chaos in Washington, D.C., and just a sense that Connecticut is a bit of a safe harbor compared to what’s going on there,” Gov. Ned Lamont said following the state’s municipal elections. “My message to the Democrats is, ‘Just don’t run against Donald Trump. You got to tell people what you are for.'”
One thing Republicans and Democrats can agree on: affordability was and will likely be the main issue driving future elections. They just disagree on the way to solve it.
Connecticut Young Republicans hope to have success at the top of the ticket next year. Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, who are both in their 30s, are vying for the GOP nomination in the governor’s race. Lamont is seeking a third term.
One of the takeaways of the October event was that Connecticut is not Washington, D.C., and there’s a better track record of Democrats and Republicans working together in the state. That was particularly evident after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.
Candelora offered a less-political message as a lawmaker who has a track record of working with the state’s Democratic majority on some issues and more of a willingness to buck the head of his own party when it conflicts with Connecticut priorities.

“It is about learning how to coexist in a state that traditionally votes for Democrats. And I think it’s important for our youth to recognize that you can have Republican principles and be a Republican in Connecticut and find your space,” Candelora said.
But as Republicans gear up for the 2026 elections, they will once again be presented with the question of how closely to align with Trump in a state that has rejected him in three presidential elections. 
“I think there’s plenty of local issues to focus on, and Trump is going to do what Trump is going to do. I would say you definitely have to know your audience and take the good from Trump that you can take from him,” Webster said.
Trump has a track record of being a make-or-break endorsement in Republican primaries. When it comes to the general election, that’s where it can get tricky for Republicans in a blue state like Connecticut.
The state of the economy is likely to play a big role in who’s successful in the 2026 midterms. With high inflation coming out of the pandemic, among other reasons, voters rejected then-President Joe Biden in 2024. And if high prices and cost of living remain the dominant issue next year, that could once again shape elections and the party in power.
“I think love him or hate him, President Trump has sort of driven the Republican Party into a principled message that youth are identifying with,” Candelora said. “And I think it all depends on what happens over the next couple of years, and if the economy doesn’t turn around, that could be an opportunity for the Democrats to step in.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025_1202_SR_GOP_042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 05:58:34.457305

One of the longest battles of all time: how involved should religion be in […],"Getty Images.Ohio Republican senators have passed a bill that would allow and put a display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. This is just one of the recent pieces of legislation that would add more Christianity to the education system.
One of the longest battles of all time: how involved should religion be in the government? For some state lawmakers, it hasn’t been enough.
“It is inexcusable that more focus has not been shown towards these historic texts,” state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, said.
The majority of GOP senators passed S.B. 34, which would require public schools to display “historic” texts in classrooms.
The list includes the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Articles of Confederation, the mottoes of both the U.S. and Ohio, the Magna Carta, the Mayflower Compact, the Northwest Ordinance, and the Ten Commandments.
“This bill will expose our students to the documents which have, in America, served as the backbone of our legal and moral traditions,” Johnson said.
Of the nine documents listed, school districts only have to choose four. But Democrats argue it’s a mandate.
“Did you notice that little piece in there — if someone gives [documents], if someone donates them, that they need to then display them?” Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said.
Antonio, a former educator, said it’s unconstitutional to put religious texts in public school classrooms.
“To present to those children that a document from a religious practice is above all others is inappropriate,” Antonio continued. ”
It’s not what the founders intended, it goes totally against the separation of church and state, and I think it’s an abomination.”
Retired Case Western Reserve University constitutional law professor Jonathan Entin said the legislation does raise First Amendment concerns.
“The idea has been that you wanna keep the government out of the religion business,” Entin said.
But he referenced three U.S. Supreme Court rulings from decades ago.
Decided in Stone v. Graham in 1980, justices said that Kentucky’s display of the Ten Commandments in schools violated the First Amendment’s establishment clause.
In 2005, justices extended the 1980 ban to Kentucky’s courthouses.
However, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Van Orden v. Perry in 2005, which allowed the Ten Commandments in a public space in Texas, since it wasn’t the only “historical document” displayed.
“The court said, because the Ten Commandments is part of a larger message or a larger set of items, it’s a less clearly religious message than the 10 Commandments standing alone,” Entin said.
In recent years, other states have pushed for the religious doctrine to be put in schools.
Most recently, a court ordered Texas school districts to remove the Ten Commandments from classrooms with a deadline of Monday.
However, Entin said that the makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court is different now, and Republican states may feel the justices would be more inclined to rethink these cases.
“[The Court is] more conservative and the majority seems to be more sympathetic to public displays of religious objects,” the professor said.
Another bill that recently passed the House would allow K-12 public schools and college professors to provide instruction on the “positive” impacts of religion on American history.
The GOP has titled H.B. 486 the “Charlie Kirk American Heritage Act.”
“Many of our adults don’t actually understand the roots of America and our founding principles that are rooted in Christianity, and that’s why we have our liberty, that’s why we have our freedom,” state Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, claimed. “I think we need to be able to be free to teach that.”
He said that the bill doesn’t allow people to proselytize — converting or attempting to convert students — but does include how Christianity positively benefited policies like the “treaty with the Native Americans” and how the Ten Commandments shaped federal law.
Antonio pushed back.
“There’s a movement in this country to make us a Christian national country, and these are the beginning steps of doing so,” Antonio said.
Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, warned against promoting religious ideology.
“A wise friend down in Texas said something that my people, the Jewish people, know well to be true from our history, which is that ‘A government powerful enough to impose religion is powerful enough to take it away,'” Isaacsohn said.
The House has also passed H.B. 485, which would require fifth graders and older to watch “Meet Baby Olivia,” a GOP-supported fetal development animated video created by anti-abortion organization Live Action.
“Children are a gift, and we’re hoping that we can change the culture to be celebrating life instead of destroying life,” state Rep. Melanie Miller, R-Ashland, said.
The development cycle and graphics shown in the video conflict with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ research.
When urging passage of the bill on the House floor, Miller quoted the Bible.
Abortion rights advocates have pointed to medical inaccuracy in the video.
“They want to be able to impose their views, their religious views — let’s be clear — on everyone else,” abortion rights advocate Kellie Copeland said, adding that the video was medically inaccurate and offensive.

As of Sept. 30, Ohio lawmakers eliminated a key legal tool used to rein in air pollution from power plants and industrial sites. Now, advocates are suing to restore that right.


For decades, environmental groups in Ohio and elsewhere have used air nuisance rules in state plans as a catchall way to enforce the federal Clean Air Act. Ohio’s version let people take legal action against companies whose emissions ​“endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, or cause unreasonable injury or damage to property.” The rule dates back more than 50 years.


Environmental groups have used air nuisance rules to file or threaten lawsuits against coal-burning power plants, iron and steel facilities, coke plants, and other industrial operations, which emit not only planet-warming greenhouse gases but also harmful pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead.


Defendants in cases brought under Ohio’s version of the rule have included Suncoke Energy, AK Steel–Middletown Works, Georgia-Pacific Corp., and Phthalchem. Consent decrees and settlements have produced orders or agreements to stop alleged nuisances, clean up waste, and expand monitoring.


But a last-minute addition to the state’s 3,156-page budget bill, House Bill 96, told the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to cut that protection out of the state’s Clean Air Act plan.


“The air nuisance rule is the tool that Ohioans have to hold polluters accountable,” said Neil Waggoner, the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign manager for the Midwest. ​“This is the state government saying … we’re going to take this away from you in the most secretive fashion possible.”


The Sierra Club is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with the Ohio Environmental Council, SOBE Concerned Citizens, and the Freshwater Accountability Project. The fifth plaintiff, Donna Ballinger, is a Middletown resident who lives close to iron and steel operations, which she claims cause nuisance conditions. An August report by the Environmental Integrity Project documented likely air quality problems in that area.


Experts warn that eliminating the right to file air nuisance complaints weakens Ohio’s enforcement of pollution measures at an already perilous moment for environmental regulation.


For months, the Trump administration has been rolling back federal pollution standards and making huge personnel cuts to the staff charged with enforcing the remaining rules and permits. The Ohio EPA has authority to enforce the Clean Air Act but doesn’t always pursue alleged violations.


“Both at the federal and state level, we’re seeing less enforcement,” said Miranda Leppla, who heads Case Western Reserve University’s Environmental Law Clinic and represents the Ohio Environmental Council and the Sierra Club in the lawsuit. ​“If Ohioans don’t have the ability to bring these enforcement actions on their own through the air nuisance rule, there’s a very serious concern that air quality will continue to degrade and Ohioans’ health will get worse.”


Echoing a recent law in Louisiana, HB 96 also blocks the Ohio EPA from acting on data that groups may collect through community air-monitoring efforts. Such data can fill important gaps and alert communities and enforcement officials to problems that may not be detected by EPA monitors miles away.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE


Ohio’s limits on using the data will particularly harm fence-line communities, Leppla said.

“At a time when Ohio is seeing renewed industrial building, including new facilities like data centers, as well as a greater federal push for more fossil fuels, it is more important than ever that Ohioans preserve their right to both collect air pollution data themselves and use that data to file suits against harmful air nuisances,” said Chris Tavenor, general counsel for the Ohio Environmental Council.


The complaint, filed on Oct. 24 in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, asserts that lawmakers violated the single-subject rule in the Ohio Constitution when they tacked the air pollution provisions onto the massive budget bill.


“This is fundamentally unrelated to the main purpose of the biennial budget,” Waggoner said. ​“And it was stuck in here in an intentional way so that folks would not have an opportunity to see it, talk about it, or debate its merits.”


The Sierra Club, Ohio Environmental Council, and other groups raised a similar argument two years ago after eleventh-hour changes to a bill about poultry included a new definition of natural gas as ​“green energy.” That case, also at the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, has been briefed, and parties are waiting for Judge Kimberly Cocroft to issue her ruling.


A 2019 decision in Paulding County, Ohio, rejected a challenge to the late amendment in the 2014 budget bill that tripled property-line setbacks for turbines on wind farms. That case wasn’t appealed and would not bind the court in Franklin County.


Despite the similarities, the new lawsuit is different because the ban goes beyond how state agencies operate, Leppla said. ​“The air nuisance rule was created specifically to allow Ohioans who are suffering from noxious air pollution and nuisances to protect themselves when the government does not act.”


HB 96 is not the first attempt to take away Ohioans’ right to bring air nuisance claims. In 2020, the first Trump administration’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removed Ohio’s air nuisance rule, Waggoner noted.


The Ohio Environmental Council, the Sierra Club, Ballinger, and another Sierra Club member mounted a successful challenge in federal court, but due to delays in agency action it wasn’t until this February that the rule became effective again.


“And now here we are with the Ohio legislature attempting to remove it again, when it had already been found to be illegal to do so,” Leppla said.


To prevent another lapse, the plaintiffs in the new lawsuit have asked Judge Julie Lynch to grant a preliminary injunction against removing the rule while the case proceeds.


As defendants, the State of Ohio and the director of Ohio EPA have 28 days to file responses after the complaint was served. What happens next will depend on those filings and the judge’s rulings on any motions.


The Ohio attorney general’s office did not respond to Canary Media’s request for comment. Ohio EPA spokesperson Bryant Somerville said the agency is reviewing the lawsuit but had no further response because the matter is in litigation.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)The U.S. Department of Education’s recent decision to reclassify social worker master and doctorate degrees as “nonprofessional” fundamentally misrepresents what we do as professionals, the complexity of our training, and the essential role we play in the behavioral health and social service systems of this country.
I feel confident saying this statement reflects not just my own concern but the voices of educators, clinicians, students, families and community members who rely on a strong, well-prepared workforce that includes other allied health fields. 
The “big, beautiful bill,” praised by some lawmakers for putting America first, reclassifies positions such as social workers, nurses, physician assistants, physical therapists, and audiologists to limit the amount individuals can borrow to obtain advanced degrees. Unpaid student loan debt is a concern for many in America. However, limiting the earning potential of those who choose to work in allied health fields is not the best solution when the workforce continues to struggle with staffing shortages. 
Social work is a profession. It is a licensed, regulated, clinically rigorous field that requires advanced graduate education, standardized training, national examinations, ongoing supervision, and strict adherence to ethical codes.
To classify MSW and DSW programs as nonprofessional is to erase the expertise required to safely assess suicidal ideation, respond to trauma, domestic violence, addiction, child abuse, and mental illness. Social workers stabilize families experiencing crisis, support aging adults navigating complex medical systems, serve veterans, and lead schools, hospitals, child welfare agencies, and justice reform initiatives.
This reclassification sends a harmful message that our field does not require specialized, intensive preparation when the health, safety and future of our communities depend on it.
In both Kansas and Missouri, where I practice, the reclassification collides directly with realities on the ground. In many counties across both states, especially rural regions, there are no licensed clinical social workers available. Families wait weeks or months for care. Hospitals board patients or turn them away because no one can provide assessments. Schools struggle to find mental health providers for students in crisis.
The Kansas Department for Children and Families and Missouri Children’s Division rely heavily on MSWs for safety assessments, permanency planning, trauma-responsive care and prevention services. A blow to the professional identity of social workers is a blow to child safety.
MSW programs in this region train first-generation students; rural students; working parents; and Black, Latino, and Indigenous students. The field of social work thrives on producing professionals with shared, lived experience because it builds bridges to reach some of our most vulnerable communities. Reclassification reduces access to professional-degree loan models, scholarships and grants, undercutting equity and representation in a field that desperately needs diverse practitioners.
MSW programs are already strained by high field-education costs. Removing our professional status may reduce opportunities for flexible tuition, practicum support, workforce development funding and enrollment at already fragile rural campuses. This significantly reduces opportunities for the next generation of social workers.
To become licensed in Kansas or Missouri, an MSW graduate must undergo 900-plus hours of supervised fieldwork, 3,000 hours of post-graduate supervised clinical practice (for an LSCSW/LCSW license), pass a national clinical licensing exam and complete continuing education hours, all while remaining compliant with the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics.
None of these requirements represent “general graduate study.” They represent professional preparation to protect lives, strengthen families, and respond to complex biopsychosocial needs. To label this level of preparation as nonprofessional is not only inaccurate but dangerous.
Policy decisions of this magnitude are not abstract. They touch real people, real families, and real crises. The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 was signed into law incorporating 988 into statutes as the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line phone number. Since 2022, 988 Lifeline has answered more than 13 million calls, texts, and chats from individuals experiencing crisis.
Kansas and Missouri have expanded mobile crisis models, but many counties cannot staff 24/7 mobile crisis teams. Without MSWs, crisis centers cannot dispatch clinicians trained to deescalate or safety plan crisis situations.
Domestic violence programs, reentry programs, housing stability, school mental health, maternal mental health and many other vital services are stretched beyond capacity. Many are relying on volunteers or untrained staff. While valiant in their efforts, the potential for further harm is great.
Reclassification is not an isolated policy adjustment. It will ripple through every system that relies on licensed social workers. To base the definition of a “professional degree” on a law from 1965 is to systematically reject every advancement in allied health that exists today.
Our profession cannot withstand a policy that undermines public trust, destabilizes educational programs and threatens access to critical care. Social workers are on the front lines of some of the most painful and complex challenges in our society. To diminish our professional status is to diminish the lives of the people we serve.
Kansas and Missouri — our country as a whole — cannot afford to lose more social workers. Our children, families, and communities deserve a workforce that is recognized, supported, and valued.

(Getty Images.)In 2019, when the last Chevy Cruze was built at the Lordstown Ohio Assembly plant, the Mahoning Valley community responded with a simple demand to GM: “Invest in us.” 
Last month, Ohio’s Mahoning Valley was hit once again with job cuts at the Ultium Cells battery plant; around 500 jobs lost, and 850 workers temporarily laid off.
The community spent years working to bring manufacturing jobs back to the area.
Workers and the United Auto Workers (UAW) spent additional years organizing the Ultium plant to ensure safety and living wages.
It is difficult to see the gains of these workers and this community lost again, and that basic ask from our community years ago, “invest in us” stays top of mind.
Since 1966, the Lordstown Complex employed thousands of Ohioans who showed up and worked hard, even as our jobs were threatened with offshoring and automation.
After I had the honor of being elected as President of Local UAW 1112, I did everything in my power to see a new vehicle brought to Lordstown.
We knew that plant had all the right stuff to be a herald of a revived American automotive industry, and our members were ready to get back to work.
We believed then, and continue to believe now, that our members are the backbone of our communities, our states, and our nation.
We have urged our representatives on both sides of the aisle to invest in workers and in communities like Lordstown across the country.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But for companies like Ultium, the passage of the Republican budget bill (the “One Big Beautiful Bill”) this past summer makes it clear that Congressional Republicans are willing to lay waste to these goals.
Ohio U.S. Sen. Jon Husted lauded the significant tax cuts in the bill, but failed to mention that these historic tax breaks for the ultra-rich come at steep cost for working people.
More than 410,000 workers are currently employed in manufacturing facilities like Ultium that build the next generation of clean vehicles or their components.
This includes more than 240,000 manufacturing jobs in the domestic electric vehicle (EV) supply chain alone.
Many of these jobs are supported by federal policies and regulations, including the 30D EV tax credits and the 45X subsidies.
The UAW believes that incentives like these need stronger protections for workers attached, to make sure public dollars are only used to create good union jobs.
But instead of working with us to improve the credits, Republicans used their budget bill to eliminate them altogether, throwing companies that produce EVs and their parts into uncertainty.
The Ultium plant in Ohio is not an outlier.
Significant layoffs at GM’s Factory Zero and Rivian were also announced last month, as were temporary layoffs at Ultium’s Tennessee plant.
The loss of jobs at these facilities is not only a loss for the workers, but also a loss for all of us who live and work in these communities.
These plants uphold local economies, build innovative technologies that position the United States to compete in an advancing global marketplace, and ultimately, produce safe, reliable American cars.
In the plants we organized, the UAW worked to ensure these jobs were good jobs, safe jobs, where workers were able to achieve significant union-backed wage increases and benefits to support themselves and their families.
Facilities like Ultium proved that auto workers building parts and components for clean vehicles could receive the strong union protections and benefits they deserve.
This fight is not over. Our workers will continue to advocate for a system that invests in all of us.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland could have to pay upwards of $300 million in 2027 to meet new federal costs to deliver food assistance to residents, with state that have high rates of administrative errors — like Maryland — having to kick in more.
That is just one of the big-ticket expenses that states will have to take on to implement changes in HR 1, the congressional budget reconciliation bill better known as the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act, state officials told lawmakers Tuesday.
In a virtual joint meeting of the Senate Finance and the House Health and Government Operations committees, legislators were told that changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid will cost the state millions to implement.
Finance Chair Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) summed up the changes as “a lot of doom and gloom.”
“We have serious issues facing us this year,” she said.
Maryland is already implementing an increased work requirement for some SNAP recipients that began in November. Meanwhile, a majority of refugees and people granted asylum are no longer eligible for SNAP unless they also have lawful permanent resident status, known as “green card” holders.
But starting next year, states will have to take on more of the costs to administer SNAP, and those costs will likely only increase in later years. Lawmakers are already facing a significant budget deficit in the upcoming legislative session.
Trump administration threatens to yank food stamps funding from Democratic-led states

“There are very serious impacts to the state’s fiscal situation because of HR 1’s impact,” Larry Handerhan, an assistant secretary for the Maryland Department of Human Services, said in the virtual briefing.
Historically, the federal government covered all of the costs of SNAP benefits, and split the costs of administering the program with the states.
But under HR 1, states will be expected to contribute 75% of administrative costs, starting next year. For Maryland, which currently spends $115 million for its half of SNAP administrative costs, that means another $57.5 million each year, or a new state total of $172.5 million a year just to run the program.
Meanwhile, Maryland will likely have to pay some of the benefits themselves, due to a new penalty on states that have a high “payment error rate,” meaning benefits were overpaid or underpaid due to administrative mistakes, not due to fraudulent actions by recipients.
Under HR 1, states with an error rate over 6% will have to contribute some state money to fund SNAP benefits. Maryland’s error rate of 13.64% is one of the highest in the country. At that rate, the state would be expected to pay 15% of the $1.6 billion required to put money on Marylanders’ SNAP cards – or $240 million more than it pays now.
“It’s not fraud, it’s a question of bureaucracy,” said Webster Ye, chief of staff for the Human Services Department, said of the error rate. “It refers to overpayments and underpayments in which we, the Maryland state agency and the administrative staff, are the ones that make that mistake.”
Maryland’s error rate spiked in 2022 at 35.56%, which Ye attributed to a surge of use under the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with high turnover at the department that led to new staff who “weren’t adequately trained.” Before the pandemic, Maryland’s error rate was below 10%.
While it’s down from 2022m ,Maryland’s error rate is still in the top 10 among states and the District of Columbia.
The Department of Human Services is working to bring down the error rate by hiring more staff and providing additional training to administer the program, improving technical processes and working to streamline the application and renewal process.
“That’s great news,” said Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County), who initially asked if the error rate included benefit theft. “Obviously it would be a huge savings for the state and to taxpayers if you can bring that error rate down.
“Personally, I think it’s a good incentive for states, because the state doesn’t pay out any of this money,” Szeliga said of the penalties. “The federal government is expecting us to be good stewards of this money.”
The Trump administration wants everyone to reapply for food stamps. What does that mean?

Responding to Szeliga’s concern around benefit theft, Ye noted the state recently entered into a contract to update SNAP cards to a “chip and tap” technology, which is expected to help reduce SNAP fraud.
The meeting also went over some of the changes coming to Medicaid, many similar to the SNAP changes. Such “overlaps” include new work requirements to qualify for Medicaid as well as new restrictions on which noncitizen immigrants qualify for benefits.
Around 320,000 Medicaid recipients will also be required to prove they are eligible for coverage every six months starting in January 2027.
Perrie Briskin, deputy secretary with the Maryland Department of Health, said that eligibility provision will probably lead to the most “churn” and people will likely lose coverage if they don’t keep up with the frequent eligibility checks.
“When people have to redetermine their coverage, they often fall out of the system,” she said.
“It’s very disheartening, what we’re about to face,” Beidle said at the end of the meeting. “It’s really doom and gloom, and we’re just going to have to work together best we can do for the people of Maryland.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_oct29_cranberry_foodassistance_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 02:57:37.247922

Wes Moore (D) announced Tuesday the release of $19 million in grants toward a program to not only decrease the state’s teacher shortage, but also entice more men into the teaching profession.
The money for the Grow Your Own initiative is allocated in this year’s budget through the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act that Moore signed into law this year.
The initiative focuses on expanding teacher and staff pipelines, boosting diversity in the profession and establishing apprenticeships. But Moore emphasized the first round of grants in the Grow Your Own program will focus on bringing in more men to teach in the public schools. According to the governor’s office, about 23% of the state’s teachers are men.
Compared to the federal government, which is busy “coming up with creative ways to try to dismantle public education,” Maryland is going in a different direction, Moore said. And he had a message for out-of-state educators and fired federal workers: “Come to Maryland.”
“In Maryland, we’re just choosing to move differently,” he said. “In Maryland, we’re going to work together in order to ensure that education continues to serve as not just the foundation, but the launch pad for everything we hope for in our society.”
Trump administration unveils plan to try to dismantle Department of Education

State Superintendent Carey Wright, who Moore called “the LeBron James of education,” summarized a few education initiatives that cut teacher vacancies nearly in half from 1,619 in the 2024-25 school year to 886 in this year. One of those initiatives is a $2,000 relocation grant to attract out-of-state licensed teachers.
As for the Grow Your Own initiative, Wright said it prioritizes programs that leverage on-the-job training and mentorship and on working to recruit men into the profession.
One of those men who participated in the program, Ronnie Beard, attended Tuesday’s announcement.
Before Beard’s seven years as a high school social studies teacher in Frederick County, he said he worked 10 years as a special education paraprofessional, also called an “ESP” or education support professionals.
“My message to ESPs out there: Take advantage of the Grow Your Own program that is out here in our district,” he said. “You definitely won’t regret it, and you won’t regret your decision.”
Also on Tuesday, the governor announced a partnership between the American Institute for Reseearch and the state’s Young Men and Boys initiative within the Governor’s Office of Children.
The partnership will be come through a $6 million, three-year memorandum of understanding under which the institute will provide research, evaluation and technical assistance to the state’s work on supporting men and boys.
Hagerstown high school senior Damir Wade, 18, who seeks to become a future educator, is also part of the state’s apprenticeship program. Wade not only supports teachers in the classroom at an elementary school, but he also helps with math intervention with fourth and fifth grade students.
After the nearly 50-minute news conference, Wade said in a brief interview that he’s had fewer than five male teachers, and no Black male teachers, throughout his school life.
“It’s very rare to see,” Wade said about male teachers in the classroom. “I just want to be that person that people can look up to, and maybe they can go into education. They can see how important their education is, to take it more seriously [and] to open more doors for their future.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gov.-Wes-Moore-12-2-2025-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-12-03 01:57:40.715335

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA – Florida has been one of the fastest growing states in the country over the past five years. Now the newest entrant to the 2026 Republican gubernatorial race says it’s time to focus less on bringing in new people and more on improving the lives of those who already live here.
“Stop inviting the whole country and the whole world to live here,” James Fishback told a packed crowd during the Tampa Bay Young Republicans monthly meeting Monday night in Tampa, admonishing U.S. Sen. Rick Scott’s paid aerial banners that flew over New York City this past summer that read, “Hate socialism? Us too! Move to FL.”
“Sen. Scott, we are full. We are done,” Fishback said.
Fishback has been in the race for a little more than a week officially but has already drawn substantial criticism from Republican Party of Florida establishment figures who say he shouldn’t be there.
“Tallahassee’s having a full blown meltdown,” he said. “The calls I’ve gotten. The attacks that I’ve gotten. All the way to the White House. Don’t do this. Drop out.”
He wants to end the H-1B visa program
A CEO with the startup asset management firm Azoria Partners. Fishback grew up in Broward County and now resides in Madison County in North Florida. The 30-year-old political newcomer (who turns 31 on New Year’s Day) has come out as a hardline immigration critic who has vowed to “fire every H-1B” employee working at state agencies and cut contracts with companies hiring visa holders.
“America is for Americans,” he declared during his opening 20-minute speech. “The brave thing for our brothers and sisters in Haiti or Brazil or Mexico or India or China – the brave thing for them to do is stay right where they are. Make their country great. The brave thing to do is not to come here on a H-1B and take a job from one of us. “
H-1B visas allow immigrants to work temporarily in the U.S. in specialty jobs, and President Donald Trump has supported increasing the number of those visas to allow entry by high-skilled workers. But there’s been backlash from “America First” conservatives, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced in late October that he was directing the state Board of Governors to prevent state universities from hiring foreign specialty workers.
Fishback said Monday that he was going to expand on DeSantis’ move, saying, “Every single foreign worker who has stolen a job from us will be relieved of their duties from state government by the time that the sun sets on my first day in office.”
“They’re gone,” he proclaimed.
Fishback says he wishes the governor was running for a third term (DeSantis is term-limited in 2026).
But he also is pushing hard on the affordability crisis in Florida. He said it doesn’t matter if the stock market had doubled recently in light of the high costs of groceries, property tax bills, auto insurance, and energy.
“I’ve said I’m going to stop construction of any AI data center that threatens to jack up our electric bills,” he said. “It’s just common sense. The idea that we have to pay the costs, have to shoulder the burdens of what others are doing, there’s a word for that. It’s called socialism.”
Can he compete with Byron Donalds?
Fishback’s entry in the Republican race for governor comes as Byron Donalds continues to dominate in public opinion polls, boosted by the early backing of Donald Trump. The Southwest Florida U.S. representative has raised more $30 million to date, dwarfing the totals of every other candidate from either party who has entered the contest.
Fishback told the Young Republicans that they “gotta respect” the work that Donalds has done for Floridians since he was elected to serve in the state House in 2016 and Congress in 2020. At another point, he called him a “great guy” and a “great father.” They met for three hours in August, he noted.
But he insists the two “have disagreements that are irreconcilable.”
When asked by a member of the audience what he could do to “separate” himself from Donalds, Fishback became uncharacteristically reticent, saying simply, “You do it by showing up.”
Fishback was somewhat dismissive of Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, who has seemingly been on the verge of announcing his own candidacy for governor for the past several months but has yet to pull the trigger. Fishback said he was frustrated that, while still serving in the Florida Senate, Collins had sponsored legislation that would have shielded pesticide companies immunity from so-called “frivolous” lawsuits. “
“A corporate system is a business that has immunity,” he said. “That is wrong. That is un-American. I’m always going to stand up for workers. I’m never going to allow any type of immunity.”
Anti-AIPAC
As part of his “America First” platform, Fishback said, he won’t take financial contributions from any organization “affiliated with a foreign country,” emphasizing that includes the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, better known as AIPAC.
Florida GOP U.S. Rep. Randy Fine has labelled Fishback a “total weirdo” and a “neo-Nazi.” Fishback said on Monday that he disavows all forms of hatred but wasn’t going to apologize for any of his stances, nor play “this game that you’re a racist. You’re Islamophobic. You’re antisemitic. Enough. Floridians have a right to exist in their own state. I’m not bending the knee to anyone.”
Audience questions 
Things got spicier as the evening wore on.
When a woman who described herself as a “recovering liberal” and current university instructor asked how Fishback would hold public universities accountable if they had rewritten DEI initiatives into something more palatable in the existing political environment, the candidate declared that, if elected, he would direct “every single university bureaucrat” to be interviewed by a member of his team to ask them “simple questions,” such as what was their reaction was to the assassination of conservative leader Charlie Kirk.
“If they use the words ‘contextualize,’ ‘gun rights, ‘He had it coming.’ — They’re out. And then guess what? Let ’em sue,” he said. “That’s how you actually eradicate an ideology.”
Fishback has never run for public office, nor voted in a GOP primary in Florida. That lack of involvement and experience was called out by Werther Marciales, policy director for the Florida Young Republicans, who asked: “Why should we trust you?”
Fishback responded that had he known he would ever run for office, he “probably” would have voted in some primaries. “I would have done things a lot differently,” he acknowledged.
But Marciales wasn’t placated. He referenced a lawsuit filed in 2024 by Fishback’s former employer, Greenlight Capital and DME Capital Management, alleging he had misrepresented his position in the company  to gain credibility for his own Azoria Partners. In September, Fishback acknowledged sharing confidential information and agreed to pay the hedge fund’s costs to resolve the lawsuit, according to Bloomberg.
When Marciales asked Fishback why his former employer sued him, Fishback said he would be happy to speak to him in private afterwards.
“No, why don’t you answer it here? Because you’re running for governor and I think people deserve to know,” Marciales said.
That led to shouts from the opposite side of the room, with one voice accusing Marciales of being “an attack dog” and another saying, “It’s not about you, dude!” before everyone moved on.
Despite that confrontation, some audience members told the Phoenix they agreed with many of Fishback’s stances, and bemoaned the fact that Trump has already weighed in on behalf of Donalds.
“The biggest thing I like about him is his message on H1-B’s and immigration. I think that’s probably the biggest thing that got Trump elected in the last election and it’s a huge topic for Americans, mostly young Americans,” said one audience member, who declined to provide his name.
“I think the race is wide open,” he added. “It’s early. A lot of things will come out. I like that Fishback’s oppo research is already dropping. He’s saying the right things. “
“I hated that the president came out and supported Donalds so quick, well before the election took place,” said another man who asked to be identified as Tim from Tampa. “There’s a lot of people trying to attack James in saying that he shouldn’t run, and that was just a huge red flag to me. Why shouldn’t he be running? It’s an election. It’s a democracy. It shouldn’t be just that ‘Oh, just because the president endorsed somebody, hey, nobody else is allowed to run.’ “",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-03 00:56:33.401022
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-03 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT needs a climate superfund, and it needs one now",Sydney Collins,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/03/connecticut-needs-a-climate-superfund-and-it-needs-one-now/,New York's Climate Superfund bill will raise $3 billion annually over 25 years without increasing energy costs to residents.  CT should have one.,"The principle behind the Climate Superfund is simple: we must make fossil fuel companies pay for the climate damage they have created, rather than leaving those costs to our neighbors and families. 
Without a Climate Superfund, Connecticut will continue to build financial burdens from climate change, including disaster relief, infrastructure repairs, and public health costs that will disproportionately impact low-income and vulnerable communities. 
Critics of the Climate Superfund often raise the concern: won’t the fee to fossil fuel companies simply be passed along to residents in the form of higher energy bills? That’s an important question to address, and one that several economists have already answered. 
As Nobel Prize–winning economist Joseph Stiglitz explained in a letter to New York’s governor, the Climate Superfund fee is based on companies’ past pollution, not their current production. That means it’s considered a fixed cost, which is something oil companies can’t simply pass on to consumers without risking their profits. In other words, this policy makes polluters pay their fair share for the damage they’ve already done without raising gas prices for the rest of us.
Additionally, the global prices of crude oil is set through supply and demand in a global market. Even large fossil fuel companies cannot raise pump prices in Connecticut without losing market competitiveness or incentivizing consumers to change behavior. 
In New York, the Climate Superfund bill will raise $3 billion annually over 25 years without increasing energy costs to residents. When similar settlements have occurred, including the federal Superfund law for toxic waste, there was no evidence of increased costs for customers.
The Climate Superfund will advance clean, affordable energy in Connecticut. Many households, especially in low-income communities, already spend a disproportionately large share of their income on utilities. A superfund can increase the state’s capacity for financial aid, such as utility assistance to alleviate energy poverty. Additionally, if funds from the climate superfund are directed towards retrofits, weatherization, and clean heating technology in low-income communities, this could help lower long-term energy costs and reduce energy burdens.
The Climate Superfund should be designed to provide stronger governance in how funds should be spent including prioritized funding for environmental justice neighborhoods and community engagement in project selection. This helps advance “energy democracy,” where communities have a voice in how funds are spent and can shape their local energy systems.
Some communities in Connecticut are disproportionately impacted by sea-level rise, flooding, heat waves, and storm damage, including those communities with older infrastructure, coastal neighborhoods, and low-income populations. A Climate Superfund recognizes these inequities and seeks to remediate historic harms by directing resources to mitigation, adaptation, and resilience projects that keep people safe and help our communities thrive. 
Opponents to the Climate Superfund believe that this is a tax that will impact consumers and businesses. However, these claims are based on the assumption that firms can freely pass these costs onto energy users. This has not been shown in existing superfund models. 
Additionally, some critics argue that this bill is not constitutional since the government cannot retroactively charge companies after the fact. However, long-standing ‘polluter pays’ principles in U.S. law have been upheld in court, including the federal superfund law (CERCLA) that has followed this model for toxic waste sites since the 1980s. Additionally, the superfund is not a ‘punishment,’ but rather a cost recovery mechanism to fix public harms from climate damages, and it is proportional based on each company’s share of historic greenhouse gas emissions. 
Connecticut is already paying for climate change through storm and flood costs, infrastructure damage, and public health impacts like asthma. These costs fall most heavily on taxpayers, especially households that already face high financial burdens. 
The Climate Superfund provides an alternative to make polluters pay, not residents. If Connecticut acts now by passing this state legislation, we can build more climate-resilient towns and cities without increasing environmental burdens to those that can least afford them. 
Join our efforts by signing our petition at act.sierraclub.org and urge our state leaders to pass a Climate Superfund.

Mike Dunleavy has approved a U.S. Defense Department request for Alaska National Guard service members to assist the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Anchorage with “administrative support,” the guard office announced Tuesday.
The Alaska National Guard said five service members will assist with “administrative and logistical” duties at the Anchorage ICE office for up to a year. 
“The Alaska National Guard members are administratively supporting the Enforcement & Removal Operations section and Homeland Security Investigations section, ensuring seamless operations at the Anchorage ICE office. Their mission includes a wide range of duties, from vehicle fleet management and safety compliance to office support and processing purchase orders,” the Guard statement said. 
The announcement included a list of clerical duties, including data entry and creating reports, answering phones, managing fleet vehicles and checking fire extinguishers. Officials said the partnership is authorized by Title 32 Section 502(f) of the U.S. Code, which enables National Guard members to perform additional duties under the direction of the President or Secretary of Defense. 
Grant Robinson, Dunleavy’s deputy press secretary, confirmed the governor approved the request.
“The Alaska National Guard members joined the guard to serve our nation. This support they are providing the Anchorage ICE office is in service of the nation,” he said by email Tuesday.
Grant did not say whether the National Guard would provide further assistance with immigration enforcement actions.
“Any future requests for administrative and logistical support will be considered on a case by case basis,” he said.
The Trump administration has continued to accelerate immigration enforcement operations, and officials have promised to “limit legal and illegal immigration,” after the shooting of two National Guard service members in Washington, D.C. last week. The Trump administration has also continued to roll back humanitarian programs for immigrants, including ending the temporary protected status of 330,000 nationals from Haiti last week.  
While ICE has been conducting mass raids, court house arrests and large-scale detentions and deportation operations across the United States, in Alaska ICE has focused enforcement efforts on specific individuals identified through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services or having interactions with law enforcement, according to the ACLU of Alaska. 
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage is the co-chair of the Alaska Joint Armed Services Committee and has been outspoken about his concerns about the Alaska National Guard being deployed domestically for “civil disturbance operations.” 
“I see it’s a long list of boring, banal administrative tasks that are in no way controversial or concerning in and of themselves,” he said of the National Guard announcement. “What’s concerning is that Alaska ICE is requesting additional support, and the assumption that I make is that it’s because Alaska ICE intends to be doing more detainments, and intends to be doing more field operations in which they’re going to need this administrative support behind them. So that’s my concern.”
Gray was reached by phone Tuesday leaving a meeting with U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan in Washington, D.C. Gray said he expressed his concerns at the meeting about the leadership of U.S. Department of Defense, which the Trump administration has renamed the “Department of War,” and Secretary Pete Hegseth. 
Gray said he’s also concerned about a wider chilling effect of ICE activity and increased immigration enforcement in Alaska.
“It’s going to increase fear, not only in the undocumented folks that might be in Anchorage and the rest of Alaska, but also fear in people who are here legally, and even U.S. citizens who might be mistaken for someone who might be undocumented,” he said. 
An October investigation by ProPublica found that more than 170 U.S. citizens were detained by ICE in raids and at protests, and the government does not track how many citizens are held by immigration agents. 
Dunleavy’s office did not respond to requests for comment on the concern around ICE overreaching its authority, and arresting and detaining U.S. citizens. 
“It seems that Alaska’s notorious SNAP backlog caused by a lack of workforce doing many of the tasks on this memo would be much better use of our Guard,” Gray added. “Why not deploy Guard members to feed Alaskans instead of deploying them to earn brownie points with the Trump administration?”
Cindy Woods, senior staff attorney on immigration rights with the ACLU of Alaska, said they have tracked at least 70 ICE arrests this year, as reported in the custody of the Alaska Department of Corrections. That’s an almost 500% increase from last year. 
“We have been seeing a growing ICE presence in the state and a growing trend of ICE enforcement,” she said. The ICE activity has been largely in Anchorage, she said. 
“We are very concerned about what this signals in relation to our state government’s willingness to cooperate with federal law enforcement, specifically in relation to ICE enforcement operations,” she said of the National Guard announcement. “I think it can’t be overstated the negative impact that increased enforcement has had across the country and Alaska, unfortunately, is not immune to that.”
An estimated 7.7% of the population, or more than 57,000 people, in Alaska are foreign-born, Woods pointed out, and the Trump administration’s continued restrictions on paths to legal immigration and citizenship, as well as humanitarian and refugee resettlement programs are impacting Alaskans. 
“It’s kind of an assault from both sides, and so we’re really concerned about that as well,” she said.
Woods said the ACLU is not aware of any U.S. citizens being detained by ICE in Alaska, but there is heightened scrutiny. 
“One case that we have heard of recently is of a longtime Anchorage resident who has been happily married and was going to their interview for their green card based on that marriage, and being arrested with basically accusations of marriage fraud,” she said. “And so we’re seeing folks who are in affirmative applications, who are not in any sort of civil enforcement proceedings, who are also being subject to heightened scrutiny and enforcement actions.”

Special election runoffs held Tuesday determined who will represent parts of Jackson and the Delta in two state Senate seats as well as who will serve as Hinds County Coroner.
The runoffs Tuesday were necessitated when none of the candidates received at least 50% plus one vote in special elections in November. The special elections were held to fill vacancies due to officials leaving in the middle of their terms.
In the runoff for Senate District 26, a seat representing areas of north Jackson and rural Hinds and Madison Counties, Canton municipal judge Kamesha Mumford appeared to best attorney Letitia Johnson in a race that saw more than a half-a-million dollars in campaign fundraising, WLBT reported. With about 95% of precincts reporting Tuesday night, Mumford had secured roughly 54% of the vote to Johnson’s 46% in the unofficial count Tuesday night, not including absentee ballots. The seat was left open when former longtime state senator John Horhn was elected mayor of Jackson in July.

Johnson, wife of NAACP President Derrick Johnson, had received an endorsement from Mississippi’s Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson. But it didn’t appear to draw votes from Mumford, who received endorsements from the mayors of two Jackson suburbs, Mayor Will Purdie of Clinton and Mayor Gene McGee of Ridgeland, as well as former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy.
Mumford touted her 18 years of legal experience during the campaign.
“When I get to the Capitol, my focus is going to be on measures that improve the quality of life for our residents: strong infrastructure, good roads and bridges, a solid quality education for our children, and public safety so we have safe neighborhoods,” Mumford told Mississippi Today in an interview during the campaign.
In Senate District 24, an area encompassing parts of Leflore, Panola and Tallahatchie Counties, Justin Pope on Tuesday night appeared to defeat Curressia Brown.
Pope, a corporate deputy with Progressive Health Group, reported he received 1,944 votes, or 54%, while Brown, a retired college educator, received 1,659 votes. The seat was vacated when longtime Sen. David Jordan of Greenwood retired earlier this year.

In the countywide runoff for Hinds County coroner, Jeramiah Howard appeared victorious over opponent Stephanie Meachum, head of the death division at the state Department of Health’s vital statistics office. Howard has been serving as interim Hinds County coroner since his predecessor, Sharon Grisham-Stewart, retired in 2024. With 95% of precincts reporting, he received about 58% of the unofficial vote to Meachum’s 42%. At that point in the count, voter turnout in the race hovered under 7% countywide.
Howard, who received Grisham-Stewart’s endorsement, had dominated in the November election with 41% of the vote out of six candidates after placing signs in most precincts across the county. He thanked his nearly thirty volunteers ahead of the Tuesday runoff.
“Running for office is a noble deed,” he said. “My fellow candidates ran good races and deserve credit for putting their name on the ballot and reaching people in the community.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04160842/Voting-5.jpg,,,2025-12-02 22:57:21.274933

At 21, Ali is set to become the youngest state legislator currently serving in Georgia, stealing the title of youngest lawmaker from Democratic Rep. Bryce Berry of Atlanta.
Ali and Cole were the top two candidates in a three-way race last month to represent House District 106, which encompasses a southwestern portion of Gwinnett County. The district was previously represented by Shelly Hutchinson, a Snellville Democrat who stepped down from the state Legislature earlier this year to care for a family member. 
Ali, who works as a graphic designer and served as the former first vice chair of the Gwinnett County Democratic Party, focused his campaign on issues like lowering the cost of living, supporting public schools and protecting the rights of immigrants and LGBTQ Georgians. He received support from key figures in Georgia’s Democratic establishment, securing endorsements from Hutchinson, House Minority Caucus Whip Sam Park, a Lawrenceville Democrat, and former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes, among others.
Cole, who serves as organizing director at an energy and environmental nonprofit, centered his campaign around issues like improving health care access and housing affordability, and investing in public schools. He was endorsed by figures like state Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat, and Gwinnett Solicitor General Lisamarie Bristol.
Though Cole received the most votes during the Nov. 4 special election, Ali pulled ahead during Tuesday’s runoff, receiving roughly 54% of the more than 1,700 votes cast in the low-turnout election.

Wes Moore speaks at Tuesday's meeting of the Chesapeake Executive Council at the National Aquarium. With him are Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, center, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, right. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Chesapeake Bay area leaders have officially committed to a new deadline for improving the health of the nation’s largest estuary: 2040.
The plan approved Tuesday by the state and federal policymakers on the Chesapeake Executive Council is a revised version of their 2014 agreement, which came with a 2025 deadline that bay states realized three years ago they were not going to meet. Tuesday’s vote at the National Aquarium in Baltimore ends months of debate over a new plan, which many environmental advocates have criticized as too slow and not ambitious enough.
The agreement includes goals on subjects from oyster restoration and wetland acreage to curtailing runoff. While the states reached some of their 2014 goals this year, they failed to reduce pollution levels by the pledged amount. Tuesday’s approval adds more time to the clock.
There has been some progress. Since 2009, pollution control practices in the various states are estimated to have reduced nitrogen runoff by 15.3%, phosphorus runoff by 21.8% and sediment runoff by 7.6%.
“We’re proud of that,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said Tuesday, “and there’s more work to do.”
Despite some gains, conditions in the bay and its tributaries have not improved markedly, as states dealt with increasing development and climate change. The most recent data indicates that just over 29% of bay waters met water quality standards, compared to 26.5% in the late ’80s.
The executive council on Tuesday also gave a key Bay Program committee the go-ahead to study the inclusion of Native American tribes in the pact, as chiefs of several Virginia tribes watched from the front row. The Indigenous Conservation Council, representing Virginia’s federally recognized tribes, had asked in January to be included but were told by Bay Program officials that they needed executive council approval first. Tuesday’s vote starts a study that is to be finished by July 1, 2026.

Moore said Tuesday that the bay cleanup effort would not be complete “without making sure that our tribal lands and our tribal peoples are deeply ingrained with any future vision that we have.”
While bay leaders touted the “ambitious but achievable” 2040 goals approved Tuesday, environmental advocates argued that — although improvements were made to the agreement after an unfavorable public comment period this summer — the final outcome remained imperfect.
Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, which represents more than 300 environmental nonprofits in the Chesapeake watershed, was particularly disappointed in the land conservation goal and the goal for public access sites. The plan calls for 100 new sites “providing access to natural lands and waters” by 2040, compared to the previous goal of adding 300 water access sites by 2025.
“We expect fully that we’re going to hit those targets before 2040,” Reilly said. “We are ready to have those conversations about what the next target should look like.
“It’s not like: We hit this in 2030, 2035. We’re done,” she said. “Let’s set another bar before 2040.”
During the public comment period, nonprofit groups and even some bay scientists expressed consternation that some of the goals had been set too low, or even revised downward — making them easier for the bay states to achieve. And they fretted about the draft agreement’s inconsistent deadlines. Some goals were due by 2030, others by 2035 or 2040.
They expressed concern, too, that the draft document was nearly silent on pollution limits that states are legally required to achieve under the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load, or TMDL standards, set during President Barack Obama’s (D) administration.
There were also semantic issues: The words “climate change” were replaced by vague references to “changing environmental conditions,” and the word “diversity” was scrubbed from the report.
In response, bay leaders made some changes, setting checkpoints along the way to the uniform 2040 deadline, and explicitly referencing their obligations under the Chesapeake Bay TMDL. But other things remained unchanged.

Maryland also pushed unsuccessfully this year for a 2035 deadline, instead of 2040. Maryland Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz said in an interview Tuesday that other states were hesitant because of the new data coming from computer modeling in the years ahead, but Maryland believed it could have achieved many of the goals 10 years from now, not 15.
“It’s also important for the public to see that there is urgency,” Kurtz said. “I understand that it’s hard for there to be urgency when you’ve been doing something for 40 years, but I think when you are undoing a hundred-plus years of damage, it’s going to take a little bit of time.”
Maryland found support from Virginia, which voted in favor of the 2035 deadline — for all but the pollution targets.
“I was ready to accelerate this whole pace,” Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) said Tuesday. “I think we’ve settled on a very good framework, a framework that sets 2040 as the next huge milestone date, and yet provides intermediate checkpoints along the way.”
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation had also pushed for a 2035.
“The main thing is we just wanted a deadline that was near-term, you know? Something that we could really push on,” said Hilary Harp Falk, president and CEO of the foundation. “But we did get mid-term accountability, which I think is a major improvement.”
David Fotouhi, deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, which is also a signatory to the bay agreement, said Tuesday that the EPA, under President Donald Trump (R) is “fully committed to restoring the Chesapeake watershed.”
After Trump’s first term, when he tried several times to eliminate funding for the EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program office, questions swirled about what a second Trump term might bring. But Trump did not attack the bay program in his first budget proposal, though other environmental agencies involved in bay work took big budget hits, and many lost employees in Trump’s effort to shrink the federal workforce.
“We will provide funding, technical expertise and data to support our state and local partners,” Fotouhi said on Tuesday. “We will support and coordinate partnership efforts, consistent with our authorities in the Clean Water Act, in Section 117. We will encourage innovation in land and water management, and we will ensure accountability and transparency, so that taxpayers know their tax dollars are making a tangible difference.”

Tuesday’s meeting drew a nearly full slate of governors, compared to prior years when many sent designees. Besides Moore and Youngkin, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer (D) and Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) were in attendance.
Moore, who had served as chair of the executive council since late 2023, passed the gavel to Shapiro, who was also recently chosen to lead the U.S.-Canada partnership for the Great Lakes. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation said in a news release that it marked the first time in “more than two decades” that a Pennsylvania governor has led the partnership.
“It’s important for me, as a Pennsylvanian, to be part of this conversation,” Shapiro said Tuesday. “For a long time, Pennsylvania took a back seat when it came to cleaning up the bay, and now we are helping lead that discussion.”
Moore gifted Shapiro with a fishing hat, and invited him for a Chesapeake fishing trip targeting invasive blue catfish. Shapiro, in turn, presented Moore with a blue crab-themed baseball cap.
Maryland is one of the states that has either achieved, or is on track to achieve, its pollution reduction commitments; Pennsylvania, with its higher density of farms, has fallen short on nitrogen and phosphorous reduction goals. As of 2024, it had cut nitrogen pollution to 104.5 million pounds, shy of the target of 77 million, and phosphorous to 3.6 million pounds, compared to a goal of 2.8 million pounds.
Collectively, the bay states had only achieved 59% of their nitrogen goal by 2024, compared to 92% of the phosphorus goal. The states, however, did achieve their goal to reduce sediment pollution.

The 11th Circuit Court’s ruling, which was released Monday, vacated the 2023 ruling and remanded the case to U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee due to a new precedent that was set by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2024.
“We find that it would be inappropriate at this juncture to address the merits of the plaintiffs’ First Amendment challenge,” the panel wrote in Monday’s ruling, instructing the district court to conduct a type of legal analysis outlined in the recent Supreme Court ruling, Moody v. NetChoice, LLC.
Senate Bill 202 passed in 2021 after President Donald Trump’s narrow defeat in Georgia. The law made several controversial changes to Georgia election law, including restricting the window of time voters have to request an absentee ballot, limiting ballot drop boxes, and implementing new voter ID requirements for absentee voting. It also contained a provision that made it a misdemeanor offense to hand out food and drinks to voters waiting in line.
The law gained national attention — and criticism — with Georgia-based businesses like Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines speaking out against the legislation, and Major League Baseball deciding to move its 2021 All-Star game out of the state. An episode of HBO Max’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” also depicted actor Larry David getting arrested for handing out a bottle of water to a voter in line.
Proponents of the law have argued that distributing food and water violates state and federal laws meant to prevent groups from buying votes through money or other means.
But opponents said the measure was cruel and discriminatory, pointing to reports of hourslong wait times at the polls in metro Atlanta during the 2020 election. Attorneys for the plaintiffs also argued that the law restricted Georgians’ First Amendment rights to free speech.
In 2023, Boulee upheld part of the ban on distributing refreshments to voters within a 150-foot “buffer zone” outside polling places. However, he temporarily blocked a provision banning volunteers from offering food and water within a “supplemental zone,” defined as 25 feet from any voter in line at a polling place, arguing that such activities count as “expressive conduct” and are therefore protected by the First Amendment. The appeals court heard arguments in the case this past August.
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s office declined to comment on the case, citing pending litigation. However, other state leaders, including Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, applauded the ruling.
“The 11th Circuit’s ruling reinforces a simple truth: Georgia has the right and the responsibility to shield voters from influence and interference at the polls,” Raffensperger said in a statement, adding “our laws safeguard every Georgian’s right to free, fair, and fast elections.”
Cory Isaacson, legal director at the ACLU of Georgia, which is representing the plaintiffs, said she was disappointed in the appeals court’s ruling, but said the organization planned to keep fighting. 
“It is important to note that the 11th Circuit didn’t reach the merits of whether or not this law is actually unconstitutional,” she said. “It instead sent it back to the district court to do a different analysis, so we remain hopeful that what’s right and lawful will prevail and that ultimately, we will see the line relief ban overturned again.”

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Gov. Bob Ferguson warned Tuesday that the budget proposal he’ll release this month will rely solely on spending cuts and not higher taxes to overcome what he says is a multi-billion dollar shortfall.
“That’s the plan,” Ferguson told reporters at the state Capitol. “I don’t plan on balancing the budget with revenue.”
“It’s a fluid situation, as you might imagine, but that is our focus right now,” Ferguson said.
The first-term Democrat also said he would not sign any increase in sales or property taxes, two tested options lawmakers could use to raise revenue quickly.
Ferguson’s comments offered the clearest insight yet on his approach to writing his first spending plan, due out in about two weeks. It puts him at odds with progressive Democrats clamoring for new taxes on wealthy residents and large corporations.
Shortly before Ferguson made his comments, state Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, held a press conference on the Capitol steps about payroll tax legislation he is sponsoring that would target larger companies with higher-paid employees.
He pointed to billions of dollars in spending reductions lawmakers made this year, as they also pushed through upward of $9 billion in new and higher taxes. Since then, estimates have shown tax collections falling below expectations.
“The question I would ask is: How many cuts is enough?” Scott said. “Revenue is the way that we solve many of the problems that are posed in front of us.”
The governor said he wasn’t familiar with Scott’s proposal.
Ferguson emphasized that the state’s looming financial decisions are tougher than the ones made in the two-year operating budget he signed in May, which dealt with a gap that the governor pegged at around $16 billion over four years. 
“We cut about $8 billion from the budget earlier this year,” the governor said. “So, as you might imagine, the ninth billion that you’re cutting is a lot more challenging to cut than the first billion.”
When asked why he was not turning to new tax revenue, given the difficult decisions he described, he said the kinds of new tax ideas Democratic lawmakers are talking about, including Scott’s bill, cannot bring in money fast enough to solve the state’s immediate budget problems.
“We have a multi-billion dollar shortfall this next year,” he said.
“That’s just a reality that the Legislature is going to have to grapple with as well,” Ferguson added. 
He vowed to veto sales or property tax increases if they reach his desk. “Those things are not going to happen,” he said.
Ferguson’s budget proposal will serve as a template for House and Senate budget writers during the 2026 legislative session that begins Jan. 12. Budget legislation approved next year will make adjustments to the two-year spending plan enacted this spring.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/washington-state-capitol-2048x1536-1-1024x768-1.jpg,,,2025-12-02 21:57:32.339354

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In a race that drew national attention and brought leaders from both major parties to Middle Tennessee to campaign, Republican Matt Van Epps pulled out a narrow win over Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn in the special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District. 
Van Epps edged Behn by nearly 7%  in a district Democrats have lost by more than 20 percentage points over the last several election cycles. With more than 95% of the votes counted, Van Epps pulled in 51.9% of the vote while Behn earned 47.1%.
In spite of the Republican win Tuesday, the Democratic surge became a focal talking point in a district President Donald Trump won by 22% in 2024 — and became a referendum on his second administration. 
Van Epps described himself as a “MAGA warrior” in his ads and promised to back up Trump, while Behn ran on a slogan of “Feed kids, fix roads, fund hospitals,” addressing messages to working-class Tennesseans. 
Behn, elected to the Tennessee General Assembly during a 2023 special election, has sponsored legislative measures to end the state’s 4% tax on groceries and a bill that would legalize marijuana and use the tax revenue from sales for highway repairs.

She won a four-way Democratic primary in October against three better-funded candidates, including two other state lawmakers. 
Van Epps, a West Point graduate and combat veteran who worked in Gov. Bill Lee’s administration, beat 10 Republicans in his primary, benefiting from large cash infusions by outside groups and Montgomery County’s pro-military voting bloc. The county is home to the U.S. Army’s Ft. Campbell and the 101st Airborne Division. 
Triggered by the July resignation of U.S. Rep. Mark Green, a Republican, the race morphed into one of national significance after the Nov. 4 elections across the country in which Democrats won gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey and Mississippi Democrats broke a Republican supermajority legislature. 
The election of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani as New York Mayor also played a factor in the Tennessee election, with Republicans comparing Behn negatively to him. 
Millions of dollars poured into the race, and national political figures became involved, with Trump endorsing Van Epps and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson stumping for the Republican nominee on Monday.  
Two former vice presidents — Al Gore, a native Tennessean, and Kamala Harris — weighed in on Behn’s behalf, as did U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York and Pramila Jayapal of Washington and the chairs of both the Democratic and Republican National Committees. 
Democrats last won District 7 in 1980, before once-a-decade redistricting moved then-U.S. Rep. Ed Jones, a Democrat, into District 8. 
During the 2022 redistricting process, Green expressed concern about new maps drawing portions of Nashville/Davidson County — which historically votes Democratic — into District 7, calling them “inherently unfair.”
After Democratic candidates lost to Green in both 2018 and 2020 by more than 30%, margins narrowed following the most recent redistricting. 
The 7th District has proven to be a launching pad for representatives: Don Sundquist, who held the seat from 1983 to 1997, became Tennessee governor, while Marsha Blackburn, who held the seat from 2003 to 2018, is now a U.S. Senator and gubernatorial candidate.

Jim McGreevey Tuesday to become Jersey City's new mayor. (Photos by Ed Murray/New Jersey Monitor)Jersey City Councilman James Solomon handily won election as Jersey City’s mayor Tuesday, fending off a challenge from former Gov. Jim McGreevey that had been McGreevey’s attempt to resurrect his political career.
Solomon’s victory comes four weeks after he and McGreevey finished in the top two slots after the first round of balloting in the city’s seven-person campaign for mayor, and nearly a decade after Solomon first rose to political prominence in New Jersey’s second biggest city.
Solomon will succeed the incumbent mayor, Steve Fulop, in January. Fulop, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nod for governor in June, is stepping down after three terms to take a job running a business advocacy group.
Solomon, 41, was first elected to the city council in 2017 to represent an area of Jersey City that includes its tony downtown and waterfront neighborhoods. He said in a debate last month that as mayor, he wants to improve the city’s schools, implement new rent controls, and oversee the development of more affordable housing.
Tuesday’s runoff was triggered when neither Solomon nor McGreevey won more than 50% of the vote on Election Day. They were the two top vote getters then, with Solomon winning 29% of the vote and McGreevey, 25%. Both are men are Democrats.
The contest had been seen as a fight between Jersey City’s Democratic establishment and the party’s progressive base. When McGreevey launched his bid for mayor, he had the backing of Hudson County’s political bosses, who largely abandoned him after his second-place finish on Election Day, while Solomon picked up the support of most of the mayoral candidates who failed to make it to the runoff.
The race had also been seen as a test of McGreevey’s political viability. A Jersey City native who later became a state assemblyman and Woodbridge mayor, McGreevey was elected governor in 2001 and resigned in 2004 after admitting to an extramarital affair with a man he had hired as an aide.
He returned to Jersey City more than a decade ago to manage a prison reentry program there.
This year marked the first time in over two decades that McGreevey’s name was on the ballot in New Jersey.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-03 00:59:49+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Bill to prioritize teacher quality over seniority faces uphill battle,Sam Drysdale | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/education/bill-to-prioritize-teacher-quality-over-seniority-faces-uphill-battle/,The proposal aims to revise how districts decide which teachers get laid off when budgets shrink or enrollment drops.,"A BILL TO prioritize high-performing and bilingual teachers over seniority during layoffs ran into some early resistance during its Tuesday hearing.
The proposal, backed by national nonprofit Educators for Excellence, aims to revise how districts decide which teachers get laid off when budgets shrink or enrollment drops. Senate Education Committee Chair Jason Lewis questioned whether it could undermine traditional tenure protections.
Instead of relying mainly on seniority, districts would be allowed to pilot a program to keep the teachers who are better qualified and have stronger performance ratings, as long as they hold the right certifications. Seniority could be used only as a last-resort tie-breaker when two teachers are otherwise equally qualified.
The bill (S 327 / H 711) defines “better qualified” teachers as those with the mandated certifications who have higher overall performance ratings, with student needs and criteria specific to each district’s collective bargaining agreement also taken into account. 
The bill also gives extra layoff protection to certain teachers even if they don’t yet have professional teacher status. Those include teachers working in high-needs or hard-to-staff schools, graduates of local “grow-your-own” programs, “Teachers of the Year,” and those fluent in languages spoken by many students in the district. 
Cedric Jacobson, a science teacher at Brooke High School in Boston and member of Educators for Excellence, said current rules, which prioritize seniority, often force districts to lay off newer, high-performing teachers from underrepresented backgrounds. 
“This undermines our ability to retain the highly qualified and diverse educators essential for student success,” Jacobson told the committee. He noted that 10 percent of Massachusetts teachers are people of color, while 45 percent of students are.
Jacobson highlighted research showing the impact of teacher diversity on student achievement.
“Black students who have had even one Black teacher are significantly more likely to enroll in college,” he said. “Representation dramatically impacts outcomes … And statewide, these young, diverse teachers are often the first to go when money is tight.”
De’Shawn Washington, a fourth-grade inclusion teacher at Maria Hastings Elementary School in Lexington, said the bill would allow districts to retain educators who have a strong impact on student learning. 
“Policies on seniority disproportionately affect excellent early-career educators working in high-need schools and communities,” Washington said. “This undermines student achievement, it erodes progress towards a more representative teaching force.”
Lisa Lazare, executive director of Educators for Excellence, said Massachusetts is one of only six states that require early-career teachers to be let go first when layoffs occur. 
“This inelegant approach disproportionately harms our newest educators, those we’ve worked hard to recruit because they better reflect the cultural, linguistic and needs-based backgrounds of the students they serve,” she said.
Lazar acknowledged that they have only had limited discussions with teachers unions. 
“We haven’t had a really strong conversation with the Massachusetts Teachers Association,” she said. “But we were able to have some beginning conversations with the AFT…they named that this is an issue, but they’re not necessarily sure what their solutions would be.”
Asked about the bill, Massachusetts Teachers Association President Max Page said the bill would “not achieve” the goals to attract “more educators in general, and more educators of color in particular.”
“We want to increase the diversity of the educator workforce by making teacher-preparation programs more accessible and affordable and increasing pathways for teacher licensure, which are captured in the Educator Diversity Act and Tomorrow’s Teachers Scholarship Program, initiatives that the MTA played a leadership role in winning in the Legislature,” Page said. 
The Educator Diversity Act was passed last year, encompassed in a larger bill. It creates alternative pathways to educator certifications, meant to lower barriers for applicants such as those who don’t speak English as a first language or don’t have master’s degrees.
Page continued, “Stripping away a set of workers’ rights leaves all educators — including educators of color — vulnerable to reductions in force carried out in arbitrary or unfair ways.”
Lewis asked Lazare about whether the bill would dismantle the state’s tenure system.
“If we were to pass a law like this, then what would it actually mean for a teacher to have tenure in that case? If, you know, they could lose their job regardless of their professional teacher status,” Lewis asked.
Lazare responded that the bill is not intended to eliminate seniority or tenure protections on a year-to-year basis. 
“This is in extreme moments when there’s a reduction in force triggered by budgetary and fiscal issues,” she said. “It adds measures of quality on top of seniority to support our students.”
Lewis emphasized shared goals with the bill’s supporters but urged further collaboration. 
“What I would say is, you know what the concerns are around this,” he said.
Lewis continued, “We share the exact same goals, right? We are completely 100 percent in agreement there… We want to continue to make this a priority, regardless of what happens with this particular proposal…bring us additional feedback ideas around ways to continue to diversify the educator workforce.”
The bill would take effect in 2026 and run through 2032. During that period, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education would evaluate whether the law increased the number of teachers of color in Massachusetts schools and submit a report to the Legislature.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Teacher_Classroom.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-02 20:58:34.346330

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia is one of the only states that does not provide needs-based financial aid for would-be students who struggle to pay for college.
But some state lawmakers are making the case that Georgia should change that, though there are disagreements over how best to pay for such a program.
A state Senate study committee released a report Tuesday calling for a comprehensive needs-based aid program for college students just a month before lawmakers are due to return to Atlanta for the 2026 legislative session. But the divisions over funding could make a plan tough to pass, particularly in an election year.
Sen. Nan Orrock. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“This is about affordability, and about opening doors,” said Sen. Nan Orrock, the Atlanta Democrat who chaired the state Senate Study Committee on Higher Education Affordability. “Swing wide the doors of higher education, post secondary programs, that will launch young people into successful lives and (they will) stay here in Georgia, and help to continue to build Georgia into the place that we know it can be, but affordability is absolutely the issue.”
The report calls on Georgia to establish a needs-based aid program modeled after those in states like North Carolina and Florida.
To be eligible, a student would need to have a high school diploma or equivalent and be enrolled in an eligible public university or technical college. They would also need to complete a FAFSA application, meet federal Pell Grant requirements with a high need for financial aid and satisfy minimum academic standards.
The awards would be based on the number of classes a student is enrolled in, and the aid would be administered by the Georgia Student Finance Commission, which also administers the merit-based HOPE Scholarship.
The committee’s report is also recommending that the new program be funded from the unrestricted reserves from the Georgia Lottery – a pool of money on top of the funds that are set aside for education funding and meeting shortfalls – which currently sit at $1.7 billion. The money could come either through direct appropriation each year, or through an endowment, in which a larger amount of money would be withdrawn and need-based scholarships would be funded by the interest earned on that money.
Georgia Budget and Policy Institute Senior Education Analyst Ashley Young said about $126 million in lottery funds could provide grants for just over 98,000 students in the 2026-2027 school year who would otherwise not be able to attend college or face massive debt.
“It can absolutely be transformative,” Young said.
Georgia student loan borrowers have the second-highest average student loan balance in the nation at $42,300, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Young said even though University System of Georgia enrollment is at an all-time high, the number of Pell Grant recipients in the system has decreased 5% over the last 10 years.
“It’s not as though they don’t want to go to college, it’s that they are finding it more difficult with increased cost of living to actually afford an option to go,” she said. “And so what we are seeing is that students are just choosing not to because they simply cannot afford it, not because they cannot be successful academically.”
Young said the lack of needs-based aid in Georgia also disproportionately affects Black students, who carry the highest student loan debt burden in the state’s university system.
Sen. Max Burns. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
But speaking after the meeting, state Sen. Max Burns, a Sylvania Republican and chairman of the Senate Higher Education Committee, expressed reservations about the proposed funding mechanisms.
“I think the lottery has done a great job for Georgia, I think HOPE has been an excellent tool, and certainly Gov. (Zell) Miller had a strong foresight when he put that program in place, but I don’t think you take funds or resources away from a successful program to fund something that you need, but have not yet developed a comprehensive way to address that. So I’m not a fan of using lottery dollars for this program.”
Burns said that lawmakers agree that a new approach for needs-based aid is needed, but he wasn’t optimistic about progress during the coming session, which falls during an election year and could likely run at a faster than normal pace.
“I think timing is a challenge,” he said. “I think in this session, we’re going to have to begin the process of understanding the problem and educating our colleagues in the Senate and in the House, seeing if we can come to an agreement about how we might choose to proceed. Can we make something happen in the near term? It’ll be difficult, but we certainly want to give it a go and have the conversation, but we’ll get to where we want to be. I feel that it’s important that Georgians have the opportunity to complete their education in a timely manner, with minimal debt.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC0199-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 20:58:34.346330

On Tuesday, a district judge ruled in favor of the landowner group in a lawsuit related to property rights. (Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A district court judge on Tuesday sided with a landowner group and found a North Dakota law related to underground storage of carbon dioxide to be unconstitutional.
The ruling from Northeast Judicial District Judge Anthony Swain Benson could have implications for the controversial Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project, which has a carbon dioxide storage permit from the state. 
The Northwest Landowners Association in 2023 sued North Dakota and the state Industrial Commission, which approves permits for permanent underground storage of carbon dioxide. The landowner group challenged a state law that requires landowners to allow carbon dioxide storage beneath their property if at least 60% of the affected landowners agree to the project. 
Benson writes in his order that the state law is unconstitutional because it allows a government-authorized taking of property without an avenue for “just” compensation determined by a jury. In this case, the property is pore space – cavities in underground rock formations where emissions can be trapped.
“The court is basically saying the constitution trumps that law, so that law can’t be enforced,” said Derrick Braaten, attorney for the landowner group. 
North Dakota Supreme Court allows landowner challenge to CO2 storage law to proceed

North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said late Tuesday his office was beginning to evaluate “possible legal avenues forward.”
“It’s a critically important question, and one where we believe the state, the duly elected state Legislature, properly balanced all of the interests involved and reached an outcome that respects private property rights, but also the needs of an economy moving forward,” Wrigley said.
In the case of Summit, about 92% of landowners in the storage area had chosen to participate in the project when the Industrial Commission approved the storage permit last year.
Troy Coons, chair of the Northwest Landowners Association, encouraged companies to move forward by working with landowners to obtain 100% voluntary participation in carbon storage projects. When that isn’t possible, eminent domain could be used for projects that have a public benefit, Braaten said. 
“Be a good partner. Show us it’s a good project, people will be involved,” Coons said.
Braaten said he believes the judge’s decision voids all orders issued by the Industrial Commission to require the participation of landowners in a carbon storage facility, a process known as amalgamation.
North Dakota landowners bring challenge of CO2 storage law to state Supreme Court

Wrigley said he was still digesting the order late Tuesday and could not comment on potential impacts to project permits.
Benson initially dismissed the landowner group’s lawsuit, citing procedural issues. In August, the North Dakota Supreme Court sent the case back to the district court for another look.
Summit Carbon Solutions and other energy companies with carbon dioxide storage projects in the works intervened in the case in support of North Dakota law. The North Dakota Farm Bureau and other landowners joined the landowner group in the lawsuit.
Braaten said he anticipates the state and Summit will likely appeal to the state Supreme Court.  
Meanwhile, Braaten is representing a group of landowners challenging the legality of the permit granted by the Industrial Commission for Summit Carbon Solutions’ carbon storage project. The parties are awaiting a decision from South Central Judicial District Judge Jackson Lofgren in that case.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-03 00:51:38+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Nuclear energy should be part of our carbon-free future,Kevin Knobloch and Armond Cohen,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/nuclear-energy-should-be-part-of-our-carbon-free-future/,Nuclear technology has evolved dramatically since the Pilgrim-era reactors started operation in the 1970s.,"MASSACHUSETTS HAS ALWAYS solved big challenges. And there is no bigger challenge than creating a reliable, carbon-free energy system while serving an electrified, data-driven innovation economy.  
That’s why, as longtime climate protection advocates, we applaud Gov. Maura Healey for asking the University of Massachusetts Lowell to map potential pathways for advanced nuclear fission and fusion energy in the Bay State.  
Led by Sukesh Aghara, associate dean of UMass Lowell’s Francis College of Engineering, the nuclear energy roadmap project will hold the last of a series of webinars to brief interested communities and stakeholders about its goals and process on Wednesday, December 10, at noon. Stakeholder group meetings for nine focus areas have also been scheduled from December 9 through January 9 to help guide the roadmap’s development. 
The challenge is huge. To meet our climate goals, we have to reduce our reliance on burning fossil fuels by electrifying our transportation, buildings, and industry, while meeting new electrical demands from AI infrastructure and other cybereconomy applications. That means we need to double our capacity while eliminating fossil fuel emissions from our grid. 
The scale involved is staggering. To take one example, meeting the Bay State’s climate goals by adding offshore wind would require commissioning a mammoth new offshore wind farm – one and a half times the size of Vineyard Wind – every year from now until 2050. 
Renewable energy is an essential piece of the puzzle, but it can’t meet all of our demand reliably at reasonable cost. Solar energy provides about 5 percent of our in-state power today and wind energy less than 1 percent.  
We can and should expand those sources. But a zero-carbon grid will be more achievable if we are able to add clean energy sources that can run 24/7/365. Deep advanced geothermal energy is one such option, as is additional hydropower from Quebec and gas with carbon sequestration. But deep geothermal is still in early stages, hydro is limited by Canada’s own needs and transmission constraints, while carbon sequestration geology is limited in our region. 
That leaves a major opening for nuclear energy. You may be surprised to learn that Massachusetts already gets a quarter of its electricity from nuclear energy. But those electrons come from nuclear power plants in New Hampshire and Connecticut since, in 2019, we closed our last in-state nuclear power plant, Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station in Plymouth, at the end of nearly 50 years generating zero-carbon electricity. 
Nuclear technology has evolved dramatically since the Pilgrim-era reactors started operation in the 1970s. Westinghouse’s gigawatt-scale AP1000 reactor, two of which were recently commissioned and are running well in Georgia, is based on “passive safety” principles. It can shut down and release excess heat without intervention from operators, thus further minimizing the prospect of meltdowns that accompanied earlier generations of nuclear reactors.  
Advanced small modular reactors (SMRs) now being demonstrated offer other advantages such as accident tolerant fuels and small unit sizes that can be deployed incrementally for municipalities, factory complexes, data centers, military bases, and university campuses –and to better equip utilities to respond to heat waves and deep-freeze spells. 
Massachusetts is well-prepared to lead this new wave. One of our all-star homegrown companies, Cambridge-based GE Vernova, is on track to build four of its BWRX-300 SMRs in Ontario and is well positioned to start building SMRs here in the US.  MIT ranks second in the country among nuclear engineering programs, while UMass Lowell’s Nuclear Engineering and Science program is also among the top programs nationally. Both institutions operate small-scale research nuclear reactors. 
We also lead on an exciting new technology: fusion energy. Unlike today’s nuclear fission plants, a fusion plant fuses rather than splits atoms, a process which avoids the tricky challenge of controlling a fission chain reaction and can substantially reduce the generation of radioactive waste. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, an MIT spinoff, is capitalized with $3 billion and could be the first private company to produce net fusion energy in their pilot plant in Devens.  
As longtime environmentalists, we appreciate the history of opposition to nuclear energy in the US, which dates to at least the Three Mile Island reactor accident in 1979. But today’s realities are different: Climate change risks are increasingly more urgent to address, electricity demand is growing faster than renewable deployment, and the US reactor fleet has a strong safety record built over the past 25 years, with advanced nuclear designs promising even greater safety. In this context, we believe it’s time for an updated consideration of this zero-carbon energy solution. 
Yes, nuclear energy has its challenges. Recent “one off” nuclear plants have proven expensive, so we need to move toward standardized plants as part of a regional and national program. We need to rebuild the supply chain and workforce. And we need to resolve the nuclear waste question through the creation of multiple long-term regional repositories powered by a consent-based siting process, as the governments of Finland, Sweden, and Canada have. The US Department of Energy has begun a similar process. 
We welcome the exploration of the role of nuclear energy in the Bay State and have confidence that Massachusetts will once again rise to a critical challenge.

Secretary of State Steve Hobbs told the Justice Department in September that he would be willing to provide voter names, addresses, genders, years of birth, voting records, registration dates and registration numbers. But he wouldn’t give dates of birth, driver’s license numbers or the last four digits of social security numbers. He wrote that information is protected under Washington law.
The Trump administration had requested the voter data from Washington amid its ongoing search for evidence to back up President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud caused by immigrants without legal voting status.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in western Washington, sets up yet another clash between the Trump administration and the Democratic-led government in Washington state.
The Justice Department is asking a judge to order Hobbs to provide the state’s voter registration list, including either voters’ driver’s license numbers or the last four digits of their social security numbers. 
The 7-page complaint alleges Hobbs’ decision violates the federal Civil Rights Act of 1960. The law states that election officials have to provide certain voter information to the U.S. attorney general if it is demanded. It gives federal courts the power to compel states to hand over the records.
“Accurate voter rolls are the cornerstone of fair and free elections, and too many states have fallen into a pattern of noncompliance with basic voter roll maintenance,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. “The Department of Justice will continue filing proactive election integrity litigation until states comply with basic election safeguards.”
Hobbs spokesperson Charlie Boisner said the secretary of state’s office’s “only knowledge of this lawsuit is through media requests and subsequent reporting.” 
“I have not been served,” Hobbs told reporters Tuesday after he and Gov. Bob Ferguson certified the state’s November election results. “I don’t know if they’re going to do that and nothing has changed. So I’m not handing over private information.”
Ferguson said he was “very confident we’ll be successful in court.”
“Why the Trump administration is choosing to file this lawsuit, that’s for them to answer,” he said. “But I am confident in how this all ends when it comes to litigation with the Trump administration, which is Washington state wins.”
The Trump administration says it wants the records to ensure states are complying with the National Voter Registration Act requirements to remove voters who are ineligible from their voter rolls and Help America Vote Act prohibition on processing voter registration applications without verifying the applicants’ identity.
But in his response in September, Hobbs wrote that he feared the information would be shared with the Department of Homeland Security to fuel the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown. He notes that the information he is willing to give “should be more than sufficient to assess Washington’s list maintenance efforts.” 
Hobbs, a former Democratic state senator, told the Justice Department he was also concerned the collection could violate federal privacy law, a concern he reiterated on Tuesday.
“In addition to ensuring that Washington’s voter registration list complies with all applicable federal and state laws, my obligation also includes protecting Washington voters from unnecessary and illegitimate intrusions on their privacy,” he wrote in September.
Hobbs didn’t receive a response to his letter from federal officials, Boisner said.
The lawsuit doesn’t come as a surprise, though. Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant attorney general in the DOJ’s civil rights division, recently said “we will definitely be taking action to enforce our federal civil rights law” and get Washington state’s voter rolls. 
The Trump administration has used a variety of means in its attempts to obtain data from states it otherwise wouldn’t have access to. 
Washington is one of six states the Department of Justice filed suit against Tuesday, attempting to access voter files. The feds previously sued another half-dozen states over the same issue in September. Two others were sued earlier, bringing the total to 14 states going to court with the Justice Department.

Only Indiana and Wyoming are known to have given their full voter registration lists to the Department of Justice, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Others, like Washington, have provided publicly available information.

Now Samantha Strable is facing charges in Wyoming over hunting.Samantha Strable, a Great Falls woman who got in trouble with the Australian government over a wombat earlier this year, was charged last month with eight misdemeanors related to hunting violations in Wyoming.
Strable is charged with six counts of false swearing, one count for taking an animal and another count of non-resident hunting without a guide. The charges were filed by Sublette County Deputy Attorney Damon A. DeBernardi. 
The counts relate to obtaining a Wyoming resident hunting license without having residency there. The charges were filed on Nov. 18 and she was booked on Nov. 21, according to the Cowboy State Daily.
Strable did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.
Court documents say Wyoming Fish and Game began their investigation following an anonymous tip on Aug. 11. 
“Samatha Strable continues to buy resident tags even though she hasn’t resided in Wyoming over two years- and brags about it on social media to over 90k followers,” said the court documents, quoting the tip.
The investigation found that in 2023 she moved out of the Pinedale, Wyoming address she used to obtain her tags. According to court records, she worked for a company called Kleinfelder as “Professional/Fauna Spotter/Catcher/Ecologist” and left that job in March 2024.
Wyoming state law stipulates a person loses their residency for game and fish licenses if they are out of the state for more than 180 days in a calendar year or “abandon their domicile in Wyoming,” court records state.
Additionally, the court documents also provide references to several Instagram posts documenting her time in 2024 and 2025 as a “wildlife biologist in Montana.” Court records state her car has Montana plates and is registered to a Cascade County address.
Court documents go on to say that posts “believed” to be Strable say she was seeking Alaskan residency this year. And, in fact, Strable is in possession of a valid Alaskan driver’s license, according to the affidavit.  
She got hunting licenses using her old Wyoming address three times in 2024 and three times in 2025. She was hunting elk, antelope, mountain lions and black bears. She also received a year-long resident fishing license in 2024. She did take a mountain lion in 2025, which is one of the charges.
Based on those facts, Wyoming Fish and Game applied for and received a search warrant for her phone records and were able to determine where she was during those two years. She was in Wyoming 35 days in 2024 and 8 days in 2025.
On Oct. 15, the Game Warden, Jacob Miller, investigating Strable contacted her at a trailhead in Sublette County, Wyoming.
Miller said he asked her where she lived.
“Wyoming. Well Montana originally,” was her response, according to court records.
She was asked if she lived in Pinedale, Wyoming.
“Well I’ve been back and forth. I’ve been to Alaska for the last couple of months,” said Strable, according to court records.
She then allegedly lied about how many days she was in Wyoming during the last two years.
“I then told her that I knew she was not in the state that much. I told her I believed she was in the state for 7 days in 2025 and 29 days in 2024,” Miller wrote in the affidavit. “Strable’s response was, ‘That’s not the case. I was here for way more than that.’ She then asked, ‘OK, how do you plan on proving that?’”
The Wyoming charges are not the first time she’s come under fire this year. Strable picked up a baby wombat and ran with it down a road in Australia earlier this year. Strable then released the wombat on the side of the road.
This drew commendation online and even among Australian government officials, with one going so far as to say, “I can’t wait for Australia to see the back of this individual.”
In an email earlier this year to the Daily Montanan, Strable defended herself and addressed the controversy.
“While the prime minister wishes harm on me for picking up a wombat, I implore you to take a good, hard, look at what is currently being done in Australia surrounding the real issues it faces, the lack of power for tens of thousands of Aussies, and the treatment of its native wildlife,” Strable wrote in a statement. “Then, decide for yourself, if I, a person who certainly makes mistakes, am really your villain.”
Strable, who was homeschooled in Great Falls and wrote pieces for the Tribune, is an avid hunter and was also at one time part of the Montana Game Wardens Charitable Trust Youth Hunter Program.

Gov. Jim Pillen announced his reelection campaign earlier this year, which picked up President Donald Trump’s endorsement. The only other announced GOP candidate is a combat medic veteran, Jacy Todd of York. Trump donor and multi-state agribusinessman Charles Herbster has been considering jumping into the primary, which would set up a rematch with Pillen. 
Walz was considered a moderate during her time in the statehouse.  She said she is not focused on partisan fights but on “what needs to be done to better the lives of the people who live here.”
The last time Nebraska had a Democratic governor was 1999, when former Gov. Ben Nelson was term-limited. Registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in Nebraska by roughly 2-to-1, with about 22% of the state’s registered voters listed as either nonpartisan or with a third party.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Nitrate concentrations, exacerbated by a wet spring that followed years of dry conditions, reached near record highs in Iowa rivers this summer. 
Concentrations are typically elevated in the summer. The past several years, nitrates have dropped to near-zero concentrations in late summer through early winter. But this year, concentrations in rivers and in central Iowa’s drinking water have remained high. 
Water quality advocates say the 2025 trend is further evidence that the state should prioritize long-term funding for water quality monitoring. Monitoring that included a longer timeline, they say, would show if these trends were consistent with similar weather patterns in the past, or indicative of what many have called a water quality crisis in the state. 
Larry Weber, the director of hydroscience and engineering in the College of Engineering at the University of Iowa, said regardless of where this year stacks up compared to previous years, it’s clear that nitrate concentrations have increased in Iowa over the past decades. 
“Not only should we have the sensors we have, we should have more out there to provide a more uniform network across the entire state,” Weber said.

Des Moines Water Works collects and publishes data on samples of its finished water, or water that has been treated at the facilities, and of its source waters, including the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers. 
This summer, Iowa Capital Dispatch compared nitrate concentrations in 2024 and 2025 using data from Des Moines Water Works. The below graphics show the data from the summer with continued comparison through Nov. 24, 2025. 


Melissa Walker, communications and outreach manager for Des Moines Water Works said in a statement that it is “not unprecedented” for levels to increase in the fall months. This is usually due to fall fertilizer application and precipitation.
Walker said the Raccoon River also had high levels of nitrate concentration in November and December of 2014 and 2015, when the state experienced a “similar weather pattern of a multi-year drought period followed by a wet fall.” 
Nitrate concentrations in central Iowa over the summer were similar to levels recorded in 2013, though this year marked the first time that Central Iowa Water Works was forced to issue a lawn watering ban to keep system demand low enough to remain within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency safe drinking water limits for nitrate. 
The EPA holds that nitrate concentrations below 10 milligrams per liter are safe to drink. This limit was set to mitigate the risk of blue baby syndrome, which can be fatal to infants. 
Des Moines Water Works has a nitrate removal system that runs when levels in source water, the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, are too high to be mixed and meet EPA compliance.


Walker said while levels are “higher than average” this fall and heading into winter, it has not been high enough to require use of the nitrate removal system at the plants. 
The system ran for 122 days in 2025 and shut off in August, according to Walker. She said levels have been low enough in the Des Moines River and the infiltration gallery, a series of underground pipes that collects alluvial ground water through more than three miles in Water Works Park, to continue making water within EPA limits. 
Des Moines Water Works has recently called for efforts to reduce upstream pollution. It opposed a recent EPA decision to not label segments of the source water rivers as impaired due to their nitrate concentrations. 
Colleen Fowle, the water program manager with Iowa Environmental Council, said the elevated levels this fall “highlight that the problem isn’t going away.” 
Fowle said many Iowans only think of the nitrate issue during something like the lawn watering ban, or during the early flushes of summer when concentrations are highest. 
“But public water suppliers don’t have that luxury, and they are thinking about these levels every single day, because they’re tasked with delivering safe water to us,” Fowle said. 
While Des Moines Water Works offers easily accessible data, the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers are not the only rivers through Iowa that have had elevated nitrate concentrations through fall 2025. 
Data from the Iowa Water Quality Information System or IWQIS, show other major rivers have also been elevated above past years. 
Most of the sensors show data back to 2021, though some are newer and don’t show data beyond 2025. 
A sensor on the Cedar River in Palo shows 2025 levels in the river were higher this fall than in the previously monitored years, aside from small spikes.
Graph via IWQIS.
The differences in the Cedar River and also in the Iowa River, at a sensor located in Iowa City, are less drastic than those observed in Des Moines along the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, but still show elevated levels through fall 2025. 
Graph via IWQIS.
Weber said precipitation along with livestock operations, manure and fertilizer applications to fields are the “key factors” in the trend of higher nitrate concentrations. 
“This long-term, continually evolving trend towards higher levels … this is just the status and trend of where the state is going,” Weber said. 
While this fall was fairly dry, he said it wasn’t quite as dry as the previous couple of falls which likely had lower nitrate levels because of abnormal dryness. 
In addition to river monitoring, IWQIS has sensors on several tiles, or underground pipes connected to agricultural land, that outlet to streams. According to the data in the system, these tile lines have consistently high – between 10 and 30 mg/L – concentrations of nitrate, throughout most of the year. Unlike the river data, these concentrations are not noticeably higher in 2025 than other recorded years. 
Weber said when comparing 2025 to the data in the system, which goes back only to 2021, 2025 looks like the outlier. But really, he said, 2025 is closer to “normal hydrologic conditions” for Iowa. 
“This year in many parts of the state, we’ve had some persistent rains that have kept those tiles flowing, and when the tiles are flowing, the nitrate concentrations are high,” Weber said. 
Tiles help to drain excess water, often along with nutrients applied to and naturally occurring in the soil, from cropland. When the soil is moist, the tiles flow. When the soil is dry, the tile isn’t shipping those soil nutrients downstream.
Archival data from the U.S. Drought Monitor shows more severe drought conditions across the state in the fall months of 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 than what Iowa experienced this fall. 
Weber said the conversation around nitrate concentrations is consistently about comparing this year to last year, or this month to that month, but he said that’s where the “argument gets lost.” 
“What we can convincingly say is that if we go back 75 years ago, it was one milligram per liter,” Weber said of nitrate concentrations in Iowa rivers. “Fifty years ago, it was two to three milligrams per liter and now we’re consistently in the six to eight milligrams per liter — with many times above 15 to 20 — and that’s simply high compared to where we were 50 years ago.”
Farm groups say water quality is improving
An increase in nitrate concentration over this time period in Iowa rivers is shown in a recent Polk County-commissioned study, the Central Iowa Source Water Resource Assessment, which pointed to agriculture as the number one contributor to the increased levels. 
A recent opinion column signed by farm commodity groups and published by Iowa Farm Bureau disputed claims made about the report and instead argued that Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy data show Iowa water quality is improving. 
The strategy’s collected data on nitrate load, divided by streamflow each year, show that since the early 2000s, when the monitoring began, the five-year average nitrate load in Iowa rivers has decreased. 
The nutrient strategy collects data to show the impact that conservation strategies, like cover crop adoption, buffer strips and reduced tillage, have on the nutrient load that eventually ends up in the Mississippi River. 
The opinion article from the farm commodity groups, including Iowa Farm Bureau, Iowa Corn Growers Association, Iowa Soybean Association, Iowa Pork Producers Association, Iowa Cattlemen Association and Iowa Nutrient Research & Education Council, said “progress takes time, but it is happening.” 
“Iowa farmers care deeply about the land and water they use to grow their crops,” the opinion article read. “To move forward, we must reject misleading generalizations and instead focus on proven, science-based solutions. Iowa’s water quality challenges are real, but so is the progress we’ve made and our resolve to do more.”
United call for information
According to Weber, the IWQIS sensors were placed to monitor individual practices and tile lines, the nutrient load leaving the state and to look at targeted watersheds for nitrate removal systems.
In 2023, the Legislature redirected funding from the monitoring system. It was temporarily propped up by money from the Walton Family Foundation, but is set to expire in summer 2026. Weber has been pleading with the state and local governments to support the monitoring system. 
Already, Polk County has pledged $200,000 to keep the monitors running, and other populous counties are considering similar allocations. 
Weber is focusing on funding the system, which needs about $600,000 annually to operate.
“I’m not asking for money for us in our program,” Weber said. “I’m asking for money for the people of Iowa, because this network is important in protecting their health and understanding the water quality concerns that we have statewide.” 
Fowle with IEC, which has advocated to fund IWQIS, said it’s “unprecedented” for a coalition of nonprofits to enter an upcoming legislative session, “pretty much all in agreement” that funding the system is a the  “first step” to help solved the water quality “crisis” in the state.
“This isn’t going to be solved overnight, but there are some steps we can take in the short term and in the long term,” Fowle said. “First and foremost, we have to make sure we have good data, and that data is accessible to everyone in Iowa.”

The group, established in 1983, includes the governors of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, the six states in the bay’s 64,000 square mile watershed; the mayor of Washington, D.C.; and the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Shapiro, who was elected unanimously at the council’s annual meeting, noted the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science gave the upper bay the second best grade in its 2025 Chesapeake Bay and Watershed Report Card. That’s the portion most affected by Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania, historically, has failed to meet the commission’s goals. The commonwealth, and to a lesser extent, West Virginia are outliers with decades of shortfalls in reducing agricultural runoff. Experts say prior agreements have failed despite binding limits on nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment, which are released as a result of fertilizer use and erosion, because of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s reluctance to penalize Pennsylvania and other states that fall short of goals.
The Susquehanna River, which supplies about half of the bay’s fresh water and is the bay’s largest tributary, flows through Pennsylvania and receives water from dozens of tributaries in the commonwealth. It empties into the north end of the bay near Havre de Grace, Maryland.
Shapiro credited Pennsylvania’s Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding, Environmental Protection Secretary Jess Shirley, Conservation and Natural Resources Secretary Cindy Dunn and Deputy Chief of Staff Sam Robinson, who oversees environmental policy, with carrying on the work started under former Gov. Tom Wolf.

“We have made progress, largely under their leadership, by giving local communities the tools and the funding to improve their local watersheds, plant forested stream buffers and to restore wetlands,” Shapiro said. “And we did it by working with landowners and with farmers, because when our waterways are healthy, they have more opportunity.”
Shapiro said Pennsylvania has reduced its run off of nitrogen, a component of fertilizer that is a major pollutant, ten fold compared to the previous decade. The state has also planted nearly 1,000 miles of forest buffers along streams and restored 139 miles of stream.
He also said the partnership with the other Chesapeake Bay states, the federal government and non-governmental organizations such as the Indigenous Conservation Council allowed Pennsylvania to achieve its progress.
“Now more than ever, there is an importance to multi state alliances, an importance to states working together to solve the big problems that we are facing in this nation,” Shapiro said. “And I think more than ever, states need to rally together to continue to make progress on the things that matter most.”
As chair, Shapiro said he would work to continue and accelerate collaboration between the states and organizations to put the revised Chesapeake Bay agreement into practice and create a sustainable and streamlined program.
“We live by three letters in Pennsylvania.

The other tracts, also largely vacant, would be readied and prepared to attract other industry and business. While the park’s development team says it is in the process of acquiring three sites, other land buys could follow.
“We’re not stopping there. We’re continuing to look at other sites,” said Michael Maroney of Omaha Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit working on the business park venture with partners including the Omaha Inland Port Authority.
The update on the business park — and other state funding-fueled projects poised to emerge within the 3,000 acres governed by the port authority in northeast Omaha and near Eppley Airfield — came Tuesday at a community briefing hosted by OIPA executive director Garry Clark.
Nearly 80 people came, including speakers Mayor John Ewing Jr., Greater Omaha Chamber CEO Heath Mello and State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who also is president of the OIPA board.
 $11 million stall 

In another key update, McKinney said he was optimistic there soon would be a breakthrough on the roughly $11 million in interest funds the State of Nebraska has not yet turned over to the OIPA.
As previously reported by the Nebraska Examiner, the port authority, backed by Ewing and Mello, sent an Oct. 20 letter seeking the immediate release of state funds it said are due to the authority under state statute.
Port authority leaders say state is withholding funds, slowing economic progress in northeast Omaha

OIPA had requested the installment in July. Nebraska’s state treasurer at the time resisted, according to the letter. Newly installed State Treasurer Joey Spellerberg set up a meeting to discuss the matter this week, and Clark said he, too, was optimistic.
Without those dollars, Clark and McKinney said, a couple of on-deck initiatives could not launch as planned. In collaboration with expert partner groups, the port authority seeks to implement a program that helps residents in the district repair, improve and own homes. 
The group also plans to seed an entrepreneurial fund and revolving loan in which businesses and startups could access dollars to help create jobs and build wealth in the community.
Clark described those efforts as “low-hanging fruit” that could get moving relatively quickly and spur momentum for the relatively new port authority district. The group’s nine-member board was installed in 2024. It hired Clark as executive director this summer. 
 Modular, 3-D, timber housing 

Currently, the port authority oversees about $120 million in state investment: $90 million for the business park and $30 million for an innovation district.
The $90 million previously appropriated by the Nebraska Legislature was intended to develop shovel-ready ground that would lure new jobs and commerce to historically disenfranchised neighborhoods of north and east Omaha.

A group led by Maroney, Burlington Capital and the Omaha Chamber was awarded the grant for the park in early 2024, and immediately faced criticism in part from residents stunned to learn their homes appeared to be in the path of the project.
Since then, the development team has vowed not to pursue residential property for the business park project. It also has pivoted from an earlier focus on a single larger site to multiple campuses.
Clark said discussions are underway to transform one of the sites into a “creative housing” hub where construction technology-focused workers might develop nontraditional housing in the form of modular, 3-D or cross laminated timber structures. He said it could help the local housing shortage, as well as provide commercial products to distribute elsewhere.
Maroney said his team currently has three noncontiguous sites under option to buy and is in a “due diligence phase.” One property is near 14th and Locust Streets, a possibility that had been aired previously but downplayed because of environmental cleanup expenses. 
He declined to name the two other sites until the process was further along. The OIPA board must approve the purchases.











“This is a true opportunity for shifting the narrative. 


– Garry Clark, Omaha Inland Port Authority



On the $30 million for a more techy innovation district, a consultant hired to frame the development process is to present its plan for approval by the OIPA board yet this year. The consultant has been gathering input from community members and other sources the past several months.
At Tuesday’s meeting, Clark recognized then-State Sen. Justin Wayne of North Omaha for championing the initial legislation five years ago that allowed for the creation of five inland port authorities across Nebraska, joining others nationwide. Wayne was unable to attend, officials said, due to previously scheduled travel.
The group also recognized Gov. Jim Pillen with a certificate, though he was unable to attend.
 ‘Shifting the narrative’

To help carry out the Omaha port authority operations, Wayne and McKinney helped secure additional dollars from the Legislature by directing interest from several state funding pots, including the Perkins County Canal and new prison projects. That is where the first $11 million installment is to come from.

In providing an overview of port authority activity, Clark told the group that pioneers in Omaha’s north and east neighborhoods fought for equity and economic opportunity but faced barriers such as redlining and lack of resources.
“This is a true opportunity for shifting the narrative,” he said.
Ewing said the port authority is poised to help carry out one of his goals as mayor.
“This is what intentional economic development looks like,” he said.



What is an inland port authority
Inland port authorities were intended as a tool to help stimulate jobs and businesses. Nebraska lawmakers bestowed powers on such entities, which must be approved by the state as well as the city, that include selling bonds to finance construction and infrastructure within the designated zone.
Legislative tweaks in 2024 gave the Omaha port authority additional muscle and funding sources. The Omaha entity also is obligated to construct at least 150 new apartments and 20 new houses within the boundaries. 
Omaha’s port authority boundaries cover nearly 3,000 acres in northeast Omaha and near Eppley Airfield. Its leaders say it contains about 15,000 households, 984 vacant lots and 377 acres of developable land. They say the average income is about $34,000.

Spencer Cox speaks during an artificial intelligence summit on Dec, 2, 2025. (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Government should not be telling tech companies how to develop their artificial intelligence, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox says, but it must be in the business of protecting children.
“The minute you decide to use those tools to give my kid a sexualized chat bot, then it’s my business and it’s the government’s business, and we are going to get involved,” he told a room full of tech executives at an AI Summit the Utah Department of Commerce hosted on Tuesday.
Cox has had a long complicated relationship with social media and artificial intelligence. And, while he doesn’t believe the government should be telling companies how to develop technology, he said he believes it must dictate some limits.

And the federal government should not interfere with that effort, he said. 
“However much you hate social media, you do not hate it enough. You do not hate these companies enough,” he said.
His remarks came just days after 12 Republican Utah lawmakers signed a letter urging Congress to reject a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act that would allow the federal government to preempt state and local governments on AI regulations. 
Deepfakes, policing, mental health and more: Lawmakers look to further regulate AI

In the letter, state lawmakers said that in an “increasingly fraught digital environment” there are new risks for youth and seniors online. A federal preemption would leave communities exposed and could “nullify a wide range of laws that states have already adopted to address urgent digital issues.”
“I would much prefer that we had a Congress that could actually pass a bill, that could actually do something that could function the way it was designed to function,” Cox said. “But if it is not going to function, then the states must act, and we must have the ability to do that, and we will fight for that ability to do that.”
However, arguing that these technologies have the potential to solve big problems in society, Cox announced a “pro-AI initiative,” meant to look at the technology’s impacts on workforce, industry, state government, academia, public policy and education.
“The core element asks us to prioritize human leadership in the age of AI, ensuring that AI remains understandable in how it functions, accountable in its impacts and adaptable to human needs, rather than the other way around,” he said. “And the second core element is that AI must be human-enhancing. It should expand our capabilities, not diminish them.”
The state is planning on spending $10 million for a workforce accelerator initiative that will support AI in the state, Cox said. That would include curriculum expansions for AI research, energy, semiconductors, quantum computing and advanced materials both in higher education institutions and K-12.
An AI-loaded 2026 session
After creating a state office to regulate AI and foster innovation in 2024, Republican lawmakers have big plans to boost AI regulations during the 2026 legislative session.
“In this next session, and coming up, you’re going to see much more work with our state Legislature,” Cox said. “We’re going to be looking at harm reduction in AI companions, transparency around deep fakes, and an upcoming study around data ownership and control more broadly, as well as the interaction with AI and health care.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Also, a big focus will be preventing anti-competitive actions by big tech companies, an issue Utah lawmakers started to work on this year, when they approved the first law in the nation to push tech companies towards interoperability, allowing users to own their own data
“We need to make sure that we don’t end up with five AI companies. We need thousands of AI companies in this country,” Cox said. 
Rep. Ariel Defay, R-Kaysville said during a panel on Tuesday that she will sponsor legislation aiming to regulate deep fakes and AI companions. She’s also expected to draft a bill titled “the balanced technology in classrooms act,” which stems from her concerns of AI use in the education system, she said.
“I want all the districts, all the (local education agencies), to have the conversation,” Defay said. “Are we correctly balancing the use of technology in our classrooms? And that includes tech and AI.”

Gallatin County health officials confirmed a new case of measles in the county this week.
On Monday, health officials confirmed a case, reported on Nov. 28, of an individual who had a known exposure to measles at a public site. Heath officials are working to identity and notice individuals who may have been exposed.
A list of public exposure locations, and a timeline for individuals to monitor for symptoms, is available here.
This was the second recorded measles case in the county in the last month. Gallatin County has recorded 21 cases of measles this year, the most of any Montana county.
On Tuesday, Missoula County health officials put out a public notice of potential measles exposure in the county from a visiting individual on Saturday, Nov. 22. No positive cases have been confirmed in the county, according to the news release.
Health officials list three times and public locations the infected individual visited and asks anyone who visited the same places on Nov. 22 to monitor for symptoms:

11 a.m. -2:30 p.m., Missoula TJ Maxx
12 p.m. -3:30 p.m., Missoula Scheels
1 p.m. – 4 p.m., Missoula Old Chicago.


Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that spreads when an infected individual coughs, sneezes or talks. Measles can also be spread through touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes. Symptoms typically begin with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body.

Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:


Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

A measles infection is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97% to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, please call your primary care physician as soon as possible.

Paccione has been the department’s executive director since 2019 and led it through the major disruptions to higher education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The department works to expand and support education opportunities after high school in the state, including credential programs, workforce development and college enrollment.
Under her leadership, Colorado began the Re-Engaged (CORE) Initiative, which allows four-year institutions in the state to give associate degrees to students who stopped working towards their bachelor’s degree but have at least 70 credit hours. She also oversaw the start of the FosterEd program that pays the college costs for students who were in foster care.
“For me, this work has always been about activating the potential in every student. Over the past seven years, we have expanded opportunity, strengthened workforce readiness, and unlocked personal fulfillment for Colorado’s learners,” Paccione said in a statement.
Paccione served two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives between 2003 and 2007, and became the Democratic minority caucus chair.
She plans to take a job in the private sector, according to the governor’s office.

(Photo by Micah Drew)The U.S. government already fixed the problem over which a couple of Montana State University international students sued, so a federal judge should toss the lawsuit the students filed against it in fear of deportation, argued the U.S. Attorney’s Office in federal court Tuesday.
But a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana said without a court order, the students remain in a precarious position, worried about future deportation and subject to yet another policy change that harms them in the future.
The lawyers made their arguments in U.S. District Court of Montana in Missoula on the government’s motion to dismiss the case, one similar to numerous lawsuits across the country in response to a Trump administration policy that resulted in stripped visa statuses for many international students.
In May, federal Judge Dana Christensen of Montana issued an order that prohibited the government from arresting or deporting the MSU students based on the status of their federal records relevant in the case, now pending with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
On behalf of the U.S. Attorney’s Office, however, John Newman told the judge the case should be considered moot. He said an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 international students across the country had similar experiences, and as many as 15% sued.
He said the Department of Homeland Security already reversed course for all of those students and abandoned its “ill-conceived and ineffective” initiative, one court records said meant students were “expected to depart the United States immediately.”
As such, Newman argued the judge should dismiss the case because the plaintiffs are no longer harmed, and the government doesn’t plan to take the same actions again.
In April 2025, the MSU students learned the records of their F-1 statuses in a federal Student Exchange Visitor Information System were terminated, which meant they couldn’t stay enrolled in classes, would lose employment authorization, and were subject to arrest and deportation.
The F-1 visa allows noncitizens to enter the United States as students to attend certified academic institutions, and after a year of study, engage in internships, practicums or other work-study off campus that’s related to their fields.
The students sued Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging the defendants unlawfully terminated their records, and Christensen issued a temporary restraining order and later injunction against the federal government.
But the government also reinstated the students’ records, as the court learned at an April 29 hearing, and Newman said Tuesday the students are free to sue again if they believe they are harmed in the future. But he said the current matter is settled.
“The plan is not to do this ever again because frankly, it was a disaster,” Newman said. “It didn’t accomplish any of the goals that I assume were intended.”
On behalf of the two MSU students, however, Alex Rate of the ACLU of Montana said the government terminated the students’ records contrary to its own code, based on interactions with law enforcement, but without a conviction or a prison sentence of more than one year, as required.
Court records state one plaintiff was charged with theft, and one with partner family member assault, but both pleaded not guilty, neither has been convicted, and neither case came with that amount of prison time anyway.
But the U.S. government still has “enormous discretion” in deciding what triggers a records termination in the future, and without an order from the court, the students remain vulnerable, Rate said.
The government states it has no plans to terminate records in the same way again, but that’s not a commitment, Rate said. He said the government also has not produced an unequivocal policy, just a message with a disclaimer, and one that’s easily changed in the future.
In the meantime, the federal government has made it clear that the likelihood immigrants and international students will continue to be in the crosshairs is high, Rate said. So he said the students need a court order to ensure they can study without worrying about deportation.
The case was filed by John Roe and Jane Doe on April 14; Roe, of Iran, was pursuing a doctorate degree in electrical engineering, and Doe, of Turkey, was seeking a master’s degree in microbiology, according to court records.
Rate said Roe continues to pursue his doctorate at MSU and expects to graduate in the next 12 months, and Doe graduated with a master’s degree and remains in the United States working through the Optional Practical Training program.
With its earlier policy, the government tried to “scare people into self-deportation,” and it nearly succeeded with one MSU student, Rate said.
“One of my clients had purchased a ticket to go say goodbye forever to his sister in Colorado because he was going to self-deport to Iran and had no expectation of ever returning to the United States,” Rate said.
To suggest the students can simply file a lawsuit if something goes wrong for them again doesn’t take their actual lives into consideration, he said.
Rate said it was “only by a miracle” the students connected with lawyers who could help in this case, and there’s no guarantee they’d have the same resources to find counsel and vet a potential lawsuit in the future.
Rate said only the court can offer his clients the security that they won’t face termination again; certainly the U.S. officials who axed their records in the first place — and could do so again — can’t offer that assurance.
“It wasn’t just my clients,” he said. “As my colleague noted, it was thousands of students all across the country, and it was only after emergency litigation that the government reversed course.”
On behalf of the government, however, Newman said the argument from the students amounted to “what if something else bad happens,” and he said that amounted to speculation. He said it’s understandable, but it’s also outside the bounds of the lawsuit.
“I can understand their concern for that given the climate,” Newman said. “But that’s a different case.”
Christensen said he would get a ruling out as soon as he could.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Russell-Courthouse-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published in the Valley News on Dec. 1, 2025.
HANOVER — More than 40,000 people in Vermont and New Hampshire may have been impacted by a data breach in a system used by Dartmouth College. Last week, Dartmouth started mailing letters to the people whose personal information was included in data stolen over three days in early August.
During that time, an “unauthorized actor” was able to access Dartmouth College files and take data, including “one or more” files that had personal information such as names, Social Security numbers and financial account information, according to reports Dartmouth filed with the offices of the attorneys general of New Hampshire and Vermont last week.
The breach was part of a widespread attack on the Oracle eBusiness Suite, a platform Dartmouth and many other companies use to manage operations. A ransomware group has been taking credit for the attack and it has identified more than 100 companies impacted by the breach, according to reporting from SecurityWeek.
“This incident was not the result of any ‘phishing’ attack on a member of the Dartmouth community or any other action or inaction on Dartmouth’s part,” college spokesperson Jana Barnello said.
After Oracle reported the security breach in early October, Dartmouth launched an investigation “as quickly as possible” to identify the impacted data and respond, Barnello said Monday. It “took time” to review all of the files and identify the people whose information was exposed, Barnello said of the gap between when the Oracle breach was announced and when Dartmouth reported it.
The college reviewed the leaked files and identified that “one or more” contained personal information such as Social Security numbers on Oct. 30, according to the filings. 
In response to the breach, Dartmouth implemented “all publicly available patches” for the program to shore up any issues, per Oracle’s recommendations, and set up a phone line for impacted people.
The letters sent to victims describe the incident and Dartmouth’s response and include access to a one-year subscription to Experian IdentityWorks, a personal security program that helps to prevent identify theft.
Dartmouth reported the data breach last week to the attorney general’s offices of New Hampshire and Vermont. The incident “involves” 31,742 New Hampshire residents, an attorney for the college reported in the filings for New Hampshire.
The breach impacted 12,701 Vermonters, Amelia Vath, senior advisor to the Vermont Attorney General, said Monday.
Dartmouth College filed similar reports in other states including Maine, California and Texas.
The only other data breach Dartmouth College has reported to the New Hampshire attorney general since 2006 was in 2012 when a laptop including personal information for four people was stolen, according to an online database.

The New Mexico Supreme Court issued an order Dec. 2, 2025 that denies a request to repeal Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s line-item vetoes on the bill lawmakers passed. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The New Mexico Supreme Court on Tuesday issued an order declining to repeal several line-item vetoes Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham struck from legislation lawmakers approved during a recent special legislative session.
Duke Rodriguez, a prominent statewide cannabis executive and possible Republican gubernatorial candidate, filed a lawsuit in mid-October asking the Supreme Court to disallow the governor from striking certain language from a spending bill the Legislature approved in October to counteract anticipated effects from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed in July.
The Legislature approved $162 million in state funding to counteract federal cuts to Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and health insurance tax credits. When lawmakers sent that bill to the governor for her signature, she signed it except for what she described as “minor” but necessary changes to counteract “provisions that unduly constrain the Executive Department’s ability to assist New Mexicans.”
NM cannabis exec asks NM Supreme Court to overturn Gov’s recent line-item vetoes

The bill awarded $12 million to the state Health Care Authority “to maintain the minimum federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit for elders and people with disabilities.” But the governor struck the words “minimum federal.”  
She also struck language regarding approximately $6 million aimed at replenishing funding local public broadcasters lost when Congress cut funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. She removed requirements that the unexpended funding to the state finance and Indian Affairs departments be returned to the general fund, and she removed language requiring the funding to be spent within the next two fiscal years. 
Rodriguez’s lawsuit, filed with the help of attorney and former lawmaker Jacob Candelaria, argued that each of those vetoes “distorts legislative intent and is therefore an unconstitutional attempt by the Executive to substitute her policy-making judgment for that of the people’s elected representatives.”
That’s a wrap: Special session ends with funding for health care, food assistance and more

The governor’s office responded in court in early November that the lawsuit was meritless, arguing that Rodriguez lacked standing to bring the lawsuit and also that the governor’s vetoes sought only to make it easier for her and the agencies she oversees to implement the Legislature’s intent. 
“At the end of the day, the funds will still be spent on the exact programs the Legislature wanted to fund; the Governor merely struck language that could cause the funds to be spent in an inefficient manner,” Holly Agajanian, chief general counsel for the governor, wrote. 
The Supreme Court, in a brief order issued Tuesday, did not specify why it ruled against Rodriguez, simply stating that the Court was denying Rodriguez’s request after having  “considered the petition and being sufficiently advised.” 
Rodriguez, in a statement Tuesday to Source New Mexico, said he respects the Court’s decision but wishes the Court had issued a “full opinion,” rather than an unexplained order, to address issues he deems critical, including who has standing to challenge executive orders and the “true scope of a sitting governor’s veto authority.”
“Without clearer legal guidance, it is evident that a sitting governor may exert significant influence over — and potentially reshape — the actions of future Legislatures,” he said in an email. “That reality raises the stakes for New Mexico.”
The continued ambiguity, he said, means the “next election will matter even more than many realize. This may be the final push I needed to officially enter this race.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sine-Die-Dems-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

Relatives still traveled home. Dozens still set up grills and canopies at games. Mississippi Today produced a collection of stories of homecoming events in the Delta, where traditions have evolved over time.
GREENWOOD — A foldable chair is a staple during homecoming season in the Mississippi Delta. It’s your front-row seat for all the homecoming parade offers: music, spectacle and pageantry.
Parade participants rent luxury cars and refashion the tailgates into chariots for rugrat royalty. Students as young as 8 wear crowns and royal get-ups to sit on the hood of a car in a sash.
The float with the Greenwood High School homecoming court is a glorious spectacle. Scarlet capes flutter behind the school’s newly crowned homecoming king Melton Adams and queen Kiyah Davis. Melton boasts a coat encrusted with opalescent jewels, and Kiyah dons a flowing gown with a hoop skirt underneath. Greenwood High School’s prince and princess share a Victorian sofa on a ledge lower. Two oversized strings of pearls trail each side of the float.

The homecoming court along with the less ornate floats and trucks pave the way for the main attraction: Greenwood’s music man and his teen marching band.
Less than 30 minutes before the Greenwood High School band was set to join the parade line, band director Olander Emmons was listening to an upset student who had left his instrument at home and couldn’t participate in the parade. Emmons directed the forlorn teen to the band room. The 17-year-old walked away to get a spare instrument.
Tired of singing the blues
Emmons, like many of his students, joined Greenwood’s band in sixth grade. He played the saxophone, but his first instruments were the drums and then the piano. He learned to play both at church.
Emmons was working as a staffer at the local unemployment office when he ran into his high school band director while grocery shopping at Walmart. She remembered his skill as a music reader. He was already working as an independent musician, playing receptions and churches around the Delta when she scouted him for the band director job. He saw it as an opportunity to develop as an artist and mentor a new generation at his high school alma mater.

He knows how to play most of the instruments in the band, particularly the brass ones. His goal coming into the role three years ago was to write new songs for the band to perform. 
“I wanted the fans to wait in the stands to hear the band,” Emmons said. “And not go to the concession stand.”
A longtime gospel fan, he began listening to more blues music despite his religious upbringing. He felt inspired to incorporate more music from the region into the band’s setlist. Emmons has also tried to develop a “show band” for Greenwood High, incorporating choreography from Lovely Anderson, the dance team coach. 
Emmons said his band has grown from 60 to 125 members since he took over.

He holds open auditions for the middle and high schools each year, pairing students with instruments. Some instruments like the bassoon require students with longer fingers, while others, such as a trombone, require students with longer arms. He pairs students with instruments for reasons both personal and biological.
Channeling pain through the music
Greenwood High has a poverty rate of almost 82%, according to state data from the 2023-24 school year. Gun violence claims the lives of a disproportionate number of teenagers in the region, a statistic that comes up in conversations with students about transportation after practice as well as in class. Sometimes Emmons’ students share stories from their neighborhoods, and those experiences inspire their own compositions, including recent performances at jamborees across the region.
“Music allows them to be able to vent,” Emmons said.“I hear a lot of kids that go through it. They try to put all the pain into the instruments they play.” 
During the homecoming parade, a hot October sun beat down on the streets of Greenwood as music filled the humid air. Dancers in pink outfits and teenagers in gowns and capes crisscrossed Cotton Street.

Mike Hoyt, a Hartford selectboard member, will fill a vacant House seat representing Barnard, Bridgewater and Pomfret, as well as part of Hartford. 
Gov. Phil Scott announced the appointment Tuesday. Hoyt replaces Heather Surprenant, a Barnard Democrat who stepped down in September, according to a press release from Scott’s office. 
In an interview on Tuesday, Hoyt, who lives in West Hartford, said he was excited to build on his prior experience working in state government as well as his time on the Hartford selectboard. He hopes that background will ease his learning curve in the new role.  
“I’ve worked in state government. I’ve enjoyed my time in state government,” he said, adding that his parents also worked for the state. “It’s part of who I am.”
Hoyt’s mother, the late Kathy Hoyt, was a top adviser to former Govs. Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean.
As an attorney, Hoyt worked for the Vermont Legislature, staffing a range of committees across six years, and later for the Vermont Department of Labor. He now works at Dartmouth College. 
Asked about his legislative priorities, Hoyt named affordability and housing. People travel from as far away as St. Johnsbury to work at the Upper Valley’s largest employers, the college and its hospital, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, he said. While on the selectboard, he said he’s tried to make a dent in those issues by rezoning and keeping municipal budgets in check. 
Hoyt’s appointment is effective immediately.

(Eric Cole/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Conservation groups are gearing up to take the federal government to court to preserve the protected status of gray wolves across the country.
The Center for Biological Diversity in a Tuesday letter, informed the U.S. Wildlife Service that it intends to file a lawsuit alleging the agency violated the Endangered Species Act by not preparing a national gray wolf recovery plan.
The letter, addressed to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and USFWS Director Brian Nesvik, says that the agency is “attempting to skirt its duty” to develop a nationwide recovery plan, and unlawfully stated that wolves would not benefit from a recovery plan.
“FWS has made numerous premature efforts to reduce or remove federal protections for wolves under the ESA, which the courts have nearly universally rejected,” wrote Collette Adkins, senior attorney for Center for Biological Diversity. “The only successful delisting effort was in the Northern Rocky Mountains, where Congress (through a rider to an appropriations bill) directed FWS to remove wolf protections. Since then, the Center and its allies have submitted petitions to relist wolves in the northern Rockies and across the West, which FWS denied. In August 2025, the U.S. District Court for Montana ruled that FWS unlawfully denied the petitions and remanded to FWS for new analysis.”
In mid-November, USFWS announced it would not release a National Wolf Recovery Plan, despite previously announcing a plan was in the works last year. The agency said the species doesn’t need federal protection.
The move comes as wolves are in the crosshairs of members of Congress who have proposed multiple bills to delist the species from the Endangered Species Act nationwide.
In the United States, wolves are managed in three different groups.
In the Northern Rockies — Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and parts of Washington and Oregon — wolves were removed from the endangered species list and are managed by their respective state wildlife agencies, which allow hunting.
A population of wolves in Minnesota are listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, while wolves in the remaining 44 U.S. states are listed as endangered species.
The letter from the Center for Biological Diversity says that the “piecemeal” recovery efforts have prevents a nation-wide recovery of the species.
“Reliance on such an outdated and geographically restricted plan prevents FWS from facilitating nationwide wolf recovery, including in places such as the West Coast, Southern Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast,” the letter states. “For these reasons, the failure to develop a nationwide wolf recovery plan violates the agency’s mandatory duty under Section 4(f) of the ESA.”
Adkins said the Center will pursue litigation in U.S. District Court if the Fish and Wildlife Service does not make any changes to its current stance on wolf recovery.
In the most recent federal litigation, which saw a federal judge in Missoula vacate the government’s determination that gray wolves in the Western U.S. don’t need increased protections under the Endangered Species Act back in August, was brought by several coalitions of conservation groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/usfws-gray-wolf-snow-large-1024x768-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

The college is one of Colorado's Hispanic-serving institutions. (Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)All of Colorado’s Democrats in Congress wrote Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Education opposing its move to end grant funding programs for minority-serving institutions. 
The department in September announced that it would end federal grants designated for MSIs, schools that are federally designated for serving a high concentration of minority and low-income students. Colorado has 15 MSIs, 14 of which are Hispanic-serving institutions and one of which is a Native American-serving institution, according to the letter.
“These grant programs help provide programming and support specifically for students of color and lower-income students,” the Democrats wrote. “Ending these programs will have widespread detrimental effects on students from all states and backgrounds.”

U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper and U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, Jason Crow of Aurora and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood wrote the letter U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. 
Colorado colleges and universities have lost millions because of the cuts, the letter says. The Democrats asked the department to help affected institutions find other opportunities for federal funding to make up for the loss of grant funding. They also asked for a written response within 30 days providing more information on where grant funding will be reallocated to ensure it continues to support students. 
“We have heard strong concerns from Colorado colleges and universities that have received termination notices from the Department,” the letter says. “The loss of millions of dollars will mean fewer opportunities for students and will only cause harm to the communities these institutions serve.”
In a press release announcing the funding cuts, McMahon said grant programs specifically for MSIs “discriminate by restricting eligibility to institutions that meet government-mandated racial quotas.” The release said about $350 million in discretionary funding will be reallocated to programs that do not include racial quotas.
Seven of the Colorado Community College System’s 13 colleges are designated HSIs, and three of those schools received grant termination notices. Morgan Community College lost $1.6 million in federal grant funding, Lamar Community College lost $3 million, and Pueblo Community College lost just under $600,000, according to CCCS spokesperson Fiona Lytle. CCCS also has two other schools that were approaching HSI eligibility and were preparing to apply for federal funding. 
Those grants supported first-generation and low-income college students, staff positions that helped students and prospective future students, English as a second language students, orientation programs, and professional development for staff and faculty, among other programs and initiatives at the three affected community colleges.
A lawsuit filed in Tennessee in June challenged the constitutionality of HSIs and related grant programs, arguing they discriminate on the basis of ethnicity.

This week marks the beginning of the Legislature's work on the state’s next two-year budget. 
The post How will lawmakers spend Wyoming’s tax dollars? The budgeting process is underway. appeared first on WyoFile .","This week marks the beginning of the Wyoming Legislature’s annual budget hearings. During the four-week-long process, the Joint Appropriations Committee is meeting in Cheyenne to hear agency requests and to draft a budget bill ahead of the 2026 session. 
In even-numbered years, lawmakers are responsible for crafting and passing the state’s upcoming two-year spending plan, also known as a biennium budget. It is the one thing lawmakers are constitutionally obligated to complete during a budget session. 
While the Legislature ultimately holds the purse strings, it’s the governor who kicks off the process with budget recommendations. 
In November, Gov. Mark Gordon proposed a $11.1 billion budget that would boost state worker pay, bolster wildfire-fighting capacity, renovate the veterans home in Buffalo and put $250 million into permanent savings, among other priorities. 
“Our job, the job of government, is to provide the essentials that communities, families and citizens cannot provide on their own and be accountable and accessible,” Gordon told the committee Monday in his opening remarks. 
The hearings largely involve agencies presenting what’s called a standard budget, which includes no more than the amount needed to allow that office to provide the same level of services in the next budget cycle as it has in the current one. If an agency seeks to diverge from that spending level, such as for new equipment or a special project, it must develop and present an “exception request” to lawmakers. 
Since the last budget session, a new group of Republicans has come into power. In 2024, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus won control of the lower chamber and now holds all but one seat on the House side of the Appropriations Committee. 
While the caucus has pledged to cut the budget, it remains to be seen where and how lawmakers aim to shrink spending. That could become clearer through the committee’s budget work or as lawmakers revise the bill during the session. However, they took extra steps this legislative off-season to scrutinize the Department of Health’s budget by forming a subcommittee. The agency has the largest budget of any state department. 
Alongside agency requests, the committee also relies on revenue forecasts to draft a budget bill. 
In October, a report indicated that Wyoming’s investment portfolio hit a record $1.86 billion in earnings, surpassing revenues from the mineral industry. Meanwhile, other prominent revenue sources fell short, including sales and use taxes and state royalties. 
State forecasters, known as the Consensus Revenue Estimating Group, will present lawmakers with an updated report when the Appropriations Committee gathers in January.
 
The committee will meet through next week, as well as the first two full weeks in January. No formal action will be taken on the budget until the final week of hearings. 
At that point, in a process known as working the bill, the committee goes unit by unit through each agency’s budget with lawmakers voting on motions to approve, deny or adjust each funding request. Vote by vote, those decisions form the budget bill, which is then prepared by the Legislative Service Office staff. 
Budget hearings are open to the public and can also be viewed remotely via the Legislature’s YouTube page. Meeting agendas are available on the Legislature’s website. 
The full Legislature convenes Feb. 9 in Cheyenne.

Larry Rhoden’s plan to keep state funding flat for Medicaid providers, state employees and schools could hurt the same areas Rhoden said he’s helped “prioritize” in recent years, advocates say.
Rhoden announced at his budget address on Tuesday at the Capitol that he wants to keep state support for the “big three” flat this year, due to “pretty flat” sales tax revenues. The last 0% increase proposed by a governor for the big three was by Gov. Kristi Noem for the 2019 budget, according to the state Bureau of Finance and Management.
Governor proposes ‘limited budget’ for SD that avoids big cuts but keeps school funding flat

School districts and health care providers across the state say they’re treading water after years of high inflation, despite relatively high funding increases attributable to an influx in federal pandemic aid and higher sales tax revenue coming out of the pandemic. Lawmakers approved a 1.25% increase for the big three last year, which was below inflation.
Rapid City Democratic Rep. Nicole Uhre-Balk said inflation will eat away at flat funding if legislators approve Rhoden’s plan.
“Not increasing is a cut,” she said.
Rapid City Republican Rep. Mike Derby, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said projections and revenues could change after the New Year, which could allow for an increase in state support. When Noem last recommended a 0% increase in state aid to education, lawmakers bumped it up to a 1% increase that year.
“We’ll see how the next four months’ revenues come in,” Derby said.
Teacher pay: ‘My fear is that 0% is going to move us backwards’
But Rep. Mellissa Heermann, R-Brookings, worries efforts to “drag ourselves up” in teacher pay rankings will be erased without more state support to education. South Dakota moved up the national ranks from 50th in teacher pay in 2021 to 46th this year.

“It’s been difficult for us to even maintain the gains we’ve had,” said Heermann, who served on the Brookings School Board for six years. “All other states around us are also increasing their teacher pay, so my fear is that 0% is going to move us backwards.”
That could lead to school districts cutting other programs or positions, which could impact student success, said South Dakota Education Association Director of Government Relations and Communications Sandra Waltman.
“Up until about last year, schools were doing OK keeping up with inflation. They weren’t getting ahead,” Waltman said. “But when you start to receive funding that’s less than inflationary, that’s when you start to fall behind and see school districts cut positions and budgets.”
Heermann suggested splitting the big three up to give a targeted increase in state aid to education. Lawmakers traditionally group funding increases for Medicaid providers, education and state employees together. 
Rhoden cautioned against using one-time funding, such as money from the state’s reserve funds, to boost big three funding. 
Derby echoed Rhoden, calling any ideas to use one-time funding for ongoing expenses a “recipe for disaster.”
The stagnant state aid proposal comes at the same time enrollment in public schools is down, due to low birth rates and increases in alternative instruction such as homeschooling and private schools, Rhoden said. Alternative instruction enrollment has increased 216% since 2015.
Medicaid: Lower reimbursement rates create ‘disruption’ in health care
Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, advocated for significant increases in Medicaid reimbursements for health care providers in recent years. The gains helped support a core obligation of state government and ensure health care providers were adequately reimbursed for their services, he said, but he doesn’t “see an option” to offer more than a flat rate this year with a lean budget overall.

“We’ve been working really hard to get them dollars, so not getting them an increase is concerning,” Karr said. “We don’t want anybody to get too far behind because it creates so much disruption in hiring people and providing the services needed, whether education or Medicaid providers.”
One year at 0% is manageable, Karr added, but he wants to see a return to increases that correlate with inflationary pressures to avoid “digging huge holes” for Medicaid providers.
Tim Rave, CEO of the South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations, said he is grateful there aren’t any cuts to state Medicaid reimbursement rates, saying cuts would risk health care access to South Dakotans.
“In light of increased inflationary costs,” Rave said, “especially in our case for hospitals and supplies where you’re looking at 10% or 12% inflationary increases, this certainly doesn’t help.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EM8A3851-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

The Trump administration has taken Vermont’s secretary of state to court, asking a federal judge to force the state to turn over information on registered voters. 
Filed on Monday in Vermont’s U.S. District Court, the lawsuit argues Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas violated federal election law when she refused to share registered voters’ addresses, drivers license numbers and the last four digits of their social security numbers, among other information. 
Vermont officials have yet to respond to the suit in court.

Back in August, Copeland Hanzas announced she wouldn’t comply with the Trump administration’s request, arguing Vermont law “specifically prohibits” the state and municipal governments from sharing voters’ personal details with the federal government for certain uses. That includes, per the law, handing over voters’ information so federal agencies can compare it to “personally identifying information contained in other federal or state databases.”
At that time, a number of other states had received similar requests from the Trump administration for voter information. Some states shared the information, while others, including Maine, declined the request. The federal government has since sued some of those states that declined the demand.
In the lawsuit, attorneys in the voting section of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division suggested their inquiry is meant to ensure Vermont’s registered voter list is accurate. The federal attorneys requested that a judge order Copeland Hanzas to comply with the request to turn over voter information. 
A spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s Office said on Tuesday that they weren’t familiar with the details of the lawsuit and declined to comment. 
“We have not yet been served with this lawsuit but we look forward to defending Secretary Copeland Hanzas in this case,” Amelia Vath, a spokesperson for the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, which represents Copeland Hanzas in the case, said in a statement.

Free.,Hegseth denies he was present for deadly second strike on alleged Caribbean drug boat,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/hegseth-denies-he-was-present-deadly-second-strike-alleged-caribbean-drug-boat,,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Tuesday he did not witness a controversial — and potentially illegal — second strike in early September that killed two survivors clinging to a burning alleged drug-running boat off the Venezuelan coast.The secretary’s exact order in the Sept. 2 strike has been under scrutiny after The Washington Post reported Friday that Hegseth gave a verbal directive to “kill everybody” that in turn led the commanding admiral to order a follow-on strike to kill two alleged drug smugglers who survived an initial attack.Hegseth’s comments responded to a reporter’s question at the end of President Donald Trump’s livestreamed two-hour Cabinet meeting. “I watched that first strike live. As you can imagine, at the Department of War we got a lot of things to do, so … I moved on to my next meeting,” Hegseth told reporters. The secretary said he learned a “couple of hours later” that Adm. Frank M. “Mitch” Bradley “made the correct decision to ultimately sink the boat and eliminate the threat.”When pressed by the reporter if he saw any survivors after the initial strike, Hegseth said “I did not personally see survivors … the thing was on fire.”“This is called the fog of war. This is what you in the press don't understand,” he replied.Hegseth said he didn’t know the exact amount of time between the first and second strikes. He declined to answer follow-up questions.Bipartisan lawmakers on the Senate and House Armed Services committees announced probes over the weekend into the follow-on strike that killed the survivors. Numerous military law experts argue killing survivors of a shipwreck is in clear violation of the Pentagon’s laws of war.Hegseth authorized strikeHegseth initially called The Washington Post investigative report “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory,” in a post on social media Friday.On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during the daily briefing that Hegseth had “authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes.”“Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,” Leavitt said at the briefing.On social media Monday night, Hegseth wrote: “Admiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made — on the September 2 mission and all others since.”A New York Times article Monday, citing five U.S. officials who spoke separately on the condition of anonymity, reported that Hegseth gave an initial written order for an operation to kill the alleged drug smugglers on the boat and destroy the entire vessel. The officials said Hegseth did not address additional steps if the first missile did not accomplish both goals, and that he did not give Bradley additional orders in response to video surveillance of the boat, according to the Times, which wrote that Bradley ordered “several” follow-on shots.The strike in question was the first of nearly two dozen U.S. attacks on boats in the Caribbean Sea, which the administration alleges are smuggling narcotics. The operations, over several months, have killed 83 individuals, according to a CNN timeline.‘I rely on Pete’Trump defended Hegseth at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting, saying “Pete’s done an amazing job.”Regarding the attack, Trump downplayed the importance of a follow-on strike.“I still haven't gotten a lot of information, because I rely on Pete, but to me, it was an attack. It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes,” he said.“Pete didn't know about a second attack having to do with two people. And I guess Pete would have to speak to it. I can say this, I want those boats taken out, and if we have to, we'll attack on land also, just like we attack on sea,” Trump said.Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that he “wouldn’t have wanted that,” referring to the killing of two men clinging to the wreckage. “Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump continued.Trump posted Sept. 2 on his Truth Social platform a 29-second edited video of the attack.On Sept. 3, Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” played the video from Trump’s post on repeat while interviewing Hegseth, who told the hosts that 11 alleged “narco-terrorists” were killed in the attack.“I watched it live. We knew exactly what they were doing and we knew exactly who they represented,” Hegseth said on the network’s talk show, which he hosted on weekends prior to being appointed and confirmed as secretary of Defense.The Intercept first reported on Sept. 10 that survivors of the initial Sept. 2 strike were killed in follow-up blasts.Congressional inquiriesLawmakers from both sides of the aisle are now inquiring to learn if what happened on Sept. 2 amounts to a war crime. U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., issued a statement Tuesday, criticizing Hegseth and calling on Trump to fire him if he violated the laws of war.“At the Pentagon, the buck stops with the Secretary of Defense, period,” Slotkin said.The first-term Democrat and former CIA official recently participated in a video, now targeted by a Pentagon investigation, reminding service members that they have a right to refuse “illegal orders.”  “True leaders own the calls they make and take responsibility for their actions. Secretary Hegseth should release the full video of the strike and lay out publicly what happened, without throwing the uniformed military under the bus,” Slotkin said.Senate Majority Leader John Thune defended the administration Tuesday when asked by reporters about the Sept. 2 event and Hegseth’s other controversies, including discussing real-time bombing of targets in Yemen in March on the publicly available app Signal.“I think the Trump administration and the peace-through-strength policies that they are employing around the world are making our country safer, and so Secretary Hegseth is a part of that,” the South Dakota Republican said.",,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

The poll, conducted by Lansing-based Mitchell Research and sponsored by capitol news outlet Michigan Information & Research Service, Inc., or MIRS, also shows that former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake has solid footing in hypothetical matchups against his Democratic rivals in the race for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat. Only Democratic U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham comes close enough to making the contest competitive, the Mitchell Research poll shows.
The survey tapped 616 November general election voters, 261 likely Democratic primary voters and 255 likely Republican primary voters between Nov. 18 and Nov. 25. About a third of the responses were collected online.
The general election questionnaire had a margin of error of 3.7%, but the primary voter section had a margin of error upward toward 6%. Still, Mitchell Research said it had a 95% level of confidence in its data.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
U.S. Senate race polling shows opportunity for Rogers, Stevens
Among likely general election voters surveyed, the poll shows Rogers as potentially doing well against each of his Democratic rivals in the race.
Rogers netted 41% of interest from those surveyed against progressive candidate Abdul El-Sayed, who ran for governor in 2018, who polled at 38% At least 22% said they weren’t sure who they were voting for in that matchup.
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak was in the same position as El-Sayed, polling just 38% in a hypothetical matchup with Rogers among those surveyed. Of note, Rogers in that matchup polled higher at 44% with 19% saying they weren’t sure yet on who they’d vote for in that scenario.
Stevens comes the closest to making the matchup competitive in the Mitchell Research poll. The congresswoman was polling at 40% among those surveyed to Rogers’ 42%, with 18% saying they were still undecided if that matchup was on the November ballot.
Rogers spokesperson Alyssa Brouillet, in a statement, said that while the Republican’s “socialist opponents battle it out in their bloody primary, Mike Rogers is winning.”
“Michiganders are sick and tired of Democrats in this state killing our jobs, failing our schools, turning a blind eye to violent crime, and trying to shoot our taxes through the roof – and the polls reflect it,” Brouillet said. “Mike Rogers will right the ship and get Michigan working again.”
Joetta Appiah, spokesperson for the Stevens campaign, viewed the data as a win.
“Once again, polling shows Haley Stevens is leading the primary and is the strongest Democratic candidate to beat Mike Rogers,” Appiah said in a statement. “Haley’s focus on lowering costs and strengthening Michigan’s manufacturing economy is how she’s building the coalition to win the primary and carry that momentum into the general election to keep Mike Rogers out of the Senate.”
For El-Sayed’s campaign, the poll shows them as one of only two candidates within the margin of error to beat Rogers.
“Even then, we learned in 2024 what happens when Democrats double down on candidates who defend Israel’s genocide in a state like Michigan: it alienates communities we need to build a winning coalition,” Roxie Richner, El-Sayed’s campaign spokesperson, told Michigan Advance. “Abdul is a formidable general election candidate because he energizes voters where his opponents will struggle to even turn them out. We’re continuing to build a movement of Michiganders who want money out of politics, money in their pockets, and Medicare for All — and we look forward to winning in both August and November.”

Hannah Lindow, spokesperson for McMorrow’s campaign, said the poll confirms what the campaign already says it knows about the race.
“Mallory has the momentum in this race,” Lindow said. “While she continues to close the gap and win with voters who know all three candidates, others in this race have lost ground or remained stagnant.”
Gubernatorial race shows Benson, James in pole positions going into 2026
James and Benson were the ones to top the likely nominee list in the survey.
The Republican with arguably the most name recognition in the race, James, was polling well at 48%, well ahead of his competitors in the race. The survey showed that former Attorney General Mike Cox took 11% of interest from likely primary voters. Meanwhile, 5% of likely Republican primary voters surveyed said they would be voting for former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, 2% said they would be supporting state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Porter Township, and 1% were likely to cast a ballot for former pastor Ralph Rebandt, who previously ran for governor in 2022. At least 33% of likely voters said they were still undecided.
Benson was in the same position on the Democratic side of the race as James, polling among likely primary voters at 48%. Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist was polling at 12% in the survey and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson was polling at 5%
In a race between James and Benson, the general election cohort survey showed the Republican candidate at 37%, the Democratic candidate at 31%, and independent candidate and outgoing Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan at 18%.

Benson, however, leads among those same likely general election voters in a matchup against Cox (the Democratic candidate polled at 33% to the GOP candidate’s 32%) and against Nesbitt (Benson netted interest at 32% of those surveyed to the senator’s 27%) In both scenarios, Duggan still polled third in terms of interest, but slightly higher in the hypothetical matchup between Benson and Nesbitt.
“John James, who lost two US Senate races before being elected and re-elected to Congress in 2022/24, and Mike Cox who lost a race for governor in 2010, are now the leading GOP candidates for governor next year,” said Steve Mitchell,  president of Mitchell Research & Communications. “However, both Aric Nesbitt and Tom Leonard are raising money and intend to be very competitive. It’s too early to count out anyone, although James is clearly in the driver’s seat.”
Hannah Osantowske, spokesperson for James’ campaign, said the poll shows that the congressman is the Republican leader who primary voters are beginning to rally around as their pick for governor.
“Michigan families are rejecting corrupt, career politicians and are ready to put a combat veteran Apache pilot and businessman who’s never left a mission unfinished in the governor’s office,” Osantowske said. “With duty and direction, John will deliver reliable energy, safe communities, affordable homes, good-paying jobs, and skills training from middle school to mid-career so every Michigander can thrive.

Although the emphasis for voters surveyed in the poll was on Benson and James, Duggan was shown to be getting around 20% of interest from likely voters in each of the three hypothetical matchups.
Duggan appeared to be doing better with Democrats than Republicans, which continues to be an interesting plot point in the race given the way he burned Democrats to run as a nonpartisan candidate and continues to get funding support from Republican donors.
If he had announced his candidacy as a Democrat, Mitchell Research shows that he does better with Democrats (at 15%) than Republicans (11%) against someone like Cox, and 6% better in both categories against James.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1135-1024x655.jpg,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

Heating assistance is “an essential lifeline for more than 20,000 Vermont households every year,” said U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. on Tuesday. “Being able to heat your home is a matter of life and death.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has released nearly $21 million in long-awaited federal funding for Vermont’s heating assistance programs, members of the state’s congressional delegation said Tuesday.
“LIHEAP is an essential lifeline for more than 20,000 Vermont households every year,” said U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. in a Tuesday release, describing the federal Low Income Home Energy Fuel Assistance Program. “Being able to heat your home is a matter of life and death.”
U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., agreed in a similar statement on Tuesday, adding, “let’s be clear: these funds never should’ve been stalled in the first place.”
Money from the federal program is dispersed in Vermont through the state’s Seasonal Fuel Assistance and Crisis Fuel Assistance programs. Additional state appropriations allow the programs to reach Vermonters whose incomes are up to 185% and 200% of the federal poverty line, respectively. For a two-person household, that would mean an annual income of about $39,000 or $42,000.

Benefit amount depends on a number of factors including income and utility cost, but the average one-time award for the Seasonal Fuel Assistance program was roughly $1,000 in the last fiscal year.
During the federal government shutdown in October and November, the state dispersed $11 million in fuel assistance on time to individual households and fuel providers. The arrival of federal funds reimburses the state for that expense, and provides support for future benefits over the course of the winter. 
Gov. Phil Scott said last month that he was “confident” that Congress would fulfill its obligation to provide that funding, in contrast with the state’s 15-day stopgap measure for food assistance.
In Tuesday’s release, Welch said funding for LIHEAP had been incorrectly hindered by President Donald Trump’s administration even after the government reopened Nov. 12.
“Not only was it illegal, but heartbreakingly cruel,” Welch said in the statement.
Vermont’s congressional delegation also criticized the Trump administration after mass layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year, which included the entire federal staff of LIHEAP.
The White House called for the program’s elimination in a discretionary budget request in May, saying LIHEAP “is unnecessary because States have policies preventing utility disconnection for low-income households.”
Last week, a report from Vermont’s Public Utilities commission recommended that the state Legislature allocate more funding to expanding heat assistance for Vermonters, and prepare for potential losses in federal dollars. In particular, the commission was in favor of expanding the state’s Crisis Fuel Assistance program, which is designed to provide stopgap funding when a household is about to run out of fuel.

,DC,2025-12-02 22:46:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"No ‘clear path forward’ in US Senate on spiraling health care costs, with deadline near",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/no-clear-path-forward-us-senate-spiraling-health-care-costs-deadline-near,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats in the Senate agree that health care costs are rising too quickly and expect to vote next week on legislation that could help Americans. The only catch is that party leaders hadn’t decided as of Tuesday what to include in the bills. Senators also seemed to accept that neither proposal will garner the bipartisan support needed to advance, leaving the tens of millions of Americans who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace with complicated decisions to make before open enrollment ends Dec. 15. ACA marketplace plans are expected to increase by 26% on average next year, though a failure by Congress to extend enhanced tax credits would lead monthly payments for subsidized enrollees to increase by 114% on average, according to analysis from the nonpartisan health organization KFF. “I don’t think at this point we have a clear path forward,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. “I don't think the Democrats have a clear path forward.”Vote on Democratic bill expectedThune guaranteed a small group of Democratic senators a floor vote on a health care proposal of their choosing in exchange for their votes on the spending package that ended the government shutdown. Democrats are widely expected to put forward a bill to extend enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Those subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year without congressional action. But it isn’t clear if the Democratic bill would extend the credits for one year or a longer period. GOP leaders are trying to rally support around a health care proposal of their own, while acknowledging it won’t get the 60 votes needed to advance under the Senate’s legislative filibuster rules. Thune said Republican senators had a “robust discussion” about health care issues during their closed-door lunch, where Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy of Louisiana presented some ideas. But no final agreements were reached. Thune, R-S.D., said conversations will continue ahead of the vote next week and likely afterward.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Democrats “have a plan” but declined to say exactly what it entails.“Stay tuned,” Schumer said. “We had a great discussion and I will tell you this: We will be focused like a laser on lowering people’s costs.”Looking for a solutionWest Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said Republican talks on health care have been “vigorous” but that they hadn’t yet “decided on the clear path.” Capito said her “expectation” is that GOP senators will put a bill on the floor next week to bring down the costs of health insurance premiums and health care as quickly as possible, though that hadn’t been finalized.  “I like the idea of people having control of the money as opposed to insurance companies, where they take a 20% profit,” Capito said, echoing comments by President Donald Trump. “I think that has merit.”Capito said senators didn’t discuss during their lunch whether to extend open enrollment past Dec. 15 or possibly reopen it next year, should Congress pass a health care bill that addresses the ACA marketplace tax credits in some way.New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said there is no indication there will be bipartisan agreement to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies or any other health care proposal by next week’s vote, though bipartisan conversations continue.  As for Democrats' plan, Shaheen said it wasn’t “clear” what legislation party leaders will put on the floor for a vote or when they’d make that announcement. ‘Mindful of the timeline’North Dakota Republican Sen. John Hoeven said there is “strong support” among GOP lawmakers for making changes to how the enhanced ACA tax credits work before extending them for any length of time. But he said those negotiations will take more time. “In my opinion, if we have (the vote) next week, we probably won't be at a point where we can get a big bipartisan agreement,” Hoeven said. “It's more likely they'll put something up that fails. We put something up that fails. And we keep working towards, hopefully, something that can work and that is bipartisan.”There is a “good chance,” he said, that will happen in December or January, a timeline that would likely put a solution after open enrollment closes. Hoeven declined to say if a deal would extend open enrollment or include a second window for Americans to select insurance, but said Republicans are aware of the deadlines. “We're very mindful of the timeline,” Hoeven said. “So all the things we're talking about recognize that it needs to be able to take effect next year or this year.”",,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

Larry Rhoden proposed a $7.44 billion state government budget Tuesday that would avoid big cuts but also hold South Dakota’s funding for schools, Medicaid providers and state employees flat next year. “This limited budget might seem like a challenge, but as I often say, I encourage you all to view that […]","South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden presents his 2025 budget address to lawmakers at the Capitol in Pierre on Dec. 2, 2025. (Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden proposed a $7.44 billion state government budget Tuesday that would avoid big cuts but also hold South Dakota’s funding for schools, Medicaid providers and state employees flat next year.
“This limited budget might seem like a challenge, but as I often say, I encourage you all to view that as an opportunity,” Rhoden told lawmakers during his annual budget address at the Capitol.
The news comes as state spending on Medicaid — the federal-state health program for poor and disabled people — has overtaken spending on K-12 public education for the first time, Rhoden said. Sales tax revenue was down 0.6% during the fiscal year that ended in June, which was only the third time in 30 years that the state experienced a negative sales tax trend. So far during the current fiscal year, sales tax revenue is up 4.7%.
Rhoden said it all adds up to a tight budget situation.
“I won’t sugarcoat it: Revenues have been very flat — only rising slightly,” he said.


He framed his budget as a return to normality after several years of rapid revenue gains fueled by federal pandemic aid and strong sales tax collections.
Rhoden’s plan for the fiscal year beginning July 1 includes about $2.5 billion in state general funds, with much of the rest coming from federal funding. The total proposed budget would be a 1.6% increase from the budget legislators adopted last winter.
Rhoden said the state’s economy remains strong, with the lowest unemployment rate in the country, high labor-force participation and a competitive tax climate. 
Yet, partly due to uncertainty in the national economy and low crop prices affecting South Dakota’s farm economy, Rhoden wants to reserve 12.5% of the general fund budget — about $315 million — in rainy-day funds, up from the traditional 10%. 
‘Big three’ held flat
One of the major discussion points among legislators could be Rhoden’s lack of a proposed funding increase for the so-called “big three”: schools, state employees and health care providers.
“Because our revenues haven’t grown much, we have to keep them flat this year,” Rhoden said.
That means no across-the-board inflationary increase for teacher salaries, Medicaid reimbursement rates or state worker pay. To soften the blow for state employees, Rhoden said his budget puts $3 million into the state health plan to avoid premium hikes.

On education, Rhoden took a long-term view, saying that since 2019, the state has delivered a 27.9% increase in funding for schools.
“So while these priorities aren’t getting an increase this year, I’m proud of what we’ve done for them over the past several years,” Rhoden said.   
Rhoden also tied flat education funding to declining public school enrollment. Births are down 9% over the past decade in the state, he said, and there’s been a 216% surge since 2015 in “alternative instruction,” including homeschooling, private schools and other forms of non-public education. 
No state cuts for local property tax relief
The governor did not propose using any savings from state government cuts to provide relief for local property taxpayers. Legislators made several proposals to that effect during summer study meetings.
Rhoden reminded lawmakers that the proposed budget last year included $80 million in cuts, and legislators restored $7 million. He suggested it will be challenging for legislators to find cuts this year.
“So, I ask the legislators who are asking for cuts, where should we cut?” he said. “Should we cut health care, education or public safety?”
There will be some room for legislators to maneuver. Rhoden said his budget leaves $14 million unallocated for legislative priorities.
New investments
Rhoden made several new spending proposals, including:

Staffing the new women’s prison under construction in Rapid City, including 133 full-time positions and $13.2 million in new annual expenses.
$10 million in one-time funding for information technology modernization to prevent state system outages like one that struck in August.
A newer Highway Patrol airplane for $5 million.
Reallocating $65 million in unused loan money from a $200 million housing infrastructure fund to an economic development fund, and giving $30 million of that as interest-free loans for airport expansion projects in Sioux Falls and Rapid City.
Increasing funding to South Dakota Public Broadcasting by $296,000 to support transparency and open government initiatives, including livestreaming of legislative proceedings. 

 Lawmakers react

Republican Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, is running for governor in 2026 against Rhoden and other candidates. He wants to cut the budget and reallocate the savings as property tax relief for homeowners. He said the first place he would look is at the governor’s “slush funds,” referring to various funds managed by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development.
Rep. Will Mortenson, R-Fort Pierre, said “Governor Rhoden’s budget was pretty bleak.”
“I think there’s real cause for concern for our state,” Mortenson said, pointing to sales tax revenues and Medicaid costs surpassing the cost of education. 
“It seems like we’ve economically gotten stuck in the mud,” he said.
Democratic Rep. Erik Muckey, of Sioux Falls, who serves on the budget committee, said the state could free up $70 million for the budget by reducing the rainy day fund allocation from 12.5% to 10%.
“We can be fiscally responsible with our budgets while also actually taking care of our people,” Muckey said. 
Legislators will begin debating the budget proposals when they convene in January for their annual lawmaking session.

[…],"The West Virginia Supreme Court has temporarily suspended a ruling that would have allowed students to attend school with a religious exemption to the state’s school vaccination requirements. (West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia Supreme Court has temporarily suspended a ruling from a Raleigh County judge that would have allowed students to attend school with a religious exemption to the state’s school vaccination requirements. 
The court on Tuesday granted a stay of the proceedings in a Raleigh County lawsuit brought by families seeking a religious exemption. Judge Michael Froble’s ruling last week enjoined the state and Raleigh County boards of education from enforcing the school vaccination requirements on those seeking a religious or philosophical exemption.
“Upon consideration and review, the Court is of the opinion to, and does, grant the petitioners’ motion to stay,” the Supreme Court wrote. “Enforcement of the circuit court’s November 26, 2025, ‘Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Permanent Injunction and Declaratory Relief’ and  any further proceedings in circuit court are stayed pending resolution of this petition for a writ of  prohibition.”
The state Department of Education had suspended the compulsory vaccination law Wednesday in response to the judge’s ruling. In response to the stay on Tuesday, the department reversed that suspension. It reinstated a directive to county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws. 
“This directive will be in effect until the Supreme Court issues further guidance,” the Department of Education said in a news release. “Our priority is to ensure compliance with W.Va. Code §16-3-4 and safeguard the health and well-being of all students across West Virginia.”
In a text message to West Virginia Watch Tuesday, state school board President Paul Hardesty thanked the Supreme Court.
“Like I said several months ago, this critical issue will be determined in the proper venue by the proper people,” Hardesty wrote. “Today, our highest court in the state has spoken and they will take the issue from here.” 
The Raleigh County legal action, brought by residents Miranda Guzman and Carley Hunter on behalf of their children, is one of a handful of lawsuits filed in the state over West Virginia’s school vaccination law and religious freedom. 
All states require school students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases, including polio, measles and chickenpox. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow children to opt out of the vaccine requirements based on a religious or philosophical objection. The state has only allowed medical exemptions. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state Department of Health to allow religious exemptions. The order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act, a 2023 religious freedom law. Morrisey has not rescinded that order even though the Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have added the exemptions to state law. 
According to the state Department of Health, as of Monday, 659 religious exemptions have been processed for the 2025-2026 school year. 
The state Board of Education earlier this year voted to instruct county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions.
Kanawha County Circuit Judge Rich Lindsay last month dismissed a lawsuit filed against the Kanawha County Board of Education, saying that the governor does not have authority to make laws. 
A Berkeley County judge in October denied issuing an injunction to nine families who wanted their religious exemptions recognized by the school board there, according to reporting by West Virginia MetroNews. Attorneys in that case said they would appeal to the state Supreme Court. 
The school board has filed a notice that it would appeal the Raleigh County case to the Supreme Court. 
In a statement Tuesday, Morrisey Press Secretary Drew Galang said the office is reviewing the court filing. 
“Whether we prevail in the courts or prevail with the Legislature, West Virginia will ultimately join the other 45 states that protect and defend religious liberty and will no longer be such an outlier on vaccine policy,” Galang wrote.

BURLINGTON — A defendant appeared in court on a Wednesday morning in an oversized crewneck with her hands cuffed in front of her. Judge Martin Maley said she was already looking healthier after spending time in jail since her last court date. 
The defendant’s case, involving theft charges, was one of four scheduled that day in Chittenden County’s new community accountability court. The initiative by Gov. Phil Scott started in October aims to address the backlog of court cases by directing resources to cases involving defendants who have five or more pending cases against them. 
The special court was part of Scott’s “short term action plan” to help address public safety challenges in Burlington. In his October announcement, Scott touted the court’s mission to not only move through cases quickly but also to better connect defendants with social services.

Cases are prosecuted by Zach Weight, who was appointed by Scott, and are heard by Maley, who was named by the chief Superior Court judge. 
On a recent day in court, two employees of Vermont’s Agency of Human Services sat with Hope Love, program manager of Therapeutic Works, a mental health services organization. The three often whispered, then pulled the defense lawyer aside to discuss treatment options for defendants. 
During court proceedings, Maley spoke from the bench about trying to help defendants gain stability before looking for accountability from people who have racked up multiple offenses. In one case, a defendant facing several retail theft charges pleaded guilty to four of the misdemeanors in exchange for 120 days to 18 months to serve. The defendant told the judge the charges came as he has battled substance use disorder and relapsed after being clean for five years.    
Before his sentence was imposed, the man apologized for his actions.

“Appreciate hearing that,” Maley said to him, adding, “Hopefully, you’ll find yourself in a place where you’re clean and sober, and I expect you’ll do well.”
As of Nov. 20, 18 defendants in the court had their cases resolved, according to Chief Superior Judge Thomas Zonay. Because those people had many legal cases against them, the court has resolved 152 cases. Also, 87 defendants had cases in the docket yet to be resolved, Zonay said. 
The court’s pilot period is projected to run through February, according to Tim Lueders-Dumont, executive director of the state Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs.
With about three months left, the case of the defendant who appeared that Wednesday offers a look at how attorneys and the judge are grappling with the court’s mission and resources in the cases they review. VTDigger is not naming the defendants in this story because their cases are not the type of prosecutions the publication would generally cover.
Maley began a court hearing on her case with a question for the defense: “What’s happened since we were here last?”
The defendant has been stabilized in prison, she’s on medication and reading books, said her attorney, Harley Brown. He proposed a sentence that would allow her to be released under the supervision of the Department of Corrections.
Maley said that Brown’s proposed sentence might make Maley “swallow hard and wonder why,” about the light sentence. The new court affords the lawyers and judge “the luxury of spending more time with folks and having these conversations,” Maley said.
Weight said in court that prosecuting the case of the defendant in court on that Wednesday is complicated: She is facing multiple charges for alleged thefts from vehicles. In some of those cases the victims drove in from out of state and Weight can’t even get them on the phone, let alone appear in court, he said.
The defendant has struggled with housing. She’s been trying to get a hotel room, but they’re hard to find, Brown said. 
“I mean, prison is not the answer to homelessness, I get that,” Maley said. But Maley said he was concerned about releasing the defendant into the community without any housing or support, especially when she seems to be getting healthier in jail.
Both parties discussed the possibility of letting the defendant go to Oregon, where she has family she asked to be with. But Maley said he doesn’t like the idea of passing off the case for other states to deal with. 
Weight said that a lot of defendants in the court docket have to leave the county or state to get the services they need. Many have gone to New Hampshire to get into a sober living program, he said. 
Weight said that while the defendant has many cases against her for a range of crimes, he didn’t want to propose a sentence out of line with what other defendants around the state are receiving for similar crimes. 
“I don’t want to come in here with a sledgehammer and punish people exponentially worse because they ended up in front of Your Honor,” Weight said. 
On another day, 14 cases were scheduled to be heard by the court. In many of those cases, the defendant had a warrant out for their arrest and did not appear in court. It’s unusual for a court to review those cases, Maley said, but he wanted to make sure they weren’t forgotten about. 
Not all cases were straightforward. In one, Weight believed that defendant was recently arrested in Florida. Both parties discussed with Maley how it might not be worth it to spend the state resources and money to transport someone back to Vermont if they were only facing minor charges. 
In another case, a man facing two charges of aggravated assault appeared to be heading to trial on at least one charge and the next available trial dates weren’t until the end of January. If a resolution to the cases was reached short of a trial, Maley told the parties, he would get them back in sooner.
When both parties weighed how to resolve the case of the defendant with the theft charges, Weight said, “I have tried to take the approach of being creative in resolving these cases.” 
Both sides weighed the pros and cons of different arrangements that might let her out into the community. However, they wanted to make sure the defendant had stable housing so she could continue to make progress. 
The judge agreed to a request from Weight to set the matter for another hearing.
That would buy everyone some time, the prosecutor told Maley, to “put a plan together so that she’s not released to a tent on the street.”

(USDA photo)A case of highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in a commercial turkey flock of about 18,000 birds in Hamilton County, according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. 
Iowa has had nine detections of the H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has impacted more than 184 million commercial and backyard birds since February 2022. 
IDALS reported a case of the bird flu in a Calhoun County turkey flock in October. The October case was the first detection in the state since April.

Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for Hamilton County following the HPAI detection. The proclamation makes state resources more available as officials work to dispose of birds exposed to the virus and monitor, contain and further detect the bird flu. 
IDALS asked producers to exercise heightened biosecurity around their flocks to help prevent the spread of HPAI, which is usually deadly for exposed poultry. 
Producers who notice sudden deaths in a flock, lethargy, decreased egg production, or birds with swollen heads and difficulty breathing, should contact their veterinarians, according to the agriculture department. 
Turkey, chicken and egg products remain safe to consume during the current HPAI outbreak, IDALS said.

(Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Islanders who received letters from the state that their personal information was compromised in the RIBridges data breach have the next six weeks to file a claim for a share of the $6.3 million class action settlement with Deloitte, the system’s vendor.
An estimated 735,501 Rhode Islanders whose personal information was compromised are considered class members, who can seek a flat reimbursement estimated at $100 per individual without having to provide proof of identity theft. Or, if you can provide documentation of losses tied to the breach, you can file for up to a $5,000 reimbursement. Class members can also make claims for two years of medical data monitoring, regardless of which payout they choose to pursue. 
Eligible Rhode Islanders have started to receive postcards in the mail with instructions on how to file a claim. Claims can also be made at the settlement website, ribridgesdatasettlement.com.
Claims need to be filed by Jan. 14, 2026. 
People who wish to opt out of or object to the class action settlement need to file by Dec. 30, 2025. The settlement is being managed by the Kroll Settlement Administration.
The data breach was made public in December 2024. The cyberattack, for which cybercriminal group Brain Cipher eventually took credit, stole private information from people who used the RIBridges platform, which is used to apply for public benefits such as food stamps as well as health insurance coverage through the state marketplace.
The settlement is the end result of the case Pannozzi v. Deloitte Consulting LLP, which was filed in March in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island and consolidated multiple lawsuits against Deloitte for the global firm’s role in the data breach. As part of the suit, the state-contracted Deloitte has denied any wrongdoing.
The $100 payout, however, is an estimate as the settlement is structured to pay out attorneys’ fees and other court costs before class members can be compensated. The plaintiffs’ legal team can absorb up to one-third of the settlement money, under the agreement’s terms. The seven named plaintiffs in the suit are also allowed $2,500 payouts.
If each of the more than 735,000 class members filed a claim, that would work out to about $8.50 per flat payment, prior to litigation fees or other costs. Accounting for litigation fees and the larger payouts attached to documented losses, the flat rate payouts could drop lower. Conversely, payouts could potentially be more than $100 if fewer people sign up for compensation. 
After the deadline for claims submissions, on Jan. 29, 2026, the settlement is scheduled for a court date in which it’s expected to receive the final OK from a federal judge.

Residents have since filed two lawsuits in a bid to stop the project. (Leah Romero for Source NM)Nearly three months have passed since Doña Ana County officials approved $165 billion in bonds for Project Jupiter, yet the controversial southern New Mexico data center complex’s potential impact on the area’s air quality remains unknown.
For months, critics have protested the billions in government-backed bonds and the plan to tap into one of the state’s most troubled water utilities. Residents and lawmakers in the area are also increasingly voicing concerns that the plans to fuel the project with natural gas generating stations will have serious effects on the region’s air quality.
Plans for Project Jupiter call for “microgrids” to power it. Microgrids are developments that can run solely on their own power sources without needing to connect to an existing grid, such as PNM or El Paso Electric. Plans for Project Jupiter call for constructing natural gas generating stations for its microgrid, prompting concern over whether this project can comply with the state’s Energy Transition Act, which requires utilities to meet renewable energy benchmarks and use fully renewable sources by 2045.
Recently, Acoma, LLC, a company affiliated with BorderPlex Digital Assets, which represented Project Jupiter at public meetings, published notices that it intended to apply for two air quality permits with the New Mexico Environment Department. 
Each notice corresponds to a different “microgrid” natural gas generating station planned for the project. Combined, the notices say the gas plants will emit more than 14 million tons of greenhouse gases per year.
By comparison, Albuquerque and Las Cruces, the state’s two largest cities, emit a combined 6.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases per year, according to both cities’ climate action plans. The defunct San Juan Generating Station near Farmington emitted 12 to 13 million metric tons per year and PNM’s entire system emits about 1.8 million metric tons, according to Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development for clean energy at the Colorado-based nonprofit Western Resource Advocates. Last year, when a Meta subsidiary filed an application to modify the air permit for its Los Lunas data center south of Albuquerque, it said the site’s greenhouse gas emissions would be less than 75,000 tons per year.
It’s not clear whether the plants will emit that much, or whether the figures are typos. BorderPlex Digital Assets and OpenAI, one of the main partners behind the development, did not respond to requests for comment.
“I think this means there is an error in Project Jupiter’s air permit application,” Tellinghuisen wrote in an email to Source NM. “I’d expect the facility, based on what we know about it, to emit 2 to 3 million tons of CO2 equivalents per year and would expect their air permit to allow it to emit up to 3 to 4 million tons/year.”
State law requires companies like Acoma, LLC to file a public notice stating its intent to apply for an air quality permit before actually applying. Acoma’s recent notices say the company planned to submit its application on Nov. 13. A spokesperson for the New Mexico Environment Department said Acoma, LLC had filed applications. He did not provide Source NM with copies of the applications, writing in an email that he was waiting on department legal staff to provide them. It’s unclear if Acoma, LLC applied for permits that would allow its microgrids to emit the combined 14 million tons per year, or if the figures in the application are reduced. 
When the company first filed similar notices for the microgrid gas plants in the Las Cruces Sun-News in October, it listed even larger figures: a combined output of 46.6 million tons per year. The most recent notices represent a significant decrease.
“We have to see the applications first to know how to proceed, but we’re definitely watching it,” Maslyn Locke, New Mexico Environmental Law Center’s senior environmental justice staff attorney, told Source NM. “This whole thing has been so rushed and shrouded in secrecy.”
A coalition of residents, lawmakers and climate advocates in the area share Locke’s concerns over transparency. Critics for months have said that details about the project, which was first announced in February, have been hard to come by. Some have filed lawsuits, alleging that elected county leaders voted on an incomplete application when they voted on the project. A coalition of project critics have organized weekly livestreams dubbed “Jupiter Watch,” in which those who have researched and followed the project closely share their findings with viewers. During the inaugural livestream Monday, Las Cruces-based filmmaker Annie Ersinghaus said the project has “been kept in the dark” and hopes that more community involvement will change that.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jupiter3-1024x683.png,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The Yellowstone County Commissioners at their Tuesday meeting appointed Stacy Zinn to represent House District 52 in the Montana Legislature.
Zinn, who was elected vice chairwoman of the state Republican Party this summer, will serve the remainder of Rep. Bill Mercer’s term. Mercer resigned his position after his confirmation as a U.S. District Court judge in Montana.
In a statement, Speaker of the House Brandon Ler said Zinn’s background will be an asset in the Legislature.
“Stacy Zinn has spent her career on the front lines defending American communities from cartels, terrorists, and violent drug traffickers,” Ler said. “She understands the challenges facing Billings and all of eastern Montana, from public safety and border security to the impact of fentanyl on our tribal and rural communities. Our caucus is excited to welcome her to the Montana House, and I am confident she will be a strong, independent voice for families and law enforcement in House District 52.”
During Tuesday’s meeting, the commissioners interviewed three candidates recommended by the county Republican Party — Zinn, former three-term state Rep. Rhonda Knudsen, and Jenna McKinney, who has worked for members of Montana’s federal delegation.
Knudsen served as the representative for House District 34 during the 2019, 2021 and 2023 session, but opted to run for the Senate in 2024, losing the primary to newcomer Gregg Hunter.
House District 52, in blue, comprises the north side of Billings.
Zinn spent more than 20 years working for the Drug Enforcement Agency along the souther border, on international deployments and as Montana’s DEA agent in charge starting in 2014. After mandatory retirement from the law enforcement agency due to age, Zinn got involved in the state’s political scene, running in the primary for Montana’s eastern U.S. House District. She finished third in the primary.
This summer, she ran for party chair and was elected vice chairwoman.
In her interview, Zinn told the commissioners she still has “fire in my belly” to serve, and had already filed to run for HD 52 with the state Commissioner on Political Practices.
She said her expertise in law enforcement would be a benefit to lawmakers in Helena.
“I feel I could represent law enforcement side of the House, which I think is missing in Helena,” Zinn said. “I understand probation, parole. I understand CPS (Child Protective Services). I understand the jail situation. I understand Indian country, especially, and the heartaches and stuff that’s taking place there.”
Commissioner Mark Morse asked Zinn about the most pressing issue facing residents of Yellowstone County, and she focused in on “the uptick of criminal element.”
“I think the biggest threat that we have right now is the unknowns moving into our communities,” Zinn said, adding she believes there is an increased presence of cartel members, gang members, and money laundering operations in the region.
In addition, Zinn said that rising property taxes, overcrowded schools and an overcrowded judicial system are also concerns to the county.
“We have a district attorney’s office that is busting at the seams,” she said. “They have stacks of cases that can linger on their desk for three three years plus, this can be anywhere from meth cases on up, and lot of times they get dismissed. So we need to figure out how to give support to the district attorney’s office.”
In Helena, Zinn said she will bring “fresh ideas,” advocate for law enforcement, and work to lower the burden of taxation on residents and cut down on wasted money in the state budget.
“I want to be a team player, but I also will continue putting the voters in our community first,” Zinn said. “And I want to be that partnership with you alland our leaders. I want to be that one (who) is going to communicate because I don’t believe in blindsiding Yellowstone County.”

The nonpartisan Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations, which is commonly referred to as OPE, released the 129-page Idaho Home Learning Academy evaluation report Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol after the release was authorized by the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Legislative Oversight Committee. 
OPE released the evaluation report after multiple Idaho legislators signed a March 5 letter requesting the office study the Idaho Home Learning Academy’s finances, expenditures, policies, contracts and student achievement results.
The Idaho Home Learning Academy, or IHLA for short, is a rapidly growing public virtual charter school authorized by the small, rural Oneida School District. 
There were about 7,600 online students enrolled at Idaho Home Learning Academy during the 2024-25 school year, many of which do not live within the traditional geographic boundaries of the Oneida School District. 
 New report raises questions about how supplemental learning funds are used by some families

As part of Idaho Home Learning Academy’s contract, its education service providers administer supplemental learning funds of $1,700 to $1,800 per student to families enrolled in IHLA that were paid for by Idaho taxpayer dollars, the report found. The money is intended to help pay families for education expenses, and the OPE evaluators found that the largest share of the funds were spent on technology expenses, such as computers, printers and internet access. Other significant sources of supplemental learning fund expenses went for physical education activities and performing arts expenses, the OPE report found.
However, OPE evaluators found that some families used their share of funding for tuition and fees at private schools and programs. Some families also used their funds for noneducational board games, kitchen items like BBQ tongs, cosmetics, a home theater projector screen, video games, Nintendo Switch controllers, a Meta Quest virtual reality headset, movie DVDs, weapons, sights lasers, shooting targets, remote controlled cars, hoverboards, action figures, smartwatches, water park tickets and the cost of registering website domain names, the OPE report found. 
Families with students enrolled at Idaho Home Learning Academy are able to access the funds though both direct ordering programs and reimbursements. The OPE report found that Idaho Home Learning Academy’s three service providers (Braintree, Home Ed and Harmony) spent about $12.5 million providing supplemental learning funds for IHLA families during the 2024-25 school year. Service providers said that some families did not spend any or all of their supplemental learning funds, and the money was retained by the service providers, not returned back to the state or school district, the OPE report found. 
 Idaho governor, superintendent of public instruction respond to OPE report’s findings

Idaho Gov. Brad Little called the report’s findings “troubling” in a letter released with the report Tuesday.
“We also have an obligation to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars,” Little wrote. “The OPE report on IHLA is troubling, especially as it pertains to supplemental learning fund expenses, academic performance, supplemental curriculum and the funding formula that enables virtual programs to receive more funding than brick-and-mortar public schools. The OPE report reveals that statutory safeguards are insufficient, oversight is inconsistent and accountability measures have not kept pace with the fast expansion of the IHLA program.”
The OPE evaluation report findings come at a time when every dollar of state funding in Idaho is being stretched further amid a revenue shortfall. All state agencies outside of the K-12 public school system are implementing 3% mid-year budget holdbacks, and the state budget is projected to end fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2027 in a budget deficit, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Idaho may need to find $600 million to $1 billion for next year’s state budget

Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield said the report raised concerns for her as well.
“(The OPE report) also raises important questions about whether direct and indirect payments to families are a proper and legal use of funds appropriated for public schools,” Critchfield wrote in a Nov. 26 letter to OPE leadership.

The OPE evaluation report found that limited oversight and accountability create uncertainty about how supplemental learning funds paid for with state taxpayer dollars are used and whether students’ curriculum choices align with state standards and transparency requirements. 
Idaho state laws and administrative rules do not specifically allow or prohibit the use of supplemental learning funds, the OPE report found. That finding was one of several “policy gray areas” that the OPE evaluation report documented. 
Little concluded his letter by saying he is ready to work with the Idaho Legislature, the Idaho State Department of Education and the Idaho State Board of Education to restore meaningful accountability for the use of taxpayer dollars.
“I have carefully reviewed the recommendations provided in this report and strongly encourage the Legislature to address the loopholes in state statute,” Little wrote. 
 Oneida School District superintendent stresses Idaho Home Learning Academy did not break state law

In response to the OPE report, Oneida School District Superintendent Dallan Rupp, who is also a member of the Idaho Home Learning Academy School board, emphasized that the report did not find that IHLA was guilty of any misconduct.
“Importantly, the OPE report did not identify any misconduct at IHLA,” Rupp said during a meeting Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. “This outcome underscores the effectiveness of Oneida School District’s oversight and reflects IHLA’s consistent compliance with Idaho’s laws, statutes, rules, regulations and procedures, as well as its cooperative relationship with the Idaho State Department of Education. We remain fully committed to operating within all established guidelines, just as we have in the past.”

“I’m extremely concerned,” Ruchti said during Tuesday’s meeting at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. “This is public money – public taxpayer money – and we have an obligation to make sure that it’s spent appropriately and with oversight. And so, yes, it may not have violated any statutory requirements at this point. But what I’m saying is that what I saw in that presentation caused me serious concerns about how IHLA and other online teaching institutions are able to spend public dollars in a way that was not intended.”
 Idaho watchdog report found most online virtual teachers were part-time employees

OPE also found that most Idaho Home Learning Academy teachers were part-time, unlike traditional schools, and the Idaho Home Learning Academy spends much less on salaries and benefits than it receives from the state’s salary apportionment formula. 
The report found IHLA was able to use the savings it realized in state funding provided to pay for staff salaries and health benefits to instead use at IHLA’s discretion or to pay its education service providers. 
The OPE report found that most of IHLA’s teachers are part-time employees and do not provide full-time direct instruction to students. Instead, the report found that Idaho Home Learning Academy’s kindergarten through eighth grade instructional model relied heavily on parent-directed learning and that IHLA teachers typically offered feedback and oversight instead of direct instruction. 
According to the report, IHLA reported $46.3 million in total expenditures from state funds during the 2024-25 school year. While traditional brick-and-mortar public schools’ largest expenditures are for staff salaries and benefits, the report found that only 36% of IHLA’s expenditures went to staff. A larger portion – 45% of IHLA’s total expenditures, or $20.6 million – went to paying education service providers.
The OPE report also found that Idaho Home Learning Academy’s students lagged behind statewide averages for scores on Idaho Standards Achievement, or ISAT, tests. The OPE report found 42% of IHLA students were proficient in English language arts during the 2024-25 school year, compared to the statewide average of 52% of Idaho students. 
The report also found just 25% of IHLA students were proficient in math during the 2024-25 school year, compared to the Idaho statewide average of 43%.
However, the OPE report highlighted that some IHLA families interviewed for the report said they do not believe statewide standardized tests are a good measure of student learning. The report also noted that many Idaho Home Learning Academy families identified themselves as homeschoolers and said they were using IHLA by choice because they were unhappy with the quality of education in traditional brick-and-mortar schools or felt that their child’s educational needs were not being met by more traditional public schools.

Dec. 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court considered arguments Tuesday in a multi-year fight over whether state officials needed to bargain with a state employees union over an executive order seeking to limit remote work.
Multiple justices questioned what constituted “bargaining” in relation to the November 2023 executive order from Gov. Jim Pillen, which ordered most state employees to return to work in person, beginning Jan. 2, 2024. 
A three-member panel of the Nebraska Commission of Industrial Relations, a state labor court, unanimously upheld the order in July 2024. The commission decided state officials didn’t violate the rights of the Nebraska Association of Public Employees when it refused to negotiate.

The court said the labor contract already “covered” remote work and that the union’s lawsuit was “frivolous” and done in “bad faith.” As a punishment, the commission ordered the union to pay $42,234.63 for state attorneys’ fees.
The union appealed, arguing it was the union’s duty to defend members’ rights. The union also said that while it tried to negotiate limited work standards before a two-year contract took effect July 1, 2023, the state flatly rejected the attempt. 
State employees received “historic” pay increases under that contract, which state officials said was a concession, but a union leader and the union’s attorney said pay raises were separate and not a “quid pro quo” agreement.
What is ‘bargaining’?
Justices Jonathan Papik and John Freudenberg asked whether the union abandoning remote work standards and not pushing the state further was still “bargaining.” 
Attorney Richard Griffin, for the union, said it was not and that the union had not “clearly” or “unmistakably” waived its right to bargain.
“Bargaining involves give and take,” said Griffin. “Bargaining involves counter proposals. Even hard bargaining involves some response, and then the parties look to other provisions of the contract where they can reach compromise. This was not bargained over.”

The union represents more than 8,000 state employees, or about 45% of state workers. Since the union challenged the order, the commission paused the remote work order for union-covered positions. The current two-year contract, mid-2025 to mid-2027, included no further clarifications on remote work.
Zach Viglianco, the state’s principal deputy solicitor general, said the state’s refusal to consider limited remote work standards was a “bargaining strategy.” He said state officials chose to “surrender” on other matters but “jealously guarded” broad authority over remote work.
Viglianco echoed the commission that the labor contract gave state employers “the right to increase, reduce, change, modify and alter the composition and site of the work force.” Viglianco said that clearly means “where” work occurs, in addition to other broad language for various aspects of work at any time, including shifts, working hours and duties or responsibilities.
“There is no other way to read that unambiguous language,” Viglianco said. “The fact that a party can present an alternative interpretation of language does not render it ambiguous.”
‘Site of the workforce’
Justice Jason Bergevin honed in on that part of the contract and asked why “site of the workforce” didn’t mean remote work. Griffin said it might but doesn’t explain implementation.
Griffin and Justin Hubly, the union’s executive director, said state law still requires negotiations over specifics of and full rights to members for implementation, such as defining “remote work” and “remote location.”
“Why wouldn’t it fully define the party’s rights to say the state can determine the site of work, and that’s the definition — the state has complete discretion?” Papik asked.

Griffin responded that it still doesn’t answer what happens when a worksite is unavailable because of no or little office space. Some exceptions were considered in Pillen’s executive order in such cases, leaving broad authority to state agency heads to implement the order.
The Nebraska Department of Administrative Services did not respond to a Tuesday request from the Nebraska Examiner on the latest status of remote or hybrid work for state employees. 
Hubly said only one in six of union members ever worked remotely during the pandemic, and many had returned to work in person. He estimated that about 1,000 state workers were still remote, some of whom had always been in remote or hybrid positions.
“The idea that nobody is working remotely is just not true, but it is significantly reduced from where it was,” Hubly said.
Pillen’s order also asked for “mechanisms” to measure and confirm productivity for public servants still allowed to work in remote or hybrid settings, which the union sought to clarify.
Order relates to COVID-19 pandemic
Freudenberg asked Viglianco whether Pillen’s order stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic. Pillen himself said in the executive order that Nebraskans expect that people are most productive in person and that “the COVID-19 pandemic is over.”
“The people of Nebraska expect their elected leaders to restore Nebraska’s public servant workforce to the posture it was in prior to the pandemic,” Pillen wrote in his order.
NE labor court sides with Gov. Pillen’s order calling state employees back to the office 

Viglianco said the pandemic had some influence, such as on the number of workers working from home. However, he said remote work has existed since at least the 1980s. 
A state brief to the Supreme Court argued the union hadn’t complained before regarding remote work, including a May 2021 executive order from then-Gov. Pete Ricketts.
Attorneys’ fees
A separate question before the Supreme Court is whether to uphold the assessment of attorneys’ fees against the union. It was one of the first cases where the party suing in front of the labor court had been awarded attorneys’ fees. The union worried it could “chill” further labor disputes.
The state estimated its attorneys’ fees at $113,296.63 but found the commission’s lower award “reasonable.” State attorneys and the commission alleged the union purposefully tried to delay the case while increasing its fee-paying membership.
“[Deterring] future frivolity is an important role played by awards of attorney fees,” the state wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court justices. “Affirming the award entered here will reinforce the notion that abuse of legal process, like crime, does not pay.”

Griffin told the justices that hundreds of employees had contacted the union and that it was within the union’s free speech rights to seek to increase membership or ask for donations. The union also argued the commission could not assess fees against those filing labor disputes, describing the action as “punitive,” “unprecedented” and beyond the commission’s authority.
Hubly said the union would begin the next round of bargaining in September and that remote work could still make sense for some needed positions, such as human resources, accounting and information technology. However, he said it’s not for all positions, like snowplow drivers.
“We’re really happy that we decided to take this appeal all the way to the Supreme Court,” Hubly said at a noon-hour rally. “Regardless of what happens there today, we’re going to get clarity from the highest court, and that will guide our path at the bargaining table in the future.”
The Supreme Court will issue an opinion on the case soon. Sarpy County District Judge Stefanie Martinez rounds out the current six-member court.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The interim director for South Carolina’s elections agency is slated to become its permanent director following a unanimous vote from the commission Tuesday.
Jenny Wooten, previously the agency’s chief of staff, took over as interim director in September, after the five-member commission voted 3-2 to fire then-director Howard Knapp.
Knapp was arrested in October on charges of embezzlement and misconduct in office. Investigators claimed he used state vehicles for personal travel and a public credit card to pay for fuel on those trips over eight months, according to court documents.
Fired SC elections chief charged with embezzlement, misconduct

Knapp’s former deputy director, Paige Salonich, was arrested the same day on a single charge of wiretapping. Both Knapp and Salonich were released from jail on personal recognizance bonds. That means they pay nothing up front as long as they continue to show up for court hearings.
Commission members have publicly praised Wooten for her transparency with the oversight board, especially when it comes to the agency’s budget. Wooten first started working for the State Election Commission in 2022, overseeing policy and outreach, according to a commission news release.
She will need approval from the Senate to officially become the agency’s director.
“Ensuring the impartiality, accessibility, and integrity of South Carolina’s elections is essential to maintaining public faith in our democracy,” Wooten said in a statement. “I’m grateful to the commission for the trust they have placed in me as our agency strives to uphold that mission.”
Wooten most recently worked in communications for Columbia nonprofit Serve & Connect, which works to form relationships between police and civilians. Before that, she oversaw programs for college savings, tuition repayment and financial literacy for the Treasurer’s Office. She has also worked for the attorney general’s office and as an office assistant for Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer, according to her LinkedIn.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0167-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – About 160 members of the Oklahoma National Guard will deploy to secure Washington, D.C.
A send-off ceremony was held Monday at the Armed Forces Reserve Center in Mustang for members of the Oklahoma National Guard’s Task Force Thunder participating in the D.C. Safe and Beautiful mission. The guard will deploy over the coming days.
The mission will last about 90 days.
“Our Guardsmen routinely answer the call to serve and support their community, state and nation,” said Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Mancino, adjutant general for Oklahoma. “As with many state-side support missions, this mission is voluntary, and I am so proud of each and every one of our Guardsmen as they continue to step forward.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt authorized members to participate.
His office said Tuesday that the deployment is funded by the federal government, but did not provide a cost.
Sarah Corley, a Stitt spokeswoman, said the mission is part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing request for support from the states to “protect the federal enclave of D.C.”
Trump in March signed an executive order creating the D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force and assigned it wide-ranging responsibilities, including providing more law enforcement presence in areas such as the National Mall and Memorial Parks, museums, monuments, Lafayette Park and Union Station.
The executive order also indicated it would work to beautify public spaces.
Over 2,000 national guard troops are already in D.C. 
Last month, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration’s decision to deploy the National Guard was illegal. The judge paused the order to give the Trump administration time to appeal the Nov. 20 decision or to remove the guard. The Trump administration has appealed.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth pledged last week to increase the number of troops in Washington D.C. by 500 following the shooting of two on-duty guard members.  
West Virginia National Guard Spc. Sarah Beckstrom died Nov. 27 after a targeted attack blocks from the White House.
Another victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe of Martinsburg, West Virginia, remains hospitalized after being shot.
Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan refugee, faces a charge of first-degree murder while armed, possession of a firearm and assault with intent to kill. He pleaded not guilty Tuesday during an arrangement hearing.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Planned Parenthood dropped a case challenging the state’s ability to remove its clinics from the list of approved Medicaid providers, ending a seven-year legal saga, advocates confirmed Tuesday.
The decision came after a federal appeals court ruled that Congress could block Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide from receiving Medicaid funds. A separate U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this year barred South Carolina’s two Planned Parenthood clinics from getting Medicaid reimbursements.
The South Carolina case began with an executive order from Gov. Henry McMaster in 2018 telling the state’s Medicaid agency to stop reimbursing Planned Parenthood for non-abortion health services, which include birth control, breast cancer screenings, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Planned Parenthood sued, blocking the order before it took effect.
Planned Parenthood files new challenge to stay on SC’s Medicaid list for non-abortion services

After years of legal back and forth, the U.S. Supreme Court in June decided patients don’t have a right to sue in order to see the doctor of their choice, allowing the state to stop reimbursing Medicaid costs at Planned Parenthood clinics in Columbia and Charleston.
Planned Parenthood tried another tact in August, this time arguing the order unfairly discriminated against the nonprofit. But when the federal appeals court’s September decision barred clinics nationwide from receiving Medicaid funds, attorneys realized they didn’t have a path forward, said lobbyist Vicki Ringer.
“Even if we were successful on a state case, we would still have that federal defunding,” Ringer told the SC Daily Gazette.
The paperwork for the settlement is still being finalized, Ringer said. The notice was filed in federal court Oct. 17.
McMaster declared victory.
“Thanks to Gov. McMaster’s leadership and his victory at the U.S. Supreme Court, South Carolina taxpayers will never again be forced to subsidize abortion providers like Planned Parenthood,” spokesman Brandon Charochak said in a statement.
But Planned Parenthood isn’t giving up entirely. Under the agreement to drop the challenge, the organization could try again later, should federal law change or justices rule differently. However, nothing is in the works for the time being, Ringer said.
Clinic closures
In 2025, 50 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed nationwide, according to a report Planned Parenthood released last month.
They include 20 closures since July 4, according to the nonprofit.
That’s when President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill into law. A provision in that massive package banned Medicaid dollars from going to clinics that offers abortions.
The two locations in South Carolina are not in danger of adding to the tally, Ringer said.
“There has been no talk, no thoughts, no nothing about closing our two health centers,” Ringer said.
Because South Carolina never expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, few of the patients who visited Planned Parenthood — even before the court rulings — used Medicaid.
An estimated 500 of the clinics’ 12,000 total patients in their South Carolina database, or around 4%, used Medicaid, she said.
Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood clinics in SC have stopped, but questions remain

“Certainly, any amount of money has an impact when you’re a nonprofit organization,” Ringer said. But most of the funding for the South Carolina clinics comes from donations and grants, not Medicaid reimbursements, she added.
Of the $35 million spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state’s Medicaid agency.
Planned Parenthood stopped requesting Medicaid reimbursements in June, and the state removed the clinics from its list of providers about two months later, when South Carolina officially received permission to carry out the high court’s order.
People who use the government-funded insurance can continue visiting the clinics, but they will have to cover any costs out of pocket.
Patients can pay for services offered at the clinics on a sliding scale, which allows low-income patients to pay only what they can afford based on how much they make. But health care often involves other costs Planned Parenthood can’t cover, such as getting a prescription or a lab test, Ringer said.
If a person can’t afford private insurance, they can’t afford prescriptions or test costs, either, she said.
Clinic shooting
The Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia also remained open following a nearby shooting last month.
Columbia police responded to reports of a shooting in a parking lot beside the Planned Parenthood clinic Nov. 14. Officers found a man who had been shot. He has since been released from the hospital, according to a Nov. 25 news release. Police never named the injured man or specified where on his body he was shot.
Anti-abortion advocate Mark Baumgartner was arrested on charges of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, as well as possessing a weapon during a violent crime, stemming from the shooting. He was released from jail Nov. 25 after posting a $50,000 bond, as long as he does not return to the location of the shooting, according to court records.
Baumgartner leads A Moment of Hope, which is a constant presence outside the Columbia clinic. Volunteers in bright green vests attempt to divert women walking into Planned Parenthood, in the hopes of preventing abortions, according to the nonprofit’s website.
Based on videos recorded on nearby security cameras and onlookers’ cellphones, Baumgartner and the man who was shot appeared to get into a physical fight outside the clinic. Police have not said what led to the fight.
Baumgartner did not respond to calls or emails seeking comment.

People seeking a commercial driver’s license would be charged with a second-degree misdemeanor under the bill if they receive “unauthorized assistance” on the part of the test that assesses ability to read and understand highway signs. Anyone who gives the assistance would be subject to the same charge.
That provision comes after the arrest of Harjinder Singh, an Indian national who is accused of killing three people when he made an illegal U-turn on Florida’s Turnpike. That story was the topic of political debate, particularly after it emerged that Singh’s commercial license had been issued by California, a Democratic-led state. Singh entered the country during President Donald Trump’s first term.

Gasoline preemption
The bill would prohibit local governments from banning gas-powered landscape or farm equipment such as leaf blowers and chainsaws.
According to the bill analysis, Miami Beach and Naples are among “a number of local governments” that have prohibited use of such equipment in favor of battery-operated machines. 
Sen. Darryl Rouson, a Democrat from St. Petersburg, asked whether gas-powered lawnmowers would fall under the scope of the bill. Truenow said they must be included to ensure a “level playing field.”
Solicitation
The bill would create a state law limiting door-to-door sales. Floridians would be able to post signs to keep their front doors free from solicitation. 
The intent is to “protect such private property rights by creating a uniform standard for notifying individuals or groups of individuals that commercial solicitation is prohibited on private property,” according to the bill.
The bill would impose “a noncriminal violation” punishable with a $500 fine for first offenders who solicit a house that has posted a sign warning against soliciting. Second offenses would be punishable as second-degree misdemeanors. 
The sign, as written in statute, would have to say: “THIS DWELLING IS DESIGNATED PRIVATE PROPERTY. NO COMMERCIAL SOLICITATION IS PERMITTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 501.062, FLORIDA STATUTES.”
Truenow specified during the meeting that the law would not make it illegal for political or religious door-knocking.
Additionally
Also in the 60-page bill is a proposed repeal of a law outlining Florida’s involvement in the Southern States Energy Compact, a non-profit that addresses energy and environmental policies. 
“According to the department, Florida has not used and does not anticipate using the services provided by the compact. Participating in the compact costs Florida approximately $45,000 annually,” according to the bill analysis. 
The bill would require people seeking emergency recovery agriculture loans to be citizens of Florida and the United States and entities to be owned and operated in the U.S. 
Lawmakers are also looking to make it illegal to have or use a signal jamming device, a first-degree misdemeanor. Signal jamming is already illegal under federal law.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Central-Florida-Farm-Tour-Visit-Central-Florida-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

(Photo by Getty Images)A House comittee on Tuesday voted 14-6 to pass a bill that allows wrongful death lawsuits for the loss of developing fetuses, with a leading proponent claiming the legislation should be a harbinger of things to come for the anti-abortion movement in Florida.
“I want to emphasize to this committee that this bill should be the beginning of a broader expansion of civil remedies afforded under Florida law to hold accountable those who continue to take the lives of unborn children illegally in our state,” founder and executive director of Florida Voice for the Unborn Andrew Shirvell told members of the House Judiciary Committee.
Shirvell claimed there would be upward of 55,000 abortions provided in Florida by the end of the year. “And I guarantee, I guarantee those official numbers contain many, many, abortions, possibly thousands, being performed illegally without justification past the six-week limitation that went into effect on May 1, 2024,” he said.
Shirvell didn’t say where his data came from. The Agency for Health Care Administration’s abortion data for calendar year 2025 show that, as of Oct. 31, 36,857 terminations had been reported by Florida physicians and hospitals.
The House Judiciary Committee was the last stop for HB 289, which already been approved by the House Civil Justice and Claims Subcommittee last month over the objections of  Equality Florida, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, and Florida Now, which are known to closely track reproductive rights issues.

“We’ve said this before and we’ll say it again: By moving this bill forward, politicians are inviting irreparable harm to pregnant patients and deepening Florida’s maternal healthcare system crisis,” ACLU interim political director Kara Gross said in a statement.
“HB 289 is so far-reaching and overly broad that it allows any person who impregnates someone else — including an abusive ex-partner or rapist — to bring harassing litigation against individuals, doctors, hospitals, private businesses, and governmental entities for a loss of pregnancy from the moment of fertilization, by simply alleging that they were at fault,” she continued.
“This increased liability exposure will be devastating to any health care practitioner or hospital that treats pregnant patients, and is especially dangerous to OB/GYNs who specialize in high-risk pregnancies.”
But other groups that steer clear from abortion debates, such as the Florida Justice Reform Institute, which promotes legislation to reduce civil lawsuits against businesses, and the Doctor’s Co., the nation’s largest physician-owned medical malpractice carrier, also opposed the legislation.
Companion SB 164, by Fort Pierce Republican Sen. Erin Grall, faces an uphill battle in the Florida Senate, where the bill cleared its first committee by a 5-4 vote.
Damages for the death of an unborn child are not recoverable under the state’s wrongful death laws, which allow for recovery of medical or funeral bills and past and future pain and suffering. Damages may be recoverable for “negligent stillbirth” in a common-law proceeding. Those damages are limited to mental pain and anguish and medical expenses incurred incident to the pregnancy.
The House and Senate bills would allow parents to file wrongful death suits for unborn children, defined as a member of “the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.” Wrongful death suits allow damages for mental pain and loss of support, meaning jurors could determine the salary the fetus could have earned over its life as part of the damages to which parents could be entitled.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/abortion-law-stock-image-300x200-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

(Getty Images)Last month, a Wall Street portfolio manager named Michael Green created a bit of a stir with a Substack article headlined, “How a broken benchmark quietly broke America.” His provocative economic argument, in a nutshell, amounts to the obliteration of an often cited but too-rarely dissected metric: the federal poverty line.
Green writes: “While trying to understand why the American middle class feels poorer each year despite healthy GDP (gross domestic product) growth and low unemployment, I came across a sentence buried in a research paper: ‘The U.S. poverty line is calculated as three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, adjusted for inflation.’ … I felt sick.”
It’s sickening because the annual income that places an American family of four at the poverty line in 2025, using 1963 domestic budget math, is $32,150. By Green’s conservative calculations, that figure should be about $140,000.
The critical responses to Green’s argument, as collected by The Washington Post, are unsurprising. The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, called it “laughable,” the Post’s Julie Zauzmer Weil reported, while George Mason University economist Alex Tabarrok said, “to think that we today are living in some hellish landscape compared to our parents and even our grandparents is just a complete distortion of reality.”
Tabarrok misses the point. As just about any working-class American family will tell you, the real “distortion of reality” is the idea that a family of four can do anything but suffer on $32,150 a year.
Green’s math isn’t novel. The Post story, for example, references the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s “Living Wage Calculator,” which estimates the living wage for a New Hampshire family of four, with two working adults, at $31.19 an hour. That adds up to an annual household income of $129,768. Also, back in October, a New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute analysis found that a family of four making the 2024 state median household income of $99,782 falls about $2,000 short of covering the collective cost of the mortgage on a median-priced home, child care for two children under 5, food, health care, and gas. Notice, too, the line items that aren’t included, like utility/heating costs and cellphone/broadband service, for example.
For those inclined to blame the poor for their poverty, let me try to anticipate some potential criticisms. 
Everyone has to live within their means, so maybe don’t buy a median-priced house if you can’t afford it. Fair enough, so let’s look at New Hampshire’s rental market. To afford a market-rate two-bedroom apartment in this state, which boasts the 12th most expensive rent in the country, you have to earn about $35 an hour, for an annual income of $72,971, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And if you’re going to do some itemized nitpicking, let me stop one of your 20th-century rants before it begins: Smartphones and broadband access are not luxury items in 21st-century America; they are a requirement for anyone who wishes to participate in society and the economy — the cost of the “participation ticket,” as Green calls it.
And then there’s the big criticism, articulated by Tabarrok in the Post story: “(Green) takes the poverty measure — and then turns it around and turns it into a middle-class measure.”
That’s the heart of it, isn’t it? What does it mean to be poor, and what does it mean to be middle class in this nation of profound economic inequality? Green’s piece carefully outlines the cost not of a life free of struggle but a decent life for an American family in 2025, in which the cost of housing, child care, health care — and here I invite you to calculate your own cost of living — are at the very least within reach. Does “within reach” add up to something close to the poverty line of $32,150? The New Hampshire median household income of $99,782? Green’s “conservative” estimate of $140,000?
One of those numbers is truly absurd, and it’s not Green’s.
Back in the spring, I tried to get at this idea in a personal way. Not to complain about my lot but to articulate a genuine befuddlement over how difficult it is to get by for a young family. I explained that my wife and I had worked hard, had lived well within our means, and it still wasn’t enough to make the numbers work. And in that moment when it felt like everything was crumbling, we were right at the median household income for a family of four.
We were not even close to poor by state or federal standards, but we were honestly one unexpected bill away from losing the battle to stay afloat. If you can relate to our middle-class challenges, if you can easily picture that kind of struggle, what kind of life, then, do you imagine for a family of four at the poverty line in 2025? 
For starters, they don’t live in a two-bedroom apartment, because that would cost more than two-thirds of their annual income. Maybe squeeze into a studio? Sorry, but that’s still about 45% of income — too high a ratio with other expenses like health care and transportation. Can a family at the poverty level afford child care for two children under 5, at a cost of $29,082? Of course not. But what happens to that household income when one parent stays home to care for the children, out of necessity?
Life crumbles a little more.
In New Hampshire and nationally, lawmakers talk a lot about the poverty line while debating elements of the social safety net, especially when it comes to “responsible” cuts. For example, Gov. Kelly Ayotte, in trying to spin her newly adopted premiums for Medicaid enrollees, suggested that truly “vulnerable” residents wouldn’t be affected. Only those making 255% of the federal poverty line would have to pay up to 5% of their household income toward the premiums. 
What does the ledger look like for such a family? They earn $81,983 annually, which leaves them nearly $20,000 below the state median. We also know that a family at the median, by the Fiscal Policy Institute’s calculations, finishes the year about $2,000 in the red just when it comes to meeting basic expenses. So things are beyond tight for our family of four at 255% of the poverty line, and Ayotte’s new 5% premium leaves them about $4,100 deeper in the hole. That is why Democrats rightfully called the premium an “income tax on the poor.”
That’s the problem with the poverty line as it currently exists: It misstates, by a huge degree, the cost of getting by. Even worse, it provides lawmakers with a false premise on which to implement social safety net cuts that compound poverty.
I really hope you’ll read Green’s piece, and the Post story on the reaction. I hope you’ll consider, too, how and why vast inequality endangers everyone, even those who benefit most.
And, I hope you’ll think honestly about the kind of life available to a young New Hampshire family at the official threshold of poverty in America and ask yourself this question:
Which of life’s necessities should we as a society be comfortable denying to those we consider poor?",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/povertyline-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

Jared Polis, seen during a 2024 press conference at the Colorado Capitol, echoed the Colorado Department of Corrections in saying the state is not fulfilling the Trump administration's request to transfer Tina Peters. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)The office of Colorado Gov. Jared Polis affirmed this week a decision by state prison officials not to fulfill a request by the Trump administration to transfer custody of Tina Peters from the state to federal authorities.
Peters, the former Republican Mesa County clerk, is serving a 9-year prison sentence for her role in a scheme to breach the security of her own election equipment. President Donald Trump has repeatedly demanded that she be released.
The director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons sent a letter to the Colorado Department of Corrections last month requesting that the state “initiate the transfer” of Peters to the bureau. 
“Requests to transfer inmates from the Colorado Department of Corrections emanate from the state, and not from other entities. The state has not made any requests to transfer this inmate,” Shelby Wieman, a Polis spokesperson, said in a text to Newsline.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This almost exactly repeats a statement from Department of Corrections spokesperson Christian Andrade, who also wrote in an email to Newsline that “the Department is not currently seeking any transfer.”
Peters, 70, is incarcerated at La Vista Correctional Facility in Pueblo. She was convicted by a Mesa County jury on multiple charges, including four felonies, and sentenced October 2024. She was the linchpin in an effort to find evidence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. There is no credible evidence that the election results were compromised.
Trump cannot pardon Peters, because she was convicted on state charges. But he has called for the U.S. Department of Justice to take “all necessary action” to get her released. In August, he promised “harsh measures” if she were not let out of jail “right now.”
A bipartisan group of local election officials last week made an impassioned plea to Polis that he reject the Trump administration’s transfer request, saying failure to do so would set a dangerous precedent. Almost two weeks elapsed between the administration’s formal transfer request and the first indications that the state Department of Corrections would resist it, and Polis’ previous silence on the matter was a widespread source of indignation among election security proponents.
“His silence is deafening, and it’s also offensive,” said Molly Fitzpatrick, the Boulder County clerk, during a press conference last week.
Peters has appealed her conviction in state court and she is pursuing a habeas corpus petition in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, where she argues she should be released on bond. On Sunday she asked the court for an emergency ruling, saying her 97-year-old mother is in intensive care in Virginia and she wants to travel there to visit.
Peters’ lawyer, Florida-based Peter Ticktin, calls Peters a “political prisoner.” During a recent appearance on Steve Bannon’s podcast, he suggested presidents actually do have the power to pardon people who have been convicted of state crimes and that he intends to pursue such a claim in Peters’ case up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. He also said he thinks the Trump administration should use the U.S. military to free Peters from the Colorado prison by force.

Free.,"Student coalition, Dem lawmakers object to Trump Education Department moves",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/student-coalition-dem-lawmakers-object-trump-education-department-moves,,"WASHINGTON — A pair of Democratic lawmakers joined student leaders Tuesday in blasting President Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. U.S. Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois, alongside college and high school students from across the United States, rebuked the Trump administration’s plans to shift several of the Education Department’s responsibilities to other Cabinet-level agencies as part of a larger effort to abolish the 46-year-old Education Department. Markey said Trump’s and Education Secretary Linda McMahon’s “dismantling of the department will have immediate negative consequences for students, for families, for local schools nationwide,” during a virtual press conference organized by “Hands Off Our Schools,” a coalition encompassing student government leaders from Washington, D.C.“When a parent or superintendent needs support or technical assistance, there will be no one to pick up the phone,” he said. McMahon defended the move at a Nov. 20 White House press briefing, saying “these interagency agreements to cut our own bureaucratic bloat are a key step in our efforts to shift educational authority from Washington, D.C., to your state education agency, your local superintendent, your local school board — entities that are accountable to you.” But Markey and Underwood said the administration’s moves would have deeply negative impacts.“The Trump agenda to destroy the Department of Education is not about cutting red tape — it is about enacting cruelty and intentionally breaking the programs that ensure the promise of education is delivered to every single student,” Markey said. Underwood said “this administration’s attacks on our Department of Education are part of a much larger assault on the very foundations of our constitutional rights and our democracy.”She added that “by tearing down the Department of Education, this administration has made an explicit choice to abandon students and families.” Underwood — who is a registered nurse — also took aim at the department’s proposal stemming from congressional Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law that would place stricter loan limits on students pursuing graduate nursing programs because they would not fall under the “professional” degree classification. She said the effort is “devastating for our already overburdened nursing workforce, and it’s a disaster for our health care system, especially in rural communities.” ‘Brainless decision’ Students from California, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C., also slammed the department’s plans to transfer responsibilities to other agencies and potential impacts on marginalized students. “This brainless decision to shift programs out of the (Education Department) is targeting the most vulnerable among us,” Darius Wagner, a student at Georgetown University, said, describing the move as “unnecessarily cruel.” “Other federal departments that now (bear) this responsibility do not have the resources, staff or expertise to manage these programs and will inevitably mismanage resources that will leave our most vulnerable children behind,” Wagner added.Ayaan Moledina, a high school student in Austin, Texas, said “dismantling and destroying the department will lead to major consequences on the success of marginalized students.” Moledina, who serves as federal policy director of the advocacy group Students Engaged in Advancing Texas (SEAT), said that “without a federal department, there will be no federal oversight of institutions to guarantee the basic and fundamental rights of students.” He added: “There will be no federal assistance for institutions to implement federally mandated programs, putting more of a burden on schools that already have their plates full.” Six interagency agreements The agreements to transfer several of the Education Department’s responsibilities to four other departments drew swift condemnation from Democratic officials, labor unions and advocacy groups, who questioned the legality of the effort and voiced concerns about the harm that would be imposed on students, families and schools as a result. The Education Department clarified that it would “maintain all statutory responsibilities and will continue its oversight of these programs” regarding its six agreements signed with Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State.Prior to the six announced interagency agreements, the agency had already undergone a slew of changes that the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily greenlit in July, including mass layoffs that gutted more than 1,300 employees and a plan to dramatically downsize the department ordered earlier this year.",,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died as a result of her injuries, and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in the hospital with severe wounds. D.C. Superior Court Magistrate Judge Renee Raymond denied bond for 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who officials allege drove across the United States to the district from his residence in Washington state. The guard members were attacked while on duty in a downtown neighborhood blocks from the White House.“He came across the country 3,000 miles, armed with a specific purpose in mind,” Judge Raymond said in her reasoning for denying him bond. “The government’s case is exceedingly strong.”The U.S. Attorney’s Office filed charges Tuesday for first-degree murder while armed; possession of a firearm; and assault with the intent to kill. Lakanwal’s next court date is Jan. 14.“The nature and circumstances of the instant offense, the strength of the government’s case, and the sheer terror that resulted, that continues to animate because of his actions, leads me to conclude that no conditions or combination of conditions, will reasonably ensure the safety of the community,” Raymond said.West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey wrote on social media Tuesday that Wolfe “remains in critical condition but is stable.”“Doctors and the family are optimistic about his current progress and note that he has responded to some basic requests such as a thumbs up sign and wiggling his toes,” Morrisey said.Troops in the districtThe West Virginia National Guard members shot last week are among the 2,000 troops stationed in the district since August, after President Donald Trump declared a “crime emergency.” Republican governors have offered to send their states’ reserves of National Guard members to the nation’s capital. A federal judge last month found the president’s deployment of troops to the district illegal. Lakanwal was granted asylum this year after he came to the United States through a special humanitarian program for Afghanistan allies who served along American forces and had to flee the country after the Taliban took it over following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal in 2021. The shooting that took place on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday has resulted in Trump expanding his immigration crackdown to include a halt to asylum applications, as well as increased scrutiny on visa applications from Afghan nationals. “In the wake of last week's atrocity, it is more important than ever to finish carrying out the president's mass deportation operation,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Monday’s press briefing. “They must go back to their home countries.”Translator appears for LakanwalDuring Tuesday’s arraignment, Lakanwal seemed to thrash around in pain in his hospital bed. A translator also appeared virtually for Lakanwal. Lakanwal’s lawyer raised concerns about U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro, a former Fox News host, holding future press conferences, warning that could harm a “free and fair trial” for Lakanwal. Pirro held a press conference on Thanksgiving morning to discuss the shooting.“The government at their own peril … continue to taint a potential jury pool against Mr. Lakanwal as a result of their press conferences,” he said.Department of Defense press secretary Kingsley Wilson said during a Tuesday briefing at the Pentagon that all National Guard members in the district would be armed. Following last week’s shooting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would request an additional 500 National Guard members be deployed in the district. It’s unclear if that directive would violate a federal judge’s order that found the August deployment unlawful. The federal judge stayed her Nov. 20 order for three weeks to give the administration time to either appeal or remove the troops. The Trump administration filed an emergency appeal after the shooting in the district.Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

The Ames university will seek approval from the Iowa Board of Regents for individual building site plans included in the CyTown development project at a virtual meeting Wednesday.
The project’s overall site plan was already approved by the board in January, along with ownership and lease structures and optional real estate services. ISU has entered into a 30-year management agreement with Goldenrod Companies and Iowa State University Research Park for the development, which is being directed by a management committee made up of board of regents members and leaders from both ISU and the research park.
ISU already approved the site development lease plans, board documents stated, and the committee had input in its creation.

ISU General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer Michael Norton said during the board’s January meeting the project will cost between $175 million and $225 million to complete. According to a presentation published online by the board of regents ahead of its Wednesday meeting, total building costs for the project will come in at more than $139.6 million.
The presentation also stated that $184 million in net revenue will be generated by CyTown for the university over the next 30 years.

Included in the CyTown site development lease plans are overviews, renderings and projected budgets for the majority of the area’s buildings, excluding the already-constructed McFarland Clinic and a hotel still in its design phase. McFarland Clinic is a health care clinic with primary, urgent and specialty care and is the “anchor tenant” for CyTown.
Described in the plan as “the glue that holds all of CyTown together,” Cyclone Alley will run through the center of the development, expanding access to the university bus system and ending in an amphitheater for entertainment. According to renderings in the board document, Cyclone Alley will include an “Alumni Walk” walkway with landscaping and water.
“The signature piece of this building is Cylo, a versatile amphitheater at the north end of the alley, ready to host acts of all sizes,” the plan stated. “A massive digital backdrop enhances the immersive experience for up to 3,500 people on the viewing lawn.”
This portion of the development will cost just under $19.4 million, according to the lease plan.

With the Cylo taking point at the north end of CyTown, the mixed-use buildings on the west end of the development between the amphitheater and McFarland Clinic are both slated to house retail spaces and units for “both short-and-long-term stays,” the lease plan stated.
Both buildings will have entertainment spaces on the second floor — building C will boast views of Jack Trice Stadium and building E will “provide a premium space for those to attend events at Cylo, creating a distinctive setting for gatherings and events within CyTown.”
The project budget for building C, with a building area of more than 83,000 square feet and five levels, totals more than $27.9 million in the lease plan. Building E will also have five levels and include almost 82,500 square footage, and will cost more than $27.6 million.
A “Food & Beverage Anchor Building” will sit across from the McFarland Clinic on the south side of the development, according to the plan. It will house two dining vendors, one for each floor of the building. The total building area is more than 16,800 square feet and will cost more than $5.8 million.

“Its location provides convenient access for stadium visitors, nearby clinic patrons, and those looking to enjoy the lively atmosphere along Cyclone Alley,” the lease plan stated.
The remaining two buildings on the east side of the development, buildings D and F, will be used for retail and office spaces. Building F will also have a terrace on its second level with seating that can be used to view Cylo events. Building F has a total project budget of more than $29.8 million and building E will cost just under $29 million.

Andy Kim sparred with state Sen. James Beach during a hearing in Trenton on Dec. 1, 2025. (Photos by Anne Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Democratic U.S. Sen. Andy Kim spent months fighting New Jersey Democratic Party leaders in 2024 over the county line, with Kim defeating them in court multiple times and then handily winning election to his current seat last year.
Judging by the reception Kim received in committee room six at the Trenton Statehouse annex on Monday, there are still a lot of hurt feelings on the losing side.
Kim was there to testify against a bill to revamp the state comptroller’s office, a measure sponsored by Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D) that has sparked outrage in the state’s progressive circles. Normally, state lawmakers give their fellow elected officials a chance to testify first during committee hearings, but Kim’s fellow Democrats decided to make him wait.
The push to punish an NJ school board member for Facebook posts is foolish

So Kim waited. And waited. And waited. Even when some witnesses who were called to speak before Kim said they would cede their time to him so he could testify and then head to D.C., state Sen. Jim Beach (D-Camden), the chair of the committee hearing the bill, said no.
“Nobody’s special,” Beach said. “I have a list, and we’re going in order.”
Beach even read a seemingly never-ending list of names of people who said they didn’t want to testify before calling Kim’s name.
When it was Kim’s turn to speak, Beach was peevish, cutting Kim off the second Kim spoke beyond the three-minute deadline Beach had earlier implemented, seemingly just for critics of the bill.
“Sir, I have been here for five-and-a-half hours,” Kim told Beach.
“Yeah, so what?” Beach responded. “So has everyone else. Why do you think you’re special? You’re not.”
Listen, I’m all for the Legislature not giving special treatment to dignitaries and forcing them to wait in line with the rest of the hoi polloi when bills are getting heard. But that’s not how it generally goes in Trenton, where even Jim McGreevey, the former governor who resigned two decades ago after getting caught hiring his secret boyfriend to a state job with a six-figure salary, gets to cut in line when he wants to testify on a bill. Surely a sitting senator can get the same treatment as a disgraced former governor.
Scutari’s comments to reporters prior to Monday’s hearing indicate Beach’s decision to keep Kim waiting was a strategy, not an attempt to be fair to the masses. They thought he would eventually bail and return to D.C., which is where Scutari said Kim should have been on Monday.
“I think he should be in Washington overseeing what he’s supposed to be doing there instead of coming here and criticizing a bill that he hadn’t had an opportunity to read yet, and asking me to get up there first and asking me for special treatment in terms of the hearing. I doubt that he remains here,” Scutari said.

Kim told me he had indeed read the bill and that he did not ask for special treatment, saying he arrived at the Statehouse 90 minutes before the hearing started to make sure he could get his name early on the speaker list (I can confirm some of that; I was behind him at security when he entered the building).
As for Beach’s hostility, Kim said he doesn’t know where it came from. He said he’s met Beach maybe once before, and cannot recall a single face-to-face conversation they’ve ever had.
Kim said what stuck out to him about Monday’s hearing was an interaction Beach had during Kim’s testimony with another person in the audience. This was after Beach said Kim had to stop speaking because of Beach’s made-up three-minute rule.
“I yielded my three minutes to Sen. Kim,” the audience member said.
“I don’t care about you,” Beach shot back.
Kim said he’s been thinking about Beach’s response for the last 24 hours.
“That is just such a disgraceful thing to say to a fellow New Jerseyan, to people that we represent. I can never imagine, no matter how much someone would yell at me about Trump or anything else, I just cannot ever imagine the words coming out of my mouth,” he said. “It’s the opposite of what public service and being an elected official’s about.”
Kim is right that Beach’s behavior Monday represents the opposite of what being an elected official is all about. But sadly, it’s too often what being an elected official in Trenton is all about.

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Add Rhode Island to the list of states facing legal action from the Trump administration for refusing to turn over personal voter information.
The U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit, filed in federal court in Rhode Island Tuesday morning, comes amid a nationwide federal probe into state voter rolls under the pretense of preventing election fraud, including noncitizen voting — which is extremely rare. Since May, the Justice Department has reached out to at least 40 states seeking voter lists, including personal information typically protected under state and federal laws, like Social Security and driver’s license numbers.
Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore refused to comply, responding to the DOJ probe in September by offering to provide a free copy of the statewide voter list already publicly available — typically provided upon request with a $25 fee. But Amore made clear he would not hand over confidential personal information without legal action.
More than two-and-a-half months later, the DOJ answered. The 10-page complaint echoes the same arguments made in its lawsuits against eight other states, including Maine and New Hampshire. 
In all of the cases, federal attorneys say the government is entitled to personal voter data under the 1960 Civil Rights Act, the 2002 Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993.
The lawsuit, which names Amore as a defendant, seeks a federal judge’s intervention to force Amore to turn over the voter registration information within five days, while declaring his refusal a violation of the Civil Rights Act.
Amore, a former high school history teacher, maintained the DOJ’s request was unconstitutional in a statement Tuesday. 
“This lawsuit, like those filed in other states, is a continuation of the current presidential administration’s unconstitutional attempts to interfere with elections processes across the country,” Amore said. “One of my most important responsibilities as the chief state election official is safeguarding the data privacy of Rhode Islanders, who entrust us with their personal information when they register to vote. I will continue to fight to protect it.”
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said he will stand with and defend the secretary in court.
“This lawsuit is just the latest example of the weaponization of the Department of Justice to further the Trump Administration’s unlawful whims,” Neonha said in a statement. “I’m not surprised that this Administration is confused about what it means to behave lawfully.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island backed up Amore, calling the federal probe “a major threat to the privacy of Rhode Island voters.” 
“Drivers’ licenses and social security numbers provided as part of the voter registration process are sensitive pieces of information that deserve to be protected and that the Department of Justice has absolutely no legitimate need for,” the ACLU said in a statement Tuesday.
Most state election officials, like Amore, have declined to provide the DOJ with full access to their voter rolls. In Nebraska and South Carolina, voters have filed state lawsuits preventing state election officials from sharing their private information. On the other end of the spectrum, Indiana and Wyoming agreed to hand over driver’s license and Social Security numbers in compliance with the DOJ’s request, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.
Officials in Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio have also agreed to help the Trump administration tap into state driver’s license data under a settlement between the states and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security filed on Friday.
The DOJ claims that state and local election officials have no discretion to limit federal election records or papers. Rhode Island’s rejection of  the voter data request undermines the DOJ’s ability to investigate states under the 1960 Civil Rights Act, the lawsuit claims.
DOJ attorneys also sought to dispel Amore’s concerns over voters’ privacy. The administration’s memo claims that the assistant attorney general who requested the data from Amore’s office made clear that officials would comply with federal privacy laws. Moreover, the DOJ  noted that Amore’s office was instructed to use encrypted email or the DOJ’s secure file-sharing system to provide the voter data.
The DOJ may claim it has the right to privileged voter data, but Common Cause Rhode Island Executive Director John Marion said Tuesday that the 1974 Privacy Act lays out strict guidelines for what exactly states can provide to the federal government. He said Amore’s decision to deny the full voter roll was the right decision.
“He’ll ultimately prevail in this litigation, because the law is on his side,” Marion said.
Marion called the demands by the DOJ a “fishing expedition” by the Trump administration to continue to sow distrust in elections, along with pushing the false claim that the 2020 race was “stolen.”
“Rhode Island shouldn’t be participating in an effort to discredit those election results,” he said. 
The DOJ’s lawsuit has been assigned to Judge Mary S. McElroy, a first-term Trump appointee.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey officials’ three-year effort to investigate a network of Christian antiabortion pregnancy centers accused of using deceptive practices landed before the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday, when justices heard arguments over the narrow jurisdictional question of whether the case belongs in state or federal court.
Since 2023, lawyers for First Choice Women’s Resource Centers have been fighting a subpoena Attorney General Matt Platkin issued for a wide array of the nonprofit’s records and communications, including donors’ names.
In New Jersey, state courts have the power to handle subpoena disputes. But First Choice sued in federal court to block enforcement, saying that the subpoena unconstitutionally chills its free-speech and free-association rights and that federal courts should decide constitutional challenges.
Tuesday, First Choice’s attorney Erin Morrow Hawley urged the justices to protect donor privacy, consider Platkin’s motives, and consider his “coercive” subpoena a violation of the First Amendment. Such a ruling would reverse earlier decisions by a U.S. federal judge and a federal appeals panel that the case should remain in state court, at least until a state judge decides whether First Choice’s noncompliance warrants sanctions.
“The attorney general of New Jersey issued a sweeping subpoena commanding — on pain of contempt — that First Choice produced donor names, addresses, and phone numbers so his office could contact and question them,” said Hawley, adding, “This is the context of a hostile attorney general who has issued a consumer alert, urged New Jerseyans to beware of pregnancy centers, and assembled a strike force against them.”
Hawley is a former law clerk of Chief Justice John Roberts. Vivek Suri, assistant to the Solicitor General in the U.S. Department of Justice, joined Hawley in arguing on First Choice’s behalf, saying people with a constitutional challenge always have standing in federal court.
Sundeep Iyer, Platkin’s chief counsel, warned that restricting constitutional challenges solely to federal judges would clog the courts and represent “a pretty dramatic sea change in historical practice.” Platkin’s office alone has issued more than 500 subpoenas this year to people and companies it’s investigating, while Google got about 50,000 subpoenas last year, Iyer added.
“State and local governments issue tens of thousands of subpoenas every year, but the federal government’s theory would risk turning many of these ordinary subpoena disputes into federal cases,” Iyer said. “Even without a First Amendment claim, that would be a remarkable break from history and tradition. No court has accepted that theory, and this court should not be the first.”

The case made for unusual allies, with groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression siding with the Alliance Defending Freedom, the Christian legal advocacy group where Hawley works. In an August amicus brief, the ACLU and the foundation fretted about “censorship by intimidation” and warned that authorities of all political persuasions increasingly are using their powers, including subpoenas, to squelch disfavored speech as society grows more polarized.
Over 90 minutes of arguments Tuesday, both sides strayed far from the jurisdictional issue and the justices peppered attorneys with a steady stream of questions.
The justices mulled the purpose of Platkin’s request for donor details (to see if donors thought their contributions were going to an abortion-rights group) and whether compliance with subpoenas is mandatory (no, unless a judge orders compliance). The jurists also debated the “degree of chill” that might deter donors and if a letter of request instead of a subpoena would have sparked the same court fight.
They wrangled with whether the mere receipt of a subpoena can cause “imminent injury” or pose a “credible threat,” if courts have not yet sanctioned — and might not ever — a noncompliant recipient. First Choice attorneys argued that they suffered harms in the cost of the legal fight, anticipated losses of charitable contributions from donors who fear public disclosure, and possible regulatory retaliation if they don’t comply with the subpoena. Platkin’s team had called claims of such harms speculative.
Some justices’ opinions seemed clear in their questioning.
Justice Clarence Thomas asked Iyer whether investigators had received any reports of deceptive practices by First Choice, and Iyer conceded they had not.
“You say you have no complaints. But rather you looked at the website and their materials, and you think it could have been misleading,” Thomas said.
Subpoenaing donor information “just seems to be a burdensome way to find out whether someone has a confusing website,” he added.
Tax law requires charitable organizations to identify major donors in tax filings in order to retain their tax-exempt status. That law also is being challenged in federal court in Ohio.
Hawley urged the justices to reject Iyer’s claim that subpoenas are voluntary, negotiable, and not intimidating.
Subpoenas “would terrify normal donors, mom-and-pop donors,” Hawley said. “If you look at the allegations in this case, some donors gave as little as $10. Those folks are going to be worried about a state attorney general, the highest law enforcement officer in the country, demanding their names, phone numbers, addresses, places of employment so that he can contact them about a donor website.”

First Choice has five centers in Jersey City, Montclair, Morristown, Newark, and New Brunswick.
A decision is expected by the summer.

(Screenshot: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)As North Carolina shoppers make their holiday purchases online, more and more of them are opting to click a relatively new button allowing them to “buy now, pay later.”
That option may look like a good way to stretch a tight budget during the holidays. But North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson warned Monday that using “buy now, pay later,” or BNPL, services could place shoppers at risk of incurring massive debt.  Jackson and six other attorneys general sent letters to leading BNPL lenders this week to determine whether they are abiding by consumer protection laws.
“Buy-Now-Pay-Later loans may seem simple and safe, but they can lead to surprise fees and growing debt,” Jackson said in a statement. “Laws exist to protect North Carolinians from predatory lenders, and we are going to make sure these lenders are following the law.”
The programs work by allowing shoppers to break up purchases into smaller payments, typically on a monthly basis, through automated bank withdrawals. While many consumers use them to make expensive purchases more manageable, the offerings have exploded in recent years, with even food delivery services offering customers the option to pay on a monthly basis.
If customers fall behind on payments, some companies charge late fees, which can quickly accumulate into larger debts. Automatic withdrawals that bounce can also trigger bank overdraft fees and reports to credit institutions, making it harder for consumers to qualify for loans in the future.
The letters, sent to financial companies Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, Sezzle, and Zip, include a battery of questions around how each addresses payment disputes, late repayments, eligibility determination, and credit reporting among other loan terms.
“We are concerned that BNPL companies might not be providing their customers with appropriate protections when they return their purchase, never receive what they ordered, or experience other billing errors,” the attorneys general wrote. “We are also concerned that BNPL providers may not adequately assess borrowers’ capacity to repay their loans.”
The use of BNPL programs rose sharply during the pandemic as an alternative to credit cards. According to a 2024 Federal Reserve report, 15% of adult survey respondents said they had used such a service in the last 12 months, up from 10% in 2021. Of those, roughly a quarter said they paid late, up from 15% in 2021.
More than half said they shopped with BNPL because they could not afford their purchases otherwise. Among respondents making under $50,000 a year, that percentage spiked to 72%. And while services vary over whether they charge late fees, a majority of respondents reported they were charged extra for missing payment dates.
Miranda Margowsky, a spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association, which represents Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, and Zip among other financial technology companies, said their consumer data shows that responsible use of the services, including “repaying in full and on time,” is the norm.
“BNPL is a valued payment method that allows people to split the cost of a purchase into four installments with no interest, no revolving debt, and no hidden fees,” Margowsky said. “These products are safe, regulated, and consumer-friendly, with a business model centered on consumer success, not fees.”
Klarna spokesperson Clare Nordstrom said the company “has built strong safeguards” into its program, including eligibility assessments and service pauses after missed payments. Those protections, she said, have helped ensure a more than 99% repayment rate.
Affirm spokesperson Brian Levin noted that the company does not charge late fees and that they are eager to engage with lawmakers on regulatory concerns. “Our success is aligned with consumers and responsibly extending access to credit. We underwrite every transaction individually and we provide consistent and transparent disclosures at checkout.”
According to North Carolina Department of Justice spokesperson Nazneen Ahmed, their office has received dozens of complaints against BNPL lenders, including 53 against Affirm and nine against Klarna. NCDOJ has also received 454 complaints against PayPal, but most relate to other services offered by the financial technology company.
The inquiry is the latest in a series of legal efforts by Jackson’s office to protect consumers in the ever-growing online commerce sector. Last month, he joined a letter to e-commerce platform Shopify over cutting ties with unlawful tobacco storefronts.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Klarna-Pay-Later-Option.png,,,2025-12-02 16:57:18.978017

Patric J. Ferguson, 34, pleaded guilty in August to civil rights, firearms, kidnapping and obstruction charges connected with the fatal shooting of 30-year-old Robert Howard.
“This defendant committed a premeditated murder while using his position as a police officer, not to protect the Memphis community, but to perpetuate this horrendous crime and shield himself from suspicion and liability,” Assistant Attorney General Harriet K. Dhillon of the U.S Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division stated in a Monday news release.
“While no prison sentence can undo the defendant’s heartless crimes, today’s sentence holds the defendant accountable and sends a clear message that no one is above the law,” Dhillon stated.
Ferguson used a police database to search for Howard, who at the time was in a relationship with a woman who previously dated Ferguson, according to Ferguson’s plea documents. He then used his department-issued patrol car to kidnap Howard from the woman’s home on January 5, 2021, according to Ferguson’s plea documents.
Ferguson then drove to a nearby parking lot and fatally shot Howard. Later, Ferguson conspired with Joshua M. Rogers, a childhood friend, to dispose of Howard’s body in the Wolf River in Memphis, court records state. Rogers and Ferguson then sold the vehicle they used to transport the body to a scrap metal company in Mississippi.
The FBI’s Nashville Field Office and the Memphis Police Department investigated the case. 
The department arrested Ferguson in January 2021 and immediately released him from duty, according to a statement posted on Jan. 10, 2021 on the department’s social media. Ferguson had been employed by MPD since October 2018. 
Rogers pleaded guilty in May to obstruction charges and is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 17.
Ferguson pleaded guilty to deprivation of rights under the color of law; kidnapping; use and discharge of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence causing death, conspiracy to tamper with a witness, victim or informant; and obstruction of justice, according to judgment documents.

Darin Seeley, commissioner of the Bureau of Human Resources and Administration, told lawmakers Tuesday on the Joint Appropriations Committee that the fixes are the first phase of a three-phase restoration effort.
Capitol restoration looms as a major expense for South Dakota

The money for the current work came from a $3 million pool of funds approved by legislators earlier this year.
Once the plaster repairs are complete in the hallways and the galleries of the Senate and House of Representatives, second phase work can begin with repairs to the Rotunda. That work is set to begin after the 2026 session’s March conclusion, and is expected to be complete by November.
The third phase won’t repair a thing, at least not right away. Seeley told the committee that his agency plans to spend about $780,000 to hire a consultant for a comprehensive needs analysis meant to identify issues across the whole of the Capitol complex.
The building’s communications infrastructure needs an upgrade, Seeley said, as part of a “multi-year, multi-phase restoration of this building.”
“There is a lot of work that needs to be done for two reasons,” Seeley said. “One, to make the Capitol as beautiful as it can be, but more importantly, to bring it up to modern standards in relationship to electrical codes, plumbing and then usability of the space.” 
When a committee of legislators asked Seeley in August to guess what a full Capitol restoration might cost, he said “we’re talking probably between $150 million and $200 million.” The building hasn’t undergone a full restoration in about four decades.

The bonuses are intended to reward the employees for outperforming revenue benchmarks for four of the state’s investment funds.
The State Investment Board originally planned to approve the funding in a November meeting, but delayed taking action after a board member asked whether the board had the legal authority to do so.
While a state law adopted in 2023 permits staff who oversee state investments to receive the performance-based pay, it doesn’t specifically say the Retirement and Investment Office has authorization to provide the bonuses. 
“They have the authority for the program, but no specific budgetary authority to make those payments,” Office of Management and Budget Director Joe Morrissette, who sits on the State Investment Board, said at a Tuesday Emergency Commission meeting.
The Attorney General’s Office verbally advised the Retirement and Investment Office that the agency could safely move forward with approving the bonus pay, Retirement and Investment Office Executive Director Jodi Smith said.
The matter was brought to the Emergency Commission on Tuesday out of an abundance of caution, Smith said. The Emergency Commission, which consists of the governor, legislative leaders and the secretary of state, addresses funding issues that come up between legislative sessions.
Smith rescinded the request after the Emergency Commission ultimately decided that it did not need to take action.
Some commission members signaled interest in amending the statute at a later date to make the agency’s appropriation authority more explicit.
“I think it was written in a way that there was not clarity,” said Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the Emergency Commission as well as the State Investment Board.
The State Investment Board will vote on the bonuses at its next meeting, which is scheduled for January, according to Sarah Mudder, communication and outreach director for the Retirement and Investment Office.
North Dakota investment board delays action on $1.3 million in employee bonuses

The Retirement and Investment Office invests state money on behalf of the State Investment Board, some of which is managed by in-house investors. The top four funds are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance.
The agency introduced the bonuses to encourage investment managers and other staff at the Retirement and Investment Office to bring in more money for the state, as well as to improve retention and recruitment. It was added at the same time North Dakota began an initiative to manage more of its investment money in-house.
If approved, this would be the first time the bonuses are awarded. The bonuses are funded by earnings on the agency’s investments. Seven of the bonuses awaiting approval are more than $100,000, with the largest more than $293,000. 
For employees to get the bonuses this year, the State Investment Board’s top four funds had to exceed certain earnings benchmarks between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025, Smith said previously.
The benchmarks are meant to represent standard market performance, she said. The funds outperformed the benchmarks by more than $191 million.
“$191 million more than the benchmark — that’s a big deal,” House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said during Tuesday’s meeting. “That deserves a pat on the back.” 
Armstrong previously expressed reservations about the bonus pay program, which was adopted before he became governor. He said at November’s State Investment Board meeting that he was under the impression the bonuses would be more difficult to obtain. 
He reaffirmed those concerns on Tuesday, and said while he doesn’t want to take away pay that was promised to investment staff, the State Investment Board would likely revisit the policy in the future. He said he wasn’t convinced the bonuses would help North Dakota attract employees.
“They don’t care about what their potential bonus is,” Armstrong said. “They care about what the base pay is.”

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Sen. Tom Willis, a freshman Republican member from Berkeley County, will lead the Senate Judiciary Committee. It’s one of the state Senate’s most powerful committees, where changes to state law are often vetted.
Willis is also running for the U.S. Senate, vying to replace current Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. 
“I am humbled and honored that the Senate President asked me to serve in this leadership role for our great state,” said Willis, R-Berkeley. “As Judiciary chair, I will continue my public service to the wonderful people of West Virginia, a journey I started 25 years ago when I joined the West Virginia National Guard in 2000.”
The Judiciary Chair position was empty after Mike Stuart left the Senate earlier this year to serve as legal counsel in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump. 
Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston
Senate President Randy Smith announced on Tuesday that Willis will lead the Judiciary Committee, effective immediately. 
“His extensive knowledge and background made him a natural fit,” Smith, R-Preston, said in a statement. “I am honored that he was willing to step up and take on this challenge, and I am confident he’s dedicated to making the lives of West Virginians and their families better.”
Willis, who is from Hedgesville and describes himself as a “Christian Constitutional Conservative,” previously served as the Vice Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
“Judiciary is one of our busiest and most important committees, and I knew that I needed a strong, reliable leader to fill that role,” Smith said. 
Willis — an attorney and businessman — was elected in November 2024 to represent the fifth district, which includes portions of Berkeley, Morgan and Hampshire counties. Ahead of his election, Willis, in the May primary election, unseated longtime Democrat Senate President Craig Blair. Blair had held the seat for 12 years.
Willis has served as a Special Forces Green Beret with the West Virginia National Guard. 
He ran for U.S. Senate in 2018, coming in fourth in the Republican primary.

In July, he kicked off a campaign again for U.S. Senate.
“While I am a declared candidate for U.S. Senate in 2026 because it is time for a change, rest assured I will give 110% to my work as Judiciary Chair as we work together in the Legislature to improve economic prosperity for all West Virginians, improve education outcomes and protect our personal liberties,” Willis said. 
Capito is expected to run for reelection next year in an attempt to secure her third six-year term.

Sodecia and Aapico — a pair of family-owned automotive industry manufacturers — will jointly run a new 400,000-square-foot facility to build vehicle frames for use in electric SUVs and trucks assembled at the Scout campus nearly 60 miles to the north.
“This announcement is also the latest example of Scout Motors’ arrival driving additional investment and job creation across our state, bringing even more opportunities and prosperity for our people,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement.
“South Carolina’s strong reputation as an automotive powerhouse continues attracting investments from global companies,” Commerce Secretary Harry Lightsey added.
Portugal-headquartered Sodecia specializes in manufacturing structural parts for vehicles and powertrain systems. It has more than 40 locations across Europe, North and South America, and Asia.
Thailand-based Aapico has spent the last three decades making various plastic and metal car parts.
To bring the partners to South Carolina, the state approved Sodecia and Aapico for corporate income tax breaks worth $25,000 for each job created.
Orangeburg County Council Chairman Johnnie Wright said those jobs mean “real opportunity for the people who live and work here.”
The council approved the operation for a reduced property tax rate. The county did not provide any details publicly about the incentives it offered.

Free.,Trump administration threatens to yank food stamps funding from Democratic-led states,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-threatens-yank-food-stamps-funding-democratic-led-states,,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture will begin next week to block nutrition assistance funding for states led by Democrats that have not provided data on fraud in the program, Secretary Brooke Rollins told President Donald Trump at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.USDA sought data from states earlier this year related to their administration of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, Rollins said Tuesday. She added the data was needed to address fraud that she called “rampant” in the program that helps 42 million people afford groceries.Most states complied with the request, but 21, mostly run by Democrats, refused, she said. A USDA spokesperson later implied the department was missing data from 22 states.“As of next week, we have begun and will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states until they comply, and they tell us and allow us to partner with them to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer,” Rollins said.A USDA spokesperson in an email listed 28 states, plus one territory, from which they said the department has received data.That would leave the following 22 states, all led by Democratic governors, that have not provided data: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin. The spokesperson provided some additional details of the initiative, including that the department was targeting administrative funds, and that the next step would be a formal warning.Blue states sought to protect bad actors, including criminals and immigrants in the country without legal status, “over the American taxpayer,” the statement said.“We have sent Democrat States yet another request for data, and if they fail to comply, they will be provided with formal warning that USDA will pull their administrative funds,” the spokesperson said.Court records show the department sent the states a new request for data on Nov. 28, and asked for a response within seven days, which would be Friday. The letter was reproduced as part of a suit the 22 states have brought against the administration over the request for SNAP recipients’ data.Leading Dem calls threat illegalIt’s unclear what authority Rollins would have to block funding, which Congress has appropriated.The federal government pays for all benefits for SNAP, which was formerly known as food stamps. It splits the administrative costs with states.The USDA spokesperson did not answer a direct question about the legal authority for withholding funds.Democrats on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee said any effort to block SNAP funding would be illegal.“Yet again, Trump and Rollins are illegally threatening to withhold federal dollars,” a social media post from an official account of committee Democrats read. “SNAP has one of the lowest fraud rates of any government program, but Trump continues to weaponize hunger.”The committee’s lead Democrat, Angie Craig of Minnesota, issued her own statement that also accused the administration of “weaponizing hunger” and said Rollins “continues to spew propaganda.”“Her disregard for the law and willingness to lie through her teeth comes from the very top – the Trump administration is as corrupt as it is lawless, and I will not sit silently as she carries out the president’s campaign against Americans struggling to afford food in part because of this president’s tariffs and disastrous economic policies.”  SNAP fraudThe data USDA has sought from states includes verification of SNAP recipients’ eligibility, along with a host of personal information such as Social Security numbers.An early USDA review of data provided by the 28 states and Guam “indicates an estimated average of $24 million dollars per day of federal funds is lost to fraud and errors undetected by States in their administration of SNAP,” the department said in the Nov. 28 letter.Preventing those losses could save up to $9 billion per year, the letter added.But the types of fraud cited in some of the public statements from Rollins and the department are rare, existing data show.A 2023 USDA report showed about 26,000 applications, roughly 0.1% of the households enrolled in SNAP, were referred for an administrative or criminal review.People in the country illegally have never been authorized to receive SNAP benefits.“The long-standing data sources indicate that intentional fraud by participants is rare,” Katie Bergh, a senior food assistance policy analyst for the left-leaning think tank Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a November interview.Trump administration targetSNAP has been a consistent target for cuts during Trump’s second presidency.The issue was a focal point during the six-week government shutdown, during which the administration reversed itself often but generally resisted calls — from states, advocates, lawmakers and federal judges — to fund food assistance.Shortly after the government reopened, Rollins in television interviews said she would force all recipients to reapply for benefits, a proposal seen as logistically challenging by program experts.And the Republican taxes and spending law passed by Congress and signed by Trump earlier this year included new work requirements and other restrictions on SNAP eligibility that advocates say will lead to major drops in benefits. The law will also make states pay for some share of benefits and increase the share of administrative costs that states are responsible for, potentially leading some states to cut benefits.",,,,2025-12-02 16:57:18.978017

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The New York Times reported Tuesday morning that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is launching an “intensive immigration enforcement operation primarily targeting hundreds of undocumented Somali immigrants in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region.”
The report cites an anonymous Trump administration official and documents obtained by the Times. 
The plan calls for the deployment of “strike teams” comprising ICE officers and other federal officials. The anonymous official told the Times that roughly 100 officers and agents from around the country have been brought into the operation. 
Local elected officials tried to project resolve and support. 
“I know many families are fearful tonight, but I want you to know that the city and I stand behind you,” said Minneapolis Council Member Jamal Osman, who represents the largest East African community in the city, during a press conference Tuesday. 
The news comes after an increase in anti-Somali rhetoric among right-wing leaders, including President Donald Trump, following the publication of an article claiming — with little evidence — that Somali-American immigrants accused of defrauding Minnesota’s public programs are providing the money to the terrorist group al-Shaabab. 
Federal officials have investigated fraud in Minnesota’s public programs for years, and of the dozens of people charged so far, the majority are Somali-American. Terrorism financing has not been among the fraud-related charges.
“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country,” Trump said during Tuesday’s cabinet meeting.
Data on the immigration statuses of the roughly 90,000 Somali-Americans in Minnesota is not readily available, but the vast majority of Somali people in Minnesota have legal status, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Tuesday. Roughly half of Somali-Americans in Minnesota were born in Somalia, according to 2024 Census data.
Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter stood together at Tuesday’s press conference, decrying the president’s comments.

“Mistakes will be made — and let’s be clear — it means that American citizens will be detained for no other reason than the fact that they look like they are Somali,” Frey said. 
Protestors have squared off with federal officers — and sometimes local police — at raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul this year. Law enforcement officers have used crowd dispersal tactics like pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets and sound cannons. 
Both Minneapolis and St. Paul are sanctuary cities, meaning their local police do not question residents’ immigration status or enforce immigration law, which is a federal responsibility. But both police departments have helped immigration authorities control the large crowds of protesters that have convened outside of raids. 
Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Tuesday his officers will protect demonstrators’ First Amendment rights, and that the department is rewriting its immigration enforcement policy based on feedback from community organizations. 
“I also ask that if demonstrations do happen around any type of immigration raid, that they remain nonviolent — so that we can keep everyone in our community safe, so that we minimize the risk of any tragedy happening, or the immigrant communities that are already suffering to suffer that much more,” O’Hara said.
On Nov. 21, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was “terminating” Temporary Protected Status for Somali people in Minnesota. TPS protects citizens of certain countries — those that are deemed too dangerous or unstable — from deportation. Around 700 Somali citizens in the U.S. are protected by TPS. 
On Wednesday, the president directed immigration authorities to reexamine the green cards — granted to people with legal permanent residency — of people from “countries of concern,” including Somalia.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MG_8231-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 16:57:18.978017

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)
Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation said in a letter Tuesday that the United States Agriculture Department must issue a “full and immediate” reimbursement to the state of New Mexico for $30 million it spent in November to pay for food assistance.
In mid-October during the federal government shutdown, the USDA informed states it would not provide SNAP funding to roughly 42 million Americans who rely on it, including about 460,000 New Mexicans. 
Later that month, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and legislative Democratic leaders announced they would use state funds to pay $30 million to cover 10 days’ worth of SNAP. The money came from the state’s Appropriation Contingency Fund, which the governor can draw from unilaterally to pay for emergencies. 
On Tuesday afternoon, all five members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation wrote to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought saying that the federal government should pay New Mexico back.
NM SNAP benefits for November threatened due to shutdown, HCA secretary says

“New Mexico’s governor did what the administration would not: She kept children, seniors, and people with disabilities fed,” the delegation, all Democrats, wrote. “No state should have to raid their own budgets to fix a problem the administration created.”
The letter cites the funding bill that reopened the government. It authorizes federal agencies to reimburse states that used their own funds to cover programs “that would have been paid” during the shutdown, according to the letter. 
“The directive is unambiguous: USDA and OMB are required to repay states in full,” the delegation wrote. “We therefore expect USDA and OMB to move quickly to restore New Mexico’s funds and execute the reimbursement without delay. The federal government has a duty to make New Mexico whole, and we insist that responsibility be met immediately.”
New Mexico Legislature passes, acting governor signs $162.5M to cover SNAP payments if needed

The USDA, in guidance to states in late October, said it would not pay states back for any funding they use to pay for SNAP benefits, saying, “There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed.” 
A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez told Source New Mexico in an email on Tuesday that the memo was taken as indication that states would not be reimbursed. And Vasquez, in a statement, said the administration has “acted recklessly and in bad faith with states like New Mexico.”
“Now that the federal government’s lights are back on, we’re asking the administration to do the right thing by New Mexico taxpayers and give the state back the money that it is rightfully owed,” Vasquez told Source. 
In addition to the $30 million the state paid for partial November benefits, the Legislature convened Nov. 11 to approve an additional $162.5 million in SNAP funding meant to last recipients until mid-January, when the Legislature will convene for its regular legislative session. That money ended up being unnecessary when the government reopened and SNAP funds resumed flowing.
“No state should be forced to backfill federal programs,” the delegation wrote. “New Mexico acted responsibly under extraordinary circumstances, and it must not bear the long-term financial burden for failures at the federal level.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Snap-booth-at-Growers-Market-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 16:57:18.978017

Officers find “warfare” notes, body armor, and an illegal conversion device after a late-night park encounter
WILMINGTON, Del. — A routine late-night patrol check in a Wilmington park may have stopped a planned attack on the University of Delaware Police Department, after officers arrested a 25-year-old man found with a converted handgun, body armor, and a notebook outlining assault tactics and a police station diagram, authorities said Tuesday.
New Castle County police said B-Squad patrol officers were checking Canby Park West around 11:47 p.m. Nov. 24 when they spotted a white Toyota Tacoma parked in the park after hours. When officers initiated a traffic stop, they contacted the driver and sole occupant, identified as Luqmaan Khan, 25, of Wilmington.
Officers developed probable cause to order Khan out of the vehicle, but he refused and resisted arrest before being taken into custody, police said. A search of the truck uncovered a loaded .357 Glock handgun inserted into a micro conversion kit, four loaded 27-round extended magazines, a ballistic hard plate used as body armor, binoculars, a laptop and a composition notebook.
The vehicle was towed to New Castle County Police Headquarters, where detectives obtained a search warrant. Inside the notebook, investigators later found handwritten notes on “warfare” techniques, premeditated assault plans and a diagram labeled as the University of Delaware Police Department, including a reference to a UD police officer by name, according to a federal criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware.
The next day, Nov. 25, county detectives and FBI agents searched Khan’s Wilmington residence. There, authorities recovered a Glock 19 handgun equipped with an illegal machinegun conversion device, commonly called a “switch,” a .556 rifle with a scope and red-dot sight, 11 additional extended magazines, hollow-point ammunition, and a tactical vest with ballistic plates, federal prosecutors said. Department of Justice
New Castle County police initially charged Khan with felony possession of a large-capacity magazine, felony carrying a concealed deadly weapon, misdemeanor resisting arrest and several traffic and ordinance violations, including failure to have insurance in possession, expired tags and being in a county park after dark. His bail was set at $107,200 cash, and he was committed to jail before being turned over to the FBI for additional federal charges according to New Castle County Police.
The federal complaint charges Khan with illegal possession of a machine gun, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison if convicted. A federal judge will determine any sentence under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Khan is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in court/
Acting U.S. Attorney Julianne Murray called the case a clear example of state and federal agencies working together to “neutralize a grave threat” before anyone was harmed, praising patrol officers and federal agents for moving quickly once the threat became clear.
FBI Baltimore Special Agent in Charge Jimmy Paul similarly credited the patrol officers for their initial actions, saying the Wilmington Resident Agency remains focused on disrupting individuals “who seek to commit acts of violence,” including against law enforcement. New Castle County Police Col. James Leonard said the officers’ proactive work prevented a potential tragedy and underscored the value of visible patrols and firm enforcement of existing laws.
The University of Delaware was notified of the findings, and the FBI’s Wilmington office is continuing the investigation. Officials did not announce any specific changes to campus security but said law enforcement will remain vigilant.
For many residents and law-and-order advocates, the incident is likely to reinforce calls for strong support of front-line policing, tough scrutiny of illegal firearms and full prosecution of those who target law enforcement — while also highlighting that, in this case, basic patrol work and existing gun laws were enough to take a heavily armed suspect off the street before a plan on paper could turn into an attack.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Threat-to-UD-Police.png,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

(Photo provided by University of Kentucky)The University of Kentucky Board of Trustees has accepted the largest donation in school history — $150 million from The Bill Gatton Foundation — to create a new arts district on campus.
However, some approval is still needed from the state legislature to move the project forward. 
The funds accepted Tuesday will support a new arts district on the western edge of the Lexington campus. It will include a new College of Fine Arts building along South Broadway, near the Gray Design Building, as well as a performance theater for dance, music and theater with several hundred seats. A pavilion and connecting park will link South Broadway and Bolivar Street near the university’s School of Art and Visual Studies (SA/VS) Building. 
“This gift will realize a vision to create an arts district on the western edge of our campus,” UK President Eli Capilouto said in a press release. “There, we can integrate art into an area of Lexington that is an increasingly vibrant and vital intersection of campus and city, town and gown.”
Gatton, who died in 2022, was an alumnus of UK. His previous gifts to the university total more than $200 million and have supported programs such as the Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food and Environment; the Gatton College of Business and Economics, and the Gatton Student Center. 
Capilouto said in the press release that construction for the new arts district would require authorization from the Kentucky General Assembly to issue bonds. Discussions with legislative leaders are underway. The state legislature returns to Frankfort in January to convene for the 2026 session. 
Some Kentucky elected officials praised the donation in the university’s press release. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said the gift “will help not only the university but also Lexington and Kentucky, as it creates a vibrant, welcoming arts district for students, Kentuckians and visitors to enjoy.”
“Education and the arts fuel our economy and our workforce, and investments like these are how we keep working to build a bright future for generations,” Beshear said. 
Republicans Senate President Robert Stivers, of Manchester, and House Speaker David Osborne, of Prospect, applauded the donation. 
“I’m anxious to authorize bonds so that construction can begin quickly,” Stivers said. “This expansion may be the impetus for more students pursuing a fine arts degree and perhaps working in the film industry, a growing industry made possible by Senate Bill 1 of the 2025 session.”
Osborne said Gatton’s “extraordinary generosity has transformed lives across Kentucky, and today’s historic gift continues that legacy.”
“His vision for education, community and the arts reflects the very best of our Commonwealth’s values,” Osborne said. “It celebrates our incredible heritage and makes way for an even more promising future. This arts district will not only enrich the University of Kentucky, but will also strengthen Lexington and our entire state.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Proposed-Preliminary-Rendering-by-SASKI-RATIO_1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

The funding comes from the Long Island Sound Futures Fund, a partnership between the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other state and federal agencies. Grants from the fund are awarded annually, and come from a mixture of public and private sources.
Long Island Sound is the second largest estuary on the East Coast, stretching over nearly 1,200 square miles between New York and Connecticut. Its watershed, including the Connecticut River, also covers parts of three other states: Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont.
Recipients in Connecticut were awarded a dozen grants totaling $3.6 million from the Futures Fund. Combined with matching funds and other grants shared with other states, the total amount of those projects rose to $7 million.
“Joining together to invest in a stronger, healthier Long Island Sound is essential, both for the region’s environmental quality and to enhance quality of life for the millions of people who live, work and play on and near the Sound,” said Emma Cimino, the deputy commissioner for environmental quality at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
The announcement of this year’s awards also comes as the EPA has sought to slash both staff and funding for its efforts across the U.S., while also rolling back regulations designed to reduce air and water pollution.
In June, the EPA closed its Long Island Sound Office in Stamford and moved the remaining employees to the agency’s regional offices in New York City. No staffers were terminated as a result of the move, a spokesperson said at the time, but at least one employee accepted a deferred resignation offer from the Trump administration.
The EPA did not respond to questions Tuesday about how the closure of the Stamford office had impacted the Futures Fund or the agency’s other efforts on the Sound. 
Bill Lucey, of the nonprofit group Save the Sound, said the move has given advocates less face to face interaction with officials at the EPA but has not otherwise impacted the work of the agency’s Long Island Sound program.
Overall funding for the EPA program has grown to $40 million in the most recent fiscal year, up from just $1 million a decade ago.
“It was underfunded for several years, but as soon as that funding was increased, a lot more people got involved in future projects, and a lot of great work is being done all up and down the coastline, on the marshes and shorelines and in the rivers,” Lucey said.
Among the recipients of the Futures Fund grants is the Maritime Aquarium in Norwalk, which was awarded $537,300 to fund an ongoing effort to remove lost and abandoned lobster traps from the floor of the Sound. The total cost of that project, including matching funds, was $809,900.
Three organizations — including the Norwalk River Watershed Association, Save the Sound and American Rivers — were awarded a total of nearly $1.4 million to develop and obtain permits for the restoration of fish passages along the Norwalk, Quinnipiac, Fourmile and Branford rivers. The total cost of those projects was over $2.6 million.
Several other grants awarded to Connecticut organizations. The total project costs are included in parenthesis.

$180,000 to the Aspetuck Land Trust to supply coastal buffers in Bridgeport (279,300)
$513,200 to the Eastern Connecticut Conservation District for to build a composting facility in Woodstock ($770,200)

(Photo courtesy of Washington State School for the Blind)When the longtime superintendent of the Washington State School for the Blind resigned this summer, he blamed harassment from a former employee.
An investigative report, obtained via public records request, concluded Scott McCallum himself sexually harassed a female colleague during his final years on the job.
The investigation, completed in mid-May, found McCallum hugged a female coworker and softly said in her ear twice that “you look good.” She reported feeling sick and losing sleep after the 2024 incident.
McCallum confirmed to investigators that he’d hugged the woman, saying he hardly recognized her because she’d lost weight. He said his comment about her looks was not sexual.
In an earlier incident, McCallum was accused of showing a woman a picture of his buttocks while flipping through his phone’s camera roll during a school award ceremony. McCallum said it was unintentional, calling the moment embarrassing. He said the photo was taken to show sores from his new rowing machine. It wasn’t clear from the report if this was the same woman from the hugging incident.

McCallum, who’d led the school since 2016, was also accused of running the school as a “dictatorship,” but the inquiry didn’t back that up. 
He couldn’t be reached for comment.
In his Aug. 1 resignation letter to Gov. Bob Ferguson, McCallum described “continuous harassment from a former employee that has created significant disruption across the agency.”
“I remain hopeful that such disruption and threats may cease once I depart my role as superintendent,” he wrote. He added that he believed it was the right time for a shift in leadership at the school and said he would seek new professional opportunities.
Ferguson reappointed McCallum to the position in January. 
McCallum has a national reputation in the education of students who are blind or visually impaired. He helped implement the country’s first online adaptive state assessment that is accessible to students who read Braille.
In 2022, the National Federation of the Blind awarded him the Distinguished Educator of Blind Students award.
Ferguson’s office declined to comment on McCallum’s departure. The governor appointed Pam Parker, the school’s outreach director, to serve as interim superintendent for the 2025-26 school year.
The school serves blind, visually-impaired and deaf-blind students. Fifty students were enrolled this past school year, according to state data. It has about 100 full-time equivalent employees and a state budget of around $29 million.
Before being recruited to come to Washington, McCallum worked in education in Oregon, including when the state closed its own school for blind students. He led Oregon’s implementation of increased state funding for support services for blind children that replaced the school, he said when accepting the award in 2022.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wa-school-of-the-blind-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

(Alabama Department of Archives and History)Ann Bedsole, the first woman elected to the Alabama Senate and the first Republican woman elected to the Alabama House of Representatives, has died. She was 95 years old.
The Alabama Republican Party announced Bedsole’s death Tuesday. A cause of death was not immediately available.
“Ann Bedsole opened doors that had never been opened for women in Alabama politics,” Joan Reynolds, the vice chairwoman of the Alabama Republican Party, said in a statement. “She broke barriers with grace, courage, and conviction, and she did it at a time when few women were ever given the opportunity.”

Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said in a statement Tuesday that Bedsole was “a woman of many firsts.”
“All who served with her say she was a larger than life personality who made the Legislature better with her simple presence,” the statement said. “Sen. Bedsole packed many adventures into her 95 years, and I join countless Republicans across the state in keeping her family in our prayers.”
A list of survivors was not immediately available Tuesday.
Bedsole served for 16 years in the Alabama Legislature, including one term in the House and three in the Senate. A cattle farmer and timberland owner, she had been active in Republican Party politics in Mobile and broader civic activities, particularly historic preservation.  That work, Bedsole said, helped her understand the importance of politics.
“When you work real hard to get something accomplished that’s right for the community, you always come back to the fact it happens in Montgomery or Washington,” he said.
Bedsole ran for the Alabama House of Representatives in 1978 as a Republican in a district in west Mobile County, after the previous occupant, Sonny Callahan – later a congressman –- ran for a Senate seat. Bedsole told The Birmingham News in 1992 that she waited for her eldest child to enter senior year of high school before running.
“It’s a hard job, and very time-consuming,” she said. “So it makes it extremely difficult for someone trying to do a good job of raising children to serve in the Legislature. It doesn’t seem to bother men, but men aren’t the care-givers, and that’s one of the differences.”
After winning election, Bedsole was one of only three women — and one of only four Republicans — serving in the House. She later said that the women “had a hard time being taken seriously.”
“We weren’t mistreated or anything like that,” she said. “The House leadership gave us the opportunity to be effective and do a good job. But they looked with a jaundiced eye for a year to see if the women could handle it.”
The representative served on the education budget committee during her time in the House. When Callahan left his Senate seat in 1982, Bedsole won election to the chamber, where she served from 1983 to 1994.
During her time, Bedsole sponsored legislation that established the Alabama School of Mathematics and Science in Mobile in 1989. Bedsole, who enjoyed backing from business interests, voted to limit damage awards from liability lawsuits and voted against an education reform package in 1992 amid concerns its tax burdens would fall hardest on middle-class households. She also supported teacher tenure laws.
The senator also broadly supported abortion rights, though she approved parental consent laws. Bedsole also campaigned for years to ban PAC-to-PAC transfers, a way of concealing the identity of donors to a campaign. The Legislature did not ban the practice until 2010.
Bedsole often lamented the absence of women in the 140-member Alabama Legislature. “Women’s views are not heard in the Legislature when there are only eight women in the whole thing,” she told the Birmingham News in 1992.
Bedsole ran for governor in 1994. During the campaign, she called for a repeal of the grocery tax, a constitutional convention, judicial reform and stronger ethics laws. Bedsole had hoped that business support would help her in her campaign against former Gov. Fob James — who entered the Republican primary hours before qualifying — but many cast their ballots in what became a fierce battle for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor between former Attorney General Don Siegelman and Sen. Ryan deGraffenreid.
James won the nomination and narrowly defeated Gov. Jim Folsom Jr., a Democrat, in the general election that year.
“I guess it proves you can’t do it in Alabama without help from special interests,” Bedsole said after the loss.
After losing the election, Bedsole focused on business and philanthropy, and mounted an unsuccessful campaign for mayor of Mobile in 2005.
Outside the Legislature, Bedsole was an active gardener and scuba diver.
“The water’s cold when you first go in and I think ‘Ahh, I don’t think I can do this,’” she told the Birmingham News in 1994. “And then I put the mask on, stick the regulator in my mouth and look down and I cannot wait to get down. It’s just a wonderful, gorgeous new world.”
Asked if she had the same feeling in the Senate, Bedsole said “it’s sort of an opposite feeling, not quite as peaceful.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ann-Bedsole-for-Dec-2-2025-story.png,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

Bob Dole, a Kansas Republican who died in 2021, was among a minority of federal lawmakers who seek to repeal the Electoral College and elect presidents by national popular vote. In this news release archived by the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, Dole uses humor and history to summarize his critique of the Electoral College. (Dole Archives, University of Kansas)TOPEKA — The late U.S. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas supported a constitutional amendment abandoning the Electoral College in the election of U.S. presidents and implementing a process of choosing the nation’s chief executive by national popular vote.
In 1979, Dole was frustrated by the U.S. Senate’s deflection of an amendment that would have shifted the process to direct election of presidents. In his unsuccessful campaign for reform, Dole pointed out the 1976 presidential race could have resulted in an Electoral College victory for Republican Gerald Ford and defeat for Democrat Jimmy Carter with a shift of fewer than 10,000 votes in key states. That would have occurred despite Carter’s overall 1.7 million vote plurality.
“I believe it would have been viewed as a betrayal of the American system of democracy,” said Dole, who was Ford’s vice presidential running mate. “Direct election would prevent this potential nightmare from occurring.”
So far, the outcome feared by Dole occurred five times in U.S. history — three times in the 1800s and twice in the past 25 years.
Despite Dole’s belief the presidential candidate who received the largest number of popular votes should win the presidential election, the Electoral College has persisted. The staying power of the Electoral College was a point of contention during a recent debate at the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas. During a trial-like forum, attorneys delivered opposing arguments on the topic and presented expert witnesses to bolster their cases.
 
Bubba vs. socialists
Ed Duckers, a partner in a California law firm and KU graduate, said repeal of the Electoral College would distort contests for president, and vice president, by abandoning a system that compelled candidates to seek broad appeal across the United States.
Direct election would trigger an avalanche of presidential aspirants anchored to a relatively small number of urban centers harboring millions of votes while sparsely populated states would mostly be ignored, he said.
“It’s going to lead to more polarizing and extreme candidates where the Republicans are about nothing but Texas and Bubba in the South and the Democrats are about nothing but (New York City Mayor-elect) Zohran (Mamdani) and socialists in the Northeast and California,” Duckers said.
He asserted liberals were keen to topple the Electoral College because in 2000 Democrat Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College to Republican George W. Bush. In 2016, the same occurred when Republican Donald Trump lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Both outcomes produced protracted turmoil in the United States.
“Why? Why? Why?” Duckers said. “Well, the why is because their team lost in 2000 and then lost in 2016. That is not a good reason to throw this country into turmoil by changing the way we elect presidents.”
The process of declaring a winner in a U.S. presidential race requires state-by-state popular elections among presidential candidates every four years. The states and the District of Columbia convert those results into electoral votes. There are a total of 538 votes in the Electoral College, and a 270-vote majority secures victory. Each state’s winning candidate can expect to claim all of that state’s electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska.
Pedro Irigonegaray, a Kansas trial attorney for more than 50 years, said the Electoral College should be repealed and replaced by a direct election. He said the Electoral College was flawed when adopted by the Constitutional Convention in 1787. The approach wasn’t the result of farsighted political design or anchored to constitutional theory, he said.
He said it was the product of demands by slave-owning states for more influence in elections by counting slaves as three-fifths of a person when allocating electors in the Electoral College.
“They didn’t want anyone else to vote except white men who were landowners,” Irigonegaray said. “The Electoral College is antiquated. It doesn’t work.”
He said the Electoral College undermined majority rule and depressed voter turnout in states solidly Republican or Democratic as candidates focused on the handful of swing states.
“I trust the American people. I value their intelligence. I value their vote,” Irigonegaray said. “This is not Republicans versus Democrats. This is about the American value for the right to vote.”
 
‘It can be dangerous’
Linsey Moddelmog, a professor of political science at Washburn University in Topeka, said polling indicated a majority of Republicans and Democrats supported abolition of the Electoral College. Repeal of the Electoral College made sense because the system was “not democratic,” she said.
“No other presidential system in the world uses an Electoral College,” she said. “It can be dangerous. Elections need to have clear and authentic and legitimate results.”
Moddelmog said there was risk presidential candidates would call upon supporters to rebel if the Electoral College didn’t go their way. She said the evidence was response to Trump’s reelection loss in 2020, including the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. A mob of Trump supporters broke through security personnel and entered the building in an attempt to prevent a joint session of Congress from counting Electoral College votes to affirm election of Democrat Joe Biden.
During cross-examination by Duckers, Moddelmog said she wasn’t concerned a move to the popular vote would incentivize billionaires to derail the democratic process by intensifying funding to third-party or independent candidates.
“I do believe that there are third-party candidates that would run. What I don’t believe is that they will ruin elections,” she said.
Jeff Jackson, dean of the Washburn University law school, said framers of the U.S. Constitution arrived at the Electoral College by default because all other ideas were rejected. They settled on creation of a deliberative body of people chosen by states to determine the president, he said.
“What they couldn’t foresee was the rise of political parties and they couldn’t foresee the fact that Americans wanted to vote,” he said.
Subsequent reforms opened voting to former slaves as well as women. The United States eliminated poll taxes disadvantaging those not owning land and the voting age was lowered. Federal civil rights laws regarding voting were enforced.
But, Jackson said, that wasn’t sufficient to correct festering wounds of the Electoral College.
“The problem is all of these Band-Aids are still hobbled by the fact that we have the Electoral College, which means as long as the Electoral College exists some people’s votes are always going to count more than others,” Jackson said.
 
Save the Electoral College
Trent England, executive director of Save Our States, an organization originally dedicated to preserving the Electoral College but expanded to lobby on state and federal policy on health care, foreign threats as well as diversity, equity and inclusion. He’s affiliated with the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, which was founded by a chairman of the Heritage Foundation.
He said he launched Save Our States because “there needed to be a principled, historically grounded defense of the Electoral College.”
“The founders really focused on the fact that what matters about an election system is more than just how we feel about it or whether our side is winning. What matters is, over time, how does it shape your politics, right?” he said.
England said a national popular election for president would inevitably be managed by the federal government, which he would oppose because that function should be left to states. Presidential contests would be nothing more than popularity contests that rewarded people for rallying their core constituency rather than securing bipartisan alliances, he said.
“The Electoral College forces candidates who want to win the presidency to build the truly nationwide coalition and to have much more legitimacy,” he said.
He said Trump was able to go 2-1 in presidential campaigns because he was able to win over voters who were unmoved by Republican presidential nominees John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012.
Tara Ross, author of the 2019 book “Why We Need the Electoral College,” said the Electoral College had proven its worth for more than 200 years.
“The Electoral College should be kept. The Electoral College is not partisan. It serves our country,” she said.
During cross-examination of Ross, Irigonegaray asked her about her volunteer work for Save Our States, which he said characterized DEI as a bad idea that advanced policies harmful to the economy, divided the nation and violated laws. Irigonegaray’s question centered on the nation’s long history of placing barriers in front of qualified women and minorities.
“I think we should judge people based on merit,” Cross said. “I’d rather have a color-blind society.”
“What if as a result of bigotry and ignorance, those individuals and minorities have not been provided, historically, the benefits that they deserve?” Irigonegaray said.
Ross: “I think this is kind of racist, to be honest, to say that people cannot achieve things because of the color of the skin.”
“I didn’t say that,” Irigonegaray said. “What I said was, as a consequence of bigotry, ignorance and abuse, many qualified women, Black men, Black women and minorities have been denied the prerequisite merit, talent and intelligence to perform work.”
Ross’ rebuttal: “Are we talking about this because you can’t actually ask me a question about the Electoral College that will stump me?”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dole-electoral-college-3-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

I figured I had the right place when I saw the bumper sticker for David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who nearly became Louisiana’s governor. I knew I had the right place when I saw a Confederate battle flag flapping in the breeze outside a white wooden-frame house.
As I stepped down the gravel driveway, a wiry 5-foot-8 man hailed me. I shook the hand of the 69-year-old, surprised by his steady grip. As I let go, I realized it was the same hand that squeezed the trigger of the .30-06 rifle that killed Medgar Evers in 1963.
Byron De La Beckwith waved me inside his home in Signal Mountain, Tennessee, and guided me into a back room, where he sat in a floral chair, holding court. An orphan by age 12, he had fought in the Pacific during World War II and returned to Mississippi with a Purple Heart. Eager to belong, he joined the Sons of the American Revolution, where he told me members began telling him “the horrible, insidiously evil things that went on in local, county, state, federal and worldwide government.”
Medgar Evers Credit: National Park Service
Beckwith and his wife belonged to the far-right Liberty Lobby. Through its newspaper, The Spotlight, the organization claimed that fraud enabled “illegal aliens” to stay in the U.S. and that 6 million Jews didn’t die in the Holocaust because only 74,000 died at Auschwitz. (Historians put the actual Auschwitz figure at 1.1 million deaths, nearly all of them Jews.)
Spotlight, whose readership reached up to 1 million, pushed the agenda that secret sinister forces controlled the government, seeking to harm Americans through drinking water, prescription drugs and conventional medical treatment, including vaccines, despite the role vaccines have played in the global eradication of smallpox and the near eradication of polio. A recent study concluded that immunizations had saved more than 150 million lives.
Now, decades since my 1990 interview with Beckwith, what was once fringe thinking has become fashionable. Anti-science, anti-vaccine, anti-immigrant and anti-federal government rhetoric have made their way into the mainstream.
In 1998, The Lancet published a landmark study by Andrew Wakefield and other scientists about a possible link between vaccines and autism.
Although the British medical journal later retracted this study, mistrust mushroomed. Celebrities from Jim Carrey to Robert De Niro questioned the safety of childhood vaccines. They found a supporter in Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the nation’s Health and Human Services secretary. In the wake of parents refusing to vaccinate their children, measles — virtually eradicated in the 2000s — has roared back to about 1,800 cases so far this year, resulting in at least three deaths, two of them children.
After the pandemic hit in 2020, Kennedy said in a video that “COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese. We don’t know if it was deliberately targeted or not.” He called the COVID vaccine — developed during President Donald Trump’s first administration and backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — “the deadliest vaccine ever made.”
On Aug. 8 this year, a man angry about the vaccine fired hundreds of rounds at the CDC headquarters, killing a police officer before he committed suicide.
Inside Beckwith’s home in 1990, his wife, Thelma, brought him a glass of an orange drink. I noticed it was bubbling like a mad scientist’s potion. I asked him about it, and he explained it was orange soda, combined with food-grade hydrogen peroxide.
This, he told me, was part of his chelation therapy, which he insisted had kept his arteries clear since renal surgery. Chelation — a dubious treatment that Spotlight championed — grabs poisons and expels them through the kidneys, Beckwith said. “Right-wing folks all over the country are drinking hydrogen peroxide,” he said.
While chelation is used to treat lead poisoning, the medical community has rejected broader use. But that hasn’t stopped Kennedy from touting chelation. Celebrity Jenny McCarthy claims chelation cured her son of autism, but at least one child has died from this treatment.
Beckwith’s wife poured me a glass of this orange concoction, and I pretended to sip it. He promised me it would remove the poisons that the government had been pumping into my body through fluoridated water. “Fluoridated water has been killing babies,” he said. “It’s being suppressed by the government and national TV.”
For decades, the CDC praised fluoridated water, saying studies show the treatment reduces cavities. Despite that, Utah and Florida recently banned fluoride in public water systems. At least 16 other states have introduced bills to do the same. Mississippi has, too, despite the fact that much of the state’s water supply contains no fluoride.
Since taking over as HHS secretary, Kennedy has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” that can cause bone fractures, bone cancer, arthritis, thyroid disorders and reduced IQ in children. The Environmental Protection Agency is now reviewing evidence on fluoride in drinking water.
Beckwith said the words that changed him most came from Judge Thomas P. Brady, who decried the Supreme Court’s 1954 decision to desegregate public schools in an infamous speech known as “Black Monday.” He told a bizarre racist version of history in which he claimed whites built the pyramids in Egypt and that racial “mongrelization” had destroyed this society. This was nothing more than a desire by white supremacists to believe they were behind the world’s greatest achievements. In reality, these ancient civilizations were anything but white.
Brady said people of African descent should regard the day they arrived in America in 1619 as “Thanksgiving Day” because they were “brought from abject ignorance, primitive slavery and placed in a country that was Christian and civilized.” White Mississippi students read this speech in their classrooms along with textbooks that claimed the KKK had saved the South. These same textbooks failed to mention the savage massacres of Black Mississippians from Vicksburg to Meridian.
In recent years, attacks on “critical race theory” and diversity, equity and inclusion have led to revised textbooks. In Florida, new standards require textbooks to say “slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” Some textbooks now call slavery “black immigration,” and one book describes Reconstruction as a time when “great southern leaders and much of the old aristocracy were unable to vote or hold office. The result was that state legislatures were filled with illiterate or incompetent men. … In retaliation, many southerners formed secret organizations to protect themselves and their society from anarchy. Among these groups was the Ku Klux Klan.”
In March, Trump issued an executive order that instructed the National Park Service to remove materials that “inappropriately disparage Americans.” The Washington Post reported that the administration has ordered the removal of signs and exhibits related to slavery at multiple national parks, including an 1863 photo used to expose slavery’s horrors — a Black man whose back was covered in scars.
After Brady gave his “Black Monday” speech, Beckwith sold copies of it and joined the white Citizens’ Council. He said the most powerful members of society — bank presidents, judges, lawyers, congressmen and other politicians — made up the council. “That was my first love,” he sighed, as if reminiscing about a high school sweetheart. “The Citizens’ Council was the first ray of light Dixie had seen since we fought through Reconstruction and captured the right to vote, the right of white people to run the South.”
He said there had been a “great awakening of council activity in St. Louis, but it’s under a little different name” — the Council of Conservative Citizens.
A quarter-century after Beckwith’s words, a young white man named Dylann Roof stumbled upon that group’s website in his Google search for “black on White crime.” After reading page after page of such violence, Roof took action.
On June 17, 2015, he walked inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in time for Wednesday night Bible study. While a dozen Black members closed their eyes in prayer, Roof fired 70 rounds from a Glock .45-caliber pistol, killing nine. When he recounted the slaughter to the FBI, he laughed.
Beckwith laughed, too, when he spoke about Medgar Evers. “I didn’t kill that n—, but he’s sho’ dead,” he chuckled. “He ain’t comin’ back.”
In 1964, two trials for Beckwith ended in mistrials. The all-white juries couldn’t agree on a verdict, despite the fact his rifle with his fingerprint had been left at the murder scene. But the Klansman failed to dodge conviction when he tried to bomb a Jewish leader’s home in New Orleans in 1975.
After spending two and a half years in prison, he joined the Liberty Lobby, which pushed for the deportation of all immigrants. Beckwith called those of Asian descent “the yellow plague” and said, “The Chinamen come over here and eat rice and dead rats, and all the money goes back to China.”
More than three decades later, these tropes persist. After a far-right outlet claimed Haitians, who migrated legally to Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets, then-Sen. JD Vance shared it on social media. City officials denied the report, but Trump repeated the claim in a 2024 presidential debate. He vowed to deport millions of immigrants, starting in Springfield.
In 2025 so far, more than 2 million undocumented immigrants have left the U.S. through deportations or other means, according to the Department of Homeland Security. In September, Trump announced that the fees to hire skilled foreign workers would rise from nearly $1,000 to $100,000.
Beckwith’s beloved Liberty Lobby advocated “America First,” a slogan adopted by the KKK in the 1920s in their opposition to Catholics, Jews and immigrants. The white supremacist group skyrocketed to more than 6 million members, electing thousands to state and national offices. In Mississippi, Klansman Theodore G. Bilbo served as both governor (1916-20 and 1928-32) and U.S. senator (1935-47).
Trump has since revived the slogan “America First,” and new Labor Department posters feature 1940s-era workers and families, promising “high-skilled jobs to AMERICANS FIRST.” All the workers are white men.
In a recent interview with conservative podcaster Tucker Carlson, Nick Fuentes, host of the “America First” livestream, decried “organized Jewry” and declared, “We need to recognize that white people have a special heritage here as Americans. … We’re losing our civilization because of mass immigration.” Trump should crush anyone in the way of deporting the 10 million people here illegally, Fuentes said. “If you’re not on board with that, you’re going to jail.”
The Liberty Lobby denounced foreign aid. After taking office in 2025, the Trump administration halted this aid, dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development and asked Congress to rescind $8.3 billion in funding.
Beckwith told me to thank the KKK. If the group didn’t exist, “you’d be a damn mulatto, quadroon or octoroon instead of a white man, a Nordic man of blood and culture. You’d just be a damn mongrel,” he said. He told me that Evers, the civil rights leader he had shot in the back on that dark night in Jackson, was “nothing but a mongrel, and God hates mongrels.”
Beckwith told me that our ancestors were the true Israelites and that “anyone who calls Jesus a Jew is blaspheming.” His basement was already packed with an arsenal for the “holy war” that he said white Christians would win against Satan and the Jews. “We have more firepower,” he said.
In 2017, hundreds of white nationalists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting, “Jews will not replace us.” On Aug. 27 of this year, a mass shooter opened fire at a Catholic school in Minneapolis. He wrote on his guns, “Burn Israel,” “6 million wasn’t enough,” and “Kill Donald Trump,” a strong supporter of Israel who has survived two assassination attempts.
Back in the 1950s, the Liberty Lobby joined forces with the white Citizens’ Council, trying to get Black Americans shipped to Africa. Beckwith supported this. He said he believed that those of African descent were “mud people” who had no souls. “What is a n— but a heathen?” he told me. “He’s not a Christian. After you turn him into a literate Christian, he’s still a n—.”
I felt overwhelmed, stunned that such a person could exist, let alone that he could be celebrated — and worse — protected by those in power. Noticing the darkness outside, I told him it was time for me to go.
“Let me walk you to your car.”
“That isn’t necessary.”
He walked ahead of me, anyway, blocked my way to the car and spoke. “God will bless you if you write positive things about white Caucasian Christians. If you write negative things about white Caucasian Christians, God will punish you.”
He paused, then locked eyes. “If God does not punish you directly, several individuals will do it for him.”
He stepped aside, and I closed the door. I was glad to have something, even just a pane of glass, between him and me.
I couldn’t start the engine fast enough.
Four years after my interview, a Mississippi jury convicted Beckwith of murdering Evers, and the judge sentenced him to life in prison, where he died in 2001. Hardly anyone attended his funeral.
Thousands flocked to the funeral service of Evers, who was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. Words from the prophet Micah reminded author Margaret Walker Alexander of Evers: “And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.”

The Dallas County Medical Center in Fordyce is a 25-bed critical access hospital and the county’s largest employer, and it serves patients regardless of their ability to pay for care, according to the complaint dated Wednesday by CEO David Mantz. Since 2010, the hospital has participated in the federal 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical companies that participate in Medicaid to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices to clinics, community health centers and hospitals that primarily serve low-income patients.
340B saves the hospital $1.1 million annually, and the hospital cannot afford to pay for prescription drugs at market prices and maintain its current services, Mantz wrote in the complaint.
States force drugmakers to keep selling cheaper meds under federal program

The federal Health Resources and Services Administration announced earlier this year that it would launch a “340B rebate model pilot program” for ten widely prescribed drugs. The program will be effective Jan. 1 for nine of the drugs and April 1 for the remaining one.
The American Hospital Association, Maine Hospital Association and four hospitals, including the Dallas County one, are joint plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. The defendants are HRSA, its administrator Thomas Engel, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the department, and the United States itself.
Requiring hospitals to pay market prices for drugs and seek reimbursement for the discounted difference by providing claims data to drug companies “would inflict hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of annual costs on hospitals and other covered entities,” according to the plaintiffs’ joint complaint.
“First, a rebate system would impose vast administrative costs to submit, track, recover, and potentially dispute the rebates,” the complaint states. “Second, it would drain 340B hospitals of huge sums of money through payments to drug companies that the hospitals then must wait to have refunded by those drug companies. Third, a rebate system would invite mischief from drug companies that have every incentive to slow and stymie the issuance of rebates, figuring that some number of rebates can be withheld from safety-net hospitals by throwing the proverbial ‘sand in the gears.’”
According to both complaints, drug companies have wanted HRSA to institute a 340B rebate program for years. Drugmakers have alleged in the past that some hospitals are pocketing the savings instead of investing the money in more services. Some research supports that contention.
Dallas County Medical Center has used its savings for a variety of patient services, Mantz wrote in the complaint. Those services include:

A financial assistance program for low-income patients
An outpatient psychiatric program for senior citizens
Several primary care outpatient clinics
A telehealth clinic for cancer patients, eliminating their need to drive multiple hours round trip to see a doctor
Replacing the hospital’s leaky roof this year without taking on debt


Mantz-Dallas County Declaration 
“We fear the increased costs from Defendants’ rebate program will force us to cut unprofitable service lines, such as our telehealth oncology clinic,” Mantz wrote. “Ultimately, the financial pressure from the rebate program could force DCMC to leave the 340B Program altogether.”
The hospital planned to use its 340B savings for more new services, such as a daycare center for employees’ children, a telehealth clinic in a local school, a wheelchair-accessible shower in the hospital, and more repairs and maintenance, Mantz wrote. The announcement of the rebate program forced the hospital to delay or cancel those plans.
Complying with the rebate program would require the Dallas County Medical Center to hire two new full-time employees “to track and chase rebates and monitor the impact on our operational budget,” but Jan. 1 is too soon for the employees to be hired and trained, Mantz wrote. Paying those employees would cut into the hospital’s budget.
Mantz said he has concerns about the rebate program itself, specifically the lack of “specific penalties” for improperly denied rebates and the use of a private-third party data collector with “unreasonable terms and conditions” and no guarantee to protect patients’ data.
The joint complaint criticizes the use of the term “pilot program” to describe it because it requires all 340B entities to participate or lose access to the program upon its implementation. The complaint also accuses HRSA of ignoring feedback from health care entities nationwide raising concerns about the administrative costs of the new program.
The plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order before Jan. 1 preventing the rebate program from going into effect until the court makes a final judgment.
“Giving hospitals only a few months to comply with these burdensome new requirements or risk losing millions of dollars in discounts they are entitled to under the law will harm patients and communities across the country,” Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, said in a news release. “We are asking the court to act quickly to protect access to vital care services.”

,Alaska Beacon,2025-12-02 20:06:40+00:00,Alaska Beacon,Alaska Supreme Court must stop judges from treating people with mental illness worse than criminals,Val Van Brocklin,,,,,https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/12/02/alaska-supreme-court-must-stop-judges-from-treating-people-with-mental-illness-worse-than-criminals/,"In Alaska, a criminal in custody must be presented with charges in court within 48 hours — or be freed.

It’s a constitutional due process right. But if you’re an Alaskan with mental illness who has committed no crime? Our courts let the state confine you for weeks with no determination of whether your custody is legal. 
That’s what happened in Tavis J. — an Alaska Supreme Court decision issued in October. It revealed superior court judges have persistently ordered these prolonged illegal confinements, rather than hold the legislative and executive branches accountable for a broken, unconstitutional system.  
As Nick Feronti, attorney for the Northern Justice Project, told me, “If this happened in the criminal context—for instance, if people were just held in prison without cause and additional scrutiny for longer than 48 hours — it would be absurd. It would be illegal.” 
The law governing Tavis’ confinement was clear. A person can be held in custody for a psychiatric evaluation when there’s probable cause to believe the person is “gravely disabled” as a  result of a mental illness and unable to meet their basic needs. A petition must be filed and granted by a superior court for an evaluation period that cannot exceed 72 hours. 
(There are also provisions for involuntarily confining persons who present a danger to others. Neither Tavis nor any of the other cases mentioned here involved any suspected danger to others.)
Over a decade ago, our state Supreme Court ruled the person must be transported “immediately” to an evaluation facility, and this can’t be delayed simply because facilities have no capacity.
The capacity issues of state-run facilities like the Alaska Psychiatric Institute have been well documented in media reports and court challenges, and individual Alaskans cannot be unlawfully confined while these institutional changes are addressed.  
Alaskans’ due process rights do not depend on adequate funding or what reforms are or are not being made. But the superior courts continued to let the state illegally confine these Alaskans.
So, in 2018 the Disability Law Center and Public Defender Agency sued the state for prolonged detentions in Alaska Department of Corrections jails and hospital emergency rooms of Alaskans awaiting involuntary evaluations. The assigned judge found:
“The state was doing nothing to see these Alaskans were transported “immediately” for their evaluations and they were harmed by the prolonged custody.”
The lawsuit settled in 2020 with an agreement the state would fix the problem. It didn’t. 
Meanwhile the Alaska Supreme Court kept seeing the problem. In court challenges brought by psychiatric patients in 2021, 2023, and 2024, the high court confronted cases involving Alaskans who were involuntarily confined for up to 19 days because there was no capacity for evaluations. Vacating the orders in each, the Supreme Court emphasized it was critical for the superior courts to enforce due process because of “the massive curtailment of liberty at stake.”
Still, two courts in Tavis’ case defied those rulings. In two separate petitions two different counselors affirmed to two different superior court judges that there were multiple facilities that would accept Tavis within 24 hours. But the facilities responded they had no capacity. And the two judges confined Tavis a total of 24 days before he was finally transported to an evaluation facility.
Tavis appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court. Two years later, the justices found Tavis’ due process rights had been violated. It vacated the superior court’s order.
Let’s be clear—vacating the orders in all these cases does nothing for the harmed Alaskans. Their prolonged detentions are over. Through years-long ordeals, they receive no compensation, no apology nor even acknowledgement from the state and lower courts. Our high court issued these repeated rulings because they were supposed to prevent future violations. But they haven’t, which leaves a big question:
Why are the superior courts continuing to ignore the law, and why is our Alaska Supreme Court hollowly vacating these violations without doing more? 
The answer came in Tavis’ case when the Alaska Supreme Court conceded that the courts hadn’t anticipated the legislative branch would not adequately fund the involuntary evaluations and commitments it legislated, and that the state (the executive branch) would pursue those evaluations even if it violated due process. And the courts enabled both branches to get away with it.
Alaska’s judiciary must have skipped school when the separation of powers was taught. Judges have the constitutional duty to tell the state that if it doesn’t have room to forcibly detain Alaskans legally, it must release them. That’s what would happen if these Alaskans with mental illness were criminals. 
The Alaska Supreme Court has the power — and duty — to ensure constitutional due process for Alaskans with mental illness. One solution would be for the court to establish a streamlined mechanism where attorneys representing Alaskans being unconstitutionally detained could get an immediate order from the supreme court for the person’s release. 
To fail to act means Alaskans with mental illness will continue to be treated worse than criminals.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Gavel-and-scales-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

(Photo: Greg Childress/NC Newsline)A coalition of municipal and nonprofit organizations has taken legal action to thwart the Trump administration’s move to restrict the amount of federal grant money nonprofits can spend on permanent housing and subsidized rents for formerly homeless people.
The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. It names the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and HUD Secretary Scott Turner as defendants.
The plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to stop what they claim are “unlawful restrictions” before they take effect. They contend the Trump administration announced the changes without substantive advanced notice and on a “highly compressed timeline.” 
At issue are federal Continuum of Care (CoC) grants, which is the largest federal grant program specifically for assisting people experiencing homelessness. HUD announced last month that it would shift two thirds of the $3.9 billion program to transitional housing and other short-term interventions for people experiencing homelessness.
The competitive grants are awarded on a two-year cycle. The second year of funding was expected on Jan. 1, 2026. But HUD is now requiring a new competition one year into the funding cycle. The deadline for letters of intent to reapply for the grants was in November, with formal applications due Jan. 14. 
“Communities were given almost no time to adapt before the funding cycle began, creating widespread confusion and threatening critical housing programs at the peak of winter,” the plaintiffs said in a news release. 
The plaintiffs said the restrictions could force more than 170,000 people into homelessness. Last week, the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, told NC Newsline that nearly 3,000 people in North Carolina could be pushed into homelessness under the changes to the program. The state could lose $24 million in funding, the alliance said.

“At a time when we should all be focused on scaling up and improving our most effective programs, this administration is instead focused on tearing them down,” said Ann Oliva, CEO of the alliance. “These sudden decisions will cause programs to be totally defunded or go without federal funds for at least five months, and likely longer.” 
“We know that conservatively, best case, we will not see awards in our state until the end of May,” Liz Carbone with the NC Coalition to End Homelessness told NC Newsline. “The funding delay alone is going to be so deeply painful for our state.”
Nonprofits in North Carolina may have to ask state and local governments to step in to fill the gaps. That’s likely to be challenging, since the state is currently operating without a new budget, and local governments have long since finalized their budgets for the fiscal year. 
As NC Newsline previously reported, the controversial program changes come as HUD breaks from the long-favored “Housing First” approach, which prioritizes providing immediate access to permanent housing without prerequisites. HUD is moving to a transitional housing approach that includes work and sobriety requirements.

“These long-overdue reforms will promote independence and ensure we are supporting means-tested approaches to carry out the President’s mandate, connect Americans with the help they need, and make our cities and towns beautiful and safe,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a statement announcing the changes.

Could Prime be looking to add two more Rhode Island hospitals to its portfolio? (Photo courtesy of Prime Healthcare)As Prime Healthcare crunches numbers on a potential purchase of Our Lady of Fatima Hospital and Roger Williams Medical Center, the income side of its ledger is poised for a $2 million boost.
The extra money comes from a settlement with the city of Woonsocket, where a local entity of Prime owns and operates Landmark Medical Center. The Woonsocket City Council authorized the payment agreement with Prime under a resolution presented at its meeting Monday. The settlement resolves a longstanding dispute — including three lawsuits — over city tax assessments and bills to the hospital operator that began a decade earlier.
“It’s a lot of money, but it’s very fair,” City Solicitor Michael Lepizzera told the council during its Monday meeting.
Fair perhaps to Prime Healthcare Services – Landmark LLC, the local Woonsocket subsidiary, which alleged in the trio of lawsuits filed in Providence County Superior Court in 2018 and 2019 that the city “illegally” inflated the assessed value of its Woonsocket hospital properties and equipment, leading to “excessive” tax bills from 2015 to 2018.
As part of the settlement, Prime and the city have agreed to toss the lawsuits with prejudice — meaning Prime can’t bring the same complaint against the city again.
“We appreciate the City of Woonsocket’s partnership in resolving tax assessments from the period before Landmark Medical Center was formally recognized as a nonprofit,” Noel True, a spokesperson for Prime, said in a statement Tuesday. “This agreement is the result of a collaborative process that reflects our shared commitment to supporting the hospital’s mission and ensuring stability for the community. We look forward to continuing our strong relationship with the City and providing high-quality, compassionate care for the Woonsocket community for generations to come.”
True did not address how the settlement might affect Prime’s ability to buy Roger Williams and Fatima.
The struggling hospitals face imminent threat of closure by their bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, without a sale by the end of the year. The Centurion Foundation, an Atlanta nonprofit received conditional approval to buy the facilities in June 2024 but has been unable to raise the money for the purchase. Amid delays and signals of closure, Gov. Dan McKee’s administration brought in Prime to gauge its interest as an alternative buyer.
An attorney for Prospect told a Texas federal bankruptcy judge on Nov. 25 that he expected to have an update on a deal by Friday. True did not immediately respond to questions regarding the status of Prime’s due diligence on Tuesday.
The Centurion Foundation is on track to secure the investor-backed bond financing “on or around” Jan. 15, CEO Ben Mingle wrote in an affidavit submitted to federal bankruptcy court Monday. Centurion also asked the federal bankruptcy judge to deny Prospect’s motion to close the hospitals by Dec. 31.  
“We are very pleased the new financing process is now underway and we are eager to work with the State’s leaders to meet this financing schedule,” Mingle said in an email Tuesday.
Attorneys for the parties are expected to provide an update at Friday’s court hearing in Dallas.
A ‘Ponzi scheme’ 
Back in Woonsocket, the City Council is firmly focused on former Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt, who it blames for the costly settlement with Prime over Landmark taxes.
“This is part of the Ponzi scheme that was being run out of this building by the prior administration,” Councilor James Cournoyer said during the meeting.
He repeatedly referred to Baldelli-Hunt as the “disgraced former mayor” and her “best-in-the-state tax assessor” Elyse Paré, mocking the descriptor of Paré given by Baldelli-Hunt.
Baldelli-Hunt led the city for a decade before resigning abruptly in November 2023 in the wake of a land purchase that violated city charter rules, first reported by WPRI-TV 12. Since she left, city officials have continued to grapple with the fallout of her administration, from sloppy bookkeeping to employee turnover and a series of settlements with other companies and property owners over allegedly inaccurate property assessments.
Including the $2 million deal with Landmark’s owners, Cournoyer estimates the city has spent $5.5 million to resolve disputes over excessive property tax assessments from Baldelli-Hunt’s administration, including with the owner of a pair of shopping centers on Diamond Hill Road. 
“This is part of a broader pattern,” Cournoyer said in an interview Tuesday. 
Baldelli-Hunt, however, turned the focus back on current elected officials.
“Sometimes people find it easier to settle than to fight for what’s right,” Baldelli-Hunt said in an interview Tuesday. “They’re not fighting for the city of Woonsocket.”










Sometimes people find it easier to settle than to fight for what’s right. They’re not fighting for the city of Woonsocket.


– Former Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt responding to criticism by City Councilor James Cournoyer


Paré, who left Woonsocket in 2019 to take a job as tax assessor for the city of Providence, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday. She left her job with Providence in 2021 and now owns a wine bar in East Greenwich, according to her LinkedIn page.
Baldelli-Hunt also said the tax years in dispute were a period of transition for Landmark Medical Center, which limited her authority over tax assessments. Prime bought the struggling hospital in 2013, following a five-year bankruptcy process. In 2017, Prime successfully converted the facility from for-profit to nonprofit status. Prime’s lawsuits also alleged the city wrongfully billed it for property and tangible taxes in 2018, even though as a federally recognized tax-exempt organization, it no longer had to pay local taxes.
‘We’re getting hit twice.’
Roger Williams and Fatima would also be returned to nonprofit status under a sale to either Prime or Centurion, the buyers said. Without new, voluntary agreements with the city of Providence and town of North Providence, the sale and change in status would cost the two municipalities a combined $8.5 million in property taxes in fiscal 2026, according to their leaders. 
The city of Providence has not had any formal discussions with any buyers regarding an alternative tax payment schedule, Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for Mayor Brett Smiley’s office, said in an email Tuesday.
“The City remains committed to doing everything possible to ensure the hospital continues serving the community while maintaining proper fiscal stability,” Vega said.
North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi also said he had not spoken with Centurion or Prime about tax payments to the town.
“We’re hoping it’s for-profit so then we get tax dollars,” Lombardi said in an interview Tuesday.
Woonsocket has forgone property and tangible tax payments from Landmark since 2019; it would have received more than $1 million in property tax revenue alone based on the $50 million assessed value of the main hospital facility. 
The city’s settlement payments back to Prime are spread out over the next five years, with an initial $250,000 payment by Dec. 31. Jim Lathrop, the city finance director, confirmed in an interview Tuesday that the city has enough money to make the first payment based on revenue from an October tax sale.
But fulfilling the future financial obligations to Prime might be difficult, Lathrop acknowledged. 
In addition to the $2 million payments, the city has also agreed to suspend fees for water and sewer charges, and issue credits, equal to $80,000 by Sept. 1, 2029.
“We’re getting hit twice,” Council President Dan Gendron said during the meeting.
Cournoyer warned of future tax hikes.
A $500,000 payment — the amount due each year for 2026, 2027 and 2028 — represents 1% of the existing $55 million annual city tax levy.
“That puts a considerable strain on finances, that will likely result in us having to raise taxes at a greater rate than we otherwise would have,” he said.
Lathrop hinted that there be alternative savings strategies that would cover the settlement costs, but declined to specify when asked, awaiting action by the council.

Toby Overdorf speaks to reporters after a property tax meeting on Nov. 20, 2025. (Photo by Liv  Caputo/Florida Phoenix)Fears of decimated fire departments dominated Tuesday’s Florida House committee hearing on proposals to slash property taxes.
Democrats in the House State Affairs Committee joined pro-local groups and a small-town fire chief in raising concern that House Republicans’ four proposed resolutions to amend the state Constitution would starve fire departments and emergency management services.
Because each of the resolutions would ban cutting the property taxes that fund schools or law enforcement, that would leave fire and EMS without much of the money they’ve come to rely on, the opponents claimed.
“How many firefighters are dispensable? That’s the question,” said Rep. Ashley Gantt, a Miami Democrat. “This bill is premature. There is no data, there is no research, and, quite frankly it’s insulting to the men and women who serve us everyday who aren’t law enforcement.”
“The financial impact [these bills] will have on our fire and EMS services could be devastating,” Williston Fire Chief Lamar Stegall agreed. Thirty percent of his county’s EMS budget comes from property taxes, he continued, adding, “If our fire departments go down, what happens then?”
The Florida Association of Counties, Florida League of Cities, and officials from Jacksonville Beach, Orange County, and South Pasadena echoed these fears, claiming that slashing property taxes without proposing alternative revenue is a “fiscal crisis by design.”
A total of seven proposed amendments to the Florida Constitution and one bill have been filed by House Republicans ahead of the 2026 session. This came — somewhat ironically — because Gov. Ron DeSantis last year demanded the Legislature find a way to slash or eliminate property taxes, which have drastically risen in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.
But DeSantis has spurned the proposals, calling them “milquetoast” and scoffing at the lower chamber’s willingness to put all the measures on the ballot for voters.
His public uninterest has been part of a broader feud between DeSantis and House Speaker Danny Perez, who declared that the Florida House would become more independent of the governor than it had been as DeSantis geared up for his failed presidential bid in 2023.
‘Nothing restricts cities from funding fire.’
Only four of the eight measures were taken up Tuesday in the second of three scheduled committee hearings. The other four will likely be scheduled for next week’s State Affairs hearing.
And despite hours of backlash, the four proposals passed along party lines. The Republicans pushed back on predictions of harm to fire and EMS services, noting that they could attempt to smooth problems if voters approve their proposals, or that fire departments could start pulling from a separate taxing fund through higher fees.
“Firefighters have the ability to … have a fee there,” said Rep. Monique Miller, a Palm Bay Republican co-sponsoring one of the measures. “There are a multitude of ways that you can fund law enforcement and firefighters.”
Some county fire departments pull from a Municipal Services Taxing Unit, she said. This is a special revenue fund fueled by charges for services, permits, fees, and special assessments.
Co-sponsor Rep. Kevin Steele claimed that in his county, Pasco, local firefighters rely on such an entity as a partial alternative funding source to property taxes.
“Instead of there being ad valorem taxes, there’s an MSTU separated from that, and there’s an ability for them to do that,” said Steele, who’s running to serve as the state’s Chief Financial Officer in 2026. That duty entails serving as the state’s chief fire marshal.
Roughly 30%, or $56 million, of Pasco fire funding comes from property taxes. About 60% comes from the MSTU.
Although none of the public testimony supported the property tax measures, other Republicans did. This included Rep. Fabian Basabe, representing Miami Beach.
“These bills don’t touch fire millage,” he said, accusing the Democrats of “gaslighting” and using “spin” to allegedly turn the measures into something they’re not. “Nothing restricts cities from funding fire.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0385-1024x1004.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

Nayra Guzmán knew there was something wrong with her daughter within hours of her birth — a long and complicated delivery that included a diagnosis of preeclampsia and ended in a Cesarean section. In the haze of recovery, the first-time mom noticed her daughter was struggling to breathe. When the baby started turning blue, Guzmán watched as doctors whisked her away to the neonatal intensive care unit.
In the days that followed, the 22-year-old’s sole focus was her daughter’s recovery, even as their home, the greater Chicago area, became the latest target of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda in a campaign titled Operation Midway Blitz.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

“We weren’t worried about the immigration raids,” said Guzmán, an immigrant from Mexico who has a pending petition for asylum and a pending application for a visa for victims of crime. “Our worry was, ‘How are we going to get this baby home and out of the hospital?’ That was our number one priority, that she would be safe and healthy, and everything else had fallen to the background.”
That changed on the morning of Monday, Oct. 20. Just 15 days after her daughter’s birth, as Guzmán, her mom and younger brother loaded into their car for their daily drive to the NICU, they were surrounded by immigration enforcement agents and whisked away to detention.
Since Trump took office in January, the administration has abandoned Department of Homeland Security policies restricting the arrest and detention of immigrants who have recently given birth, are pregnant or are nursing. As a result, the administration has taken into custody immigrants like Guzmán, who are medically vulnerable and whose detention threatens not only their own health but also that of their newborn children — typically U.S. citizens — by depriving them of early bonding beneficial to a baby’s lifelong wellbeing.

The administration’s sudden expansion of immigration arrests in Chicago meant Guzmán was in the government’s custody for about 34 hours. She was kept  in a holding facility that was intended to house people for only a small fraction of that time — one that has come under intense scrutiny amid allegations of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and limited medical care. Even though she was still trying to produce breast milk for her daughter, Guzmán had limited access to food and water at the Broadview Processing Center and was never provided a breast pump. She said she was never assessed by a medical professional while in the government’s custody. Guzmán was left to manage the pain of her C-section recovery as well as her Type 1 diabetes with the supplies she had in her backpack at the time of her arrest.
ICE did not respond to a request for comment on Guzmán’s detention or the general conditions at Broadview for immigrants who have recently given birth.
Medical professionals say the conditions of many detention facilities — crowded, dirty and with inconsistent access to health care, food and water — are a threat to most people’s health. They pose particularly acute concerns for people who are still navigating the physical and psychological weight of postpartum recovery like Guzmán.

News reports, lawyers, Democratic lawmakers and immigration rights activists have identified dozens of cases of pregnant, postpartum and nursing individuals who have been detained and whose health has suffered as a result. But the total amount remains unknown: In March, the Republican-led Congress let lapse a requirement that Homeland Security report twice a year on the number of pregnant, postpartum and nursing individuals who have been detained. The Trump administration has declined to provide that information despite repeated requests from lawmakers, The 19th and others.
Now, as the administration expands its immigration enforcement campaign, exporting its Chicago strategy to Charlotte and New Orleans, Guzmán’s case offers a rare window into detention for pregnant and postpartum immigrants. Guzmán is also among the growing number of immigrants who are being detained despite having no criminal record, even as the administration insists its immigration enforcement agenda targets criminals and people who pose a safety threat to the country.

The family had finished breakfast and was loading into the car with some urgency. Guzmán’s daughter was still in the NICU, unable to eat or breathe independently. The doctors had planned a meeting to review the baby’s prognosis and care plans — and Guzmán also wanted to be there for her daughter’s noon feeding.
As Guzmán went to buckle her seatbelt, she looked out the window and noticed they were surrounded. By the look of the white SUVs, Guzmán said, the family knew immediately that they were being detained by immigration agents.
Guzmán remembers the agents asking where they were born and what paperwork they could show. The family, who arrived in the country three years ago, showed the agents their work permits and explained their pending asylum application. The family also explained that they were on their way to the NICU, and an agent approached Guzmán to ask how long it had been since the birth. With that information, they did not handcuff her as she was being detained.
Guzmán asked if she could please call the hospital to let them know she wouldn’t be coming in that day. Guzmán remembers an agent saying she’d have to talk about that with a judge, who would decide whether she would be released or go back to Mexico. The agents explained that after processing, she’d likely be going to a longer-term detention facility in Kentucky.

“In that moment, I just felt fear,” Guzmán said. “I thought, ‘The government is going to take custody of my daughter. I’m going to be in detention and I won’t be able to do anything for my daughter.’ If my daughter isn’t recovering with me there, I thought, then much less so if I’m arrested.”
Up to that point, Guzmán said the pain and difficulty of her own recovery had been overshadowed by her daughter’s. When she was with her, it all faded away. As she was being detained, it came into focus.
Guzmán’s C-section incision was throbbing on the ride to Broadview. The agent behind the wheel was driving fast over potholes, she said, despite pleas from her brother that Guzmán was in a fragile state following her surgery, which involved cutting through seven layers of tissue.
“How is it possible that I’m going all the way to Kentucky, in this state, six hours away? My scar is burning. I’m supposed to be resting,” she thought.
Once she arrived at Broadview, Guzmán said, she was taken to a room and examined by two immigration agents. They asked Guzmán to explain how her insulin pump and monitor worked and what medications she had in her backpack. One agent asked Guzmán to take off her belly binder, a stretchy garment that supports the abdomen after surgery. She declined, explaining that without it, she’d have a hard time managing the pain.
“I overheard another agent say, ‘Leave it. They’ll take it at the detention center,’” Guzmán recalled.
Eventually, she was transferred to a holding cell for women alongside her mom. They were given water and a sandwich at around 3 p.m., Guzmán said, her first meal since they were detained around 10 a.m.
The only places for rest inside the holding cell were small benches. Guzmán spent the night on one without a blanket or anything but what she had on her body.
“It was really uncomfortable. I was wearing two layers of leggings, two layers of socks, my sweatshirt, and I was still freezing,” Guzmán said. “Once I was laying down, I couldn’t really move because of the pain. And then I started to feel cramping in my uterus.”
C-section recovery typically involves six to eight weeks of rest, gentle movement, wound care and pain management. At a minimum, patients only 15 days out from a C-section require a bed, access to a breast pump, clean water and a sanitary restroom to change menstrual pads, said Dr. Beth Cronin, an OB-GYN in Rhode Island and chair of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology’s Committee of Advancing Equity in Obstetric and Gynecologic Health Care. They need access to a shower, and they need extra food — especially if they are breastfeeding.
“Those are medical necessities. You would never take anybody else who just had major surgery and give them a bench,” Cronin said upon learning about Guzmán’s case. The risk of infection is heightened for patients with Type 1 diabetes, she added.
Guzmán’s detention was made more difficult by the fact that she was held in a temporary ICE processing facility lacking the services of longer-term detention centers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a class-action suit filed Oct. 30, nine days after Guzmán’s release, people who had been detained at Broadview described overcrowded and dirty cells; limited food and water; no access to showers, soap or menstrual supplies; inadequate medical care; and freezing conditions at night. Multiple people with diabetes said they were given only a sandwich at every meal, though bread can cause blood sugar spikes. Days later, a judge said he found the accounts “highly credible,” and described the conditions as “unnecessarily cruel.”
In another case, filed by a nursing woman detained Oct. 30 and released a day later, government officials conceded that they were not aware of any accommodations at Broadview — such as a lactation room or breast pump — that would allow detained immigrants to express breastmilk.
“Oversight of this facility is desperately needed as legal service providers and our constituents have raised concerns about the poor conditions at Broadview,” reads a letter signed by the state’s two senators and its 14 Democratic representatives, who have been denied entry to assess the conditions of the facility. “These reports allege unsanitary bathroom facilities; spreading illness; continued overcrowding; detainees sleeping on the floor or in chairs; a lack of access to food, water or hygiene products; restricted communications to family members and attorneys; and an inability to access medication.”
“Whether it’s a detention center, whether it’s any federal building under the Department of Homeland Security, we have to make sure that we are enacting and enforcing the policies to protect people,” said Rep. Delia Ramirez, who represents a Chicago-area district and has been pushing for more transparency around conditions at Broadview.
Under any circumstances, Cronin said, having a newborn requiring intensive care can be deeply traumatizing for someone who has just given birth. A large body of medical research suggests that early bonding between a parent and newborn can help nurture an infant’s brain development — fostering social, emotional and cognitive development — and can alleviate anxiety in someone newly postpartum.

Guzmán said that prior to her arrest, she was at the hospital daily, and would often get time “piel a piel,” or skin-to-skin, with her daughter. While in custody, Guzmán had no access to any information about her daughter. A relative had contacted immigration attorneys to sue for Guzmán’s release; the same lawyers had Guzmán’s father appointed as a temporary guardian for her daughter. Her father and uncle drove to the hospital — risking detention themselves — to visit the baby while Guzmán was in detention.
“Even if she had an uncomplicated vaginal birth without an incision, it’s still the fact that you’re separating a newly postpartum person from their baby in this way and putting them at personal risk to contract infection and get sick and not be appropriately nourished and be able to empty their breasts,” Cronin said. “And all of that is terrifying.”
Citing Guzmán’s health and that of her newborn daughter, her lawyers successfully petitioned a judge to order the family’s release. The three of them left Broadview at around 8 p.m. on October 21, avoiding a transfer to a long-term detention facility, such as the one in Kentucky. It was too late to visit the hospital that day. The family waited for close to 30 minutes in the rain before their attorneys could pick them up, said Laura Smith, a lawyer who argued for the release of Guzmán and her family. Their first stop was for a meal at Portillo’s, a local fast food chain that specializes in Chicago-style hot dogs.
Even climbing a flight of stairs was difficult for Guzmán, Smith recalled: She had to walk backward, relying on her family for support.
After her release, Guzmán fell ill with flu-like symptoms, which kept her separated from her daughter for almost a week. After going almost two days with little food or water and without access to a breast pump, Guzmán said, her breastmilk dried up.
While her daughter has made significant strides, she continues to need NICU care. Guzmán said her daughter still relies on a feeding tube, and doctors have ordered more tests to arrive at a diagnosis. Going outside — even to see her daughter — feels dangerous in a way it didn’t before.
“When I first got home, I felt relieved. But the next day, I had to face reality. I was telling myself, ‘You have to leave the house and see your baby.’ But I had this horrible fear that they would detain me again,” Guzmán said.
There is no active deportation case against Guzmán, and her visa application is still pending. She keeps having flashbacks to her arrest and detention: the sound of chains and handcuffs being thrown around by immigration agents, the screaming, the way the men arrive at the detention facility “all beat up and dirty.”
“It’s a deep fear and this feeling that there are eyes watching you everywhere.”

NEW CASTLE, Del. — The Delaware River and Bay Authority has taken a major step toward adding a new “green” ferry to the Cape May–Lewes Ferry fleet, awarding a $78.6 million construction contract for a diesel-hybrid vessel expected to begin service later this decade.
The DRBA Commission on Nov. 18 unanimously approved a contract with SENESCO Marine LLC of North Kingstown, R.I., to build and outfit a new 75-car passenger and vehicle ferry. The new vessel is expected to eventually replace the MV Cape Henlopen, an over 40-year-old diesel-powered ferry that currently runs between Lewes, Delaware, and Cape May, New Jersey.
“For sustainable ferry operations in the future, it’s imperative we make this necessary capital investment today,” DRBA Executive Director Joel Coppadge said in a statement. “The Ferry’s a critical piece of regional infrastructure, and we’re proud of the Ferry’s heritage and link between two historic destinations. The new hybrid ferry is the start of the next chapter in the proud history of the Cape May–Lewes Ferry.”
The hybrid vessel is designed to significantly reduce emissions while cutting fuel use by an estimated 35%. DRBA officials say the ferry will operate with lower emissions at sea and zero emissions while in port or docked. Annual reductions are projected at 2,025 tons of carbon dioxide, 102.7 tons of nitrogen dioxide, 1.51 tons of fine particulate matter, 1.03 tons of hydrocarbons and 5 tons of carbon monoxide.
“The Cape May–Lewes Ferry is a vital transportation link and an economic catalyst for the southern regions of Delaware and New Jersey,” said Heath Gehrke, the authority’s director of ferry operations. “Hundreds of thousands of people rely on our year-round service to get them safely across to work, visit loved ones, get to that vacation destination or to avoid the hassle of highway congestion. By moving forward with our vessel modernization effort, we’re ensuring that future generations will continue to enjoy a break from the ordinary aboard the Cape May–Lewes Ferry.”
The $78.6 million project is being partially funded with a $20 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The contract award is subject to a 10-day review and consent period by the governors of Delaware and New Jersey.
With the bid awarded, construction on the new ferry is slated to begin early next year, with a projected completion date in summer 2029.
The DRBA, a bi-state agency created in 1962, owns and operates the Cape May–Lewes Ferry, the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the Forts Ferry Crossing, and manages five airports in Delaware and New Jersey.
Since it began service on July 1, 1964, the Cape May–Lewes Ferry has carried more than 50 million passengers across the Delaware Bay. DRBA officials say the ferry system supports more than 4,000 jobs and generates hundreds of millions of dollars in regional economic activity, making the new hybrid vessel both an environmental and economic investment in the future of coastal Delaware and South Jersey.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/New-Ferry-Vessel-Rendering.png,,,2025-12-02 14:57:14.405987

(Photos by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch; photo illustration via Canva) Local chapters of the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators unions have endorsed state Rep. Josh Turek and Sen. Zach Wahls in the Democratic primary for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat.
The Heat and Frost Insulators Local 39 in Council Bluffs and Omaha, Nebraska endorsed Turek, a Council Bluffs Democrat, saying he was a strong supporter of unions in the Legislature. Turek, a two-time Paralympic gold medalist, has served in the Iowa House since 2022.
“We’re proud to support Josh for U.S. Senate because we know he’ll continue his record of supporting unions,” John Hanson, business manager for Insulators Local 39 said in a statement. “He’s been a fighter for the working class during his time in the state legislature and we know he’ll take that same fight to Washington.”

Turek said in a statement he was “honored” to have his campaign endorsed the union, adding to a list of endorsements from Iowa Democratic leaders, including former Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, former Lt. Gov. Sally Pederson and Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten, who was also previously running for the U.S. Senate seat in 2026 and endorsed Turek’s campaign after dropping out.
“In working class communities like mine, unions are essential to providing good-paying jobs and benefits that support families,” Turek said. “At a time when Washington is more focused on billionaires, I’ll continue fighting for the working class and the unions that make it strong.”
Turek is running against Wahls and Nathan Sage, former Knoxville chamber of commerce executive director, for the Democratic nomination in 2026. The winner of the Democratic primary is expected to face U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who quickly became the frontrunner for the GOP nomination after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst announced she would not seek reelection.
Wahls, D-Coralville, announced on Tuesday he had also received an endorsement from an Iowa Insulators union in the race, coming from the Heat and Frost Insulators Local 81 union, serving the Quad-Cities area in eastern Iowa and western Illinois.
Sean Nagle, business manager for the Insulators Local 81 union, said Wahls “fights for working people every single day.”
“He’s been a consistent advocate for labor, someone we can count on to protect our right to organize, stand up for safe jobs, and defend fair wages and benefits,” Nagle said in a statement. “Our members are worried about rising costs and shrinking paychecks, and Zach is laser-focused on exactly that — boosting workers’ pay, lowering costs for families, and taking on the corporate special interests that are squeezing our members. Insulators Local 81 is proud to stand with Zach Wahls in this race.”
Wahls has received endorsements from several other Iowa labor unions, including Teamsters Local 90, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1846, Communications Workers of America Local 7110 and Ironworkers Locals 67, 89, and 111. He has also been endorsed by officials like former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander and Council Bluffs Mayor-elect Jill Shudak.
The state senator said if elected to the U.S. Senate, he would work to support Iowa unions and the workers they represent, which he said “are the backbone of Iowa’s middle class.”
“I know what it means when a good union job keeps a family above water,” Wahls said. “In the Senate, I’ll fight to raise wages, pass the PRO Act, protect pensions, and make sure every Iowan who works hard can actually get ahead — not just scrape by while billionaires and big corporations write the rules.”

(Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)As Pennsylvanians pull out their snow gear and shovel walkways for the first time this season, the state is set to begin accepting applications for its Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program on Wednesday. 
The state Department of Human Services usually opens applications in November, but delayed LIHEAP when it hadn’t received funds due to the longest federal government shutdown in history. The federally funded program received $229 million in 2024, which helps offset heating bills for more than 300,000 Pennsylvanians. 
The Trump administration distributed funds under the block grant last week. Applications for LIHEAP will be open until April 10, 2026. 
Energy assistance need ‘tremendous’ in Pa., but shutdown halts delivery of critical funds

“Pennsylvanians deserve the safety and health benefits that come from being able to heat their homes and keep themselves and their families warm through the winter,” said Human Services  Secretary Val Arkoosh in a statement. “LIHEAP helps hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians each year by providing cash and crisis grants directly to the eligible household’s utility company or heating fuel provider, and I am very glad that we are finally able to begin this important work.” 
Awards range from $200 to $1,000, though the average benefit in 2024 was $336. To qualify for the one-time grant, individuals and families must make at or below 150% of the federal poverty level — or $22,590 for an individual and $46,800 for a family of four. 
Separately, Pennsylvanians may qualify for LIHEAP crisis grants up to $1,000 if they’re at risk of getting their heating service terminated or have less than two weeks’ worth of deliverable fuel, which includes oil, propane, coal or wood.
The state’s moratorium on heating and electricity disconnections started in November and lasts until March 31. That moratorium applies to families making up to 250% of the federal poverty level, or $39,125 for an individual and $80,375 for a family of four. 
Families still have to pay their winter bills in the spring, potentially with the assistance of LIHEAP. The moratorium doesn’t include households using deliverable fuels or those getting energy from rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities because they aren’t regulated by the state Public Utility Commission.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1528-1-dragged-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 14:57:14.405987

(Amanda Berg for the Capital-Star)Buried in a code bill passed with the 2025-26 state budget is a provision giving a single school district $5 million, outside of the typical formulas that are used to distribute funds to Pennsylvania’s school districts.
The bill didn’t mention the district by name, but specified the money is to go to one “in a county of the second class A with a 2021-2022 adjusted daily membership greater than 5,590 and less than 5,595.”
It  could only be William Penn, a Delaware County district represented by state House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia).
William Penn has struggled financially for years, and was one of the six plaintiff school districts in a lawsuit that led to Pennsylvania’s method of distributing money to schools being overturned in 2023. The Commonwealth Court called it unconstitutionally inequitable.

District officials reached out to lawmakers to advocate for additional funding – as they do every year – during negotiations over the latest state budget, according to Jennifer Hoff, who sits on the William Penn Board of School Directors and chairs its Budget & Finance Committee. 
William Penn needed the money even more than usual this year because the state budget impasse forced the district to borrow – and incur interest – to make up for delayed funding from the commonwealth, Hoff said. 
“William Penn has long struggled and advocated for themselves around funding,” Hoff said. “We need to be properly funded. That’s what caused the problem, that’s what keeps the problems going. It’s more expensive to be poor than rich. Your insurance rates go up, it costs more to borrow. That’s where William Penn is. We never get ahead, and it’s a government-made problem.”
More than two dozen other school districts, at minimum, likewise took out loans and incurred interest, according to the Pennsylvania State Education Association.
Asked why William Penn School District received additional funds, Beth Rementer, a spokesperson for the House Democratic caucus said in a statement, “the guiding principle for the House Democratic caucus has always been and always will be to help the least advantaged. There is an overlap to the extent that our leaders represent some of the poorest areas. Maybe that is a good thing.”
Rementer did not respond to follow-up questions about whether specific issues elevated William Penn’s funding needs above other districts. 
Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, a senior attorney at the Public Interest Law Center, which represented William Penn in the case that led to the creation of the adequacy formula, provided some clarity about the district’s unique needs.
William Penn recently found itself facing a $9.2 million deficit after uncovering record keeping issues and under-budgeting problems. That’s led the school district to consider cutting staff, including administrators and academic interventionists who work one-on-one with struggling students.
“I do think the context matters,” Urevick-Ackelsberg said. “They’re a district that has a judgement against the state for unconstitutional underfunding, and their budget situation, if anything, is even worse than previously understood … This was a catastrophe for them.”

Deirdre Abrahamsson, a William Penn spokesperson, said the district has taken steps to ensure that similar bookkeeping issues don’t come up again.
“We have implemented new internal controls and updated financial procedures to standardize record keeping and documentation,” she said. Staff have received training in purchasing, payroll, and budget reporting to ensure consistency and compliance across all schools and departments. Oversight and accountability have also been increased, with more frequent internal reviews and stronger collaboration between the Business Office, administrators, and auditors.”
The district is still making decisions about what to do with the $5 million from the state, according to school board member Hoff. 
It’s likely the money will go toward developing curriculum and mental health services. With the funds amounting to a one-time cash infusion instead of recurring revenue, the district is wary about using it on recurring costs like staffing, Hoff said.
Kayla Anderson, a spokesperson for Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was a key negotiator for both the 2024-25 and 2025-26 budgets, did not respond to specific questions from the Capital-Star. 
But she said in a statement, that the most recent spending plan, “takes seriously the need to drive dollars out to the schools that need them most to ensure every Pennsylvania student has access to an adequate, equitable education. The final budget agreement was the result of a thoughtful, considered negotiation with all leaders in both parties.”
Additional funding part of a Capitol compromise
This is the second year in a row that the state budget has included additional funding for school districts represented by members of House Democratic leadership.
Last year, Democratic lawmakers pushed for an adjustment to the adequacy funding formula, devised to help the least advantaged schools in the wake of the lawsuit. Ultimately, that led to 11 school districts receiving an additional $14 million annually –all represented by Democratic House members, including members of leadership. William Penn was one of them.\

Democratic lawmakers  said the move was the result of a compromise with Senate Republicans, who successfully pushed for changes to the adequacy formula that resulted in dozens of school districts – including those 11 – receiving less funding than Democrats had hoped. 
The compromise, they said, protected districts that both genuinely needed money and were important to House Democrats whose votes were necessary to pass a budget and ensure the adequacy formula was enacted at all.
All 11 districts that received additional funding were affected by changes to the adequacy formula proposed by Republicans. But other districts – including many represented by GOP members –  were affected as well, according to an analysis by the Capital-Star.
“There are 500 school districts across the Commonwealth, and each have their own definition of what fair funding means,” Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said in a statement. “For years, our Commonwealth has been dealing with formulas which seek to implement greater ‘fairness’, yet there is no universally agreed to definition of fairness. As we continue to meet our obligation to support educational opportunities for all children in Pennsylvania, looking at how adequacy dollars are dispersed remains a topic of conversation.”
Urevick-Ackelsberg believes House Democrats, led by McClinton, have shown their bona fides advocating for better funding for K-12 schools across Pennsylvania, including in rural areas largely represented by Republicans.
“If I were evaluating Speaker McClinton fairly, I think I would say she’s been a really good champion for increasing school funding. And I think by any reasonable metric, that caucus has repeatedly passed both fiscal reforms and more aggressive funding increases, but they haven’t passed both sides,” Urevick-Ackelsberg said.
While he would like to see broader changes to Pennsylvania’s school funding model that would help more schools, Urevick-Ackelsberg sees the $5 million for William Penn as a necessary expenditure for a district in crisis, though.
“William Penn is in a pretty unique position in that this district that was the named plaintiff in the school funding litigation, and has a judgement against the state, was facing acute disaster,” he said. “I don’t think you can draw any conclusions except to say we need to get all school districts this money on a faster timeline.”
Originally, a seven-year plan to add $5.4 billion to the state budget for struggling districts was presented by a commission of lawmakers and members of the Shapiro administration. They’d been tasked with developing the plan by Commonwealth Court in 2023 when it ruled the state’s school funding formula was unconstitutionally inequitable.
But, lawmakers extended the timeline to nine years at the insistence of the Senate GOP majority. 
“We aren’t getting it out nearly as fast as it needs to go,” Urevick-Ackelsberg said. “If you’re a child who’s starting kindergarten, you’ll be in ninth grade before schools are adequately funded.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230530_Cap_Star_Edu_Funding_643_EDIT-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 14:57:14.405987
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-02 18:52:05+00:00,CT Mirror,Norm Pattis asks out of defending Kosta Diamantis in second trial,Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/02/kosta-diamantis-norm-pattis-withdraw/,Konstantinos Diamantis' attorney Norm Pattis said Diamantis hasn't paid him for defending him in his first trial.,"Konstantinos Diamantis’ attorney Norm Pattis has filed a motion seeking to withdraw from defending Diamantis in his second corruption trial, claiming the former high-ranking state employee has failed to pay Pattis for defending him the first time.
If U.S. District Court Judge Stefan Underhill grants the request, it could delay Diamantis’ second corruption trial, scheduled for early February.
Diamantis, the former Democratic deputy secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, is facing bribery, extortion and filing false statement charges for his alleged role in pressuring state employees to cancel a 2020 audit that was examining the Medicaid and Medicare billing of a Bristol optometry practice
In a separate case regarding school construction projects, Diamantis was convicted by a jury in late October on 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators. He is facing between 10 and 12 years in prison on those charges, according to Pattis. 
Sentencing on those charges has been postponed until after the second trial. Diamantis is currently free on $500,000 bail.
Pattis said in his motion that he will continue as Diamantis’ attorney for the sentencing from the first trial but that doing the second trial without getting paid “would be a hardship” for his firm. 
“Mr. Diamantis has thus far not fulfilled his obligation as to services for that trial that has gone to verdict and has been warned that the undersigned will move to withdraw if the responsibility is not fulfilled,” Pattis wrote. “In the instant case, the undersigned contends it would be hardship to his firm to continue with representation to a second trial when the client’s obligations arising under the first trial have yet to be fulfilled.”
Underhill has not responded to Pattis’ motion as of Tuesday. It is unclear whether the judge would hold a hearing to question both Pattis and Diamantis about the fee dispute. 
In his motion, Pattis said Diamantis would oppose the motion and said it was unclear if federal prosecutors would take a position. Diamantis said Tuesday he didn’t want to comment.
Jury selection for the second trial is supposed to begin Jan. 30, but if Pattis is allowed to withdraw, it could delay the trial while a new attorney familiarizes themselves with the case.
The indictment in the upcoming trial alleges that Diamantis conspired with Helen Zervas, owner of Family Eye Care, and Christopher Ziogas, a former Democratic state lawmaker and her fiancé, to get a potentially damaging audit canceled. In exchange, she allegedly paid Diamantis about $95,000.
Both Zervas and Ziogas have pleaded guilty, and Pattis has said he expects both of them to testify at the second trial. 
Ziogas appeared in federal court last week and changed his plea to guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert M. Spector, who asked Ziogas to describe in his own words what he had done.
“I participated in a scheme with Helen and Kosta to try and have him suppress some activity in Medicaid charges that she was facing,” Ziogas said, adding, “We paid him to help influence the outcome of the audit.” 
When asked by the judge what he had specifically done, Ziogas added, “Helen gave me money, and I gave it to Kosta — maybe $100,000.”
There is no mention in the 13-page plea agreement about whether Ziogas will be required to testify at Diamantis’ upcoming trial in the Zervas matter, and the issue was not brought up during last week’s hearing. 
Ziogas is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 18. Under the plea agreement, he is facing between 70-87 months in prison. Ziogas was allowed to remain free on the $500,000 bail that has been in place since his arrest last February.
The case has its roots in a Medicaid audit that was scheduled in early 2020.
It was during the height of COVID, in May 2020, when Diamantis and Ziogas hand-delivered a check for nearly $600,000 to the Department of Social Services in order to reimburse the state Medicaid program for services that Zervas improperly billed.
After that check was delivered to the DSS office in Hartford, the audit into Zervas’ optometry practice was dropped, which prevented state auditors from combing through her records and potentially clawing back even more money for the state.
The CT Mirror reported that the audit of Bristol Eye Care was the only one that DSS canceled over a five-year period. 
Diamantis and Ziogas previously told the CT Mirror that there was nothing illegal about the $600,000 payment, and they said their involvement had nothing to do with the agency ending the scheduled audit of Zervas’ practice.
Zervas pleaded guilty last February to health care fraud charges and admitted that she conspired with a former state lawmaker and former high-ranking Connecticut employee to pressure officials at the state’s Medicaid agency to cancel an audit that was examining Medicaid overpayments at her optometry practice.
The federal prosecutors said Zervas fraudulently billed the state’s Medicaid program on more than 300 occasions between 2015 and 2020. She did the same for Medicare patients, but less frequently.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0228_SR_FederalCourtKosta_068-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 13:57:25.354131

Scott and Lambert Junttila allegedly allowed “unauthorized computer examiner access to voter data, including non-public voter information,” according to Nessel’s office. When the charges were first announced in May 2024, Nessel noted that Scott also allegedly refused to turn over a voting tabulator for maintenance and testing, as well as that Lambert Junttila “illicitly transmitted data from the Adams Township Electronic Poll Book concerning the 2020 General Election under the direction of Scott.”
“The deliberate violation of voter privacy to push a false agenda and spew misinformation is reckless and illegal,” Nessel said in Tuesday’s press release. “My office takes these allegations very seriously and looks forward to further pursuing this case through the judicial process to defend the rights of Michiganders and protect their personal election data.”

Scott also faces a felony charge of Misconduct in Office and a misdemeanor charge of Disobeying a Lawful Instruction or Order of the Secretary of State as Chief Election Officer. 
Lambert Junttila is also facing charges in Oakland County for separate charges of alleged voter machine tampering, which she was indicted for in 2023 alongside former Republican attorney general nominee Matt DePerno and former state Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City).

Nov. 4, 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Shenna Bellows and 11 other secretaries of state are objecting to the federal government’s repurposing of a data tool to identify noncitizen voters, arguing doing so oversteps state authority and puts Americans’ private data at risk.
President Donald Trump’s administration rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice started asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The Trump administration sued Maine after Bellows twice rejected these requests. 
“While DHS claims that its changes to SAVE make it an effective tool for voter eligibility verification, the modifications to SAVE are likely to degrade, not enhance, state efforts to ensure free, fair, and secure elections,” the 12 secretaries of state wrote in comments submitted to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday.
Previously, SAVE could only conduct searches one name at a time. Now, it can conduct bulk searches, making it possible to feed millions of voters’ information into the tool and have it check those records against a series of federal databases to try to verify someone’s immigration status. 
In November, Bellows and other secretaries of state also sent a letter to the Trump administration asking whether federal agencies actively misled election officials regarding the use of the voter data it requested from states, in light of federal officials acknowledging that the Department of Justice shared voter roll information with Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens. 
In the comments submitted on Monday, the secretaries of state argue that the repurposed SAVE tool has not been proven to be reliable for voter verification purposes and using it as such will lead to misidentifying eligible voters as non-citizens, chilling voter participation. 
State election officials ​in letter ​ask if they were ‘misled’ by Trump administration

What the modified system will do, they wrote, is allow the federal government to seize states’ constitutional authority to regulate and administer their own elections and threaten to expose hundreds of millions of Americans’ private data to cyberattack and misuse. 
“And all these risks must be considered against a single backdrop: American elections are free, fair, and secure,” they added. “Study after study confirms that the so-called ‘problem’ that SAVE targets does not exist: Non-citizen voting is exceedingly rare.” 
These objections from Bellows and the secretaries of state of California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington come after four Republican states agreed to help the Trump administration gain access to state driver’s license data through SAVE. 
Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio initially sued former President Joe Biden’s administration last year alleging it wasn’t doing enough to help states verify voter eligibility. 
As part of a settlement agreement on Friday, the federal government is required to continue its development of SAVE and, in return, the GOP states agreed to support Homeland Security’s efforts to access the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, also called Nlets, an obscure computer network that typically allows law enforcement agencies to search driver’s license records across state lines.
Maine Morning Star’s partner outlet Stateline reported last week, before the settlement agreement was filed in court, that Homeland Security publicly confirmed it wants to connect Nlets to SAVE.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/election-day-2025-19-Large-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 13:57:25.354131

Friends and family wrapped her in hugs and whispered words of encouragement: “One day at a time” and “I’m so glad you’re back.”

The roughly 60-person gathering on Monday marked almost a week since the 38-year-old Greenwood mother returned to her hometown after spending nearly six years in prison for killing her abuser. Now, Carroll hopes to be fully reunited with her children and help other victims of domestic abuse who may share her experiences.
The state parole board, in a 4-2 vote Nov. 19, approved Carroll’s release following a years-long effort by her family, her second grade teacher, and two GOP legislators. She walked out of the women’s prison in Columbia six days later.
Inside the law office of one of Carroll’s supporters, state Rep. John McCravy, well-wishers clutched plates of pink- and red-frosted cake and clasped hands in prayer circles with Carroll as she greeted neighbors she hadn’t seen in years — and even some people she’d never met who prayed for her release.
Because of those efforts, Carroll was able to spend Thanksgiving at her aunt’s home in Simpsonville with her five children — ages 6, 9, 15, 16 and 18 — eating turkey, fried chicken and her grandmother’s specialty macaroni and cheese.
“I just have no words,” Carroll’s aunt Brenda McCullough told the group. “Thanksgiving was so wonderful. The kids were so glad to see each other. It was just like they’d never been apart all this time.”
Carroll spent the Monday after the holiday getting her identification card as she works to have her driver’s license renewed. She starts work Wednesday at Granny Hands and Landis catering company.

Her goal is to have all of her children home with her — hopefully by next summer.
“I just want to get all my kids under the same roof in the same household again,” Carroll told the SC Daily Gazette.
The two youngest children, both boys, live with another family member in Greenwood. Her 18-year-old daughter lives on her own, while her 16- and 15-year-old daughters live with family in Columbia.
Carroll said her daughters visited often while she was incarcerated. She saw the boys just once.
But Carroll feels as if they’ve picked up where they left off, loving her unconditionally. Her oldest daughter reached out and interlinked fingers with her mother as she visited with Greenwood friends she’s been separated from.
Carroll pleaded guilty but mentally ill to manslaughter in December 2019 for fatally stabbing her then-partner, 27-year-old William Jamal Johnson.
Carroll was allowed to spend Christmas Day with her children and turned herself in the next day to begin her 15-year sentence.
Johnson repeatedly physically abused Carroll. Law enforcement officers responded to their home eight times between May 2016 and Johnson’s death, court records show.
She left twice, but as is common in cases of domestic abuse, she returned. She planned to leave again that day in September 2017, when the couple started arguing.

“That day, it was just too late,” Carroll told the Gazette.
At her first parole hearing, Carroll told the board that “he leaped out at me and hit me again.” She’s said she doesn’t remember what happened next. At some point she got a knife from the kitchen, cut him on the arm and ankle and stabbed him in the chest.
After realizing what she’d done, Carroll tried to save Johnson’s life, applying pressure to his wounds. He died at the local hospital.
A month before Carroll’s sentencing, a psychologist diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder linked to severe domestic violence, also known as “battered woman syndrome.”
At sentencing, then-Circuit Court Judge Letitia Verdin (now a state Supreme Court justice) permitted Carroll to be eligible after serving 25% of her 15-year sentence, leading to the efforts for her release that began in 2022.
While in prison, Carroll said she befriended another woman serving a 30-year sentence with no opportunity for parole for a similar crime.
Carroll said that’s why she wants to start a nonprofit to help other women plead their case for release. She’d also like to work toward changes in state law for battered women, though she’s not yet sure what. And she wants to share with others what she learned in prison programs she enrolled in about recognizing signs of abuse and anger management skills.
“When someone abuses you, they find ways to make you dependent on them, make you feel alone, make you feel like everyone is against you,” she said. “You don’t realize how serious it is.
“I wish I had had that knowledge that I have now,” Carroll added.
In addition to nonprofit work, Carroll also hopes to return to school, taking night classes in business management with the goal of one day opening a daycare.
She said the worst part of prison was being away from her children. She loves being a mother.
“I’m kind of a big kid myself,” she said.
The separation led to sleepless nights and times of lost hope. She said it was faith and the support of her community that helped her get through.
Now out of prison, she said, she refuses to let her time inside define her.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)About 2,000 nurses in four Des Moines area UnityPoint Health campuses will vote early this month on whether to unionize their ranks for what leaders of the movement say will bring more bargaining power for salaries, benefits and working conditions through a proposed affiliation with the Teamsters Union.
Nurses are expected to vote Dec. 7 to 9 on unionization at four UnityPoint locations — Iowa Methodist Medical Center, Blank Children’s Hospital, Methodist West Hospital and Iowa Lutheran Hospital.
An affirmative vote would be a groundbreaking one in Iowa health care — and the union movement — as the Teamsters would represent nurses in non-profit hospitals, with the potential for organizing other health-care workers across a span of UnityPoint facilities in Iowa — and other medical centers in which health-care workers could be inspired by the Des Moines vote.
“We are fed up with UnityPoint whittling away at the things nurses need at the bedside,” said Alex Wilken, 39, a critical care nurse at Iowa Methodist Medical Center with more than a decade of experience.
Wilken is on the organizing committee for unionization with his nursing peers at the four centers.
“It isn’t just about pay,” Wilken said, adding that patient-staff ratios and safer working conditions are a big part of the push for what he believes will be more effective advocacy.
“The method we have here in the United States is to unionize,” Wilken said in a phone interview.
UnityPoint leaders say unionization is not in the best interests of the health-care network. UnityPoint management denied a request this summer for voluntary union recognition in workplace negotiations.
“At UnityPoint Health, we believe that direct collaboration is the foundation for building the strongest and most supportive environment for both our team members and the patients we serve,” UnityPoint officials said in a statement sent to Iowa Mercury. “For this reason, we believe that representation by an outside party is not in the best interests of our patients, our nurses or our community.”
Union organizers are calling for an investigation into how UnityPoint funded any opposition to unionization. Nurses and union officials allege that UnityPoint spent $6 million to fight unionization.
UnityPoint did not respond directly to questions on funding sources for any activity related to the union vote.
Sammi Ladd, 36, a critical care nurse at Iowa Methodist, said health-care workers are concerned that staffing and security levels are not high enough to deal with patient violence. Ladd was attached by a patient while pregnant and kicked a few years later by another patient.
“I’ve seen my co-workers and friends get strangled by patients,” Ladd said.
Ladd expects the nurses to vote for unionization. The vote is managed by the National Labor Relations Board.
“I do truly think this is something that will go through,” Ladd said in an interview. “I do think this something that our community, Iowa, and nurses, deserve.”

Alano De La Rosa, the principal officer for Teamsters Local 90, which includes the Des Moines area and reaches into many other Iowa counties, said nurses will be able to negotiate with the full force of the Teamsters Union behind them. This includes a $400 million national strike fund, he said.
UnityPoint is clearly worried that the union effort with nurses at the four medical centers in the Des Moines could spread to their other facilities and staffing sectors, De La Rosa said.
“I believe it would have been considered by UnityPoint when they started cutting millions of dollars in checks to union busters,” De La Rosa said.
De La Rosa said the Teamsters Union has experience representing nurses and health-care workers.
“They are very big-hearted and they want to help everybody around them,” he said.
The vote is coming two months later than originally scheduled as as the federal government shutdown forced a postponement of a vote that had been set for early October.

In total, the state on Tuesday announced $3.2 million for 18 outdoor infrastructure projects in 13 counties and three tribal communities. According to a news release, interest in the grants has been increasing, with a “record-breaking” 56 applications for the latest FY26 grants, totaling $12.6 million in requests, a 60% increase from the prior round. Of the recipients, 11 received funds for the first time.
The grants include approximately $33,000 to add a kids’ bike pump track in McKinley County via the Navajo Townsite Community Development Corporation. The new track will “support our growing Navajo mountain biking community, and provide a healthy activity to connect our youth to the outdoors,” Navajo Townsite Community Development Corporation Executive Director Prestene Garnenez said in a statement.
Also in McKinley County, the Zuni Youth Enrichment Project received just under $100,000 to renovate nine trailheads, “adding cultural and educational signage from a Zuni perspective,” and to “train a youth trail crew to strengthen connections to the Zuni Pueblo, preserve cultural heritage, and support community wellness.”
Rio Arriba County, in partnership with Pueblo de San Ildefonso, received $85,534 to hire Indigenous youth “to restore and maintain the existing trail system” surrounding Fishing Lake. 
The Rocky Mountain Youth Corps in Taos received the largest award, $500,000, to expand its Individual Placement Program and place 16 young adults in apprenticeships with the Carson, Santa Fe, Gila, and Cibola National Forests and the Valles Caldera National Preserve.
The City of Sunland Park and Grant County each received just under $500,000 to complete phase two of the Rio Grande Trail project and to upgrade the Forks Campground, respectively.
According to an EDD news release, the projects will support 105 jobs and “improve or develop” more than 700 miles of trails in communities across the state. Ten of the projects will receive $2 million from the Land of Enchantment Legacy Fund.
“New Mexicans are proud of their expansive vistas and unique outdoor spaces,” EDD Secretary Rob Black said in a statement. “Communities across New Mexico are eager to improve accessibility and provide safe and beautiful spaces for locals and visitors to get outdoors and enjoy all that New Mexico has to offer.”

A pair of northeast Florida Republicans have filed bills that would allow those health care providers and insurance companies to file lawsuits for damages, injunctive relief, and attorney fees for adverse action taken against them for exercising their medical conscience rights.
HB 551 is sponsored by Rep. Dean Black; Sen. Clay Yarborough is offering the identical Senate companion bill, SB 670.
“Well, I think in this situation, the concern is that a provider — a doctor, a nurse, a lab tech — whatever, is being compelled to perform a service that violates their conscience. … So, think, you know, being forced to perform transgender surgery or an abortion, something like that,” Black told the Florida Phoenix, adding, “Those would be two examples that would commonly jump to mind. And that’s not meant to be an exhaustive list, but those would be two things.”

Black and Yarborough both represent parts of Nassau and Duval counties. But Black said the civil enforcement provision isn’t being driven by local constituents. It’s left over from the 2023 session, when the original law was passed.
“There were lots of people that were interested in similar language before. That hasn’t stopped, and there’s a steady stream of people that are not letting that go. They still feel that there’s unfinished business there. And Sen. Yarborough and I agree,” Black said.
Existing law
The law defines “conscience-based objection” as one based on a “sincerely held religious, moral, or ethical belief.” And it says that that a health care provider “may not be discriminated against or suffer adverse action” because they declined to participate in or pay for a health care procedure.
The 2023 legislation was hotly debated and closely watched by advocates for gay, transgender, and women’s health care who worry that it gave physicians and payors legal protections to discriminate against patients. It was closely tracked by the Florida Justice Association and insurance companies, in part due to the civil enforcement provisions.
Lawmakers approve measure to allow doctors to withhold care because of ‘conscience’

As initially filed, the 2023 law would have allowed health care providers whose medical conscience rights were violated to file civil suits, as Black and Yarborough are pushing for in the coming session.
But after robust lobbying efforts, 2023 bill sponsor Rep. Joel Rudman offered an amendment to his bill deleting the civil enforcement language. Instead, the Legislature agreed to a regulatory scheme that required health care providers and insurance companies that allege their rights have been violated to file complaints with the Attorney General’s Office. If that office determines the law has been violated, the office can file a civil suit.










What we're aware of is there are people in the medical community who are concerned about not having the protections that the new bill would afford them.


– Rep. Dean Black


The law authorizes the AG’s office to take depositions; make inspections; issue and serve subpoenas; compel the attendance of witnesses; and require the production of books, papers, documents, and other evidence while investigating the complaints.
It’s not clear how many providers have filed complaints with the AG’s office, which did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for information.
Black noted the existing law permits, but doesn’t require, the AG’s office to file civil suits for substantiated complaints and described enforcement efforts to date as “nebulous.”
But Black also stressed that the legislation isn’t about Attorney General James Uthmeier’s performance. Instead, it’s about ensuring people have protections under the law, regardless of who is elected AG of Florida, he said.
‘Put the power in the hands of health care providers’
The 2026 legislation wouldn’t unravel the complaint process, delete the AG’s ability to investigate alleged violations, or strip the AG’s ability to file civil litigation. But it would allow those who filed complaints to move ahead with their own civil suits if the AG’s office hasn’t acted within six months.
“What we’re aware of is there are people in the medical community who are concerned about not having the protections that the new bill would afford them. You’re relying upon the AG, which right now the AG might really jump on that energetically if there was a violation of existing law,” Black said.
“But who’s to say who the AG would be in future years? And never mind that. We also just think it’s a good idea to put the power in the hands of the health care providers and let them avail themselves of remedies under the civil justice system,” Black said.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/02/ct-tax-cuts/,"With the next election less than 12 months away, the 2026 General Assembly session could be swamped with tax-cutting ideas from both parties.","Republicans have staunchly defended unprecedented state efforts in recent years to shrink Connecticut’s massive legacy of pension debt, even though it’s leached billions from education, health care and other core programs in the process.
But the GOP has begun to modify that stance, willing to scale back that effort if — and only if — those dollars go back to middle-class households in the form of big tax cuts.
Citing high energy costs, inflation above federal targets and Congress cutting deeply into human services, Republicans say Connecticut families need more help badly now, but not through new state programs.
And with many Democrats already renewing their push for a new child-based income tax cut and the next state election less than 12 months away, the 2026 General Assembly session could be swamped with tax-cutting ideas.
GOP: CT households must benefit directly from big surpluses
“For my constituents, it’s about over-taxation,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said during a floor debate last month. “We are seeing billions and billions of dollars flow into our coffers.”
The GOP leader was referring to the aggressive series of state budget caps that have generated unprecedented surpluses averaging more than $1.8 billion, or 8% to 9% of the General Fund, every year since 2017. About $4 billion from those bounties has been used to bolster budget reserves, but the bulk, about $10 billion, has been dedicated to whittling down the massive pension debt Connecticut amassed over seven decades prior to 2011.
The primary beneficiaries of those payments, Candelora said, involve tens of thousands of state employees, municipal teachers and retirees from those two fields.
“But what about the other 3.4 million people, the people that are telling us we can’t afford to continue to pay property taxes in the state of Connecticut?” he added. “I think we need to start looking at the people that are slipping into poverty, slipping into need, because everything in the state of Connecticut has become unaffordable.”
In late October, House Republicans called for a $700 increase in the state income tax credit that covers a portion of households’ municipal property tax bills.
With the potential to restore $500 million annually, all to the middle class, it would rival the 2023 income tax cuts ordered by Gov. Ned Lamont and the Democratic-controlled General Assembly for the most generous relief package in state history.
But it also would mean this fiscal year’s projected surplus — another big windfall projected at $2 billion — would be about 25% smaller. That means less to pay down pension debt, which still exceeds $33 billion, according to Lamont’s budget office, and isn’t projected to be eliminated until the mid-2040s.
But Candelora said Connecticut could afford a big tax cut and still make big annual inroads on its debt problem. The $10 billion in surplus funds its deposited into the pensions since 2020 were in addition to the more than $3 billion in required payments Connecticut makes annually through regular budgeting. Prior to 2020, Connecticut never had contributed surplus to its pensions.
And since Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the legislature already have diverted some funds away from surplus and into new spending, why couldn’t Republicans deflect some to cut taxes on households in need, the North Branford lawmaker added.
Lamont and Democrats dedicated $300 million from last fiscal year’s surplus to launch a new program to expand affordable child care. That initiative also has a claim on a portion of future surpluses.
And despite repeated warnings that Medicaid costs were exploding, Democrats underfunded the program by $284 million last fiscal year, effectively leaving the problem to be solved using surplus dollars.
“I think I’ve been dragged into this conversation unwillingly by the Democrats,” Candelora added.
House Republicans likely won’t be alone in supporting tax cuts.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, has “serious concerns” about redirecting any funds away from paying down a pension debt, but “if we’re going to do anything [else] with those funds … it needs to be returned to [households] in the form of tax relief.”
The GOP’s two gubernatorial contenders, former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart and state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, both agreed Connecticut can help its middle class and save diligently to reduce debt.
Given the huge budget surpluses Connecticut has reported since 2017, “it’s hard to not ask the question: Are we being overtaxed?” Stewart said.
And while she praised the bipartisan legislative effort eight years ago that helped Connecticut save more, stop tax hikes, and begin reducing debt, the former mayor added it’s still too expensive for many to live here.
“I see that every day,” she added. “Often times, both parents are working and they’re just scrounging by.”
“At some point, middle-class taxpayers are the forgotten people of Connecticut,” Fazio said, adding relief would provide an economic assist as well. “All the evidence suggests that income tax cuts spur more economic growth than other forms of tax cuts.”
Democrats have their own tax-cutting ideas
Republicans also won’t be the only ones putting tax-cut proposals on the table.
Many progressive and moderate Democrats in the General Assembly have been pushing for the past four years to create a permanent state income tax credit for low- and middle-income households with children.
The most popular plan, raised back in 2021 by then-Rep. Sean Scanlon, a Guilford Democrat who now serves as state comptroller, would provide $600 per child, up to $1,800 per household.
The United Way of Connecticut, another leader in the fight for a state child tax credit, vowed to continue the battle in September when it released its latest affordability analysis, showing a record-high 581,000 Connecticut households, about 40%, couldn’t afford a basic “survival” budget.
The United Way estimates it cost a family of four — two parents and two children — $116,000 to cover basic survival needs, including food, housing, utilities, child and health care and transportation in 2023.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said the governor “will listen to any ideas that reduce taxes, increase taxpayers and make our state a more attractive place to live and work.”
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the tax-writing Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said this week she anticipates many state tax relief proposals aimed at the middle class in the next session, especially since the GOP-led Congress focused the bulk of federal tax cuts it ordered last July on the nation’s wealthiest households.
“That creates a structure where the very wealthy are receiving a tax benefit and the middle and less privileged classes are not,” she said.
Can CT afford to cut taxes and bolster human services?
But both Horn and House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, warn frequently that any tax cuts must be sustainable. In other words, don’t promise so much relief it must be scaled back one year later if the economy slips.
And state legislators are more worried about budget stability now than perhaps any other time since they installed new caps eight years ago. That’s because Congress ordered more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other human service programs to help finance federal tax relief.
Connecticut expects to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in annual federal assistance, although the bulk of those cutbacks likely won’t take effect until 2027 or 2028.
Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden, a progressive who is challenging Lamont for the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial nomination, said many lawmakers still want to put more dollars directly into working families’ hands.
But Elliott, a founder of the legislature’s Tax Equity Caucus, added tax relief is a good tool — but not the only one — to help families.
It does a family little good to save $700 on state income taxes if Connecticut cuts municipal aid so much that same household faces an $800 increase in town property taxes.
Similarly, it state budget policies drive up community college tuition, slash rental and winter energy assistance and ignore rising health insurance costs, then tax cuts help little or not at all.
“It’s not one or the other,” Elliott said. “It seems that there’s a hypocrisy on the part of the Republicans that they are only willing to affect [costs] with tax cuts.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0128_SR_GrantPauseConference654-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 13:57:25.354131

Under federal law, when a parent or teacher refers a child for a possible disability, the district must complete an evaluation, often within a 90-day window. But the complaint, filed in the Eastern District of North Carolina, alleges the school district routinely stalled these evaluations by requiring students to first complete the “Multi-Tiered System of Support,” a schoolwide intervention program meant to help struggling students before they fall behind. MTSS is not a special education service, and federal law does not permit districts to use it to delay or deny an evaluation.
According to the complaint, the practice left children waiting months, sometimes more than a year, for assessments they were legally entitled to receive much sooner.
The lawsuit was brought by Cynthia Lee, a former teacher at Sherwood Park Elementary School, and three former second-grade students identified as R.S., D.C. and J.M. They say Cumberland County Schools unlawfully used the MTSS program as a “gatekeeper,” blocking or postponing evaluations even after parents submitted written referrals. The complaint also says the district failed to give parents required notices when it declined to move forward with an evaluation.
In a statement, Cumberland County Schools said it was aware of the lawsuit but does not comment on pending litigation. The district said it “remains committed to supporting students with disabilities and working with families in accordance with applicable state and federal law,” and is reviewing the complaint with its legal counsel.
Lee alleges she repeatedly alerted administrators that the students showed signs of disabilities and needed prompt evaluations. She says that as she continued raising concerns, school administrators became hostile.
After Lee filed a formal complaint with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction on April 30, 2025, she says she was confronted in staff meetings, publicly criticized and eventually forced to resign at the end of the school year.
According to the lawsuit, the Department of Public Instruction investigated Lee’s complaint and found that Cumberland County Schools had violated IDEA’s Child Find, which requires schools to identify and evaluate any child who may have a disability. The state described the district’s practices as “systemic.”
The complaint does not specify how the district responded to those findings.
The lawsuit also names DPI, arguing the state failed to enforce federal disability law and allowed districts, including Cumberland County, to use MTSS in ways that delayed legally required evaluations.
NCDPI said it had not yet been served with the lawsuit and could not comment.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AdobeStock_disability400.jpg,,,2025-12-02 12:57:31.525588

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The University of Alabama suspended publication of two student-run magazines on Monday, claiming that the publications were not in compliance with federal guidance on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. 
UA officials Monday evening told members of Alice, a magazine focused on female undergraduates, and Nineteen Fifty-Six, a magazine focused on Black undergraduates, that they would stop publishing, citing their interpretation of a July memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi, which makes non-binding recommendations on compliance with anti-DEI policies supported by the Trump administration.
“I was under the impression that we were protected from being affected by any anti-DEI legislation and rulings because of our First Amendment right to freedom of press, but it appears I was wrong,” Alice Magazine Editor-in-Chief Gabrielle Gunter said in a statement Tuesday.

Alex House, an associate director of communications at UA, said in a statement Tuesday the suspension of both magazines was to “ensure all members of our community feel welcome to participate in programs that receive university funding from the Office of Student Media.”
Nineteen Fifty-Six Magazine Founder Tionna Taite said in a statement Tuesday that the publications are needed at the university to highlight minority voices. 
“Truly both 1956 Magazine and Alice are pivotal to the minority experience at UA. I am beyond disappointed in the regression UA has made since I created 1956 Magazine,” Taite said. “In 2020, UA made promises to be more diverse, inclusive and equitable. Five years later, I do not see any progress and their decision regarding both magazines confirms this.”
While both publications were geared toward specific demographics, all students could apply to work for the magazines. Bondi’s memo did not include any specific guidance on student-run publications serving particular communities.
“These were spaces for marginalized students to create work that reflected their lived experiences,” Gunter said.
The news was first reported by the Crimson White, the university’s student-run newspaper.
Alice Magazine, started in 2015, was the university’s women’s magazine writing about topics including lifestyle, health and wellness. Nineteen Fifty-Six reported on the university’s Black culture and lifestyle. 
The University of Alabama has been dismantling spaces that serve marginalized communities on the campus over the last year and a half. After the Alabama Legislature passed SB 129 in March 2024, banning publicly-funded diversity, equity and inclusion programs and so-called “divisive concepts,” the university closed two dedicated spaces for the Black Student Union office and the Safe Zone, a space for LGBTQ+ students.
In a filing in a federal lawsuit over SB 129 this summer, attorneys for UA claimed that reopening the spaces would constitute “unlawful discrimination,“ citing the Bondi memo. Attorneys for students and educators challenging SB 129 rejected the assertion, noting the Bondi memo was non-binding and that the spaces were open to all students, regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation.
Marie McMullan, the leader of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) Student Press Freedom Initiative said the organization is currently investigating the incident, calling it “deeply concerning” and “a blow to the student press in Tuscaloosa.”
“The university’s decisions must respect the First Amendment rights of student publications like Alice and Nineteen Fifty-Six,” McMullan said in a statement Tuesday.
A petition was started on MoveOn to reinstate both magazines saying the suspension is “a direct attack on free speech on a college campus and must be combated by all students.” As of late Tuesday morning, it had over 900 signatures.

Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn, introduces his congressional redistricting bill during committee on Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The author of Indiana’s new congressional redistricting bill acknowledged the maps are “politically gerrymandered” during committee questioning Tuesday but defended the proposal against accusations of illegal racial gerrymandering.
The maps, released Monday morning, were drawn “purely for political performance” of Republicans, Rep. Ben Smaltz told indignant Democratic colleagues.
The current districts, drawn by the GOP in 2021, are 7-2 in favor of Republicans. The House and Senate GOP worked with the National Republican Redistricting Trust to engineer a likely 9-0 sweep of the districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.
“They’re politically gerrymandered, if you’d like to say that,” Smaltz, R-Auburn, said.
He was adamant that no racial information was used in crafting House Bill 1032.

The targeted districts now held by Democratic Reps. André Carson and Frank Mrvan are by far Indiana’s most racially diverse. The maps split Carson’s district, which largely overlaps Marion County borders, four ways, and halves Mrvan’s.
“You’re okay with … racially gerrymandered maps if you get your desired outcome for … politically gerrymandered maps?” asked Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis.
“We didn’t look at that, at any of that,” Smaltz replied.
He faced more than an hour of intense questioning from Democrats on the House Elections and Apportionment Committee on Tuesday, which also featured ominous testimony from Marion County’s elections chief and a prominent Republican.
It was the House’s only hearing on the maps, held with less than a day of notice. A committee vote is expected sometime today.
‘Chaos’ incoming, clerk says
Local election officials typically have a year before an election to make redistricting-related adjustments, Marion County Clerk Kate Sweeney Bell told the committee.
If approved next week as planned, clerks would have a matter of months before the May 5 primary election.
She detailed the complex updates required to reassign the likely hundreds of thousands of impacted Indianapolis voters, retrain thousands of poll workers, update public communications and more — all on a smaller budget.
Precinct splits backed into the bill present further “administrative burden.”
“If any of this is done incorrectly, voters are going to feel the impact when they come to vote,” the clerk said.
She urged lawmakers to reject the proposal, adding, “If it passes, there will be chaos. Chaos in clerk’s offices around the state. Chaos when candidates file at the election board. … That’s exactly what election administrators want to avoid.”
More than 20 witnesses spoke in opposition to the proposal by mid-day, including retired Ivy Tech Community College Sue Ellspermann. The Republican previously served as lieutenant governor under former Gov. Mike Pence, and as a House lawmaker.
“We have fair maps. The ones we have performed — some might say over-performed — for the Republican majority,” she said. “The plea to redraw Indiana’s map is coming out of Washington, D.C. Some may argue that they have the right to ask, and in that case, we certainly have the right to answer, ‘No.'”

She reminded lawmakers — including former colleagues amid 2011 redistricting — that they pledged to “serve all Hoosiers, not just those who voted for us or the current president” in their oath of office.
Hoosiers “have a reputation for standing up to political pressure,” Ellspermann added, lauding Pence for his refusal to overturn the 2020 election.
Just two witnesses had spoken in favor of the maps by midday: Paul Logemann, an Indiana resident and lobbyist with D.C.-based Heritage Action and Indianapolis resident Nathan Roberts.
Logemann pushed legislators to advance the maps, saying they “reflect the will of Hoosiers and ensure that Hoosier voices are not diluted in Congress.”
California, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Utah have already heeded — or countered — President Donald Trump’s call for more GOP U.S. House seats.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Federal funds previously held up in the government shutdown are now available to help Mainers heat their homes. 
On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins announced that nearly $40 million is now available to help low-income Mainers, seniors and tribal members in the state afford their energy bills this winter. More than $1.4 million of that is allocated specifically for the Indian Township and Pleasant Point Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, Maliseet and Mi’kmaq tribes.
The money is part of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Republicans, like Collins, and Democrats in Congress have been urging for these dollars to be made quickly available after the government reopened in late November. 
“LIHEAP funding provides vital relief to thousands of Mainers, helping them avoid the constant worry of having to choose between heating their homes and covering other basic necessities,” Collins said in a news release Tuesday. 
Home heating costs are estimated to rise on average nearly 8% compared to last winter, according to national forecasts. Costs for heating with electricity are expected to increase even more, with estimates at about 10% higher than last year.
Golden pushes for quick release of heating assistance delayed by shutdown

U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat who represents Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, recently signed onto a letter asking Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to distribute the funds by Nov. 30. Bipartisan senators, including Collins and independent Sen. Angus King, similarly sent a letter to HHS last month calling for the assistance to be released.
States usually receive LIHEAP allocations in early November to help roughly 6 million Americans, including 45,000 Mainers, heat their homes, but this year’s money was delayed because of the government shutdown that proved to be the longest in history. 
The Maine State Housing Authority came up with a temporary solution after it was made clear states would not receive LIHEAP funding on the usual timeline, using leftover funds from two other programs to avoid heating emergencies. However, they knew it wouldn’t be a long-term fix.
LIHEAP eligibility is based on income, family size and the availability of resources. Maine residents can apply here.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5053-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-02 12:57:31.525588

The Senate has consistently resisted the idea. (Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)A measure (HB 133) that would lower the age to purchase a long gun in Florida from 21 to 18 years old passed its second and final committee in the state House on Tuesday and will hit the floor when the 2026 session opens, where for the fourth year in a row it is expected to pass in the GOP-controlled chamber.
However, a companion bill in the Senate has yet to been filed, putting the measure in jeopardy of failure. A similar situation has played out durin the past three legislative sessions, with the measure passing the House and dying in the Senate.
The proposal is sponsored by Rep. Tyler Sirois, R-Brevard County.
The majority of public speakers who came before the House Judiciary Committee opposed the measure, many of them students who invoked the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. That incident, which killed 17 students and instructors, led to the raising the age to purchase a long gun to 21 as part of a larger comprehensive gun safety package signed into law by Republican Gov. Rick Scott.
“Allowing teenagers to buy high-powered weapons and carry them without a permit in a state without permitless carry is not freedom,” said Jacob Lombardo, a senior at the University of Central Florida. “It is a threat to every student and every family in this great state.”
The only proponents of the measure were individuals representing Second Amendment organizations.
“Right now in Florida, 18- to 20-year-olds can legally carry a firearm. They can even open-carry a firearm. But they cannot legally purchase one,” said Jed Carroll of Gun Owners of America. “That means their right to self-defense exists only if someone else buys the firearm for them. And let’s be honest — that only works for young adults that come from families with the means to provide it.”

There have been 234 reported cases of influenza this season, which generally runs from fall through winter. Those cases have resulted in six hospitalizations.
“In Missoula County and nationwide, hospitalization rates are increasing for respiratory illnesses, including the flu and COVID-19,” a press release said. “Getting vaccinated remains the best tool along with basic prevention measures to protect everyone in the community from respiratory illnesses.”
Flu symptoms include high fever, chills, headaches, exhaustion, sore throat, cough and body aches. It can take several days after being exposed to the virus for symptoms to develop. Additionally, flu can spread one day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick.
Health officials are also tracking clusters and moving forward with their disease surveillance programs. 
“The Montana Public Health Laboratory is ramping up influenza surveillance to track statewide activity, circulating strains, and antiviral resistance,” a DPHHS press release stated. “This year’s program mirrors last season, with 14 hospital labs submitting two specimens weekly and 33 additional labs receiving fee-waived tests for confirmation.”
Health officials are encouraging everyday precautions to stop the spread of influenza including:

Getting vaccinated.
Wearing a mask if you are sick and need to go out in public.
Covering your nose and mouth with a tissue or your elbow when you cough or sneeze.
Washing hands often with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.
Staying home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone, unless you medical care or necessities.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1463564287-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 12:57:31.525588

Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr., the son of a prominent family from Grenada, pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder and evidence tampering for hiding Lee’s body in a wooded gully in Carroll County near his parents’ home. 
Lafayette County Circuit Judge Kelly Luther accepted the prosecution’s recommendation for Herrington to receive a total sentence of 40 years to serve with an additional 10 years of post-release supervision.
Lee’s family, friends, Oxford police officers and even some university officials attended the sentencing hearing Tuesday. Herrington’s parents also sat in the audience, his side of the courtroom more populated than during the first trial.
Before Luther handed down the sentence, Lee’s father, Jimmie Lee Sr., addressed the court. Stephanie Lee stood behind him. The parents have rarely spoken publicly throughout the process. Jimmie Lee Sr. said he was a “broken father” and he reminded Herrington that Lee had trusted him.

“I’m here to give a message and just let Herrington know,” the father and pastor said. “Hell will put you in order. Heaven will put you out.”
Jimmie Lee reminded him of God’s redemptive plan: “You don’t have to go to hell.”
The father said he knew from the beginning that Herrington killed his son. He prayed for healing. He said his family has been living July 8, 2022 — the day Lee went missing — since that day.
“I had to witness my son’s skeletal remains. I touched his skull,” he said. “No father should have to go through that. No parent should have to go through that.”
When Judge Luther spoke, he praised the handling of the case.
“Mississippi got it right in this case. This case was investigated more thoroughly than any other case I have dealt with in my 35 years in this criminal justice system. It was defended … as well as any case I have dealt with in my 35 years. Everybody did their job,” he said.
Herrington did not speak at the hearing. His attorney, Aafram Sellers, said Herrington did not tell him why he killed Lee. The plea was ultimately Herrington’s decision, Sellers said, adding that redemption “starts with accepting responsibility.”
“We don’t see our lives going down these paths and that is what happened,” Sellers said. “… Both families have to go through that grieving process.”
The prosecution said it had not expected a plea deal. It came Monday as the court was selecting jurors in Madison County due to a concern that it would not be possible to seat an unbiased jury from Lafayette County. 
The first trial in 2024 ended in a mistrial. Action News 5 reported that one of the 12 jurors refused to convict Herrington because of the absence of Lee’s body. 
Earlier this year, Lee’s remains were found in a dumping ground in Carroll County. Prosecutors then indicted Herrington a second time.
Lee’s disappearance sparked a movement in Oxford called “Justice for Jay Lee.” His friends held protests outside the courthouse, tailgated at football games and ran a social media page.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia MercuryAs Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger prepares to take the helm of the state of Virginia, she has announced her pick for the next secretary of health and human resources: Marvin Figueroa. 
A veteran senior official of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Figueroa previously served as the Deputy HHS secretary under former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. Figueroa was also a health policy advisor to U.S. Sen. Mark Warner and helped craft the CHRONIC Care Act — a 2018 law that bolstered Medicare coverage of services for people with chronic conditions. Most recently, Figueroa was vice president at BGR Group, a bipartisan lobbying and communications firm in D.C. 
The state’s HHR secretary oversees a dozen state agencies — to include the Departments of Health, Social Services and Medical Assistance Services. The role is paramount to helping gubernatorial administrations carry out their agendas regarding public health. 
“As Governor, I am committed to making sure our neighbors have access to safe, reliable healthcare and are served by leaders who are ready to tackle the tough challenges ahead,” Spanberger said in a statement. “I know that Mr. Figueroa will always put the health and safety of Virginians first — and I look forward to working alongside him to deliver affordable, accessible care for every Virginian.”
Spanberger’s administration and state lawmakers will have to navigate a shifting national landscape of federal health funding along with forthcoming changes to Medicaid eligibility and hospital funding mechanisms in the years ahead. Outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin had already reserved some of the state’s budget surplus as “cushion” earlier this year to cover some of the funding gaps created by Congress and President Donald Trump’s actions. For instance, the reconciliation bill passed this summer, for the first time, shifts financial responsibility for several public health programs to states.
“The challenges are real. Families are feeling the strain of rising costs, uneven access to care, and systems that are too often hard to navigate,” Figueroa said in a statement. “I share the Governor-elect’s commitment to meet these issues with the urgency Virginians deserve. I am ready to work with the General Assembly, our agencies, and partners across the Commonwealth to strengthen the systems communities rely on and to deliver progress people can feel in their daily lives.”
More access, less cost: Spanberger lays out health care plans if she wins Virginia governorship

Addressing health care affordability and access issues was a pillar of Spanberger’s campaign for governor. She pledged support for a forthcoming reform to create a single state-contracted pharmacy benefit manager position to handle Medicaid in Virginia. The move, supporters say, would improve accountability, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat. 
Other public health changes that could be on the horizon under Spanberger’s administration include creating a statewide hospital price transparency comparison tool to help people weigh options for treatments and drugs. She may collaborate with Attorney General-elect Jay Jones on consumer protection laws, and a push for Virginia’s pharmaceutical manufacturing industry to ramp up generic drug production. 
Spanberger also said earlier this year that Virginia’s network of free and charitable clinics can count on her support for funding boosts in coming budget cycles. As shifting federal policy can cause thousands of Virginians to lose their health insurance, clinics have been bracing for increased needs in their local communities.

Sensory exercises like this are often used in special education classrooms. (Getty Images)Tuesday marks fifty years since the Individual with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, was signed into law by President Gerald Ford, and education advocates and parents of children with disabilities are saying that the support provided in Michigan is not enough. 
Elizabeth Wilson Fischer, the mother of three young children with autism, two of whom also have ADHD, pulled her two oldest children out of their public school in Forest Hills, just outside of Grand Rapids, after receiving what she described as inadequate support, including refusal from school administrators to provide needed accommodations like 504 plans, which are established sets of instructions to teachers and school administrators to assist students with disabilities. 
The situation became traumatic, she said, especially for her oldest son, Francis. 
“I was dragging him into school. He wasn’t making friends. He was having conflict at recess or at school, so his self confidence and self worth started deteriorating,” she said. “He’d come home and we would just be managing meltdowns, basically because he was so upset and distraught and stressed out from school.”
Even though his individual teachers were generally supportive of his accommodations, without more formal support structures from administrators, the situation became too severe. Now, both of Fischer’s older children attend a private, nontraditional school in their area — meaning that the family has to pay tuition costs as well.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I would love to have seen some more proactive measures being put into place, because really, they wait for the kids to struggle before they come in and help,” Fischer said of the public school system. 
Stories like Francis’s are not rare in Michigan, according to a report submitted to state legislators at the end of October that detailed the issues that the state faces in funding for special education. 










Our current system is inadequate, inequitable, and too often creates disincentives for schools to provide needed services to students with disabilities.


– David Arsen, a professor emeritus of education policy and educational administration at Michigan State University


That report, the Michigan Special Education Finance Reform Blueprint, explains that though the number of students with disabilities is now nearly 15% of Michigan’s public school population, their educational outcomes are lacking. Less than 60% of those students graduate on time, and nearly 14% drop out of high school. 
“Special education funding is among the most important and pressing areas in need of reform. Our current system is inadequate, inequitable, and too often creates disincentives for schools to provide needed services to students with disabilities,” David Arsen, a professor emeritus of education policy and educational administration at Michigan State University, writes in the report’s foreword. “In most cases, students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) represent a net financial loss to their schools, with the financial burden increasing as student needs grow more complex.”
As the system stands in Michigan, school districts have to submit special education expense reports to the state, who will reimburse a portion of the expenses — just over 28% for operational costs and around 70% for specialized transportation costs. 
It also notes that under the current system, local property taxes and wealth determine how much money a school has for special education, “resulting in underfunding for lower-wealth districts and compelling schools to allocate general fund dollars to meet mandated services.” 
But even in wealthier towns and districts, support is lacking. In Forest Hills, where the Fischers live, the median income is over $156,000, according to Census Bureau data, around double the median income of the state overall. And for most families, the cost to send students to specialized or nontraditional private schools would be too high for it to be a reasonable option, often totalling thousands of dollars per year.
Federal funding is also lacking — the National Education Association explains that when the Individual with Disabilities Education Act was passed, federal funding was supposed to cover 40% of the average per pupil cost for special education. Nationally, that number is less than 12%, and in Michigan, the funding gap is over $919 million. 
Instead, the Blueprint report advocates for what is known as a Weighted Student Funding formula, where students who need higher levels of support in special education have higher funding levels allocated to their districts. The system would build on Michigan’s per-pupil allowances, which are appropriated each year in the budget — in fiscal year 2026, that number stands at $10,050. The proposed system would add money in four tiers, increasing the per-pupil allowance for students with special education needs by a certain weight depending on the needs of the student. 
Fischer emphasized that these supports are necessary for students with disabilities, like her children, to succeed in school — as well as to allow other students and teachers to be able to have a classroom environment conducive to learning. 
“Parents aren’t looking for 504s for fun for their medically diagnosed ADHD, autistic children. They were born 30 steps back,” she said. “This isn’t a leg up.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1088179758-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 11:58:35.915865

One of them is North Stonington, Connecticut.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Laura Tillman to discuss her article, “A chemist, a chef and an author craft soy sauce on the CT coast,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Laura’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Laura, you were intrigued when you found out that Moromi soy sauce is manufactured in North Stonington, Connecticut. How did you find that out?
LT: I think I was just doing some reading. I wrote a story last year about chef Jacques Pepin. And I’m always really interested in what’s going on in food. I had spent a number of years before this working on a book about a chef, so that’s just a topic that I’m interested in. I think I was kind of on the hunt for another interesting, quirky kind of food story based in Connecticut.
WSHU: And so you come across this sauce, and then how do you go about telling the story? Because Bob Florence seems like a fantastic character.
LT: Yeah, he’s done a number of interviews. So I read up on, you know, what he had discussed about this journey. And then I got to go to the Moromi brewery. The factories making soy sauce are referred to as breweries. I came to learn and interviewed him there, and got to sample some of the different Moromi products. And yeah, he has had an amazingly interesting journey up to this point. I think in a lot of ways, when you hear what his story is, it makes total sense that he’s making soy sauce now. But he, you know, started out in industrial plastics, selling these plastics, having lived in Detroit and working for the car manufacturing industry at a time when manufacturers were replacing a lot of these kinds of clunky, heavy metal parts in cars with plastics to improve mileage. And so he ended up doing a lot of business in Japan and his career, and because of that,he went to Japan, ate a lot of great food in Japan, learned about soy sauce, which in Japan is shoyu. And then, you know, many years later, after he had moved to Mystic, he started thinking about another business idea and also a hobby of making his own soy sauce at home.
WSHU: But before he got to the soy sauce, he had another project that he had worked on; trying to make fuel, right?
LT: Yeah, fuel from algae through a fermentation process, and that project was scientifically successful, but it didn’t end up being a profitable business at the time. So that kind of linked his experience with manufacturing, his experience with chemistry, and his experience with fermentation altogether, which are kind of like these key elements to having a successful time making soy sauce and manufacturing it.
WSHU: Now, tell us a little bit about soy sauce. What is it?
LT: So there’s a process by which this mold called koji is added to soy beans and to wheat, or it could also be rye berries, and the mold kind of eats at these ingredients and then ferments. And so that mash of ingredients, once the koji has had time to inoculate the soybeans and the wheat are put into barrels in a mash, and that mash starts to ferment, and it’s kind of producing this kind of slow motion Maillard reaction, which is the same process when you’re cooking and heating something, and basically, proteins and sugars are being heated. So over time, you know. It creates this substance that really kind of lights up your mouth when you’re eating it. Through this other partner in the business, James Wayman, who’s a chef based on the Connecticut coast, I learned a little about his experience with koji and with soy sauce and kind of how he views it as a really critical component to taking his food to the next level.
WSHU: Now, James Wayman is another person involved in this, and he happens to be a chef.
LT: Yes, so James was when he met Bob Florence, he was the head chef at Oyster Club, the acclaimed restaurant, and then he ended up separating off and founding Nana’s, which has locations in Mystic and Westerly, Rhode Island. And Nana’s is kind of an all-day cafe. They call it a bakery. They also have pizza, rotisserie chicken, and specials. So there’s a lot going on in their menu. And when Bob Florence and James Wayman met, Bob Florence asked James Wayman to just try the soy sauce that he was making. I think for him, it was kind of like, you know, he was making this thing as a pet project, but it would mean a lot to him to have a chef like James taste it and just give him his thoughts. And immediately, James Wayman put it on the menu at the Oyster Club and called it Bob Florence soy sauce. And at the time, you know, it takes about a year to brew one of these barrels of soy sauce.
WSHU: Wow, that’s long.
LT: Yeah. So for Bob Florence, he wasn’t kind of ready to scale up that quickly. He was like, Do I really have enough of this stuff to be putting it on a menu of a restaurant? But over time, they decided to go into business together to make this together.
WSHU: Now, tell us about the third person in this story, Debbi Florence.
LT: So Debbie is Bob Florence’s wife. She is a Japanese American children’s book author, and so she has also written some great children’s books about Japanese food, specifically a picture book biography of a Michelin-starred chef named Nikki Nakayama. But yeah, so the three of them went into this business together.
WSHU: Now the Moromi brand can be found in restaurants across the country.
LT: Yeah, and you can also buy it on their website. You can also go to Nana’s and buy it, and a number of other places carry it in the Mystic area, restaurants, and other gourmet shops.
WSHU: This is really a specialty item.
LT: Yeah, I will say, since I visited, I bought a bottle of it, and I have started using it. My kids have very expensive tastes, as their favorite food is sushi. Once in a while, we get sushi, and we’ll use the Moromi soy sauce. And I really do think that it adds complexity and, really, it adds to the experience of eating something like that.
WSHU: Well, it’s fascinating how these things happen. And one of the few manufacturers of soy sauce in the U.S. is located right here in Connecticut.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1010_SR_NanasMystic_063-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Tom Witt said he began fielding calls about 15 minutes after Kansas Reflector published a story on Democratic Sen. Mary Ware’s retirement from the Legislature.
Witt, best known as a former executive director of Equality Kansas, walked away from the Statehouse in 2022 after 18 years of fiercely guarding LGBTQ+ rights. He has remained off the radar and wasn’t interested in returning to the public stage — “Oh, hell no,” he said in an interview — but the calls kept coming.
“At first,” he said, “I was telling people, ‘You’re out of your minds. I’m not interested in doing this.’ Just because, reflexively, my answer for the past three years, when people have asked me if I want to get back in, in one way or another, my reflexive answer has been, “No, I’m retired — and quit asking.”
But, he added, “some very serious people in Democratic politics” told him he should join the list of candidates to become Ware’s successor.
Democratic precinct committee members on Thursday will choose Ware’s replacement for the Wichita seat. Rep. Silas Miller is another candidate. Neither Miller nor former Wichita Mayor Brandon Whipple, who is considered by political observers to be another possibility, returned a call from Kansas Reflector seeking comment for this story.
Witt has lived in the Senate district for more than 30 years and worked on campaigns for Ware and other Democrats from the area who were elected to the state House and Senate.
He said his knowledge of the district, experience with the legislative process and willingness to speak up, loudly, make him a strong candidate for the seat.
There won’t be a learning curve, he said.
“I know my way in and out,” Witt said. “I know every rule, procedure, process, custom. I probably know more about how to work in the Senate than a lot of the newer senators do.”
“Where people will have a really mixed opinion on whether I should be in this seat or not: I’m not known for my silence,” he added. “I have strong opinions, and I am very happy to share them with any legislator, whether they’re on my side or they’re an opponent. I’m not going to hold back. And there’s a lot of people that think we need more of that in the Senate Democratic caucus.”
If chosen for the position, Witt said, his top issues would be protecting public education, tax fairness, and supporting rural hospitals and family farms.
“I’m known for LGBT advocacy,” he said. “It just goes with my territory here. But that’s not going to be my sole focus. It can’t be my sole focus. There’s 75,000 people in this district, and they all deserve representation.”
He is also concerned with firearm safety.
Witt said that while he carries a concealed firearm himself, “I also think that anybody who carries a firearm outside their home needs to be vetted and trained and permitted.”
Miller is serving his second term in the House, where he is the ranking Democrat on the Federal and State Affairs Committee. He announced his interest in Ware’s seat through a post on his campaign Facebook page.
“I’ve loved my time serving in the Kansas House and getting to know Sen. Ware both as a colleague and a human,” Miller wrote. “She is a fantastic person and I know that she has big shoes to fill.
“After a lot of contemplation, I’ve decided to announce that I intend to seek the nomination to represent Senate District 25 at the upcoming convention.”
Ware announced her retirement Nov. 13 and didn’t state a reason. She was appointed to the position after former Sen.

The board assessed each applicant on their proposed casino’s economic benefit, job creation, diversity initiatives, and impact to the local community. Each of the three casinos has estimated billions of dollars in revenue, and the state is hoping it will boost its own coffers. The state has already factored an estimated $2 billion in revenue from the projects into the MTA’s budget through 2029. 
“The board’s decision was constrained by the specific criteria of the legislative study… in response to a vote of the people of New York State to support the licensure of the casino gambling in the state,” said board chair Vicki L. Been. “Within that framework, the board took very seriously, both concerns and the hopes of those who commented on the proposals.”

The casino race originally began with eight players, but only half remained after eight separate Community Advisory Committees — panels evaluating local support — killed some bids. MGM Yonkers in Westchester also unexpectedly withdrew its application to renovate and expand Empire State Casino, prompting Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano to call on Gov. Kathy Hochul to launch an investigation into the sudden drop out. 
The gambling industry has been vying to break into the New York City market for decades. In 2013, voters approved a constitutional amendment allowing seven casino licenses statewide. The text of the amendment also issued a ten-year moratorium on downstate licenses so upstate casinos could establish themselves before encountering competition from downstate casinos. 
One of the winners in Monday’s decision, Bally’s Corporation, plans to build a 500,000-square-foot casino at Ferry Point in Throggs Neck. The project includes a 500-room hotel, a 2,000-person event center and two parking garages with 4,660 spaces. As part of Bally’s purchase agreement for the site, the Trump Organization — the former operator of Trump Links golf course — is slated to receive $115 million from the deal. 
“Our team has worked closely with community leaders, union partners, and local stakeholders to build a project that delivers real jobs, lasting economic benefits, and a world-class entertainment destination for the Bronx,” said Bally’s spokesperson Lauren Westerfield in a statement. “We are grateful for the board’s confidence and look forward to working with the Gaming Commission as the process moves to its next phase.”  
In Queens, the Metropolitan Park project would transform a 50-acre lot near Citi Field into a resort with 286,208 square-feet of gaming space, an entertainment venue, multiple restaurants, a convention center, hotel and retail. Backed by Mets owner and hedge fund manager Steve Cohen and Hard Rock International, the developers pledged $1.75 billion in community investments including park space and income-restricted housing.
Following the announcement of the recommendations, protests erupted from the crowd by a Flushing group organizing against the Metropolitan Park project.
“After years of community engagement and support, Metropolitan Park is one step closer to becoming a reality,” said Karl Rickett, a spokesperson for Metropolitan Park. “Following a fair, transparent and rigorous process, the Gaming Facility Location Board has validated the positive economic impact this project will have with billions of dollars in tax revenue, 23,000 union jobs, and over $1 billion in community benefits.”
Outside the Graduate Center, members of the coalition against the Metropolitan Park casino protested the Gaming Facility Location Board’s vote for what they perceived as a lack of community involvement in the licensure process. The Community Advisory Committee established local support for the casinos, but Sarah Ahn from the Flushing Workers Center, said that “the process was corrupt.” Ahn also said that community members delivered a list of grievances regarding the project to the committee before they ultimately voted to approve the proposal and felt “disenfranchised” by the process.
“Governor Hochul’s Gaming Commission is giving the green light for Steve Cohen to  squeeze hard earned wages from our immigrant communities at a time when affordability is the key issue in our city. This casino will tear apart families, create gambling addiction, and increase crime and displacement,” the coalition said in a statement. “The tax revenue collected will come at the cost of the most vulnerable people in our community.”
The last license would go to Resorts World, which already operates the city’s lone, current gaming facility. Its 5.6 million-square-foot expansion plan will bring 6,000 slot machines, 800 gaming tables, 2,000 hotel rooms, a 7,000-seat arena, over 7,000 parking spaces, over 30 dining outlets and over a dozen acres of community green space to southeast Queens. The Genting Group, the Malaysian hospitality group that owns it, expects between $3.3 and $4.6 billion in revenue for 2031. 
“Resorts World New York City’s journey to this historic moment represents more than 15 years of work to generate jobs, revenue and opportunities for our neighbors,” said Robert DeSalvio, President of Genting Americas East. “Resorts World New York City’s $7.5 billion proposal is the only bid that can expand operations in just 90 days, generating billions in new revenue for mass transit and public education over the next four years.”
What Happens Next?
While the Gaming Facility Location Board issues the final decisions on the applications, it is up to the State Gaming Commission to issue the casino licenses by the end of the year. The commission will assess whether applicants are financially sound and capable of responsibly operating a casino, including paying the $500 million application fee, securing land, investing $500 million in the local community, and addressing issues such as problem gambling and community impact.
The Gaming Commission will also be responsible for ensuring that the casino winners remain committed to the community investments outlined in their proposal as a part of their licensing agreement. 
Winners must also place a deposit of 5 to 10% of the project’s total investment with the state.
While the lengthy approval process is almost over, it will take another few years until the winners will have their casinos up and running. Bally’s and Metropolitan Park expect to open their doors in 2030, while Resort Worlds will finish the first phase of their expansion by 2026, and the second in 2030. 
Bally’s projects an annual revenue of $1.2 billion in economic output, including $370 million in state and local tax revenue. According to the Metropolitan Park team, their proposal would reap the most annual revenue with $3.9 billion by their third year, and $850 million in taxes. 
The State Gaming Commission is expected to award the final licenses by December 31.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NYC-casino.jpg,,,2025-12-02 11:58:35.915865

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)HAMILTON — With overwhelming support, Ravalli County Commissioners voted unanimously Monday to oppose the placement of the Sheep Creek mining “exploration” project on a federal track designed to improve permitting efficiency.
More than 500 members of the Bitterroot Valley turned up at the Ravalli County Fairgrounds Event Center for the midday meeting, and no member of the public expressed support for the project, to conduct preliminary gallium and heavy “rare earth element” mining to see if a full-scale operation is feasible.

The materials are used in everyday items such as automobiles and cellphones.
The project would take place near the headwaters of the Bitterroot River and in an area with elk, wolverines, Canada lynx, sometimes grizzly bears, and native fish, including westslope cutthroat trout, listed by Fish, Wildlife and Parks as a “fish of special concern.”
Some members of the public asked commissioners to oppose the project altogether.
On behalf of U.S. Critical Materials, Scott Osterman told commissioners and members of the public the work was important to national security and ensuring China didn’t have a stranglehold on material needed for U.S. defense.
Osterman, former head of the Department of Commerce, and another mine representative said the project would use new methods and be environmentally “benign,” although Osterman disputed the area was “pristine.” He apologized for staying mum about the project for so long.
However, members of the public said the headwaters of the Bitterroot River in a closed basin where water is already overallocated is no place for a mine, no place for the substantial truck traffic, and no place for experimenting with new mining technology.
They also raised questions about the corporate structure of U.S. Critical Minerals and its relationship with “shell companies,” as did Commissioner Greg Chilcott, who said shell games make him nervous.
“I don’t want to pick the wrong walnut shell,” Chilcott said.
During public comment, Tom Powers, who described himself as one of the sole surviving members of the original class action suit brought in Libby over asbestos poisoning, said he never worked in the mine there, but he has asbestosis.
Powers said he worked in public buildings, and he worked on the Kootenai River when trucks pulled asbestos across the top of the river, unbeknownst to him.
Powers and many community members were diagnosed with a chronic lung disease, one with symptoms that often don’t appear for years after exposure, and Powers asked commissioners to consider the aftermath of a mine.
“Don’t let this happen here,” Powers said.
Tuesday, commissioners plan to sign a letter to the Congressional delegation and Gov. Greg Gianforte announcing their opposition to the placement of the Sheep Creek project on the federal FAST-41 permitting list.
FAST stands for Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, and Osterman said the acronym incorrectly implies projects are on a “fast track.”
The federal website that describes the FAST-41 permitting council, created under Title 41 of the Act, said it aims to “improve the efficiency of the permitting process for critical infrastructure projects.”
Commission Chairman Dan Huls said he wasn’t sure how the project landed on that list, but the commission learned about it a couple of weeks earlier, he believes from a member of the Congressional delegation.
Commissioner Chilcott said he generally appreciates the idea the federal government could move more quickly, especially when it comes to forest projects in the area, but he does not want a process that cuts out local participation.
After the presentation from U.S. Critical Materials, Commissioner Jeff Burrows grilled the mine representatives, and he said they not only kept the community in the dark, they also didn’t reach out to Ravalli County Commissioners in a timely fashion.
Commissioners are responsible for public safety and health, including roads, he said, but roads already are in disrepair, and Ravalli County does not have a budget to accommodate the significant infrastructure demands of the project.
“If you start talking somewhere between 30 and 5,000 trucks per week coming out of the West Fork, we can’t afford that,” Burrows said. “ … I’m a little disappointed that we haven’t been reached out to earlier, (and) that now, we’re looking at going on the ‘fast track’ program.”

The mine representatives gave varying estimates for truck traffic during the exploratory phase, from “maybe” one to three two-ton trucks a day, “relatively minimal” during the first year, to “potentially more” the second year.
They said the project would ramp up, all under the permitting process, although it was hard to estimate a truck count at full-scale production, should that take place. Osterman said the company would help build roads and bridges if it moved into that phase.
He said even in the early stages, the project would bring 40 to 50 jobs to the Darby area, and average salaries for mining jobs are $85,000 to $135,000 a year, which he described as “significant” economic development.
Members of the public, however, said tourism is the new economy, and the mine posed a risk to tourism, recreation, even property values, and they pointed to different values.
Katelynn Rennaker, who owns the Bitterrooter, a vintage clothing boutique in Stevensville, opted to keep her shop closed on Monday, to lose money, in order to attend the meeting and ask commissioners to withdraw all support for the mine, especially “fast tracking” it.
“This felt way, way more important,” Rennaker said.
Phil Ramsey, general manager with MPG Ranch, and Heather Barber, director of the Bitterroot Water Partnership, gave rebuttal testimony to the mine company’s presentation, and Barber said she had never seen as many people in attendance at the fairgrounds before.
Ramsey said the companies interested in mining in the Bitterroot had been prospecting the headwaters since 2022, but they had opened no local office, offered no regular briefing, and made no full data releases.
“Trust is earned through documents and relationships, not slogans,” Ramsey said.
He said if the company was serious about earning the community’s trust, it would remove itself from the FAST-41 list, although Osterman declined to do so when a commissioner asked. Ramsey also said the company representatives told one story to the public about the scope of the mine, but another to potential investors, with “major discrepancies.”
Barber too said she had seen no meaningful engagement from the mine representatives, despite an executive recently stating permits were expected in time for production in 2026. She said the valley already faces mounting pressures from more water users and hotter summers, and the mine proposal puts the river and local economy at risk.
Tourists spent $7.5 million on guiding services alone in the Bitterroot Valley in 2023, the fishery and tourism economy bring $67 million a year to the valley, and the tourism economy is growing, Barber said.
“It’s a significantly larger portion of the economy than 40 to 50 jobs may create,” Barber said.
She said the mine representatives see a geographic anomaly in the Bitterroot that could be lucrative, but the Bitterroot is a home, and one not worth risking to people who value public lands, healthy rivers, hunting, fishing, floating, bird watching, farming, ranching, and local businesses and families.
“We’re lucky to live, work and play here, and people from around the world visit to see something that is increasingly rare, a vibrant valley sustained by a healthy river running through its heart,” Barber said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Line-for-rcc-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-02 11:58:35.915865

Monday the flag was raised over the Mississippi Governor’s Mansion by three members of the U.S. Air Force after remarks from Gov. Tate Reeves and First Lady Elee Reeves. 
“The United States flag reminds us that our history, though marked by struggle, sacrifice and great challenges, has always been defined by perseverance,” said Reeves before the flag was raised on the overcast, brisk day in downtown Jackson.
Elee Reeves, who is also a co-chair of the America250 Mississippi Commission, said “The American flag serves as a beacon of hope for those chasing the American dream, a blessing to the families welcoming their loved ones home from service and a reminder of the values we teach our children.”
The America250 Mississippi Commission will hold various events next year as part of the country’s 250th anniversary celebration.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Homeland Security)The Hoosier congressional delegation — in a push led by U.S. Senator Todd Young — is urging the Federal Aviation Administration to name Indiana as one of two new national drone test sites.
In a Monday letter to the federal agency, all nine of Indiana’s representatives and both senators expressed support for a bid from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation and the Applied Research Institute as the FAA expands its Unmanned Aircraft System Test Site program.
If selected, Indiana supporters say the designation would open opportunities for universities and manufacturers in the state to develop cutting-edge drone technologies.
“Indiana is uniquely situated to best assist the FAA in integrating UAS into the national airspace system as well as advance the United States’ capacities for manufacturing and deploying drone technologies,” the delegation told FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford, who previously served as the chief executive of Indianapolis-based Republic Airways Holdings until he was tapped by President Donald Trump earlier this year to serve as FAA administrator.
Story continues below.
Indiana Delegation Letter in Support of FAA UAS Test Site
 
Lawmakers added that, “between the geographical location in the heart of the Midwest, the already numerous testing assets for a variety of missions, and state and federal representatives who are committed to supporting advancement of these critical technologies, our state is poised to provide the best outcomes for American leadership in drone manufacturing and deployment.”
The FAA is adding two sites to its national network, which supports research, safety evaluation and integration of unmanned aircraft, according to the federal agency.
Young’s office said Indiana stakeholders submitted their application to the agency Monday, and the delegation letter was sent the same day.
Indiana’s manufacturing strength is a central part of the pitch. 
Lawmakers wrote that while developing advanced drone technologies is vital, “it will be even more critical that we can take these newly developed technologies and scale them at a level in which we can deploy them to industries across the country.” 
“From applications in defense, agriculture, public safety, and beyond, there is a demand and need for U.S.-developed and produced technologies that address the national security and privacy concerns posed by their foreign-made counterparts,” they said. “Indiana is also well-positioned to meet the influx of workforce needs that will accompany this growing ecosystem.”
Universities and military assets were also highlighted.
New Indiana task force aims to boost state’s role in U.S. drone development

The letter pointed to Purdue University, which lawmakers noted has “the first university-owned airport in the country, the largest indoor motion capture facility in the world, and a faculty dedicated to addressing the challenges of safely integrating UAS into the national airspace.”
Highlighted, too, was Indiana’s Technology Readiness and Experimentation initiative at Camp Atterbury, which in August “demonstrated the ability to neutralize a 49-drone swarm with a single electromagnetic pulse,” as well as testing space at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center and counter-UAS work at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane.
The delegation also underscored ARI’s role as a coordinator of state and federal research efforts, saying its experience “managing the Silicon Crossroads Hub, Heartland Bioworks tech hub, and the Defense Innovation Unit OnRamp Program” positions the institute well to support the test-site designation.
State-level coordination is additionally part of the argument. 
The letter referenced Gov. Mike Braun’s Oct. 29 executive order establishing a statewide drone task force. 
The new “Indiana Initiative for Drone Dominance Task Force” will coordinate work across government, universities and private industry to support federal efforts to strengthen U.S. leadership in drone technology and airspace security.
The task force must deliver its strategic plan and recommendations to the governor by July 31, 2026.
Young, who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee and has worked on drone policy at the federal level, helped Braun craft the executive order.
The FAA has not announced a timeline for selecting the new testing sites.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Republican Party is moving quickly after Republicans in the Alaska Senate confirmed Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s picks for two vacancies in the Senate on Saturday.
Sens. George Rauscher, R-Sutton, and Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, encountered no significant opposition from Republican lawmakers and were sworn in after a secret ballot vote on Saturday morning in Anchorage. They replace former Sens. Mike Shower and Shelley Hughes who are running for lieutenant governor and governor, respectively, in 2026.
Rauscher and Tilton resigned from their House seats immediately after the vote and were promptly sworn in as senators.
Their resignations open two vacancies in the Alaska House, and the Alaska Republican Party has set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Dec. 4  to receive applications from local Republicans interested in representing the approximately 36,000 Alaskans in House District 26 and House District 29 in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. 
Party officials are slated to meet Saturday at the Best Western Lake Lucille Inn in Wasilla to pick three applicants for each seat to send to Dunleavy for consideration. 
Those meetings are not open to the public, according to the party’s request for nominations.
Dunleavy has until Dec. 29 to make a final selection and is not required to pick from among the party-nominated candidates. 
Legislators expect him to act sooner than the deadline in order to allow House Republicans time to take a confirmation vote and for the new lawmakers to settle in before the regular legislative session begins Jan. 20. 
Rauscher and Tilton each said they don’t have a preferred nominee at this point.
“Every day, somebody else calls me to ask whether they should put their name in,” Rauscher said, adding that the short deadline means interested people should hurry. 
Tilton said she’s aware of “five really great individuals” in her former House district. “At this point in time, I don’t have one I would say I would endorse … they are all excellent,” she said.
Both Rauscher and Tilton said they are keeping their House staff members as they transfer to the Senate; Rauscher said he’s been busy handling the administrative duties that involve shifting from the House to the Senate, including shifting offices and handling paperwork.
“We’re hitting the ground running,” he said.
In a short-lived moment of comedy, Rauscher’s listing on the official legislative website displayed the picture of former Rep. Sara Rasmussen, R-Anchorage, instead of Rauscher’s proper headshot.
Before the legislative session begins, Rauscher and Tilton will join four other Republicans in choosing a new Senate Minority Leader, to replace Shower, to become the face of the Senate’s six-person minority caucus. No date has been set for that decision.
The Senate is led by a bipartisan 14-person caucus that includes five Republicans and nine Democrats. 
In the House, Republicans didn’t wait for their vacancies to be filled before selecting a minority leader to replace Rep. Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, who stepped down from the role last month.
On Saturday, the House’s minority Republicans picked Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, as Minority Leader and Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, as Minority Whip. 
The House is divided between a 21-person multipartisan majority and a 19-person Republican minority. Of those 19 Republican seats, only 17 are filled, and several members were absent from Saturday’s vote due to prior commitments. 
On social media, Reps. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, and Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, denounced the choices, saying in part that they were untimely.
In a news release announcing the vote, Johnson said, “I don’t want to see the House Republicans go too long without leadership in place. If we had at least one of the leadership positions filled, we could have carried on but without either position we were lacking in key tools to move forward and be effective as a caucus.”

Minnesota is a generous state, Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We’re AAA bond rated. But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We’re doing everything we can. But to demonize an entire community on the actions of a few? It’s lazy.”
Start from the bottom: Do fraudsters seek out states with AAA bond ratings? 
I have trouble picturing a couple scammers poring over the S & P’s bond ratings, looking at each other and saying, “We must go north!” 
Especially since our fraud problem is homegrown. 
Also, it’s a real shame that being a “well-run state” attracts fraud, per Walz. Sorta puts us in a difficult bind: Do we want a “well-run state”? If we do, I guess we’re inviting fraud. Bummer. 
At the start of his answer, Walz takes responsibility for “putting people in jail.” 
This is an interesting assertion, in the Minnesota sense. The federal government of both Democratic and Republican administrations have charged more than 80 people with stealing from food aid and Medicaid programs. 
What would Walz’s role be in sending people to federal prison after federal prosecutions?
His spokeswoman sent me this statement: “Prosecutions don’t materialize out of thin air. Department of Human Services does extensive investigative work in collaboration with federal prosecutors, and the governor has created a specialized law enforcement fraud unit at the (Bureau of Criminal Apprehension). The executive’s job is to assist law enforcement and prosecutors in every way possible, not to undermine their work by pardoning fraudsters.” 
The last bit is a swipe at President Donald Trump, who has declared amnesty for just about every white-collar criminal in America. (And never forget the 1,600 insurrectionists.)
OK, fair enough. 
I have no doubt that Walz and his team are intensely focused on this issue these days, now that it’s blown up in their faces, and that the Department of Human Services and BCA are helping the feds develop cases that are leading to convictions. Bravo. 
But to call the recent efforts tardy is vastly understating it. 
When the Reformer reported in 2024 that the FBI was investigating autism centers on the suspicion of phony billing, a DHS assistant commissioner waved us off when we asked about explosive growth of the program, which seemingly should have raised red flags: 
“I don’t think we are surprised or particularly disturbed by the rate of growth,” she said.  
She also told us the the growth was “pretty consistent” with other DHS programs, such as “housing stabilization services,” which is pretty funny in retrospect because that program was so riddled with fraud that Walz moved to shut it down this summer.
In the spring of 2025, even as a February Star Tribune report raised questions about the potential for fraud in the housing stability program, Walz’s budget request included funding for additional DHS positions to keep up with the explosive growth of the program, the Strib reported. “Where it could, DHS moved to speed up processing times and let more individuals into the program.”
A defense lawyer for some of the defendants in the various fraud cases recently told The New York Times that it was all so easy they figured it must be OK to steal: 
“No one was doing anything about the red flags. It was like someone was stealing money from the cookie jar and they kept refilling it,” he said.  
That doesn’t sound like “extensive investigation” to me. 
As a result of this mess, Minnesota’s reputation for clean government and business has been badly damaged. 
As worrisome: tens of thousands of Somali-Americans — who happen to have the same ancestral background as most of the Minnesota scammers, but nothing else in common — have been slandered by Trump and his cronies. And now the community will face the terror of ICE.
But it all started with the Walz administration’s feckless failures.  
Unfortunately, Trump and the internet have ushered in the political era of brazening it out. Never apologize. Never take responsibility. Spew whatever argle-bargle comes in your mind. Attack. Repeat.  
This behavior should be familiar to Walz, a former high school geography teacher and football coach. It’s the behavior of adolescents, and it’s consumed our entire politico-media system. 
To his credit, Walz’s love of Minnesotans and Minnesota is that of the convert: ardent and true. So he should consider respecting our intelligence, and coming clean about how he and key people in his administration failed us. It would be a start. 
If he’s unwilling to do so, maybe it’s time for a courageous Democrat to consider a primary challenge.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250609_0528-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 13:57:25.354131

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Licensed gun dealers are a major source of firearms that end up illegally trafficked, according to a new analysis using federal data by the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun laws.
Gun trafficking involves diverting guns from legal commerce into the illegal market, often through straw purchases, unlicensed dealing or other methods that bypass background checks and federal recordkeeping requirements.
A straw purchase is when someone who can legally buy a gun does so on behalf of another person who cannot or does not want their name associated with the purchase.
Using trace data from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Everytown for Gun Safety found that 96% of guns recovered at crime scenes and traced between 2017 and 2023 were originally purchased from a licensed dealer. Everytown estimates more than 1.27 million guns will have been trafficked nationwide by 2026.
Licensed gun dealers earned an estimated $695 million from firearms that were later identified as trafficked, according to the report.
The report also points to gaps in federal oversight of gun shops, noting that the number of gun shop inspections has fallen sharply during the Trump administration. But the issue long predates the current administration.
In Oregon, for example, federal regulators inspected fewer than 2% of the state’s roughly 2,000 gun dealers in 2022 and 2023, according to records obtained by Oregon Public Broadcasting, a nonprofit media organization.
Stand-your-ground laws linked to higher homicide rates, new report finds

A federal budget document released in June shows that the U.S. Department of Justice plans to eliminate two-thirds of the investigators responsible for monitoring federally licensed gun dealers — reducing the number of inspectors from about 850 to roughly 300.
In May, the ATF announced a new policy loosening the rules that dictate when gun dealer licenses should be revoked. And since Trump took office in January, roughly 80% of the ATF’s 2,500 special agents have been directed to take on at least some immigration enforcement duties.
Everytown argues in its report that these oversight lapses allow suspicious sales to go undetected.
ATF data also shows that trafficked guns are involved in twice as many shootings as non-trafficked firearms. Nearly 88% of people who received these guns were legally prohibited from buying firearms, according to the report. Trafficked guns were frequently linked to drug offenses, aggravated assaults, homicides and attempted homicides.
The Everytown report urges states to increase regulatory inspections of gun dealers, adopt gun laws to deter trafficking and use data to identify and disrupt illegal supply chains.
“My years at ATF taught me that states don’t have to wait for Washington to act,” Marianna Mitchem, a senior firearms industry advisor at Everytown, wrote in an email. Mitchem is a former associate assistant director of field operations at the ATF.
At least 16 states and Washington, D.C., license and regulate firearms dealers, according to Everytown’s research.
Colorado and Illinois, for example, require gun dealers to obtain a state license and comply with security, recordkeeping, and storage standards, with state officials conducting regular inspections.

(Photo by David Berding/Getty Images for People's Action Institute)The University of Minnesota Medical School opened its doors in 2024 to UnitedHealth Group to launch a pilot course entitled “Leadership and Value.” 
UHG is a private, for-profit corporation headquartered in Eden Prairie, a 20-minute drive from the University of Minnesota campus. It is the world’s largest health care corporation by revenue, containing two main divisions: United Healthcare (health insurance) and Optum (health care services, data and pharmacy benefit managers). 
The medical school elective was developed for fourth-year students interested in health systems leadership. 
As a former student of this course, I fear the UHG-University of Minnesota partnership is the beginning of an unholy union. 
To contextualize my concern, consider UHG’s philosophy. The insurance company’s “value-based care” model claims to promote efficiency by funding only “high-yield” medical care. In practice, this approach biases health care delivery toward withholding care rather than providing it. When large insurers like UHG decide what care has “value,” they decide what is worth paying for. Health care decision-making shifts from the physician to UHG, a practice that conveniently saves the company money. Unsurprisingly, UHG now leads the nation in claims denials. 
The partnership’s origin story is the first warning sign of UHG’s intentions. According to the course director — whose comments I transcribed — UHG approached Dean Jakub Tolar with a proposal to embed itself within the medical school, pitching the course to train students to become “high-value providers.” Tolar ultimately negotiated a “balanced” curriculum wherein each entity would direct half the course: UHG would preach the benefits of value-based care, while the U offered weekly debriefs, health systems lessons and leadership workshops. 
We met with a dozen or so UHG employees throughout the four weeks. The pattern of these sessions quickly became clear: First, UHG employees would present a slideshow with graphics and slogans that ranged from vague corporate jargon to optimistic messaging about the future of health care. Then, they opened time for questions. Students would – either curiously or skeptically – challenge the corporate newspeak. 
In one lecture, a UHG employee from the diversity, equity and inclusion office showcased the company’s health equity projects. During the Q&A, students asked if the company ever sacrificed their bottom line for the sake of improving health disparities. They answered clearly: Their efforts only focus on communities with high membership enrollment. In an audio recording of the session, this speaker states: “The disparity does have to align with a return on investment.” 
Further questioning revealed that UHG does not share its population health data with local communities or universities, nor does it provide long-term funding for these health equity projects. 
They ended bluntly: “None of it is charity work, it’s all intentionally designed to improve outcomes in communities where we have members [patients] so that we get return on investment.”
This pattern — wherein students dragged the facts out of UHG employees during the Q&As — raises several questions about the course. Could the course have met its learning objectives without students actively participating? Does the “balanced” curriculum negotiated by the U depend on students’ own skepticism? Importantly, where were the expert voices offering opposing views to UHG’s model? 
A truly balanced perspective is requisite in any university class, especially housed in a state flagship institution. 
Were it not for consistent student pushback, the UHG sessions would have amounted to corporate propaganda. 
Many topics in a medical curriculum don’t require debate, but health care financing does, especially when UHG is involved. UHG is a controversial entity in the American health care landscape, with at least 16 lawsuits in the past seven years over denial of care, upcoding and overbilling, patient privacy violations, and anticompetitive steering of patients and providers. The Department of Justice is investigating the company, according to reporting in Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal. None of this appeared in the four-week curriculum. 
While the course may encourage critical thinking about the health care system, it also welcomes an onslaught of UHG propaganda without counterpoints or fact-checks of their claims. Balancing UHG’s perspective with a neutral academic one — while better than nothing — is not a “balance” at all. 
This course represents the worrisome start of a deepening relationship between UHG and the U. During one visit, we were unexpectedly joined by then-CEO Sir Andrew Witty. 
We asked what he envisions for the partnership’s future. 
In recorded audio from the course, he replied: “It just doesn’t make sense for us not to be working together more… because we feel like [this course] is going well, it will be an encouragement to then move to the next.” 
Pressed on what “the next” may entail, he replied, “It could be anything! It could be more in the education space, research collaboration…working with the medical school more directly in terms of collaboration on new ideas.”
In short, UHG has its sights set on U, and it is eager to ratify this marriage. 
The U should at least get a decent prenup.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2162260765.jpg,,,2025-12-02 09:59:30.547631

Laura Kelly says weak state corporate income tax revenue and sales tax receipts should convince the 2026 Kansas Legislature to be cautious in developing a new state government budget. In this Nov. 25, 2025, photo, she appears at an event at Cedar Crest in Topeka. (Photo by Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A month of softness in state revenue from corporate income tax and retail sales tax led Gov. Laura Kelly to urge the 2026 Kansas Legislature to take a cautionary approach to managing the state’s finances.
Kelly, a Democrat approaching the final year of her second term as governor, responded to the November revenue report Monday by asking the Republican-controlled Legislature to be judicious as it worked to craft the new state government budget.
“November’s tax collections were nearly on target overall,” Kelly said. “While individual income tax collections were up, corporate income tax collections were again below estimates and significantly below November 2024 levels.”
The Kansas Department of Revenue’s report offered a snapshot of where Kansas stood five months into the current fiscal year compared to the initial five months of last fiscal year.
She said the state collected this fiscal year $74 million less in corporate income tax than last fiscal year. In addition, retail sales tax revenue slipped by $53 million in a year-to-year comparison.
The state’s bottom line, however, stayed in positive territory for the fiscal year because individual income tax collections surged by $173 million, or 9.9%, above last year’s performance at this juncture. Overall, considering all sources of state tax revenue, Kansas sits $58 million above the five-month total reported through November 2024.
“As I develop my next budget proposal I am not considering just fiscal year 2027. I am also looking on to the out-years to keep our state on solid financial footing,” Kelly said.
She said Kansas was on pace to erode a $3 billion cash reserve by spending $300 million to $700 million more annually than collected in taxes.
In the past, Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, said the governor was fond of “grandstanding” when speaking about state budget issues. He said Republican lawmakers were committed to showing Kansans “results that can be achieved with level-headed and carefully crafted policy.”
Kansas governors submit to the Legislature in January of each year a constitutionally balanced budget for consideration by the House and Senate.
The Republican-controlled Legislature — as it did in 2024 — has been working on an alternative budget bill. The House-Senate budget committee scheduled two days of meetings next week to hammer out details of its outline for the fiscal year starting July 1, 2026.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kelly-24-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-02 09:59:30.547631

In 2024, Washoe County saw a nearly 38% increase in reported Lyme disease cases from the previous year, from eight cases to 11. Reported cases of the illness have increased in Northern Nevada year-over-year since 2020, according to tracking by the Northern Nevada Public Health office. 
Public health officials say the true number of cases may be higher due to underreporting. The disease can be difficult to track because symptoms mimic those of other diseases, and only patients with the worst outcomes are usually tested.
Lyme disease is transmitted through the bite of an infected black-legged tick, also known as a deer tick, which must be attached for 24 to 48 hours to spread the illness. During the nymph stage, when they are most active, black-legged ticks are about the size of a poppy seed and are easy to miss.
In about 80% of Lyme disease cases, a “bulls-eye” rash spreads around the site of the tick bite, but without one Lyme disease can be easy to misdiagnose. 
Early signs include common influenza-like symptoms including fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes. As the disease develops without treatment, more serious symptoms may emerge. In more severe cases the disease can impact joints, the nervous system and the heart for weeks to months after the initial tick bite. Delays in treatment may also increase the risk for chronic illness.
“Unfortunately, if it is Lyme disease and it goes untreated it can progress to more serious signs and symptoms which can appear months after a tick bite,” said Northern Nevada Public Health epidemiologist Liliana Wilbert.
This year, people in the U.S. are seeking emergency care for tick bites at the highest level since 2017, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Lyme disease through the years has been found mainly in the eastern and upper mid-western states of the U.S. But the range of Lyme disease cases has expanded significantly since 1995, according to the CDC — including to places where people are less familiar with the risks and how to prevent the disease.
Milder winters and longer warm seasons have allowed ticks to expand their range, bringing Lyme disease to more areas. Lyme disease-carrying black-legged ticks are mostly active when temperatures are above 45 degrees, and thrive in areas with at least 85% humidity, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.
“It’s more favorable for the ticks in the northeastern regions and coastal California. It wouldn’t be as favorable here in Nevada. That’s not to say we don’t have ticks that do live here,” Wilbert said.
In July, Carson City Health and Human Services confirmed a case of Lyme disease for a person who had not traveled outside Northern Nevada in the four weeks prior to symptom onset. The CDC also reports that more cases of Lyme disease have appeared along the west coast and in Nevada in recent years.
Still, most cases of Lyme disease reported in Northern Nevada in 2024 were among people who had recently traveled out of the state. Eight of the eleven cases in 2024 had a documented history of travel or recent relocation, some with diagnoses originating from outside the state, suggesting potential exposure in other jurisdictions. The remaining three cases had no identifiable source of exposure, indicating an unknown origin of infection.
In some of those cases people traveled to nearby Northern California, an area a recent study by the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Research Center identified as an underreported area not fully captured by traditional CDC surveillance methods. 
Wilbert said gaps in data can also make it difficult to track Lyme disease across state borders. For example, case counts are attributed to the individual’s place of residence, rather than the location where the exposure or infection occurred.
That can result in skewed data without clear answers. In Nevada, most reported cases in Nevada were among women at 73%.
“When the cases come to us, they’re typically reported on a lab report,” said Wilbert. “We don’t know why most of them have been women, that is definitely something that it’s interesting.”
To reduce the risk of Lyme disease, the Northern Nevada Public Health Department says it’s crucial to minimize contact with ticks and their habitats, particularly in areas with dense vegetation. 
“We highly recommend that people be careful when they go out into wooded areas and go camping or hiking because they’re so easy to overlook and prevention is the key,” Wilbert said.
Recommended precautions include wearing long-sleeved shirts and closed-toe shoes, wearing permethrin-treated clothing, applying EPA-registered insect repellent to exposed skin, and performing daily tick checks. Showering within two hours of outdoor activity can help remove ticks before they attach.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2199151003-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 09:59:30.547631

Murry, a Kansas City resident, said he’s always loved watching sports. When he learned about sports betting via social media, he started placing bets on the Chiefs.
“I’ll go on Sunday mornings, so probably once a week, maybe twice if there’s something fun,” Murry said. “Or if I’m over there — running errands in Overland Park or visiting family in Prairie Village — I’ll put it in.”
Most of the time, Murry has kept it simple and found a parking lot to place his bets — and he wasn’t alone. Murry said he’s often seen other people parked and on their phones on the Kansas side of the border.
“On Sunday mornings, there’s usually a few cars that you can tell (are placing bets),” he said. “Or if you’re just driving, you’ll see cars parked on the side of the road that are probably doing that.”
But when he gets a group of friends together, they’ve gone to a bar on the Kansas side of State Line Road to bet as they watch the game.
Murry and his friends are among thousands of Missourians who cross the border into Kansas, Illinois and other states to bet on sports. Of the eight states that border Missouri, only one — Oklahoma — has not legalized sports betting in some form.

Between Sept. 5 and Oct. 21, 2024, GeoComply — a software company that checks sportsbook users’ locations to determine whether they can place a bet — identified more than 216,000 mobile sports betting accounts in Missouri.
During that time, more than 3,700 Missourians traveled to Kansas and more than 2,800 traveled to Illinois to bet on sports, according to data from GeoComply.
The phenomenon is similar to cross-border shopping, according to Adam Hoffer, the director of excise tax policy at the center-right Tax Foundation.
“In Missouri’s case, just based on where the state population is, you’re definitely going to see an impact on neighboring states,” Hoffer said.
In November 2024, Missourians legalized sports betting, and on Dec. 1, 2025, sportsbooks went live within Missouri’s borders for the first time. Murry, who spoke with The Beacon a few days before sportsbooks launched, said he’s excited about the change.
“It was time for it to happen,” he said. “I think, no matter what your opinion is on it, people are going to other states — people are going to do it regardless.”
Between Sept. 5 and Oct. 21, 2024, thousands of Missourians traveled across state lines to place bets on sports.

He said he appreciated the greater accessibility of not having to travel to place bets. While he thinks he’ll bet “more or less” the same amount, he is looking forward to live betting, which he said wasn’t as much of an option before.
As Missouri bettors stay in their homes and neighborhoods to place bets, other states will feel the impact of lost revenue, Hoffer said.
Missouri expects to collect about $28 million in tax revenue from sports betting annually. Although the state stands to collect revenue that would otherwise go to neighboring states, Missouri is late to legalizing sports betting, which means it won’t attract as much cross-border betting from its neighbors.
However, as the Midwest embraces sports betting, some states’ sports betting tax policies could drive bettors into neighboring states, Hoffer said.
“I don’t think Missouri is going to be a huge winner (in terms of) an influx of cross-border bettors. Where they might see it most is actually from Illinois, because Illinois just placed a per-wager tax,” he said. “What we expect to see as a result in Illinois are fewer, smaller bets.”
Illinois “bettors can, if they’re near a border with Missouri … dodge that tax by betting across the border. So I do think (Missouri) will see some net influx from people living in neighboring states,” he added. “I don’t think it’s going to be enormous, but I do think there will certainly be some bettors looking to avoid the higher taxes in neighboring states.”
An advantage of being a later adopter is that Missouri could evaluate other states’ sports betting tax policies to see what works best, Hoffer said.
“I think that’s quite helpful in this case,” he said. “If I were to design a (sports betting) tax structure from scratch, I’d pick the way Missouri designed it. Their rate of 10% is going to put them close to the median rate.”
Sports betting taxes aren’t competitive in the same way as taxes on cigarettes or gasoline, “where prices — and, in part, taxes — are advertised on billboards on the side of the highway so consumers know where to shop for the best rates,” Hoffer said.
Still, higher taxes could mean sportsbooks have to worsen the odds for their customers in order to ensure they make a profit. As a result, worse odds could push bettors to nearby states with lower taxes and better odds, he said.
“Sports bettors, like a lot of other cross-border shoppers we see across the country, will know where they can get the best odds for their wagers and will bet accordingly,” Hoffer said.

Let’s jump into some California housing news:

Housing projects on state land: Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office last week unveiled six affordable housing projects that are planned to be built on state property, including on former DMV sites in Fontana and Stockton. The projects include at least 840 affordable housing units in total and stem from a 2019 executive order directing state agencies to review state-owned property that could be used for housing. All six sites entered into lease option agreements by Nov. 13, according to a spokesperson for the state’s Department of General Services.


‘Milestone’ for LA-area wildfire recovery?: In November Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass touted the first single-family home in Pacific Palisades to receive the city’s approval for occupancy, after the Palisades Fire destroyed thousands of buildings and claimed 12 lives in January. In a statement Bass said the “major milestone” marked “an important moment of hope,” but a homebuilding company, not a family, owns the house, reports Politico. The company, Thomas James Homes, bought the property located on 915 N Kagawa Street in November 2024 and began the permitting process before the wildfire. Bass received backlash from critics who argued the praise was misleading.


Low-cost housing study: A new study by the nonprofit Enterprise analyzed 39 single-room occupancy properties in California owned by nonprofit operators. Viewed by housing advocates as a critical component of housing for low-income tenants, the study looked at more than 3,000 SRO units and found that most are “inherently quite old,” with an average build year of 1928 — a year before the Great Depression. Ninety-five percent of the projects also operated on a deficit, compelling housing providers to contribute more than $24 million of their money to keep the properties open. These housing units also had an average 20% vacancy rate.

At least 10 candidates are running in 2026 to succeed Newsom as the next California governor and the race remains wide open: In a poll released by UC Berkeley last month, 44% of surveyed voters did not have a preference for governor, and no candidate polled above 15%. 
To keep track of the revolving door of candidates, CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang has a guide with details of each of the top candidates, which include:

Xavier Becerra: The former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary was associated with a scandal recently after the FBI revealed that Newsom’s former chief of staff and other political consultants conspired to steal money from a dormant campaign account held by Becerra.


Katie Porter: Last month the former Orange County congressmember received some bad press after she was caught on camera trying to walk out of a TV interview, and another video showed Porter berating a staff member during a Zoom call.


Chad Bianco: The pro-Trump Riverside County Sheriff wants to loosen regulations on businesses and overturn California’s sanctuary laws. Though he is neck-and-neck with Porter in the polls, no GOP candidate has won a statewide seat in nearly 20 years.

The change caused the porn industry’s largest website, Pornhub, to block access  in Missouri, issuing a statement calling the new rule ineffective and a potential risk to user privacy.
Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, who took over the policy after it was initiated by her predecessor, celebrated the news, calling Pornhub’s decision proof that the rule is needed.
“If a billion-dollar corporation would rather leave Missouri than verify that children are not accessing graphic sexual content,” she said, “that tells you everything you need to know about its priorities.”
It’s already illegal to show children pornography under federal law, however it’s rarely enforced. Various measures exist to verify a person’s age online, such as uploading a government ID or consent to facial recognition software.
The new Missouri rule requires any commercial website or platform to implement some form of age-verification measure if at least a third of the content it offers is pornographic. Platforms that refuse to comply are subject to penalties, injunctive relief, and enforcement actions for engaging in unfair and deceptive practices.
“If you want to operate in Missouri, you must prove your users are adults,” Hanaway said. “If that is too much to ask, then you will not operate here,” 
In September, a trade association representing the adult entertainment industry told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that it was considering a legal challenge to the rule, since they were created outside the legislative process. 
The legislature has tried to pass age-verification laws, with little success. 
A bill nearly identical to the new rule received initial approval from the Missouri House in February but was never brought up for a final vote in the chamber. 
The bill faced criticism that it would ultimately do more harm than good by driving traffic to lesser-known sites that don’t comply with the law and have fewer safety protocols. Critics also raised concerns about privacy, arguing it is impossible to ensure websites aren’t retaining user data. The regulations could also lead to censorship, critics warned, specifically regarding information about sexuality. 
“While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting users,” Pornhub said in its statement, “and in fact, it will put children and your privacy at risk.”
Hanaway said Pornhub is “welcome to leave Missouri.”
“What is not welcome,” she said, “is any company that puts profit above the safety of our children,”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2302-e1755617763363.jpg,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488
,California,2025-12-02 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Who’s running for California governor? Here’s a look at the current field of candidates,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/12/governors-race-current-field/,"A few moments of controversy have touched an otherwise sleepy, wide open race to be California’s next governor.","In summary
A few moments of controversy have touched an otherwise sleepy, wide open race to be California’s next governor. 


The game of musical chairs in the race to be California’s next governor lost another player last week. 
After Democratic businessman Stephen Cloobeck — who was polling at below half a percent — dropped out of the race and endorsed Rep. Eric Swalwell on Monday, at least 10 candidates remain. 
Voters are hardly to blame if the names don’t ring a bell. Though it’s wound on for more than a year now, the 2026 governor’s race remains unexpectedly wide open. In one poll released last month, 44% of surveyed voters did not have a preference for governor and no candidate polled above 15%.
The primary election is next June. Here’s a look at the field right now: 
XAVIER BECERRA
If former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra was looking for attention for his campaign, he found it in the form of negative headlines. 
Last month, federal prosecutors indicted a Sacramento powerbroker in an alleged corruption scandal that rocked the state’s Democratic establishment. At its center? A dormant campaign account held by Becerra, from which prosecutors allege Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff Dana Williamson conspired with other political consultants to steal $225,000. Williamson is charged with helping to divert the funds to the wife of Becerra’s longtime aide, Sean McCluskie, who has pleaded guilty in the alleged scheme. 
Becerra was California’s first Latino attorney general before serving as a cabinet secretary for former President Joe Biden. He is running primarily on a platform of lowering health care costs. 
He has not been accused of wrongdoing in the case and has said he was unaware of what was happening. But it’s still possible the association — and the implication he wasn’t paying attention — will taint his campaign, already polling at just 8%. 
The controversy is one of a few moments of intrigue in an otherwise quiet race. 
KATIE PORTER
In October, former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat, was caught on camera trying to walk out of a TV interview with a reporter who pressed her on whether she needed Republican support in the race. A second video followed, showing Porter berating a staff member during a Zoom call. At the time considered the front-runner, she rode out the news cycle and later said she “could have done better” about the behavior in the videos, but they appeared to have dropped her approval ratings. She is essentially tied with the top Republican candidate. 
Porter made a name for herself as one of a “blue wave” of female, Democratic lawmakers elected to Congress during the first Trump administration in 2018. A law professor at UC Irvine who ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate last year, she gained attention for her tough questioning of corporate executives using her signature whiteboard. 
TOM STEYER
Joining a wide field of other Democrats, billionaire investor and climate activist Tom Steyer announced last month he is jumping into the race.

Steyer, who made his fortune by founding a San Francisco hedge fund, has used his wealth to back liberal causes, including the environment. He’s never held public office before, but ran a short-lived campaign for president in 2020. 
CHAD BIANCO
Pro-Trump Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco is neck-and-neck with Porter in the polls, though he is unlikely to last near the top of the pack in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly two-to-one and a GOP candidate hasn’t won a statewide seat in nearly 20 years.
The cowboy-hat-toting Bianco has heavily criticized Democratic governance. He argues for loosening regulations on businesses and says he wants to overturn California’s sanctuary law that restricts local police from cooperating with federal deportation officers. 
ERIC SWALWELL 
Other Democrats have focused on their biographies and experiences in government to try to distinguish themselves in a race where name recognition is low across the board. All have said they want to make California more affordable and push back on the Trump administration’s impact on the state.

Swalwell, a former prosecutor and Bay Area congressman, will likely lean heavily on his anti-Trump bonafides. He was one of several members of Congress appointed by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to help lead the second Trump impeachment after the attempted Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection and is now the latest Democrat under attack by the Trump administration over his mortgage.
ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA
Former Los Angeles mayor and former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa is among the more moderate of the Democratic field. He boasts of his time running the state’s largest city, during which he boosted the police force. He ran for governor unsuccessfully in 2018. 
BETTY YEE
Former state Controller Betty Yee emphasizes her experience with the state budget and the tax system, having been a top finance office in ex-Gov. Gray Davis’ administration and having sat on the state Board of Equalization. 
TONY THURMOND
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, a Democrat, is the only candidate currently in a statewide seat. He emphasizes his background as a social worker who grew up on public assistance programs in a low-income family. He has stated an ambitious goal of building two million housing units on surplus state land. 
IAN CALDERON
Ian Calderon, a former Democratic Assembly majority leader, is emphasizing his relative youth. He was the first millennial member of the state Assembly, and is part of a Los Angeles County political dynasty. He has some ties to the cryptocurrency industry and has name-dropped it in ads and debates. 
STEVE HILTON
Republican Steve Hilton, a Fox News contributor, was an adviser for British conservative Prime Minister David Cameron before pivoting to American politics. Before launching his campaign he released a book this year calling California “America’s worst-run state.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112525-Candidate-Forum-CS-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488
,California,2025-12-02 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,After ICE arrests come health scares for the detained,George B. Sánchez-Tello,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/ice-health-scares-for-detained/,"Families of detained immigrants describe what many studies have found: ICE centers are ill-equipped to care for people with chronic illness, causing more suffering and death","After five months in Adelanto, an immigration detention facility in Southern California’s high desert, Emma Marcela Crespin de Paz is home in Los Angeles. The 58-year-old food vendor was released in October after multiple hospitalizations while in federal custody. 
Before she was detained, De Paz had been coping with high blood pressure and diabetes — serious, chronic conditions. Her warrantless arrest and bail bond indicate she shouldn’t have been taken at all.
De Paz’s ordeal highlights both a public component of Trump-era immigration policy — racial profiling — and a burgeoning public health concern that’s hidden from view: the immigrant detention system is ill-equipped for the health needs of those in its care. 
Deaths in custody capture public attention, said Dr. Altaf Saadi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she is the associate director of its asylum clinic.
Less attention is paid to those with chronic illnesses, whose health needs are worsened by indefinite detention in a dragnet, she said. People like de Paz.
At least twice de Paz had to be hospitalized while being held by immigration officials; both times she was admitted without her family’s notification. Because ICE detained her without her medication, she only began receiving her pills after family and attorneys advocated for her wellbeing. 
Saadi’s research on the health and wellbeing of California’s immigrant detainees has over five years consistently raised concerns about detention facilities.  
“Detention center medical systems have limited health care services, are frequently under-staffed and are focused on managing acute care needs rather than chronic medical problems, resulting in medical neglect, delayed diagnoses and care and severe negative consequences, especially among trauma-exposed individuals,” Saadi and other researchers wrote in the Health and Human Rights Journal in 2020. 
Surviving ICE detention despite illness
“The reality is there are harms occurring on a daily basis that people are surviving because people are resilient,” Saadi said in a July interview. 
Interruptions of detainees’ regular medicine and treatment routines and ensuing physical harm are likely underreported and under-discussed in local media and communities, Saadi added. 
Emma de Paz arrived in the United States in 2001 from Chiquimulilla, in the Guatemalan state of Santa Rosa, said her brother, Carlos Barrera de Paz. 
In Guatemala, her family worked in agriculture, as well as construction and street vending. The journey from Guatemala to Los Angeles lasted about 25 days, Carlos explained, including a four-day walk through the Sonoran Desert.

In the United States, De Paz established herself as part of Los Angeles’ informal economy by becoming a regular vendor outside the Hollywood Home Depot. She was known for Guatemalan favorites — black beans, hoof soup, and Guatemalan barbeque.
She also became part of a movement to legalize street vending in Los Angeles, explained Sergio Jimenez of Community Power Collective, a grassroots collective of tenants, street vendors & transit riders working for what they call a “solidarity economy.” 
Recently, about the time de Paz returned from detention, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that de Paz had helped advocate for, to prevent immigration officials from accessing street vendors’ personal information from the licensing process. 
De Paz’ brother, Carlos, described his sister’s and family’s struggles with immigration enforcement.
 A family’s search amid hospitals’ silence
It began June 19, less than two weeks after federal officials began aggressive raids at a downtown L.A. warehouse and nearby Home Depot. Agents picked up De Paz and took her to the Metropolitan Detention Center downtown. She didn’t have her medicine with her.
De Paz ended up hospitalized nearby at White Memorial Hospital in Boyle Heights. Neither hospital nor immigration officials notified de Paz’s family. Instead they found out through a network of immigrant advocates working to alert communities to raids, identify those taken and track their well being. 
Carlos called the hospital in Boyle Heights and asked, in English, if his sister was there, if she was doing well or needed help. But hospital staff would not confirm she was there nor comment on her wellbeing, he said. 
Jimenez and her family later learned ICE agents were in de Paz’s room and in the adjacent hallway. Jimenez has met with doctors, nurses, surgeons and dieticians who have raised ethical concerns about ICE presence.
Throughout the summer, L. A. media reported on the presence of ICE in hospital lobbies and patient rooms. The nation’s nursing union has been advocating for the rights of immigrant patients in custody. Even White Memorial released ICE guidelines, though doctors and advocates said they fall short.
“This is a violation of patients’ rights,” Jimenez said. “Medical professionals are questioning the presence of ICE and the lack of (patient) access to their medication.”
Treating ill immigrants poorly
After 10 days in downtown Los Angeles, de Paz was transferred to the Adelanto Detention Center, a private prison operated by GEO Group. 
In her first week there, she again was without medication and was given food considered harmful for patients with diabetes and high blood pressure. For instance, de Paz was fed Capri sun and sandwiches for lunch, Jimenez and her family said.
“All that is jeopardizing her health,” Jimenez said. “The conditions don’t change.”
While in Adelanto, de Paz was hospitalized again. The family is still not sure where because, again, hospital staff would not confirm her visit. The family received no explanation or paperwork about the hospitalization. 
De Paz told her family the hospital did not provide translation services for her to communicate with the doctor or nurses. 
Instances of poor treatment and health care for immigrants at Adelanto have long been documented.
A 2018 Homeland Security Inspector General report titled “Management Alert – Issues Requiring Action at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in Adelanto, California,” includes a subsection titled “Failure to Provide Timely and Adequate Medical Care for Detainees Increases Health Risks.” 
The report states detainees are not ensured appropriate or necessary medical and dental care. Inspectors note doctors spoke in English to Spanish-speakers who did not understand what was said. The report also notes inspectors discovered nooses made from bed sheets, hanging from vents; detainees in interviews gave a variety of reasons for the sheets, including for failed suicide attempts. 
A year after that report, the California Department of Justice published a review of immigration detention facilities in California, complying with a law passed in 2017. The review said inspections at 10 facilities — including county jails, private prisons and Adelanto — revealed universal problems with medical record keeping, nurses practicing outside their legal scope, inadequate exams, inadequate medical care, inadequate mental health staffing and unsafe suicide watch and solitary confinement practices. 
The report noted that Adelanto was the most difficult source for obtaining medical files. Also, California’s DOJ requested a two-week inspection of Adelanto, but ICE allowed investigators in for only one day and did not permit them to speak with any detainees or staff. 
Evidence of medical harm
Detention facilities and staff are not prepared to adequately address the health needs of detainees and are harmful, Saadi reported in 2021 in the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities. 
That same year, in the Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health, Saadi and another researcher reported on health needs for immigrant detainees amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Noting the lack of public data on detainees with chronic health needs, they identified a 2013-2014 survey of 565 detainees in four California facilities — three jails and one private prison. 
Researchers found 42.5% of respondents had at least one diagnosed medical condition and 15.5% had multiple chronic conditions. About 28% of detainees reported a combination of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, about 17% had neuropsychiatric conditions and nearly 9% reported lung disease. 
Of the individuals with known health conditions and treatment, about 21% experienced disruption in care upon entering detention, as did nearly 32% of individuals with two or more conditions.
In January 2025, across a pair of peer-reviewed journals — the Journal of the American Medical Association and the Journal of Migration and Health — Saadi and her colleagues again warned about the health dangers of migrant detention, concluding: “The most effective harm-reduction policy would be to end the use of incarceration in immigration legal proceedings.” 
Healing at home 
It will take more attention to research like Saadi’s and the stories of detained immigrants like de Paz for the public to understand the degree of medical harm resulting from Trump-era raids and arrests, to ensure it doesn’t happen again.
Meanwhile, de Paz has said she does not want to speak to reporters about her experience. When she returned home in October, the Los Angeles Times noted a tremor in her hands that hadn’t been there before her detention. 
“She’s gone through a lot of trauma, and she’s asked to take a break while she heals,” explained Jimenez. 
She has since made progress. For Thanksgiving de Paz returned to the Home Depot parking lot where she had been detained. She gave plates of homemade turkey in pipián, a traditional Guatemalan dish, to the day laborers there.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/070125-Emma-de-Paz-Protest-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C698&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

Maura Healey is proposing a new requirement to mandate the flood disclosures as a means of steering people out of harm’s way in the first place.","DENISE KRESS HAS been living for 35 years with the Belle Isle Marsh as her backyard. 
But as more severe storms hit over the past decade, her life has been consumed by the marsh in ways other than its natural beauty: thinking about water, preparing for its encroachment, laying down bags of sand, living through flooding, and recovering from its wreckage. It’s meant two totaled cars and five repaired or replaced electrical and heating systems, and weeks spent in a hotel in the winter of 2018 after flood waters breached her basement twice in two months and then froze so that you’d need a “pick axe” to navigate it. 
Through all this, she’s stayed. 
But Kress occasionally ponders what it will look like, when the day comes, to sell her house just over the Boston border in Winthrop, given all the flooding the property has endured.  
“I can’t worry about it because there’s little that I can do about it,” Kress said when asked if she’s concerned that disclosing her home’s flooding history could impact its value. “But I would want the next owner to know. People have a right to know.” 
She’s quick to add, though, that even if she had known all the flood damages and insurance price hikes that would come in her 35 years in Winthrop, she may not have changed a thing anyway: “If I had to do it all over again, I probably would,” said Kress, who finds comfort in the vast marsh that drew her to the property originally. 
Such are the complications facing Massachusetts, a high-cost coastal state seeing some of the fastest-warming ocean temperatures in the world and increasing rates of precipitation that are exposing its aging stormwater drainage systems, dams, and culverts.

Gov. Maura Healey aims to direct a new influx of cash to address those very issues through her nearly $3 billion environmental bond bill, which includes $308 million to upgrade high-risk dams and flood control systems and nearly $100 million for coastal initiatives like seawalls, jetties, and beach nourishments. But as flooding touches more Massachusetts households, she’s also proposing a new requirement to steer people out of harm’s way in the first place: mandating flood risk disclosure when property owners sell. 
Massachusetts is one of just 14 states in the nation and one of just three located along the coast (Virginia and Georgia are the others) not to require flood disclosures, which are meant to arm prospective homebuyers with knowledge of a property’s past flooding history. Healey’s proposal comes as state leaders push to build more homes to ease high prices, including a goal to construct 220,000 more units by 2035 and a major zoning overhaul designed to increase housing around MBTA rail stops.  
“The flood disclosure provision is about consumer protection,” Katherine Antos, the state’s undersecretary for decarbonization and resilience, said in an interview. “Oftentimes, what families pay for their housing, whether they’re making one of the largest financial decisions of buying a home, or if they’re renting, this is a significant portion of their expenses. Making sure that they have available information about flood risk is key to helping them make informed decisions, including ways that they can keep themselves and their property safe.” 
Healey’s bill will now need action in the Legislature, and it arrived there earlier this year with broad support from the business community to the insurance industry to municipalities.  
But there’s one stakeholder key to the state’s efforts to address both a dire shortage in homes and a growing need to shore up current and future housing stock against flood risk that is keeping mum on the disclosure push: the real estate industry.  
Theresa Hatton, CEO of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors, said that she’s neutral on the proposed flood disclosure requirement. But she cautioned that moving ahead with the policy would upend Massachusetts’s structure as a “buyer beware” state — meaning the burden falls mostly on the buyer to proactively investigate issues with the home. 
“Flooding will affect the price of a home in terms of the insurance that you’ll have to pay,” she said. “In some cases, a buyer may decide, ‘This is not the home for me. I’d rather put this money into my mortgage as opposed to flood insurance.’ And others might say, ‘This is the most beautiful piece of property I’ve ever seen. I’m willing to take the risk and invest in flood insurance.’ To each their own — the more information, the better-informed decision you can make. But this is a systematic change that I don’t believe is the biggest priority to tackle at the moment. Let’s get some more housing built first.”  
Daryl Fairweather, chief economist of real estate firm Redfin, told CommonWealth Beacon that she supports mandatory flood disclosures — but acknowledged that “there are people who disagree with me in the real estate industry.” 
“If the seller is aware of flood risk and the buyer is not, then that gives an advantage to the seller during the negotiation process,” Fairweather said. “It’s better for there to be more even footing between seller and buyer. And on a more macro level, anything that helps homebuyers make better economic decisions, the more it will help the economy overall. Otherwise, we could have a situation where homebuyers are not at all aware of the risks, they go buying homes with high risk unwittingly, and then they end up needing bailouts from the government or insurance companies.” 
Supporters of Healey’s proposal in Massachusetts recognize the real estate industry could play a pivotal role in whether the state is able to enact a flood disclosure requirement. Norman Abbott, senior government affairs specialist at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, said the sector is “an influential group” and that “this may be an issue where we ultimately don’t see eye to eye.” 
Sen. Rebecca Rausch, a Democrat who co-chairs the Joint Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, declined to say in an interview whether she’s concerned that the real estate industry could serve as a roadblock to the flood disclosure provision. 
But she added that “flood risk is only going to increase” — and with that risk comes a potential financial reckoning for property owners.  
“So whether [owners are] required to talk about it or not, the value is going to be impacted,” Rausch said.  
Joel Scata, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council who leads the group’s flood disclosure scorecard project, said real estate agents in other “buyer beware” states have opposed flood disclosure requirements because of a “misconstrued fear that this is going to hamper the real estate industry even though many other states have strong disclosure laws and still have strong real estate markets.” 
Luck might play a role, too.  
David Melly, a senior policy director at the Environmental League of Massachusetts, said that Massachusetts has avoided the flood disclosure conversation in recent years in part because it has largely been spared from devastating and headline grabbing major hurricanes with statewide impacts. New Jersey and New York, for instance, enacted flood disclosure laws in 2023 in the wake of hurricanes Sandy and Ida that battered those coastlines, flooded subway systems, and knocked out power for a large swath of people for an extended period of time.  
Still, between dramatic coastal erosion along bluffs and beaches in the state and crushing inland flooding in communities like Leominster in recent years, Healey’s bond bill would strengthen stormwater management systems and establish a revolving fund to implement upgrades to roads, bridges, dams, and salt marsh restoration projects. 
The flood disclosure requirement in particular is one that Carole McCauley wishes had already been in place when she sold her flood-prone Salem home a decade ago. 
McCauley, a single mother who used to work in the state’s Office of Coastal Zone Management and is now at Mass Audubon, would often park her car up the street on safer ground because the drains in front of her house would regularly overflow, with water spreading out over the road and bubbling up the sidewalk and onto her front steps. She became accustomed to watching the tide charts daily. 
But everything changed when a microburst of intense rain woke her up one morning in October 2011. She ran downstairs to find that three feet of water had poured into her basement, despite three sump pumps, and later learned she had lost a water heater and had her car totaled from the storm.

When McCauley found out a few years later that her mortgage lender was going to require her to purchase flood insurance, McCauley decided it was time to move. 
But she didn’t disclose the flooding history to the next owner. 
“I felt like a real jerk,” McCauley said. “I remember having a conversation with the realtor, and he’s like, ‘Are you going to disclose?’ He just looked at me, like, ‘I’m your agent, and this is your money. What do you want me to do?’ They’re not making us do it. Hold your nose, and off you go.” 
The experience changed her thinking on flooding, climate change, and even capitalism. 
“This is not even just about convincing people that science is real and here’s something science is telling us,” McCauley said. “Now we’re telling people that their retirement, their future, their savings is at risk if their property values are impacted. But it is a very painful step in the right direction to require the mandatory disclosures. It’s not going to convince some people – some people can afford the loss, and some people just don’t believe it. But if they don’t believe it, it’s only because they have never lived through what it’s like to have all your family photos gone because they’re soaked in mud.” 
The proposed flood disclosure requirement isn’t necessarily just to benefit buyers, either.  
Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist, said if sellers knew their flood history would be disclosed, they could be nudged into taking additional steps to help mitigate against any damage such disclosures could do to their property value by investing in new gutters, for instance, or redoing their landscaping to navigate water away from the home. 
Now, Healey’s flood disclosure proposal will barrel forward into next year and stands to offer an early glimpse into the policy jockeying to come over how Massachusetts handles its growing flood problem.  
“Choosing not to disclose isn’t necessarily the answer, because it’s almost like a perverse game of musical chairs,” said Scata, the senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Eventually, someone’s going to be left holding that property that’s untenable because it floods so often.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0414-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Two nonprofits have given Fairhope Public Library over $42,000 to offset state aid lost in a dispute between the library and the Alabama Public Library Service (APLS) board over content in the teens’ section of the library.
The donation from Read Freely Alabama and EveryLibrary Institute came weeks after the library learned the state had canceled and reallocated $22,000 in funding that library officials had understood to be suspended pending resolution of the dispute.
“We are really excited, to finally at long last, be handing over this money that was raised by the community, by the people of Alabama, and by many of the people around the world who saw the plight of our library and stood up, and opened their pocketbooks to help our library stand up to censorship,” said Elizabeth Williams, one of the members of Read Feely Alabama who helped create the GoFundMe account. “Now that APLS has made clear that they have no intention of returning our funding anytime soon, we are going to release this money.”

Williams said that the Board of Trustees for the Fairhope Public Library requested that the two groups delay donating the funds that were raised until APLS eventually decided on the fate of the library’s funding.
“Obviously we are very excited and appreciate the support of the community so much,” said Robert Gourlay, director of the Fairhope Public Library. “That is unbelievable, the amount of funds that were raised and the true show of support from the community.”
A message was sent to John Wahl, chair of the APLS Board and the Alabama Republican Party, on Monday.
APLS told Fairhope Public Library Board Chair Randal Wright last month that it had disbursed the money that it had been withholding from Fairhope to other libraries in Baldwin County.
The board suspended the final two installments of Fairhope’s state aid for the 2025 fiscal year in March. APLS Board Member Amy Minton moved to hold the funds after a handful of individuals from Fairhope accused the library of shelving  books in the teen section that they considered sexually explicit, in violation of APLS administrative code updates from last year.
The administrative code changes required that local libraries, as a condition for receiving state aid, create policies that further restrict minors from having access to library materials considered obscene, sexually explicit or otherwise inappropriate.
The Fairhope Public Library Board reviewed 17 books that were challenged after the APLS Board suspended its funding. Board members decided to reshelve seven titles to the adult section while keeping the remaining books where they were originally located.
Library officials  said they did not receive any notice from APLS that they were not complying with the regulations indicated in the administrative code.
Read Freely Alabama, with assistance from the EveryLibrary Institute, started a fundraiser by creating a GoFundMe account to help offset what was considered a temporary funding loss at the time.
APLS last month approved additional changes forbidding libraries from shelving books for children or teenagers that contain “gender ideology,” a term it does not define, and those that address “the concept of more than two biological genders.”
“The board of the Alabama Public Library Service was very clear that it does not believe that LBGTQ+ identity should be on the shelves of public libraries, and that is a tragedy,” said John Chrastka, executive director of EveryLibrary Institute. “So, we wanted to step up and help safeguard that library from what was essentially blackmail on the part of the board, trying to force them to remove content that is otherwise legal.”
APLS continues to withhold funding from the Fairhope Public Library. APLS board members delayed making a final decision at the meeting in September on whether to reinstate funding for Fairhope to allow themselves time to read the books themselves.
Wahl said at last month’s meeting that he had not read the materials that were challenged and requested that his fellow board members delay deciding on the fate of Fairhope’s funding until the meeting scheduled for early next year so that he could have additional time to read the books and report his findings to board members.
Thus far, Fairhope Public Library remains out of compliance with the administrative code and has not received any state aid since the APLS Board voted in March.
The Fairhope community has rallied behind the library amid the ongoing battle. City leaders have expressed support for the library, and Fairhope voters largely rejected a slate of candidates backed by library opponents this summer.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7721-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Rocky Mountain Power is proposing a 4.48% rate increase for all customers, potentially for the next decade. However, this time, the adjustment isn’t meant to cover its expenses, but a self-insurance account that would cover extraordinary expenses in case of utility-related catastrophic wildfires.
The company’s request stems from a law the Utah Legislature passed in 2024, which, among other provisions, allowed large utilities to establish a restricted fire fund fed by a surcharge to ratepayers. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, who sponsored the law in the 2024 session, said the adjustment was driven by commercial insurance prices going “astronomically high,” especially after PacifiCorp settled a lawsuit with about 400 plaintiffs over deadly wildfires that devastated Oregon communities in 2020.
“The idea here is, if Rocky Mountain Power would have to go out and purchase insurance at the higher level, that cost would be blended back into the rates that we’re paying today,” Sandall told Utah News Dispatch on Monday. “So rather than pay the extra high cost of the additional insurance to an insurance company, the idea here is to self insure to a certain degree.”
Commission orders 4.7% electricity rate increase, a quarter of Rocky Mountain Power’s proposal

According to November testimonies from Rocky Mountain Power executives, the proposed 4.48% increase would translate to about $3.70 a month for the average residential customer, the cap established in the bill. With the increase, the company is hoping to collect about $109 million a year, and eventually, after 10 years, about $1 billion.
Rocky Mountain Power argued in its request for the rate increase that the proposal is in the public interest, especially now that “the increasing incidence and severity of wildland fire has put unprecedented financial pressure on electric utilities operating in Western states like Utah.”
“The availability of the Fire Fund supports customers and the state of Utah generally by fostering the financial stability of the Company so it can deploy capital to effectively serve customers,” the company wrote. “Massive claims on utility assets arising from wildfire liability could compromise the Company’s ability to expand infrastructure to meet current customer needs and expected load growth in Utah.”
The code establishes that the fire fund would supplement other forms of insurance. And Sandall highlighted the account would not be part of Rocky Mountain Power’s system. It would instead be a restricted account, and would only be used as a last resort if there’s a catastrophic fire with liabilities that insurance won’t pay for.
“This is just an insurance account that the ratepayers pay into, but it’s always there,” Sandall said. “And if something else comes up in the future where we don’t need it, I’m sure that we’ll give it back to the ratepayers.”



Let us know what you think...


 


The hope is that Rocky Mountain Power still takes the necessary measures to avoid fires by keeping their power lines clear and cutting energy in high wind situations, Sandall said, and that the state isn’t forced to use the account.
“They just were really at a point where the insurance companies, especially after the Oregon lawsuit, did not want to insure them at a reasonable rate,” Sandall said. “And so this becomes a self-insured fund, rather than pay the extra high premiums to an insurance company.”
Rocky Mountain Power’s request was expected after the passage of Sandall’s legislation. However, it also comes after a controversial request for a 30.5% residential rate increase, heavily criticized by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and legislative leaders. Ultimately, the Utah Public Service Commission approved only a 4.7% bump, which would translate into a $4.31 increase in the average home’s utility bill. 
However, Sandall reiterated the fire fund is different from the general rate because the money would not pay for Rocky Mountain Power’s regular operations.

,California,2025-12-02 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s 911 debacle is California’s latest failed tech adoption,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/california-tech-911-system-failed/,Since 2019 California has spent $450 million on a new 911 system. This year the  Newsom administration declared it unworkable and will start over.,"Six years ago, shortly after the Legislature enacted his first state budget, Gov. Gavin Newsom embarked on a celebratory tour to tout the spending plan’s major provisions.
Newsom’s last stop was in San Francisco, where he bragged about increasing fees on telephone service to finance an upgrade of California’s 911 emergency communication system, whose deficiencies had become painfully apparent during a series of destructive and deadly wildfires.
“During my first week in office, I proposed making crucial updates to modernize our antiquated 911 system,” Newsom said during a media event. “The idea that it’s 2019, and we are using analog systems designed decades ago is astounding, and we need to make investments to make sure the technology aligns with the devices people are using in their daily lives.
“California’s antiquated, analog microwave network must be upgraded to a digital network to maintain safety operations that can integrate into the 21st century technology everyone is using,” Newsom added.
Fast forward to 2025. Wildfires still plague the state, including the massively destructive fires that swept through Los Angeles neighborhoods. Californians also remain at risk from earthquakes and floods, not to mention crimes and medical crises. 
They still are depending on an emergency communication system that Newsom denounced as antiquated. What happened to the promised upgrade?
Since 2019 the state has spent $450 million on a new system, but this year Newsom’s administration threw in the towel, abandoning what had already been built and declaring it unworkable and that the process must start all over again.
The Sacramento Bee laid out what happened — or didn’t happen — in a lengthy piece of investigative journalism:
“California settled on a design that no other state had implemented: a regionalized approach that divided the massive state into four sectors.
“Between 2019 and 2025, California paid four technology companies over $450 million to build out its Next Generation 911 system, a more advanced emergency communication tool that would provide dispatchers with enhanced location services and other ways for the public to communicate with first responder operators.
“But when the time came to turn that system on, it didn’t work.”
In 2024, California’s Office of Emergency Services switched on a few dispatch centers as a test and discovered that it was operationally so flawed that officialdom “decided to scrap the regional design and go back to the drawing board,” the Bee found. The state now proposes a new design similar to what other states have adopted. Cal OES will seek proposals next year for a substitute, the Bee reported, “at an additional cost of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars.”
The failure is not just money down the drain. It compels Californians to continue relying on a system whose shortcomings put their lives and property in jeopardy.
Sadly too, the 911 debacle is not an isolated case of inept technological adoption — even though California is the global leader in cutting edge tech and its governor once wrote a book outlining how it would transform governance.
The governmental landscape is littered with information technology projects that have failed to deliver the promised benefits, have experienced huge cost overruns or have been abandoned.
The poster child is the state’s most ambitious technology project, called the Financial Information System for California, or FI$Cal for short,  launched in 2005 as a one-stop application for managing state finances. It has consumed more than a billion dollars, is many years overdue and is not likely to be completed until sometime in the next decade, if ever.
The common denominator, demonstrated anew in the 911 project, is the effort to create something new, rather than relying on systems with proven functionality — which is the bureaucratic equivalent of reinventing the wheel.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/080819-911-Center-SF-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

The meeting can be viewed virtually at this link by entering the password “Council2.” 
The council, formed earlier this year by state lawmakers, is tasked with overseeing most of the money won from companies that contributed to Mississippi’s opioid epidemic — a public health crisis that’s led to over 10,000 deadly overdoses since 2000. State officials have been receiving tens of millions of settlement dollars since 2022 but haven’t spent the money on anything other than attorneys’ fees yet. 
Earlier this year, organizations across the state and country submitted 126 applications for money overseen by the council, which the office of Mississippi Attorney General and Council Chair Lynn Fitch said in November has accumulated to around $100 million. The council members reviewed those applications in private subcommittees this fall and scored them on a 0-100 point scale. 
At the last meeting in November, the members agreed to use Tuesday’s meeting to more thoroughly evaluate 59 applications that scored highly on the scale. They also voted to review a roughly $9 million application for opioid wastewater surveillance, a concept State Health Officer and Co-Vice Council Chair Dr. Dan Edney said had little utility. 
Most of the money requested in the highly-scored applications are coming from organizations with at least one representative on the council. Some council members, applicants without representation and addiction experts said they thought the process has favored committee members’ organizations. Michelle Williams, Fitch’s chief of staff, told Mississippi Today that members of the council are leaders in addressing the state’s addiction crisis, and it would harm the state’s public health response to exclude them from the application process. 
State law requires the council to submit recommendations to the Legislature by Dec. 7 — 30 days before the start of the 2026 regular legislative session. During the session, lawmakers are expected to approve or deny those recommendations and begin appropriating the state’s opioid settlement money.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/03144450/Opioid-Settlement-Fund-Advisory-Committee-meeting1.jpg,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

Vaughn RMC is one of 50 rural hospitals that are eligible to receive funds through the Rural Hospital Investment Program. (Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)A state board Monday approved a system of distributing private donations to rural hospitals, based on need. 
The Rural Health Investment Program Board will use three weighted criteria to approve the allocation of the money, made available through legislation passed earlier this year that created a dollar-for-dollar tax incentive program for individuals and businesses that donate to rural hospitals. 
“We just did a simple table where the hospital with the greatest need would get 100 points, the second greatest need would get 99 points,” Wesley Ashmore, vice president of finance at the Alabama Hospital Association, told the board Monday during its virtual meeting.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The board will use three weighted criteria to score hospitals’ needs. The “quick ratio” weight is current assets divided by current liabilities and accounts for 50% of a hospital’s rank. “Operating margin” is determined by the hospital’s net income from services to patients divided by operating revenues and accounts for 25% of the rank. “Uncompensated care” accounts for 25% and is determined by the hospital’s uncompensated care divided by operating expenses.
Each hospital is ranked on each weighted category, Ashmore said, which is then averaged for the hospital’s overall rank. Lake Martin Community Hospital ranked first overall and will fall into the first tier. Lake Martin and nine other hospitals will receive 30% of undesignated funds. 
Greene County Hospital ranked last overall and will fall into tier five. Greene County and nine other hospitals will receive 10% of undesignated funds. The board did not have all of Green County Hospital’s data, which led to its position.
Alabama State Treasurer Young Boozer complimented Ashmore’s methodology.
“It’s easy to understand, and I think it’s going to be a very positive impact and it will be something that will be able to be used for some time,” Boozer said.
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. Alabama is one of ten states that has not expanded Medicaid. Alabama’s hospitals have long pushed for expansion, saying it would help hospitals on the brink of collapse survive, but Republican leaders have resisted it.
While Alabama House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program.  
The donation program approved by the Alabama Legislature earlier this year has an annual statewide cap of $20 million for 2026, $25 million for 2027 and $30 million for 2028 and beyond. It requires a 10% match from local communities. 
In November, board members and Danne Howard, president of the Alabama Hospital Association, said the program will help, but would not save a hospital in danger of closing.
“It was never intended to be something that would prevent or save all of the rural hospitals, because it can’t, it won’t,” Howard said in an interview in November. “It is an opportunity for community engagement, for community support of their hospitals, to get some much needed cash into a rural hospital that has needs for something.”
The board approved funding for 50 hospitals at its meeting last month, which will be displayed on the Alabama Department of Revenue’s website. Donations made without designating a specific hospital will be distributed based on a weighted five-tier system. There will be 10 hospitals in each tier.
Alabama’s rural hospitals will also be receiving funding from the federal Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that was signed into law this summer. It distributes $50 billion in grants to the states over five years for rural health care. According to a brief from KFF, a national health policy research organization, the fund could offset just over a third (37%) of the estimated federal Medicaid spending cuts in rural areas, which are projected to be $137 billion over ten years.
Gov. Kay Ivey’s office announced that the state submitted its application to the federal government last month. 
Rob Pearson, chair of the board, said he is happy with how the undesignated funds tier came together.
“I believe we’ve got something that the Legislature intended.If there’s any adjustments to be made, we’ll get back with them, but it’s certainly something that will be supported statewide,” Pearson said. “I look forward to seeing it improve our rural hospitals around the state.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VaughanRegionalMedicalCenter_McLelland12878-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

According to a news release, PNM has received close to 400 scam reports this year, and says scams tend to “spike during the holidays when more people are at home and are dependent on electricity.”
The scams involve people impersonating PNM staff and “using aggressive tactics to steal money and personal information,” including threatening “to disconnect customer electricity unless they pay within an hour with a pre-paid card.”
PNM says some telltale signs of a scam include:

urgent payment demands
prepaid gift card requests
caller ID “tricks” in which scammers “may use local-looking numbers or ones similar to your own to appear legitimate”
“impersonation tactics” involving fake callback numbers and “hold music that mimics PNM’s system—but with poor sound quality”

The Toronto-based corporation’s board of directors has authorized Barrick to explore an initial public offering that would consist of Barrick’s mines in Nevada as well as its Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic.
Barrick has mines spanning the globe — in South America, the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, and multiple African nations. 
Some of those projects have given the company headaches. A dispute over revenue sharing at a mining complex in the West African nation of Mali resulted in Barrick losing administrative control, the project getting shut down, and four employees detained for a year. Barrick announced last month that it entered an agreement that resolved the disputes, assured release of the employees, and would “pave the way for a constructive path forward.”
Shareholders have also groused about geopolitical risks and potentially inferior (compared to gold) economic potential at Barrick’s massive copper mining complex in Pakistan.
Barrick’s board earlier this year was reportedly mulling the sale of African holdings as well as the project in Pakistan.
Creating a North American subsidiary would stop short of that, while still providing shareholders some separation.
“We are singularly focused on driving improved performance and shareholder value,” Barrick CEO Mark Hill said in a statement announcing the prospect of a Nevada-centric subsidiary Monday.
An IPO for an entity consisting of Barrick’s North American mines “could give new and existing shareholders more optionality around jurisdiction in a pure gold company with growth,” Hill said.
Barrick is the operator of Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture with Newmont Corporation. Last year, the venture accounted for more than two-thirds of the gold mined in Nevada.
The price of gold has skyrocketed more than 60 percent in 2025, setting all time highs well above $4,000 an ounce.

Instead of demanding that school districts curb their spending, the task force suggested a process in which districts collaborate, with lots of support and help from the Agency of Education, to find ways to save money.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jack Hoffman: Seize the opportunity for a second chance on school reform.","Jack Hoffman is a senior policy analyst with the Public Assets Institute. Before joining Public Assets, Jack covered politics and state government in Vermont for 20 years. 


The Act 73 redistricting task force wrapped up their work, and they’ve given the state a chance to rethink the course of education reform it has been pursuing for the last decade.
Vermont communities, as well as elected leaders, should seize this opportunity to get us out of the ditch we’ve been in and refocus on what should be our priority: ensuring our kids have what they need to thrive. 
The 168-page draft proposal from the Nov. 10 meeting of the task force had a lot to digest. And it requires close reading because the proposal offers much more nuanced analyses of problems confronting the education system than we’ve seen from the administration or the Legislature in recent years. The task force also put out a more streamlined draft report along with an explanation of the changes. 
One of the group’s most important recommendations is to stop further forced consolidation of school districts, which fits with one of the task force’s guiding principles: do no harm.
It’s not that the committee opposes mergers. It recommends voluntary consolidation for some districts in certain circumstances, which was the state’s policy before passage of Act 46 a decade ago. 
Like all recent education reform plans, the redistricting task force focused on costs. But it didn’t offer the usual “we have to do something about Vermont’s skyrocketing education spending” refrain, which has pitted the administration and the Legislature against local school officials for too long. Instead of demanding that school districts curb their spending, the task force suggested a process in which districts collaborate, with lots of support and help from the Agency of Education, to find ways to save money.
The report includes examples of potential cost savings, and none of them appear to require an overhaul of the education financing system. For example, the task force pointed to areas where public schools have seen a rise in per pupil spending because they’ve lost students to independent schools. (School taxes are tied to per-pupil costs, so a decline in students can drive up taxes.) Fixing this would require changes to how we pay for tuition students, which is not addressed in Act 73.
The proposal also pushed back against some of the conventional wisdom that has grown up around Vermont’s education system, like the idea that larger schools are more efficient and produce better outcomes than smaller ones, or that small schools need to close because it’s the small communities that are losing students.
The report referenced other cost drivers, but not in much detail because they were beyond the scope of the committee’s mission. They deserve mention, though, because they go to the heart of perhaps the most consistent complaint about Vermont’s funding system: per pupil spending
Vermont spends more than most other states and has for a long time. In recent years, the cost of health care — especially mental health care — has been a big factor. But that’s a problem for many businesses and individuals in Vermont, not the fault of the school funding system.
The task force also noted that Vermont spends a bigger share of its education budget on social services than neighboring states. That’s in part because other states pay for services through the general state budget — and perhaps through county budgets in some cases — that Vermont covers through the Education Fund. Moving costs from the education fund to the general fund wouldn’t eliminate them, but it would relieve pressure on education property taxes — and lower Vermont’s average per pupil spending. 
Vermont saw an unusual jump in education spending and school taxes in fiscal 2025, which set off the current scramble to remake the state’s education funding system. But some homeowners are getting hit with tax increases not tied to spending increases. There are ways to address those jumps and make the tax system fairer without the disruption of more consolidation or upending the entire system. But that, too, was beyond the scope of the task force’s mission and can be addressed separately. 
What the redistricting task force has laid out is a more nuanced approach that has a better chance of gaining public acceptance than something imposed by Montpelier. It will require
addressing a lot of specific problems rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. And it offers greater opportunity for local community engagement, which is critical to making any change work.
At a time when democracy is under threat across the country, it makes sense to protect and preserve it here at home — for our communities and our kids.

(Getty Images)Indiana hospitals are making progress toward lowering health care costs, according to new national rankings and reports.
Multiple analyses highlighted Monday by the Indiana Hospital Association showed improved hospital pricing and more cost-effective care for Hoosiers.
Recent data from WalletHub placed Indiana as the 8th-best state in the nation for health care costs in 2025, up from 15th in 2021.
The ranking was based on multiple metrics: the cost of a medical visit; average hospital expenses per inpatient day at community hospitals; the cost of a dental visit; average monthly insurance premiums; the share of the population under 65 with high out-of-pocket medical spending relative to income; and the share of adults who forgo doctor visits due to cost.
IHA officials said the improvement reflects the impact of “hospital-led” efforts to contain costs and increase efficiency across the state’s health system.
The same WalletHub rankings placed Indiana 20th in the country for access to health care services and 36th for health care outcomes, which included rates for infant and maternal mortality; childhood immunizations; cancer incidence; and life expectancy.
Story continues below.
Health Care Affordability
 
Indiana placed 22nd in the overall “Best Health Care Systems” list.
IHA separately pointed to a 2024 Forbes report that ranked Indiana 24th out of 50 states in health care costs — a jump of 13 spots from its 2023 position as the 11th-highest.
Indiana was ranked the 10th worst state for health care in an earlier 2023 Forbes study due to a combination of high costs, poor patient outcomes and issues with overall access to care. The study emphasized a low number of primary care physicians per capita and high average insurance deductibles across Indiana, but the state received its lowest score for hospital care quality.
A different 2024 Forbes analysis ranked Indiana 7th worst for health care access, similarly citing high costs and lagging outcomes.
Hoosier hospital officials maintain they’ve increased price transparency and expanded tools to help patients compare costs and quality. Some of this was spurred by legislative efforts.
Further data cited by IHA shows that employer-based health insurance premiums have remained at or below the national average since 2020. The association suggested that reductions in hospital costs “are helping to keep premiums in check for families and businesses.”
RAND Corporation studies also show a “consistent” downward trend in hospital pricing, according to IHA. Indiana moved from the most expensive state in the 2019 RAND 2.0 report to ninth in last year’s RAND 5.1 analysis, surpassing eight other states in five years. 
IHA leaders have previously raised concerns about RAND’s methodology but said Monday that “consistent improvement across reports points to meaningful progress.”
Hoosier employers increasingly turn to self-insured plans to trim costs

“Indiana hospitals are committed to making care more affordable without compromising quality,” said IHA President Scott Tittle. “These rankings reflect the hard work and collaboration happening across the state to lower costs and improve access for Hoosiers.”
“Indiana’s trajectory stands out nationally,” he continued. “We’re controlling costs better than many states and making measurable improvements relative to the rest of the country.”
Additional IHA data shows a 7% drop in the share of median income spent on health care since 2020, and national rankings now place Indiana among the ten most affordable states for health care.
The improvements come amid broader conversations at both the state and national levels about rising health care costs.
Among the numerous health care measures signed into state law earlier this year, House Enrolled Act 1004 now requires some of Indiana’s largest nonprofit hospital systems to lower prices or risk losing their nonprofit status.
Under the new law, prices for patient services must be capped at or below the level in effect on Jan. 1, 2025, through June 30, 2027. Lawmakers said the move aims to rein in hospital charges and increase financial accountability.
The policy also mandates audited financial reporting and gives state regulators the power to enforce price caps if hospitals exceed pre-set benchmarks.
Lawmakers also enacted House Enrolled Act 1003, which bolsters medical billing transparency across providers. The law requires hospitals and other medical providers to give clear price estimates to patients, standardize billing practices and forbids surprise fees.

You would be forgiven for thinking Michigan isn’t even holding an election for governor in 2026. While the race exists on paper, in press releases and in campaign finance filings, […]","A milk carton with a 'missing' poster of U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) that supporters of Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt brought to Michigan Republican Party gubernatorial debate in Sparta, Mich. James was invited but did not attend. Oct. 29, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceNine months out from the 2026 Michigan gubernatorial primary, contenders for the Republican nomination are running like they have all the time in the world.
You would be forgiven for thinking Michigan isn’t even holding an election for governor in 2026. While the race exists on paper, in press releases and in campaign finance filings, few of the candidates have full-time staff, have spent meaningful money or have done anything more than make the rounds at rubber-chicken dinners hosted by county Republican parties. 
Republicans have a reasonably long front bench. Congressman John James, state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former Attorney General Mike Cox and former Speaker of the House Tom Leonard all bring experience, fundraising capability and established networks of support. The others — who I won’t even name — are unlikely to make the ballot.
And yet, for all the theoretical strength, almost none of these campaigns resemble a serious statewide operation.
Republicans, if they want to take back the governor’s office, must start running a real race.
The political dynamics of 2026 — an open seat after eight years of Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and an electorate that remains deeply divided — theoretically favor a strong Republican nominee. Add in the wildcard of Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan’s faux independent bid and the race is even more ripe for a win. 
But that nominee must first run a campaign worthy of the office.
That means hiring real staff and putting them out front. It means building out an organization in all 83 counties. It means spending money instead of hoarding it. And it means making a public case for why each candidate should be governor, instead of waiting for a Truth Social notification that may never come.
Ask party insiders who is actually managing these campaigns and the answer is often a shrug, followed by a comment about consultants “helping informally.” Aside from an occasional press release touting how much cash they’ve raised, the kind of structure expected at this stage simply isn’t there. 
Endorsements are similarly scarce. 
Normally by now, you would see state legislators, party officials and grassroots activists pick sides. You would expect candidates to have a chair in every county. As of this writing, only Leonard and Nesbitt have released endorsements — and even then, we’re talking about a handful of names, maybe a dozen at most. Do any of these campaigns even have a statewide steering committee, let alone a campaign chairman? The silence is telling.
Contrast that with Lieutenant Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Not only do the two Democrats do a stronger job touting endorsements, but their campaigns also appear to exist beyond the confines of social media feeds.
Among Republicans, it feels as if nobody wants to do anything substantive because President Donald Trump might post a late-night endorsement on Truth Social, thereby ending the race before it truly starts.
If that’s the strategy, it rests on shaky ground.
Trump’s 2026 endorsements have mostly focused on races for Congress. Whatever he ultimately decides, there’s little evidence he’s preparing to wade into the Michigan GOP’s gubernatorial primary. And even if he does, candidates cannot run a statewide campaign in a battleground state by holding their breath until absentee ballots drop in June. 
Elections are won by the candidates who show up. Right now, the would-be standard-bearers for Michigan Republicans aren’t showing up nearly enough.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA296081-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-02 07:57:19.474349

The latest twist came late last month when Attorney General Catherine Hanaway accused a company hired to collect signatures for the campaign of human trafficking. You read that right: Human trafficking. If […],"A polling location in Jefferson City (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Republicans have been doing everything they can to block a referendum to put the state’s gerrymandered congressional map on the 2026 ballot. The latest twist came late last month when Attorney General Catherine Hanaway accused a company hired to collect signatures for the campaign of human trafficking.
You read that right: Human trafficking.
If true, it would be a massive scandal — and a grave tragedy. But so far, the only evidence Hanaway has cited are “reports.”
After she made the initial accusation on social media, we sought clarification from her office on where she heard these allegations, what “reports” she was referring to and what led her to believe they were credible enough to seek assistance from ICE, the federal agency that enforces immigration laws.
Her office didn’t respond.
A few days later, Hanaway issued a statement announcing she had launched a formal investigation into the allegations. So we asked again for any information about the source of these claims. And this time, Hanaway’s office was quick to respond to tell us that because there is now an active investigation, no information can legally be released.
Welp…
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee seized on the news, using it in a Black Friday–themed text blast to warn Missourians not to sign petitions from a group being investigated for “improper conduct.”
At the center of the accusation is Advanced Micro Targeting — the Dallas-based firm hired by a PAC called People Not Politicians to collect signatures. The allegation is that AMT is bringing undocumented immigrants into the state to assist with the campaign.
To put it another way, at a time when many immigrants — regardless of their legal status — live in fear of being detained and deported, AMT has allegedly been able to convince some to stand outside of government buildings with clipboards.
AMT has strongly denied the accusations. According to the company, all signature gatherers are vetted through the federal E-Verify system. Every petition form lists the name of the signature gatherer, and all forms are reviewed by a notary who checks the signature gatherer’s ID.
Adding to the drama, AMT filed a federal lawsuit alleging four consulting firms are involved in an effort to pay AMT employees to abandon their work, turn over any signatures they gathered and badmouth the company — all to sabotage the petition drive.
Some employees, according to the lawsuit, were offered up to $30,000 to quit and provide “intelligence” to opponents of the referendum.
In a recording provided to The Independent by a supporter of the referendum, an individual who approached signature gatherers in Kansas City is heard identifying himself as an employee of one of the firms named in the lawsuit, Let the Voters Decide.
Let the Voters Decide, which is based in Florida, called AMT’s litigation a “bogus lawsuit” full of “absurd claims.”
And so here we are: an alleged sabotage campaign; an immigration investigation; a federal lawsuit; and a litany of procedural roadblocks.
The GOP is pulling out all the stops to keep the gerrymandered map off the 2026 ballot.
It’s understandable. Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected the General Assembly’s actions all but twice — including overturning a congressional map in 1922.
The fight over Missouri’s gerrymandered map seems destined to spiral deeper into political intrigue. What began as a dispute over lines on a map has now become a test of the state’s democratic backbone.

State Rep. Jim Murphy of St. Louis used the first day of pre-filing for the upcoming legislative session to introduce a bill to ban solicitations that include recurring donations. The bill also requires each solicitation to state “in a clear and conspicuous manner” the candidate or political action committee that will use the money.
“If you want it, you have to call them back every month,” Murphy said.
The bill, he said, is in response to a report in The Independent last month about how Eigel — who is running in the Republican primary for St. Charles County executive — is continuing to reap donations from people who gave to his unsuccessful bid for governor in 2024.
How a Nebraska veteran unwittingly became a repeat donor to a Missouri county campaign

Eigel attracted the out-of-state donors with strident messages on issues like immigration and by embracing Donald Trump, which drew a rebuke from the president’s campaign for using his name without permission. His campaign relies heavily on the work of a political action committee called BILL PAC, which provided $150,000 during the second quarter of the year.
BILL PAC solicitations this year have continued in the same vein. One sent in November accused Democrats of scheming to make citizens of undocumented immigrants, “permanently rigging the elections to vote Democrats for generations.” 
Another, headlined “Antifa Insurrection Warning,” told recipients: “They want to destroy our country through violent uprising to install a Socialist ‘utopia’ where the law of the land comes from leftist ideology, not morals or principles.” 
The appeals never mention Eigel or identify the purpose of BILL PAC, which is named as the recipient in small type at the bottom of the emails.
“I can’t speak to the motivation or what they were trying to do when they did what they did,” Murphy said, “but I don’t think it’s transparent enough, and I don’t think it’s fair.”
Eigel’s campaign did not respond to a message seeking comment.
The bill is the only one of more than 1,100 pieces of legislation filed Monday — 599 in the state Senate and 515 in the Missouri House — that addresses recurring political donations. The session starts Jan. 7.
The use of a pre-checked box to turn single donations into recurring donations has been incorporated into fundraising strategies for Democrats and Republicans and are often missed by unsophisticated donors, especially retirees.
Other states have proposed similar bans. Pennsylvania’s legislature considered a ban on the fundraising tactic in 2023, but it didn’t advance very far. New Jersey lawmakers pushed for a ban this year after reports in Politico about the fundraising of a Republican candidate for governor. 
The Federal Election Commission recommended a federal ban on pre-checked recurring donations in 2021 but Congress has not acted.
Russell Wood, 92, of Cambridge, Nebraska, agreed to make a donation to Eigel’s campaign for governor in 2023. The single donation became a recurring weekly donation that stopped for only a few weeks in 2024 between Eigel’s campaign for governor and county executive when he did not have an active committee.
Wood’s donations, $30 each week, totaled $1,050 by Sept. 30, the closing date of the most recent disclosure report. Reached by telephone Monday, Wood said he has not heard from the Eigel campaign since speaking to The Independent and he has been unsuccessful in stopping the payments.
There are additional charges on the latest bill from the credit card he used, Wood said. He called customer service to end the payments, he said.
“The person I talked to was a nitwit,” Wood said. “He said ‘we can’t do that without (the Eigel campaign’s) approval.’”
Wood is one of 141 people nationally — including six from Missouri — who made multiple donations to Eigel’s 2024 campaign for governor who are also contributors to his St. Charles County executive race. 
One retired woman in Texas, who made 143 donations to Eigel’s campaign for governor, has contributed $1,205 in 74 separate donations since December 2024.
Wood said he’s tried contacting the national Republican Party to stop the contributions, which he said were made initially in 2023 to support Republican candidates in five states. He is determined, he said, to stop the outflow of money.
“I am going to put the kibosh on this,” Wood said.
Eigel is relying heavily on the money from out-of-state donors to finance his campaign. The three-way primary includes incumbent Steve Ehlmann, executive since 2007, and Jason Law, mayor of Lake St. Louis.
Of the 1,074 itemized donations reported through Sept. 30 to Eigel’s campaign committee, only 11 are from Missouri, representing seven individual contributors. Only four live in St. Charles County. 
There are more contributors to Eigel from New Jersey, Florida, Texas and California than Missouri.
An independent political action committee formed to back Eigel’s political activities, BILL PAC, is also heavily dependent on recurring and out-of-state contributions. Of 3,679 itemized contributions this year to BILL PAC this year, only 137 are from within Missouri. Fewer than half that number are from constituents who could actually vote in next year’s county executive election.
The practice of autochecking boxes for recurring donations is “misleading, at best, and deceptive, at worst,” Murphy said.
“I’m here to protect our citizens,” he said. “I didn’t think that they were being properly protected, so therefore we’re going to try to fix it.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022724_eigelfiling1-scaled-e1741631637688-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-02 07:57:19.474349

Advocates urge people to avoid blaming an entire community for the actions of an individual after an Afghan man was named a suspect in the shooting of National Guard members.

Federal immigration officials recently announced plans to re-examine the green cards of individuals from “19 high-risk countries” and conduct an assessment of country-specific factors for pending and future immigration requests, stirring worry among Vermont’s Afghan community, advocates say.
The announcement from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services came after an Afghan man was named as the suspect in the Wednesday shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. — Sarah Beckstrom, 20, who later died, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, hospitalized in critical condition.
The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, previously worked with the CIA in Afghanistan and was among more than 190,000 Afghans admitted into the U.S. after its withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
The same day of the shooting, USCIS wrote on X, “Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”
Later, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow posted on Facebook that USCIS halted all asylum decisions “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”
Molly Gray, executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, released a statement on Thanksgiving Day condemning the attack on National Guard members and affirming the organization’s support for Afghan allies in Vermont.
“The President’s response is deeply harmful, and spreads misinformation about Afghan allies and veterans who risked everything for this country,” the statement said, observing that the actions of one person shouldn’t be attributed to the entire Afghan community.
Afghans spent 21 years supporting U.S. missions in Afghanistan and risking their lives, and they fled to avoid persecution by the Taliban, the statement said. 
Afghans who resettled in Vermont contribute to the state’s workforce and economy, Gray told VTDigger. About 650 Afghans live in Vermont, working in fields such as manufacturing, health care, engineering, the service industry and small businesses, she said.
“It’s important that state leaders condemn the attack, but also ensure that Afghan community members across Vermont are not targeted and continue to feel safe and welcome,” Gray said, sharing that Afghans living in Vermont have already contacted the Alliance expressing their concerns.
According to a memo obtained by the Associated Press early last week — before the shooting — and signed by Edlow, the Trump administration was already planning a review and re-interview of all refugees admitted in the U.S. from Jan. 20, 2021, to Feb. 20, 2025.
But no official guidelines have been released on the matter, and local groups working with refugees are still waiting to see who is going to be impacted and how.
Tracy Dolan, director of the Vermont Refugee Office, also expressed her concern for the National Guard attack in D.C. and said the Afghan community is saddened by what happened.
“We’re hopeful that people understand that one person doesn’t represent an entire group, just like one refugee doesn’t represent all refugees,” Dolan said.
Dolan also emphasized that refugees who come to the U.S. are highly vetted in a process that can take months or even years.
“That is not just looking at any kind of criminal or legal history that they might have from where they’re coming from, but it also involves interviews and documentation of where they’ve been and who they’ve interacted with,” she said. “It is extensive, and it goes through several layers.”
Dolan said the Refugee Office plans to have meetings with refugees to support them and answer any questions they might have.
Gray said the Vermont Afghan Alliance will also work with attorneys statewide “to support Afghans as issues arise and reviews or re-examination happens.”

(Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)A whopping 13 Democrats and a single Republican filed petitions Monday to get on the ballot for the special primary election to replace Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in Congress.
Most of the would-be candidates are not a surprise. They started announcing their bids to replace Sherrill, a Democrat, even before she won the governor’s race on Nov. 4. She resigned from Congress effective Nov. 20, leaving a vacancy in the 11th Congressional District until Jan. 3, 2027.
The special primary is slated for Thursday, Feb. 5.
The Democrats who hope to compete in the primary are: Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett; Army veteran and businessman Zachary Beecher; attorney and comedian J-L Cauvin; former Sherrill intern Marc Chaaban; former Obama staffer Cammie Croft; Maplewood Committeeman Dean Dafis; Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill; Morris Township Committeeman Jeff Grayzel; ex-Rep. Tom Malinowski; ex-Sen. Bernie Sanders advisor Analilia Mejia; Chatham Councilman Justin Strickland; Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way; and community activist Anna Lee Williams.
On the GOP side, Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway is the sole candidate.
Most of the would-be candidates filed far more than the 500 signatures needed to win a spot on the ballot for the special primary. The deadline to file objections to petitions is Friday.
The Democratic winner will face Hathaway on Thursday, April 16.
Sherrill, who becomes governor on Jan. 20, said she won’t be weighing in on which candidate she supports. Gov. Phil Murphy (D) urged voters to cast their ballot for Gill, who managed Murphy’s 2017 gubernatorial campaign. U.S. Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) endorsed Malinowski.
The 11th District includes parts of Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties. When Sherrill was first elected to represent it in 2018, she was the first Democrat to win the district in decades. Its boundaries have since been redrawn to make it easier for Democrats to win. It went for Democrat Kamala Harris over Republican Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race by nearly 9 points, and Sherrill won it in last month’s gubernatorial race by about 15 points.

“Let’s say I went to St. Vinnie’s [thrift store], got a bat, and a ball. Okay, $1.10 for both of them. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball,” said Mitchell Nathan, a math learning sciences professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, at a November public hearing before the Assembly Education Committee. “How much was each item?”
Nathan pushed them for responses. Some lawmakers murmured it would be $1 for the bat. One added that that’s only if there is no tax included. Others didn’t respond. It was Rep. Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls) who provided the correct answer of $1.05.
Nathan told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview that he wanted lawmakers to think more concretely about math education as they consider ways to improve it.
“[Brill] got it right because she actually did the math,” Nathan told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. “She actually sat down and carefully thought it through, instead of just reacting and applying quick numeracy… It felt like a good opportunity to just have people experience what they were talking about, so it wasn’t just all abstract. I thought it was important for me as a learning scientist to clarify that what we might know and what we might take away from legislation on the science of reading doesn’t immediately map over to mathematics.”
Lawmakers are seeking to mirror the work that they did on reading education in 2023 under Act 20, which sought to ensure schools focus on teaching the “science of reading.” The new reading law used $50 million in funding to help with costs related to curriculum and literacy coaches and established an Office of Literacy within DPI. 
Lawmakers’ proposal to improve math education is more modest than the literacy efforts.
Coauthored by Rep. Karen Hurd (R-Withee) and Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), AB 615 would require schools to implement three numeracy-based tests per year for students starting in kindergarten through eighth grade. 
“The goal of this legislation is to identify students who are falling behind in math and to implement corrective measures to ensure these students stay on pace with their peers,” the lawmakers wrote in a cosponsorship memo. 
The bill comes as Wisconsin, like much of the country, has not recovered to pre-pandemic performance levels on math assessments.
Lawmakers expressed concern that Wisconsin students’ performance in math on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a congressionally mandated assessment, has declined. 
In 2019, 45% of Wisconsin fourth grade students scored a proficient level on the NAEP, and in 2024, 42% scored proficient. In 2019, 41% of eighth-grade students were proficient, and in 2024, 37% were considered proficient. 
Wisconsin also has one of the largest achievement gaps in the nation between Black and white students. In 2024, 5% of Black fourth-grade students in Wisconsin scored at or above the proficient level in math on the NAEP as compared to 51% for their white peers.
Under lawmakers’ proposal, screenings would need to be “valid, reliable, research-based, and predictive of future mathematics achievement” and be designed to identify students who are at risk of not meeting grade-level standards. An amendment to the bill would require DPI to maintain a list of recommended numeracy screening assessments on its website. 
Schools would also need to implement personal mathematics plans for each student identified as at-risk on two consecutive tests. The plan would need to include “quality math tutoring.”
Math teachers and education experts and the Department of Public Instruction (DPI), however, have expressed concerns that the bill would not have the intended effect of boosting achievement.
“Numeracy” testing to measure proficiency 
Republican lawmakers and the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), a conservative nonprofit legal organization which recently published a paper on reforming math education in Wisconsin, are focusing on “numeracy” — just as they focused on “the science of reading,” as a way to boost achievement. 
In lieu of action from lawmakers, WILL has been encouraging local school districts to adopt a model policy that seeks to “foster numeracy across all schools in the District in an effort to increase mathematical proficiency in all students.” The organization has also worked with ExcelinEd, an national education reform nonprofit group founded by Republican Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, on the effort.
In the paper, WILL defines “numeracy” as “the ability to understand and work with numbers, including place value, arithmetic operations, and their real-world relevance.”
“When students are numerate, they are able to use math in everyday life, not just in the classroom,” a WILL memo states.
Eric Kuennen, a mathematics professor at UW-Oshkosh who spends time teaching future math teachers, said WILL is using a good definition of “numeracy.” He said it touches on ensuring students can “comprehend mathematical concepts, operations and relations” and are able to do “procedures flexibly and appropriately” as well as building “logical thought, reflection, explanation, critical thinking and problem solving” skills.
Kuennen said, however, he is concerned about whether everyone has the same interpretation of numeracy and cautioned against making comparisons between “numeracy” and the “science of reading.”
“With a more narrow focus, [numeracy] can be more concerned [with] just knowing about facts — knowing your addition tables… or being able to do a procedure,” Kuennen said. He also said that “mathematical reasoning and reading literacy are very different things, and our math education experts are aware of that.”
“What may work well for reading and literacy is not what is necessarily going to work well for mathematical literacy or numeracy,” he said.
The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction identified a similar concern in opposing the bill. 
“We do not believe the answer to improving math outcomes lies in creating state laws in a construct that is like 2023 Wisconsin Act 20. The body of research around improving math, and existing state actions around math improvement, are not the same as state-led efforts to improve reading,” the agency stated.
The current DPI math standards were adopted in 2021 with the input of teachers and other stakeholders to provide a teaching framework centered on reasoning, procedural fluency and conceptual understanding, according to the agency.
The bill would require elementary and middle school students through the eighth grade to take three additional tests a year including one before day 30 of the school term, one in the middle of the term and one no later than 45 days before the last day of school. Those tests would need to focus on numeracy. 
Kuennen said testing is a “double-edged sword” that is needed to assess learning but can get in the way of learning as students and teachers may feel more pressure to train for performance on tests rather than focus on learning. 
Nathan of UW-Madison said the approach in the bill is worrying to him because a legal emphasis on numeracy could hinder students’ math education. He said there needs to be a balance. 
“I think we would be in terrible error as a state if we said we’re not going to let kids study other more advanced ideas until they achieve some mastery level numeracy,” Nathan said, adding that the state should not act as a “gatekeeper” of other math like trigonometry and calculus.
Nathan, who noted his comments are his personal views based on his research and experience and not the positions of UW-Madison, told the Examiner that numeracy is a “core building block” of math education and that Wisconsin schools are “absolutely” already teaching it.
“We are doing numeracy, and we do a pretty good job with numeracy,” Nathan said. “Why we have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels is not a simple thing to answer, and it’s almost certainly not going to go away or turn around the other direction just because we do more assessing.”
Funding pressures
Several math education experts and teachers expressed gratitude that lawmakers are discussing the issue, but said they are concerned that lawmakers are just giving schools an unfunded mandate that will do little to advance math education. 
Kuennen said he was surprised by the content of the bill. Having read WILL’s paper, he said the organization presented “great information” and “really good recommendations,” but the proposed bill leaves a big gap between the two.
In addition to early screening, WILL has recommended that schools implement more targeted teacher training, flexible coaching models to support math instruction and regular reporting of math achievement.
“There’s nothing in [the bill] about supporting teacher professional development. There’s nothing in there about funding teacher professional development, or funding having math coaches in elementary school,” Kuennen said. “This bill seems like it’s just an unfunded mandate for schools to implement additional testing. The irony is that the motivation for this bill is that our students are testing poorly, so our recommendation is to do more student testing. We already know the problems and we know the solutions, but I think the real issue is the solutions that work costs money.”
Republican lawmakers and supporters of the bill have cited successes in other states as they urge Wisconsin to take action, including by advancing the bill. At least seven states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Virginia and West Virginia, have implemented new laws related to numeracy and math education.
Alabama has seen the most growth in the nation for math scores in recent years. Its growth comes after years of low NAEP results, including a ranking of 52 — at the bottom of U.S. states and territories — in fourth-grade math in 2019. The state passed a law in 2022 that overhauled its math education. In recent years it has jumped up rankings to 32nd, with students nearing national averages. Alabama is the only state whose math scores have reached its pre-pandemic levels.
Wisconsin’s fourth-grade students were above the national average for math proficiency and its eighth-grade students ranked third on the NAEP in 2024.
Nathan said the legislators’ use of the Alabama/Wisconsin comparison was a great example of the need to dive deeper into the math concepts they are considering.
“If you’re really low to start, you have a lot of room to move up, and if you’re scoring quite high, you don’t have a lot of room to move up, so those are important contexts in which to interpret these numbers” Nathan said. He added that “what Alabama is doing — which is seemingly helping Alabama a great deal — is backed by a lot of money.”
Alabama’s Numeracy Act adopted in 2022 was expansive — replacing the state standards, establishing an Office of Mathematics Improvement, providing new instructional materials, implementing professional development for teachers and hiring elementary math coaches as well as monitoring student progress and offering summer school to struggling students. As of 2025, Alabama’s increased its investment in its initiative by $27 million, bringing its overall investment to $95 million.
Unlike the literacy overhaul, the current math proposal from Wisconsin lawmakers doesn’t include any funding.
A Department of Public Instruction fiscal estimate warned the bill would create ongoing fiscal pressures for local school districts and the state agency. 
“Because the bill lacks dedicated funding or reimbursement mechanisms, implementation would rely on existing budgets to be absorbed within existing resources,” the estimate stated. “While the precise financial effect is indeterminate, the bill’s long-range fiscal implications include sustained cost growth, resource diversion and possible equity challenges across districts.”
Local school districts would incur costs related to screening administration, data management, tutoring provision and plan development, and those districts with lower proficiency rates would face added costs for creating math achievement plans.
DPI would have to handle recurring costs to develop, update and maintain the tutoring provider database, public reporting systems, and model achievement plan as well as to provide professional development and technical assistance.
Republican lawmakers and Will Flanders, WILL’s education research director, have acknowledged that the bill would not be as expansive as the literacy law.
“Folks are questioning whether this is sufficient enough intervention,” Flanders said at the public hearing. “There is wisdom in starting with a little bit of a lighter hand because we’re not quite as bad in math as we are in reading.”
However, math education stakeholders are skeptical that implementing more testing will do much for teachers and students.
“If this is the first step, I don’t think it’s the right first step. It’s telling us things we already know,” Kuennen said. “I think a good first step would be to ask the DPI, what’s really needed, and ask the teachers and schools in Wisconsin what’s needed.”
Kuennen said the math education crisis is not new in the U.S. and that the state “shouldn’t panic and do something just to do something” and that Wisconsin has an active community of mathematicians, educators and professional organizations, all who are concerned with math education in the state.
From his perspective, the state needs a “balanced, measured approach that listens to all the experts we have in our state and the needs of the teachers — talk to the teachers, talk to the districts, see what they need and then work to change the priorities, the funding priorities of the state.” Specifically, Kuennen said schools need more time and more money. 
“We need it to be a higher paying job so we can recruit and retain more high-quality teachers. They need time to plan during the school day. They need time to meet with their fellow teachers to collaborate. They need time to meet with students one on one. They need more time to have dedicated to math lessons,” Kuennen said. “The real solutions are more time and more money.” 
Jennifer Lawler, coordinator of secondary mathematics and science for Kenosha Unified School District and president-elect of Wisconsin Mathematics Council, noted in written testimony that 71% of school districts lost state funding in the 2025-26 school year and the requirements in the bill would further stretch budgets and time constraints.
“While some students require additional time and support to achieve at grade level, the provisions for ‘quality math tutoring’ are vague and appear to be an effort to funnel taxpayer money into private, unregulated tutoring companies and/or unproven Al tutoring programs which school districts can ill afford,” Lawler wrote. “The additional testing requirements and the required time for tutoring would also further reduce students’ opportunity to learn science and social studies, as well as engage in fine arts and physical education.”
Nathan said there are many reasons why performance has not rebounded to what it was before the pandemic. One key concern he identified is the turnover of teachers during and after the pandemic. 
“We’ve lost a lot of teachers who had a lot of experience,” Nathan said. “As a state, we have made it less appealing to be a public education teacher than used to be the case. We’ve taken away a lot of rights and benefits and also just publicly come out, blaming teachers for a lot of problems.”
Kuennen said there will not be a “quick fix” to the state’s math education troubles. He pointed to the efforts of Winskill Elementary School, which saw over 80% of students who were advanced or meeting expectations in math in 2025 after bringing in math coaches and taking other steps to help improve math education. Along with local districts that are taking their own step, DPI has said it is working to improve math education in the state.
DPI has said it is working on a statewide plan to provide guidance to school districts on math that will include recommendations for elevating number sense and operation sense, implementing high quality math instructional materials, providing interventions and more learning opportunities, implementing systems to track student progress and building math identities for students and elementary educators. 
“You can’t just do one thing. You can’t just say, ‘OK, what’s missing is this numeracy screening or what’s missing is this particular book or anything,” Kuennen said. “It’s really a cultural shift in how elementary school teaching is structured.”

Gretchen Whitmer last week joined governors from six other states signing onto a petition demanding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency add microplastics to its program collecting data on contaminants not currently covered by the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Led by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, the petition requests the EPA include microplastics in the next Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, which would develop a monitoring program for drinking water across the country, potentially leading to further regulation. 
Microplastics are small pieces of plastic between 1 nanometer and 5 millimeters wide. They have been found in every ecosystem on the planet as well as in food, beverages and in human and animal tissue.
While the health impacts of these materials is still being researched, exposure to microplastics is suspected to harm reproductive, digestive and respiratory health and could be linked to colon and lung cancer. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Although the EPA was expected to release a proposed Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule in November with a final rule expected in December, the agency has yet to issue the proposed rule. 
Under a provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA must include a contaminant on the monitoring list if it receives a petition from seven governors, unless it determines that monitoring a substance would block them from monitoring a contaminant presenting more of a public health concern.
Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Delaware Governor Matt Meyer, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, and Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont were the other governors on the petition. 
In a statement, Tami Renkoski, co-founder of the Michigan Microplastics Coalition praised the governors’ decision, emphasizing the need for data to determine the scope of the issue. 
“It takes guts to lead these days, especially on environmental issues but this is a bipartisan issue that will only continue to get worse if we don’t start doing something now,” Renkoski said. “The health of our children, grandchildren and many ecosystems is at stake. Thank you, Governor Whitmer, for having the guts to lead on this issue.”
Wenonah Hauter, the executive director of Food & Water Watch similarly praised the move. The organization filed its own petition with the EPA last year, calling on the agency to monitor microplastics under the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
“This is a momentous step towards gathering critical information we need about the emerging crisis of microplastics in drinking water,” Hauter said. “We thank Governor Murphy for his leadership on this petition and Governor Whitmer and all the governors that have joined him in this vital effort. We now call on the EPA to grant this petition and get to work. People have a right to know about microplastic contamination in their drinking water.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/plastic-pollution-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 06:56:28.622882

Fremont County is an unlikely place for an orchestra, but a dynamic cellist has kept one alive and growing there for 40 years.
The post Maestro Murdock orchestrates classical music culture in central Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","The musicians seated on stage, ranging in age from about 12 to 80, included college students, nurses, retirees, veterans, siblings and outdoor educators. All wore black. 
Holding their violins, French horns, flutes and drumsticks at the ready, they turned their collective gaze to the small woman climbing the perch before them. Rebecca Murdock lifted her delicate baton, and the music began. 
Murdock doesn’t fit the typical conductor mold. She is female, for one, in a position long dominated by men. With her diminutive stature and reserved demeanor, she isn’t what jumps to mind for a task so public and expressive.
As she conducted the orchestra through “Jupiter” from Gustav Holst’s “Planets” series, she kept her movements fairly tight, right hand waving in time, head nodding, eyes finding the musicians to cue, left hand joining in on more emotive moments. A small contained dance. 
The orchestra played. The performance, tight and polished, earned standing ovations. 
The scene could unfold in any number of American cities, but it’s less expected in small-town Wyoming. Fremont Symphony Orchestra, based in Lander, has fielded an orchestra in a town of less than 10,000 people for decades. Today it performs two full orchestral concerts a year and brings world-class soloists to the stage as guests to play alongside the 30-odd resident musicians. 
“I would dare to have anybody find a symphony like this in a town of 8,000,” Murdock said. She’s yet to come across anything similar. “I think it’s kind of one-of-a-kind.”

How does the Fremont Symphony Orchestra do it? It’s got a few things in its favor, the most notable being Murdock at the helm. She has been an integral part of the group for its entire 40-year history, as a cellist, as conductor, as private music instructor and as the behind-the-scenes director — booking rehearsal space, advertising shows, organizing logistics and securing guest artists. 
“Becky’s a force, and she always has been,” said bass player Kate McKeage, who has been playing with Murdock since the ‘80s. “When she has goals in mind, she just figures out a way to achieve them.”
Murdock has a deep store of musical knowledge, a no-nonsense standard of excellence and the energy and organization required to herd dozens of musicians in rural Wyoming into a cohesive symphony orchestra. 
She is uncomfortable with too much credit, however. Musicians, residents, business owners and community groups have supported over the years. 
“I couldn’t have done this without the help of so many people,” she said. 
Music before words 
Murdock was the youngest of seven children born to a musical family. Her mother was a piano teacher, and she would set her baby daughter on the bench during lessons. Murdock absorbed music early and without much effort.
“I honestly don’t remember a time when I didn’t know how to read music,” she said. 
Though she was born in Newcastle, Murdock grew up in Minneapolis. As a child, she chose the cello as her instrument in an act of defiance of her piano-playing forebears. Right away, her school string teacher insisted she have private lessons, Murdock said.  
“My mother said ‘no, I can’t afford private lessons,’” she said. “And he said, ‘OK, I will come over to your house one night a week and teach her.’”
After about a year, that teacher felt Murdock had grown beyond his teaching abilities, she said, so he found a woman in the Minnesota Symphony who could take over tutelage.

“And of course, by then, my parents said, ‘You’re paying for the lessons,’” she said. “So I babysat at 50 cents an hour for 14 hours a week, so I could pay for my $7 weekly lesson.”
Later, she studied music at the University of Wyoming in what was another act of defiance — this time against a father who forbade the music major. In her first semester, she met Michael Murdock; they married a year later. After college, he got a job in Fremont County and they moved to Lander.
Back then, in the early ‘80s, the few avid musicians in the area found one another, Murdock said. Around 1984, she and a small group of string players began playing together regularly. 
“We started a small chamber group,” she said, “and that was kind of the start” of the Fremont Symphony Orchestra. 
“But it certainly wasn’t called an orchestra then.”
Murdock never thought she would be in Lander permanently, and in the mid-’80s she and Michael moved their small children to Washington, where she secured a coveted spot in the Spokane Symphony. But this followed a major mining bust in central Wyoming, which made it difficult to sell their Lander house and sever ties. 
They returned in 1987. By then, the chamber group had turned into a string orchestra. But the UW professor who had been conducting the group was getting older. He asked Murdock to take over. 
She accepted the baton and has directed the group ever since. 
More than wand-waving 
Yes, yes, it looks simple. Stand on an upturned box in front of musicians and wave your arms like a bird. Punctuate the air now and then with the baton. Et voilà — you are a conductor. 
The reality is, of course, worlds away. In her home office, Murdock pulled out sheet music that she conducts to. It’s what’s known as a full score, which means it includes the musical parts for every instrument. It’s dizzying to look at, let alone try to understand. 
But that’s what she does, somehow keeping organized in her head when to cue the horns and when to slow the strings’ tempo and the precise moment when the timpani can crash. 


Murdock learned the basics of conducting in college — it’s a standard part of a music education. When she stepped into the FSO conductor role, the professor who preceded her gave her lessons to hone her skills. 
Starting with a string orchestra, which was only four parts, helped her learn, she said. The music has grown more intricate as the group grew into a full orchestra. 
Conducting is complicated brain work, Murdock said. “You have to really know what you are doing,” she said.
As she practices her cello every day, she also faithfully practices conducting prior to a performance — two hours a day, every day, for eight weeks. Murdock practices by playing YouTube videos of different orchestras and going “over, and over, and over” until she has the work memorized. 
“She definitely knows the music,” said Clara Cox, a viola player from Laramie who played as one of the 19 “imports” (along with her siblings and mom) in the most recent performance. “She knows when people have wrong notes or when they miss an entrance, and she’s good about working on those things. She also takes input, which is really nice. I think some conductors don’t do that so much.”

Cox, who is studying viola and harp performance at the University of Wyoming, said her appreciation for the conductor’s job has grown as she’s learned more about music.  
“You have to know so many different parts,” she said. “There might be 30 different parts, and you have to know all of them, and know the tempo changes, or how a piece starts, or know all the little nuances … It’s a lot of work. It’s very intellectual.”
Dvorak to Disney 
The orchestra grew in fits and starts. Early on, Murdock and cellist Beth Shipley juggled the duties of organizing and performing. They added brass in the ‘90s, Murdock said, and welcomed high school and Central Wyoming College players, and Murdock created a youth orchestra. The group became a nonprofit with a volunteer board in 2010. That helped it leverage grants and donations. 
Making a symphony’s finances work is difficult, she said. Music is expensive and ticket sales don’t cover costs. In the early years, Murdock said, “I begged and borrowed and stole music from people.”
Those later grants and gifts helped it grow. When Shipley passed away in 2017, her family made a $10,000 donation to the group. “That kind of got us off the ground to where we could hire soloists.” 
That includes the likes of renowned pianist Richard Dowling, who strode on stage during the recent Lander performance in a sequined blazer, sat down at a grand piano and dazzled the crowd with solos of Mozart and Addinsell. 
Murdock, who has spent many years traveling to other places as an “import” player, also relies on her large network of musical connections to bring in quality players to help flesh out the group. She makes a special effort to ensure they have nice accommodations, she said, thanks in part to generous lodgers who donate rooms. 
In addition, Murdock is a private instructor, which creates another pool of musicians to draw from.

Fremont Symphony Orchestra still has a “very low budget,” Murdock said, but it has a strong reputation for professionalism in a community that’s supportive of the arts. Where Murdock once had to search high and low for musicians, now she has to turn people away. 
The group has performed everything from difficult Dvorak pieces to the orchestral suite from “The Lion King” with an 80-voice choir. The group’s standards have inched up and up. That includes Murdock’s conducting. 
‘Highly unusual’
Nancy Brumsted first heard of the Fremont Symphony Orchestra when she was a Jackson music teacher. After retiring, she and her husband moved to Lander. She immediately got in touch with Murdock to audition and got in. 
“I couldn’t believe that in a small town like Lander, we had something like this,” said Brumsted, who now sits on the board and plays violin. 
“It’s such a high level of quality,” she said. “It’s really exciting to be able to play with a group of musicians that are so accomplished.”

The existence of the orchestra in rural Wyoming is “highly unusual,” McKeage said. Murdock has built up a funding model, a supportive community and high-caliber musicians, she said. “It wouldn’t have worked in every community, but she made it work in that community, and that’s a real tribute to the community too.”
Murdock said she’s driven by a desire to give musicians the opportunity to push themselves and audiences the opportunity to learn and enjoy classical music.
“She is small, but she is mighty,” Brumsted said. Murdock’s high standards of excellence rub off on the musicians, she said. “She’ll call us on it if we’re not doing it correctly. We have to be on our toes, which I also love, because I want someone that cares that much.”
Lander is better because of Murdock and music, Brumsted said.
“We definitely would not exist without her,” Brumsted said. “She’s really dedicated her life to it, and we’re all richer as a result. It’s such a gift to the community.”

Ranchers and researchers tout futuristic technology's benefit to working lands and wildlife.
The post Virtual fences keep cows in and barbed wire out on Wyoming ranches appeared first on WyoFile .","Dustin Taylor left the gate open when he kicked hundreds of cows into one of his pastures this fall. That particular gate had been a source of endless frustration. It’s in the middle of an elk migration corridor, and each year anywhere from 100 to 1,000 elk pour through, tearing down fences and often becoming tangled in barbed wire in the process.
That all changed this year.  
Over the summer, he adorned 50 cows with shiny black collars and turned on an invisible electric fence that gave the cattle a beep and then a shock if they tried walking through the open gate. Soon after, he placed collars on hundreds more. 
Then he watched as elk flowed through his open gate, and his cows stayed put. 
Taylor, owner of the E Spear Ranch outside of Meeteetse, is one of a growing number of ranchers across Wyoming and the West using virtual fences, a more sophisticated version of invisible electric fences people have been using for years to keep their dogs in their yards. Proponents of the virtual fences say they’re a way to not only lower the number of fences draped across the West but also to give landowners imminently more flexibility in how they move and manage their cattle on a complicated landscape.

For ranchers like Taylor, they’re another useful tool on the same harsh landscape his great, great-grandfather settled in the late 1800s. 
“I like the traditional ways. We’re pretty much a saddle horse operation, and so it kind of makes you think when your cows are all wearing collars that glisten in the sunshine and have an LED light in the nighttime,” Taylor said. “But it’s a win-win with us. We’re not getting elk trapped in fences and cut up in wires and they’re not tearing our fences down. We’re able to better manage our use with wildlife interests.”
A dream comes to life
For decades, researchers and ranchers have dreamed of virtual fences, a way to contain cows that didn’t require spending tens of thousands of dollars building and fixing fences and a way to track cows as they move in real time. But for many of those decades, the technology felt as futuristic as perhaps what a smartphone would have felt like in 1980. 
And while the technology is here, it’s still in its “brick phone stage,” said Drew Bennett, the University of Wyoming’s MacMillan Professor of Practice in Private Lands Stewardship. 
“If you think about where cell phones were in the 1980s, you carried them around in a suitcase or there was the Zack Morris brick phone,” Bennett said, referencing the popular show “Saved by the Bell.” “Then think of where we are with iPhones today. They are the same technology, but in name only, not in functionality. We need to be anticipating where this technology will be in 10 years.”

While technologically advanced, the concept behind virtual fencing is still relatively simple. Unlike an electric fence for a dog around a backyard, which requires burying a line underground that reacts to a dog’s collar, virtual fences operate using solar-powered towers scattered around a rancher’s land. The 20-foot-tall towers act as intermediaries between a cow’s collar, a satellite, and a rancher’s phone or computer. If a rancher wants to, say, change the perimeter of a grazing pasture, he or she needs only to open the computer program and modify the size or area of the fence. 
Cows, for their part, require minimal training, said Taylor. 
The collars first beep at a cow when the animal approaches an electrified fence line. If the cow keeps walking, it receives a small electric shock that pushes it back. 
Cows can push through the fences, but rarely do once they’ve acclimated to the beeps and small shocks. 
Ranchers may actually benefit from cows, when needed, walking through the fence, said Travis Brammer, director of conservation at PERC, the Property and Environment Research Center.
Predators like wolves sometimes use physical barriers like fences to trap and contain prey. If cows, while being pursued as dinner, can simply keep running through the beeps and shocks, they have a much higher likelihood of reaching safety.

As virtual fence companies evolve, they’re creating programs that will then beep on one side of the cow’s head until it turns back toward its assigned pasture, essentially herding it back home.
Ranchers require variable numbers of towers depending on the virtual fence company and, especially, the particular ranch’s topography. A tower in a flat landscape can cover 10 to 20 square miles. Pastures with steep cliffs and bluffs require more. 
Ranchers piloting the collars say it’s been a learning process, and like all new technology, it’s come with its fair share of glitches, including collars falling off, software updates and issues with slow internet.
But many of those are actively being solved, said Brammer. 
Bennett asks ranchers to think less about what the technology can do today and more about where it’s headed because the conservation benefits, he said, feel almost endless. 
Thinking about the future
The biggest, most obvious benefit of collars is the reduced need for actual, physical fences. 
In fact, more than 620,000 miles of fence likely covers the West, enough to stretch to the moon and back. 
And most agree that adding more fence means causing more problems for wildlife, impeding migration, ensnaring legs and preventing access to desirable food. 
The technology, Taylor and Bennett point out, won’t rid the West of all its fence lines. Wyoming is a fence out state, so even if one rancher’s cows have collars and respond to virtual fencing, a neighbor’s cows may not, which means perimeter fences will still be needed. 
However, the bulk of fencing is actually internal fencing, those separating pastures. Virtual fences can get rid of those. Taylor said this year he did not build fences he had planned to construct because of the collars.

As for conservation benefits, Bennett’s team at the University of Wyoming is publishing a paper detailing how virtual fences can allow ranchers to give creeks and rivers a reprieve from cows and prevent fences from being washed out each year during spring floods. They can concentrate cattle in an area to help battle invasive species like cheatgrass, alert a rancher if a cow isn’t moving and needs to receive medical help, and even use grazing cows to target fine fuels in fire-prone areas. 
Virtual fences also open land to grazing that had been off limits because it was too difficult to build fences. It can also be used to replace fences destroyed in wildfires.
The Property and Environment Research Center, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and local conservation districts are holding workshops across the state to introduce the idea to more ranchers. 
“This is a potential win for natural resources, biodiversity and wildlife, and a win for ranchers,” Bennett said. “When we think about where it’s going, we are limited only in our own creativity.”

Replacing residential property taxes with a higher, more volatile and regressive state sales tax is a terrible idea, opines columnist Kerry Drake. 
The post ‘Tax swap’ bills punish poor, enrich wealthy homeowners appeared first on WyoFile .","Have you ever wondered how a bad bill manages to work its way through the Wyoming Legislature?

Opinion

Here’s an example of a particularly disturbing one that’s only partway through the process: It started when Sen. Bob Ide, R-Casper, proposed eliminating all property taxes last June. That move would have cost Wyoming a whopping $2 billion in tax revenue.
His phony rationale was that the tax breaks the Legislature approved in the last two years — including a 25% reduction on the first $1 million of a home’s fair market value — were too complex. Gee, how could taxpayers determine what exemptions they qualify for, when and how to apply, and which forms are required?
So, to fix a non-problem that he and other far-right legislators created, Ide had a eureka moment: Just abolish all property taxes! He convinced colleagues on the Joint Revenue Committee to have staff draft such a bill.
A constitutional amendment is required to eliminate any state taxes. A resolution must be approved by two-thirds of both the House and Senate, then put on the ballot in the next general election. It would need a simple majority to pass.
But there were many problems with Ide’s proposal, beginning with $2 billion in lost revenue from eliminating residential, commercial, industrial and personal property taxes. How would the state make up the loss of so much money?
Ide proposed raising the state’s sales tax, which would be just about the goofiest thing Wyoming could do.  
“A sales tax is the only way we’re going to muck out all of this layered minutia of property taxes,” Ide said. I’m surprised he could say that with a straight face.
Opponents immediately detailed the folly of this approach. The state’s 4-cent sales tax raises about $950 million yearly. That’s more than a billion dollars short of what all of Wyoming’s property taxes annually raise, so the state sales tax would have to be at least doubled to make up the difference. 


Why would anyone think the average Wyomingite wants to pay 8 cents in sales tax, on top of 1-to-3-cent optional city and county sales taxes for local projects? 
By the committee’s next meeting in August, much had happened to change the state’s tax landscape. Those skyrocketing property tax hikes that prompted the tax breaks had fallen to normal levels in many counties. 
Opponents of the 25% across-the-board tax break had correctly predicted the Legislature’s failure to “backfill” the lost property tax revenues that fund public services like police, fire protection, parks, libraries, roads and other infrastructure would force small cities and counties to make substantial and unpopular budget cuts.
The panel also learned not everyone agreed with the Legislature making more property tax breaks a top priority, much less eliminating the taxes.
Laurie Longtine of Casper was one of about two dozen homeowners who urged lawmakers against further property tax reductions.
“Property tax is how we pay for the things we value,” Longtine said. “It is a responsibility we accept as part of being a caring member of our communities. It is a part of how we take care of each other.” 
Last Wednesday, the committee voted 9-1 to sponsor a watered-down version of the bill that would only eliminate residential property taxes. It voted 8-4 for a “trigger bill” to raise the state sales tax by 2 cents if the amendment is approved by voters. 
It’s still a terrible idea that should die a quick death when the general session starts in February, but it may not. Lawmakers know anything that lowers the tax burden on voters is a great campaign issue, and many will be willing to pass a sales tax increase if they can sell the notion that it’s the best way to equalize taxes for all.
But it’s a laughable claim. A sales tax is a regressive tax, because it requires a greater percentage of income from people with less ability to pay, and a smaller percentage from those with higher incomes. The fact that everyone is paying the same 4-cent tax on goods doesn’t make it “fair.”
Let’s call the Joint Revenue Committee package what it is: reverse-Robin Hood measures that take from the poor and give to the rich. It benefits the rich entrepreneur in Jackson way more than the blue-collar miner in Gillette.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities described the tax changes Wyoming lawmakers are considering — swapping property taxes out for sales taxes — as making state and local taxes “even more rigged in favor of the wealthy.”
The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a progressive think tank, said that on average, the lowest-income 20% of taxpayers face a state and local tax rate nearly 60% higher than the top 1% of households. 
Beth Blackwell, the city of Newcastle’s grant and loan specialist, testified that moving to sales taxes, a more volatile revenue source, will make it difficult for local governments to budget effectively.
“Listening to all of this, it makes my stomach hurt in the sense that you are cutting off the legs of our communities and pulling the blanket out from under them,” Blackwell said.
“Eliminating residential property tax is not reform, it’s destabilization disguised as relief,” said Josephine Carlson, a Wyoming resident. “Property taxes fund the backbone of community safety.”
Another concern is that special districts like hospitals and community colleges are only funded by residential property taxes. The committee’s bills do not address how special districts that have chosen to tax themselves for local projects and build institutions will make up the lost property tax revenue.
Wyoming Department of Revenue Property Tax Division administrator Ken Guille said these special districts may also have incurred debts, based on borrowing assessments drawn from their local property taxes. Who will pay these loans off?
The timing of this major taxation change is concerning in light of the decline in state and federal support for local governments. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities advised states not to pass bills like this any time, but especially when costly private school voucher programs threaten to defund public schools, and federal budget cuts will shift the cost of paying for health care, food assistance, education, and other investments further onto state and local governments.
The good news is that the two bills must survive the legislative process, and this is such a bone-headed move that even the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which controls the House, may not be able to sell it. But if the Legislature manages to pass both measures, voters will have the final say.
There’s still plenty of time to kill this tax swap, but don’t sit on your hands and waste a chance to let your legislators know it’s a move in the wrong direction. It will hurt low-income people and allow wealthy homeowners to make even more money by not having to pay property taxes.
Legislators, put this dud in your proverbial box of bad bills and don’t ever let it out.

(Getty Images)As a group of Idaho lawmakers looks to improve the state’s child custody laws, at least one legislator believes a group of reforms passed in wake of tragedies in Utah and Pennsylvania may present a template. 
In 2024, the Utah Legislature passed Om’s Law, a bill meant to prioritize child safety in custody proceedings that was named for 16-year-old Om Moses Gandhi, who was killed in a murder-suicide by his father during an unsupervised, court-mandated visit in 2023. 
Murdered boy’s mother speaks in House committee to advocate for Om’s Law

Months before Gandhi’s death, his mother Leah Moses, had gone to Utah lawmakers seeking the legal reforms because of her yearslong custody battle in which she felt the courts did not consider her evidence of Gandhi’s father’s abuse, the Utah News Dispatch reported. 
Utah’s law adopts provisions of a federal Keeping Children Safe From Family Violence Act, known as Kayden’s Law for Kayden Mancuso, a 7-year-old girl shot and killed by her father during a court-mandated visit in Pennsylvania in 2018. 
Idaho Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, first heard about Kayden’s Law through his work as a member of the legislative Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force. 
“It just seemed to fit into exactly what we were trying to get at with this task force, if you’re really looking at the No. 1 goal is to make sure that children don’t suffer through the process of these custody battles,” Bjerke said. “But if we’re going to have any true effect, we have to protect the innocent party.” 
Bjerke mentioned the law at a few of the task force meetings, including one Nov. 11, in which members discussed priorities for legislation recommendations. The task force plans to meet again to approve its recommendations for fellow lawmakers, who will return to the Capitol for the 2026 legislative session on Jan. 12. 
Bjerke said he can’t speak for the rest of the task force, but plans to advocate for something modeled after Kayden’s Law. 
 What is Kayden’s Law?

The federal act, passed by Congress in 2022 to amend the 1994 Violence Against Women’s Act, incentivizes states to make changes such as addressing the definition of abuse and adding past assault convictions not related to the child to what should be considered during custody disputes.
In cases where a parent abused family members, the law requires only supervised visits with children in most cases. The federal law recommends that the court train judges on domestic violence and child abuse, and only accept expert testimony from those who are qualified and credentialed to work with abuse victims. 
The law prohibits reunification treatment, which is therapy meant to repair an estranged parent-child relationship in high-conflict divorces, if there is no evidence it is safe and effective. It also prohibits removing a child from a safe parent to do the therapy if one parent has a history of abuse, and requires that the reunification therapy be administered by professionals if the therapy is going to be mandated.
Colorado in 2023 became the first state to pass the law in its entirety, ProPublica reported. Utah became the second, shortly followed by Pennsylvania. Other states have enacted portions of the law.

 How would the law work in Idaho? 

Bjerke said he learned about the law from attorneys and others who work in family law issues, and he liked that it provides a proven template that’s been approved in other states. 
“We don’t have to be first in everything,” Bjerke said. “We shouldn’t be last in everything.” 
He identified in particular the prohibitions around unsupervised visits if there’s a history of abuse as portions of the law he’d like to see enacted in Idaho. He also liked the additional training requirements. 
He knows that it’s a difficult balance, especially in Idaho that has passed multiple laws focused on elevating parental rights. 
“If someone is determined to have had a history or criminal background that is abusive to a spouse or children … we’re wrestling with those parental rights, but if you really care about making sure that you protect children, you’re probably going to have to have only supervised visitation until something maybe can be proven,” Bjerke said. 
The task force cannot pass legislation, only make recommendations. The committee members are working to bring proposed legislation to its next meeting, scheduled for 10 a.m. on Dec. 10. 
Task force co-chair Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, told the Sun in an email that she and other members are considering Kayden’s Law, among others. 
“Yes, we are looking into everything!” Scott responded to the Sun. “Hoping to have another meeting to discuss more about the legislation ideas.” 
Bjerke’s hope is that kids in these situations might have more limited exposure to abuse.
“I’m not naive enough to know that we catch everything,” Bjerke said. “But if we can lessen the degree that somebody is just going to keep that cycle going because they were so abused through the process, I just think that’s a great way for us to concentrate our efforts.”

Nov. 4, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Supreme Court Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke says his first year leading the judicial system was a “learning curve” of trying to “keep the ship afloat” and move forward.
Funke, in a broad interview with the Nebraska Examiner a few days after his November anniversary as chief justice, said he better understands what the Supreme Court does as the administrative body for the judicial branch. He saw closely what former Chief Justice Mike Heavican did daily for nearly 20 years.
“My job was to kind of keep the ship afloat and keep it moving forward,” Funke said.

Now, a year after succeeding Heavican, Funke said he didn’t fully appreciate everything Heavican did.
“He was a self-driven individual that just really was dedicated to the job,” Funke said of Heavican. “I wouldn’t even say 50 or 60 hours a week. It was 70 or 80 hours a week. He was 24/7 doing something as chief justice, and he did it for 18 years.”
Passing the torch
A first-generation lawyer in his family, Funke said he hoped he was ready to be chief, a step up from his early dreams of one day becoming just a county judge, a milestone he achieved in 2007. He later became a district judge in 2013 and an associate Supreme Court judge in 2016.

Funke said Heavican set a “high bar” for the Supreme Court, and many of its initiatives over Heavican’s tenure came from his ideas and focus. For example, taking Supreme Court oral arguments to high schools, allowing media to bring cameras to trial courts, expanding juvenile probation, creating the Office of Public Guardian and leading statewide summer tours.
“For a long time, I think people just thought it was seven people in the Capitol making these decisions in secret,” Funke said of the Supreme Court. “Really, what we do is we get input from lots of different people, and then we make those informed decisions.”
According to Funke, Heavican, who Funke said often described the courts as the “forgotten branch of government,” saw ways to embrace what the judicial branch did. Funke said Heavican wanted the public to understand the importance of the courts and the impact on their lives.
The judicial branch budget
Funke’s first six months as chief justice coincided with the 2025 legislative session, where state lawmakers and Gov. Jim Pillen, who had promoted Funke in October 2024, had to contend with a structurally imbalanced state budget and a major projected budget deficit.
Funke’s first four to five months in the chief position were about promoting the “good work” of the judicial branch while educating people about the branch’s budget, about $250 million annually and about 1,700 employees.
The core function of the judicial branch is to operate district and county courts in all 93 of Nebraska’s counties, Funke said, plus separate juvenile courts in the three largest counties and the appellate-level Court of Appeals and Supreme Court.

There are also a few dozen problem-solving courts where judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement, community members and more work with high-risk, high-need individuals for individualized, alternative outcomes. These intensive programs aim to support individuals and reduce the likelihood of them reoffending, while also seeking to save taxpayers’ money.
Problem-solving courts include veterans treatment courts, adult and juvenile drug courts, reentry courts, mental health courts and family treatment courts.
Funke said the bulk of a judge’s work is ensuring cases are heard in a timely fashion and that they have the resources they need to do so. The court system also seeks to help people feel comfortable with a judge’s processes, how they make their decisions and why.
“Not everybody’s going to agree with it, but at least they may better understand we did listen to the evidence. We heard all sides. We were fair. We were impartial,” Funke said. “And we based our decision on the facts of the case and the law as the Legislature has adopted it.”

There are about 150 judges statewide who annually deal with close to 335,000 cases each year, Funke said. Of those, about 300,000 are in county courts, another 34,000 are in district courts and about 1,000 are considered by the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court.
The judicial system also runs probation, with about 15,000 to 16,000 adults in the system on any given day, Funke said. There are nearly 3,000 more juveniles on probation daily. Probation consists of a “huge” portion of the court system’s budget and employee count.
About 850 adult convicted felons are in problem-solving courts working to try to rehabilitate their lives to have convictions set aside. There are another 1,300 people on post-release supervision and 400 people through the Office of Public Guardian who need someone to help decide housing, medical care or financial decisions because they can’t care for themselves.
The court also assists individuals with behavioral health, drug and alcohol treatment, transitional housing, education, job placement, domestic violence prevention training and more.
“We’re doing a lot of different things in probation to try to avoid people having to go to prison so that we don’t have an incarceration state and we don’t spend even more taxpayer monies on these types of criminal activities,” Funke said.

The court’s budget is relatively small in the total state budget, Funke said — about $5.5 billion from the state’s general fund, primarily from income or sales taxes each year — but “we take that part of it very seriously.”
Attempted budget veto
In May, Pillen tried to veto nearly $12 million from the Supreme Court budget, criticizing the courts for spending more in recent years. However, Funke and other court staff have said those increases have come because lawmakers passed bills to create and fund new initiatives, or told the courts to add programming with existing resources.
Even still, some widely supported legislative programs, such as a nationwide model justice program for all veterans, remain delayed and legislatively unfunded.
Court staff had said the vetoes would close some problem-solving courts and other services. Some lawmakers had begun preparing to defend the programs from Pillen’s judicial vetoes. The cuts to the courts would have been more severe without a last-ditch effort to restore $3 million in one of the final rounds of budget debate.
“Every branch of government must contribute to balancing our state budget,” Pillen said in his May 21 veto message.

The Legislature said the Pillen vetoes weren’t properly submitted according to the Nebraska Constitution, and the governor ultimately backed down after consulting with Speaker of the Legislature John Arch. Had Pillen fought the Legislature, it could have been the Supreme Court deciding a constitutional challenge. Pillen later accepted responsibility for the veto “mistake.”
But budget adjustments are likely back on the menu for 2026, Pillen and Arch have said. Pillen has suggested he might seek to revive the vetoes. All this came before Nebraska’s budget situation worsened, largely from revised economic forecasts. Lawmakers face another nearly $500 million budget hole to fill.
Doing more with less
Funke said the current state budget allowed the courts to continue all programs and services. However, he said the judicial branch, similar to all other areas of government, has an obligation to be a good steward of tax dollars. That includes a “deep dive” into court finances and efficiencies, an endeavor that has been ongoing for the past six months.
“We have to make sure that we continue that high level of output but do it with less money,” Funke said.

This could mean utilizing technology to find efficiencies or having judges travel less between courts in their judicial district, such as more remote hearings. It could also mean more problem-solving work to try to save money elsewhere.
“But at some point, we’ll have to decide: What services do we get the most bang for the buck?” Funke said, adding that “realistically,” some services will need to end in 2026.
In the end, Funke stressed the judicial branch is a separate and equal branch of government.
“They may control the purse strings and how much budgetary monies we get,” Funke said of the executive and legislative branches. “But we are a separate branch, and we have to make the decisions based on what we think is best for the citizens of the state.”
Funke added: “I think we’re doing that, and I’m proud to put us up against other judiciaries across the country.”
‘Real people’
Funke has sought to continue Heavican’s work of openness and transparency for the courts. He was a trial judge when Heavican looked to bring cameras into trial courts, which expanded statewide by 2017. Funke said it has been effective and was an early supporter of the initiative. The courts now livestream public interviews for judicial applicants, too.
Funke also praised the continued work of going to high schools for oral arguments, of which many high schoolers would likely never hear. Supreme Court judges spend 20 to 30 minutes after answering student questions.
This could include federal issues, trust and confidence in the courts or social issues, some of which judges can respond and others they can’t. The Court of Appeals also goes to high schools, and both have taken oral arguments to law colleges, too.

In early November, the Supreme Court hosted oral arguments at Connestoga High School, which Funke said is about 25 miles from where he grew up in Nebraska City. He said it was nice to be in his neighborhood and that students hopefully saw he’s “just like them, just a lot older now.”
“We’re not some abstract figure,” Funke said, adding it helps judges be seen as “real people.”
As a trial judge, Funke said he spent lots of time coaching youth sports, including football and basketball. His wife coached volleyball. Funke was also heavily involved in high school sports, serving as the public address announcer for football for 25 years at the high school his children attended. 
“As much as a judge can be involved in the community, I got involved in the community, and I enjoyed it,” Funke said, adding he was not alone among judges.
He emphasized that the courts are only as effective as the public has trust and confidence in the courts, so he takes it upon himself to advocate for his branch. He said he has not turned down any interviews or speaking opportunities since becoming chief.
Vacancies and public scrutiny
Funke said this is also important as the courts face a decline in applicants for judicial vacancies.
Just two applicants recently applied for the Omaha-based vacancy on the Supreme Court for now-former Justice Lindsey Miller-Lerman, who was appointed to the high court in 1998. Her successor, Justice-designate Derek Vaughn, a district judge, highlighted a similar challenge he hopes the Supreme Court can continue to address when Pillen appointed him last month.
If there are not at least two applicants forwarded to the governor to pick from, the process restarts. That happened recently during the search for replacement judges in Madison and Dawson Counties.
“I think now is an opportunity where we have to really kind of double down and redouble our efforts to make sure that we are doing all that we can do to explain the work of the judicial branch, demystify the process of becoming a judge,” Funke said.
Funke said part of this means uplifting that judges have personal lives, are public servants and are often hand-picked from their communities. For some prospective judges, donning the black robe could mean giving up a more “lucrative” legal practice where they could make more money, Funke said.
Supreme Court justices have a salary of $228,431.18. All other state judges are paid a percentage of that — 95% for Court of Appeals judges; 92.5% for district judges, separate juvenile court judges and Workers’ Compensation Court judges; and 90% for county judges.
Funke said there is also public scrutiny to consider. He said judges decide on the law and the constitution, “not based on what they think the law should be, what their own personal belief is or anything of that nature.”
Being from a small community, Funke said it could be difficult to make decisions where people knew him or his family. But he, like others, must set that aside. In recent years, Funke said scrutiny has intensified, which could be part of the reason for less interest in judicial positions.
Path to chief justice
Funke recalled suggesting to his parents that he wanted to go to law school when he was younger, and “we all had to figure out what that meant and how that would work.” One of his mentors was a neighbor, the county attorney for Otoe County, who later became a judge.
Funke would go on to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for an accounting degree before going straight to the University of Nebraska College of Law in 1991. In his third year of law school, Funke took a position back home as a deputy public defender for the county, a position he held for three years.
The following decade, Funke worked in the Otoe County Attorney’s Office and became a deputy county attorney for eight years. When the county attorney became a judge, county commissioners appointed Funke to the vacancy, and he was elected to the position. 
He also worked in private practice for 13 years after law school.

In 2007, a judicial spot opened on the Sarpy County court bench. Funke was one of a dozen applicants. Then-Gov. Dave Heineman appointed him in the southeast Nebraska district in 2007, which gave Funke experience in rural Otoe County, Cass County and a more metropolitan area of suburban Sarpy County, which he said was a “really good learning experience.”
In 2013, a district court spot for Otoe and Cass Counties opened, which happened to be the former post of Funke’s mentor. Funke applied, and Heineman elevated him.
Funke described the trial courts as “a place where you got your hands really involved in the process,” such as hearing from litigants, seeing witnesses, weighing the credibility of testifiers and evidence and ultimately making decisions.
Come 2016, with the retirement of Supreme Court Justice William Connolly, then-Gov. Pete Ricketts elevated Funke again. Funke thought to himself, “Those spots don’t come open very often.”
“If you want to give yourself a chance to be on the Supreme Court, you got to take them when you can get them,” Funke said.
Of all current members of the Supreme Court, all but one previously served as a trial judge.
‘Pride in the work we do’
The Supreme Court has heightened Funke’s focus not just on the law but on process and procedure, largely because appellate cases are dictated by jurisdiction and whether cases are done “correctly” before reaching the highest state court.
Funke attributed any success in the judicial branch to its public servants, including staff who have stayed for decades, as well as judges who make hard decisions most Nebraskans will never see or be reported on and won’t ever reach the Supreme Court.
“We take pride in the work we do. We understand how important it is to the citizens of the state, and people strive to do the best they can,” Funke said. “We’re fortunate that we have those people working for us.”

(Photo by Edward Saunders, used with permission). America’s current president in his constitutional role as commander-in-chief of America’s armed forces has publicly threatened even unto death those military leaders who conclude his orders are illegal and are not to be followed. Hugh Thompson, a courageous soldier decades ago, had something to say about that.
The sight sickened them. On March 16, 1968, near the South Vietnamese village of My Lai, shown as “Pinkville” on Army maps, Army helicopter pilot warrant officer Hugh C. Thompson, Jr. and his crew, Army specialist Glenn Andreotta and Army specialist Lawrence Colburn, saw from the air something they could not comprehend. But Thompson, an experienced combat pilot, knew something was terribly wrong.
They were flying aerial reconnaissance supporting Task Force Barker, a battalion-size U.S. infantry force from the 23rd U.S. Infantry Division. The task force was on a so-called search-and-destroy mission. However, after weeks of suffering casualties and enduring severe psychological stress from relentless enemy sniper fire and treacherous landmines, something broke inside the exhausted, overwrought, and angered infantrymen of Company C, First Battalion, 11th Infantry Brigade. A deep something, which binds the fundamental core of human existence. A fabric separating human from animal, from modern man to the primitive, and from decency to savagery.
Flying over the battlefield Thompson saw more than a hundred dead bodies in a water-filled ditch — women, infants, children and the elderly. He witnessed American soldiers rampaging and indiscriminately firing into, bayoneting, and sexually violating civilian noncombatants. Thompson, risking much, landed his small helicopter between the civilians and marauding leaderless soldiers. In an act of moral and physical courage Thompson, a man of principle, saved countless Vietnamese civilian lives. He was instrumental in stopping the ruthless massacre. For his actions that day, Thompson would later receive a medal for heroism.
On the ground Thompson confronted Army First Lt. William L. Calley, an inept Company C. platoon leader at My Lai. 
Thompson lashed out, “What’s going on here?” 
Calley replied, “Just following orders.” Calley would later be convicted of murder and sentenced in military courts for his actions at My Lai.
Wars in history have been fought generally for prize or plunder. Wars for liberty and freedom are new concepts in history. U.S. wars in succession through World War II had clearly defined objectives. After World War II, U.S. military objectives seemed clouded, answers not easily found as to the why.
America’s disciplined military proudly wear their uniforms, but they have not forfeited a personal conscience and a moral compass of right and wrong. The individual soldier, sailor, airman, marine, and coast guardsman, the flower of America’s youth, holds and implements military weapons of violence. 
These servicemembers are not mindless followers. They have the right to hear from their leaders as to what the military is doing, and if that is justifiable for America and for humanity. They have the right to know if their leaders have the physical and moral courage to husband their lives for a legitimate cause. A cause supporting who and what we are as Americans and what we stand for: liberty or tyranny; decency versus savagery. 
War is a complex dynamic, sometimes chaotic in a fog of violence. Humans fight wars. Humans who struggle with what they see versus what they feel. Military leaders often struggle to control and make sense of armed combat unfolding before them. (The author fought at the Battle of Khafji during the Persian Gulf War.) Even in war, moral considerations surface. Forces collide, be they forces of weaponry or forces of morality. The Golden Rule versus the bayonet. 
In time nations began debating the conduct of war. Nations agreed that in the human condition some things in war are acceptable, while others are not. Nations signed treaties and laws on how wars are to be fought by military forces. Even war has its limits.
Servicemembers of the United States armed forces swear an oath to defend the U.S. constitution and in effect, applicable U.S. laws. Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice mandates service members obey “lawful orders.” But in the fog of war with fierce combat raging or with ambiguous military or national objectives, what truly constitutes a lawful order?
Obeying military orders can, and many times do, put a servicemember in a vicelike grip: A grip of obedience versus a grip of refusal to do what a servicemember knows is patently wrong. Warrant Officer Thompson at My Lai faced this conundrum and responded with the resolute and fundamental decency of mankind.
At Nuremburg, Germany, immediately after World War II, victorious Allied nations put on trial military officers and officials from Nazi Germany responsible for mass murdering millions of innocent noncombatants and unarmed prisoners of war. Crimes against humanity. These Nazi defendants many times offered a defense that they were “just following orders.” Orders from their leaders the defendants deemed acceptable and lawful, including genocide.
The world disagreed with this defense, the so-called Nuremburg defense. America, indeed the world, said military armed forces must still follow fundamental laws of mankind and of human decency.
America must reaffirm this in its armed forces and have the moral courage to resolutely say no to orders deemed in contravention to the righteousness of liberty, decency, and what America stands for. Even if the orders come from the commander-in-chief.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Tuesday, Nov. 18 started out the way most other days had of late in the relatively brief life of Triangle-area resident Fernando Vazquez. Like so many children of immigrants who, despite being native-born American citizens, find themselves working alongside their parents at difficult, low-paying jobs that most of their fellow Americans are unwilling to take on – office cleaners, farmworkers, construction site helpers – 18-year-old Fernando showed up for work at a Cary construction site.
Unfortunately, it didn’t end in normal fashion.
As NC Newsline’s Brandon Kingdollar reported, while Fernando was walking back to work after buying a drink at a nearby store, he saw a group of masked men wearing dark glasses emerge suddenly from a group of unmarked SUV’s that had pulled up to the job site. Within a few moments, they had cornered Fernando behind a fenced-off HVAC area in which he had been trying to evade their attention.
“Where are you from?” one of the masked men demanded of Fernando as they handcuffed him and tossed him into one of the SUVs alongside another sobbing young worker.
Eventually, the masked men dumped Fernando – who was born in Raleigh and was carrying and displayed his North Carolina Real ID – in a parking lot a half mile or so from where they had grabbed him. They threw his wallet and ID cards out the window of the SUV as they sped off.
“I have no idea why they just dropped me off,” Fernando said later. “I kind of felt like I was being kidnapped.”
The men who carried out this terrifying assault like modern-day Klansmen or KGB thugs were, of course, by all indications, U.S. Border Patrol agents. Federal government employees. Your tax dollars at work.
This is the abysmally low place to which things have sunk in 2025 America during the second term of the nation’s autocrat-in-chief, President Donald Trump.
Across the nation – especially in jurisdictions in which politicians disfavored by Trump and his toadies have been elected to office – employees of the American government are riding into town unannounced and vigilante-like to round up people of varying immigration statuses and terrorize their communities. Almost invariably, the people in question are brown skinned.
And it’s just plain and irredeemably wrong.
Yes, it’s true that millions of people in this country are present without full legal authorization. And yes, it’s also true that a very tiny percentage of the people in this group are criminals who are preying upon others – mostly fellow immigrants.
But it’s also indisputably true that the overwhelming majority of the immigrants whose communities are subject to Trump’s terror tactics are, like the tens of millions of immigrants who preceded them (a group that included Trump’s own family), simple, salt-of-the-earth people looking for a better life.
They’ve come here to escape war, persecution and grinding poverty in their homelands and, quite often, to take on incredibly difficult and dirty jobs under conditions that few if any other Americans would find remotely acceptable.
Is the current immigration system broken? Of course it is. The need for reform that would provide millions of people with a realistic path out of the shadows and into full legal status has been overwhelming for decades. Right now, for most aspiring immigrants who lack wealth or light skin, such a path (or, at least, one that takes anything less than decades and vast sums of money) literally does not exist.
Indeed, the understanding and acceptance of this truth was so widespread as recently as early last year that Congress was on the verge of passing genuine bipartisan immigration reform/border control legislation. North Carolina’s senior Republican senator, Thom Tillis, was leader in the effort.
Tragically, however, that plan didn’t jibe with then-candidate Trump’s two-part scheme to make the demonization of immigrants the centerpiece of his campaign and to deny any kind of policy victory – even ones that were indisputably good for the nation – to the Biden-Harris administration. As a result, the plan was deep-sixed at Trump’s direction.
And so, here we are now, living in an unprecedented moment in the history of the nation that has long held itself out as the leader of the “free world.” It’s a moment in which masked employees of our government – many of them well-meaning individuals cynically misled into believing they are somehow helping to combat a “foreign invasion” – are employing terror tactics long reserved for the world’s totalitarian and authoritarian regimes.
Meanwhile, millions of good and honest people – many of them American citizens like Fernando Vazquez – must now go about their daily lives in constant fear that they too will be snatched off the street and secreted off to some domestic or foreign gulag.
Nearly a quarter century ago, a previous U.S. president undertook a global campaign that he called a “war on terror.” Today, it’s a shocking and sobering fact that the millions of caring and thinking Americans pushing back against Trump’s police state actions – people peacefully witnessing, documenting, protesting and organizing and lending moral support to their immigrant neighbors – now find themselves on the front lines in just such an effort.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4603-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 06:56:28.622882

(Getty Images)Despite compiling $2.2 billion in child support payments from 2020 through 2024, Louisiana was among the lowest ranked states and U.S. territories for such collections, according to an audit released Monday.
The Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s review of the Department of Children and Family Services’ Child Support Enforcement Program determined the agency collected nearly 56% of court-obligated payments last year from noncustodial parents. That rate was an improvement from 52% in 2020, but Louisiana still ranked 52nd out of 54 states and territories for child support collection. 
According to the audit, Louisiana struggles more than most states to collect current child
support because of the state’s high poverty rate and its low median household income. Based on federal estimates from 2019-23, the state’s individual poverty rate was 18.9%, compared with a 12.4% national rate. Its median household income was $60,023, compared with $78,538 nationally.
Louisiana also ranked 47th for collection of past-due child support, according to the auditor’s calculations, with the same reasons contributing to the delinquency. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Child support owed in Louisiana is also higher than other states, in part, because the state had a mandatory minimum child support payment of $100 until 2024, the Department of Children and Family Services explained to auditors. The Louisiana Legislature repealed the minimum, effective Jan. 1, 2024, and all child support orders since then have been based on a noncustodial parent’s ability to pay them. Court-ordered payments before that date have to be adjusted through a formal process, which Children and Family Services said could impact a noncustodial parent’s ability to pay them.
“Research shows that child support agencies struggle to collect payments because noncustodial parents can be difficult to locate, may have no income because they are unemployed, or report that their income is too low to have the ability to pay child support.,” the audit said.
There were 222,050 child support cases in Louisiana last federal fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2024. That number is down 14% from the 2020 count and in line with a national trend of decreasing case counts. The state attributes the decrease to reduced participation in federal assistance programs, specifically Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Louisiana law requires certain TANF recipients to make child support payments, but participation in the program decreased 63% nationally from 2010 to 2022 as the result of stricter qualifying standards. 
Children and Family Services has used employment and parental engagement programs to improve child support payment compliance, but federal support no longer exists for them. More than 2,600 noncustodial parents in Louisiana received employment and training services in the fiscal year that ended June 30, and the state collected nearly $334,000 in child support payments from them. The state ended the program at the end of July because the federal Office of Child Support Services did not approve its continuation, according to the audit.  
The audit also noted Louisiana improved its cost effectiveness for collecting child support. For every $1 the Department of Children and Family Services spent on collections, the state collected approximately $4.51 last federal fiscal year. The national average was $4.24.

The review also determined the state intercepted an average of $8.3 million annually in insurance claims from parents who owed child support payments. The audit suggested the Department of Children and Family Services could increase that amount if insurance companies that do business in Louisiana were required to share insurance claims data, which would allow the state to identify parents who owe payments and intercept claims. There are at least 12 states with laws that require insurance companies to share claims data, according to the audit. 
In its response to the legislative auditor, Children and Family Services said it will seek legislation to require insurance companies to check whether a parent owes past-due child support before issuing a settlement payment.
Other suggestions in the audit report for the Department of Children and Family Services include working with the Louisiana Department of Health to ensure all eligible Medicaid cases are referred to the agency for collection purposes. State law requires child support court orders include medical insurance for children. If a child is on Medicaid, the noncustodial parent must contribute an amount not to exceed 3% of their gross income. 
Children and Family Services said it is coordinating with the health department to ensure compliance with the referral requirement and has adjustments in the works.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sensoryexercises-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 06:56:28.622882

Sign up for Votebeat Michigan’s free newsletter here.
Despite being certified last week, the election for mayor of Hamtramck may be far from over.
City Council member Muhith Mahmood, the candidate who lost the Nov. 5 mayoral election by just six votes, is suing both the City of Hamtramck and the Wayne County Board of Canvassers to have more than three dozen uncounted votes included in the final total. The case has the potential to reverse the outcome of the election, a victory by engineer Adam Alharbi.
Due to what election officials have said was human error, 37 absentee ballots in Hamtramck were separated from the others and not counted on election night. When the ballots were discovered — opened, but still in their envelopes — in the city clerk’s office the following day, they were immediately sealed and taken to the county elections department.
But Hamtramck Clerk Rana Faraj later said three non-election officials had walked into the clerk’s sealed office on election night before the ballots were discovered, effectively breaking the chain of custody for those ballots and raising questions about their security. The Wayne County Board of Canvassers ultimately deadlocked on whether to count the ballots, resulting in their exclusion from the official results.
Not counting those ballots is “unconstitutional disenfranchisement,” Mahmood’s attorney, Mark Brewer, wrote in the lawsuit filed last week in the Third Judicial Circuit of Michigan, arguing that either the ballots should be counted or the 37 voters should be allowed to cast new ballots. The lawsuit is also filed on behalf of the 37 voters, whose names have not been made public.
Michigan election law requires absentee ballots to be tabulated, wrote Brewer, a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party (the Hamtramck mayoral election, however, is nonpartisan). To bolster his other proposed remedy, Brewer cited cases in Hawaii and North Dakota in which judges allowed voters to cast new ballots after their original ballots were challenged. According to Brewer, and Votebeat’s initial review of Michigan case law, it does not appear that Michigan has ever let voters recast ballots after an election.
“The vote margin in the Hamtramck mayor’s election is currently 6, far less than the 37 votes not tabulated,” the lawsuit noted. “Thus, not only are the constitutional rights of those 37 voters affected but those 37 votes could determine the outcome of the mayoral election thereby affecting every resident of Hamtramck.”
The goal, Brewer told Votebeat, is to ensure that all votes are counted — even if that means his client still doesn’t win the election.
“It’s all the principle here,” he said in an interview on Monday. “My client agrees that every vote should be counted, no matter what the ultimate outcome is. We’ll let the chips fall where they may.”
Hamtramck City Attorney Odey Meroueh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Wayne County canvassers also did not immediately respond to requests. Nabih Ayad, the attorney for Alharbi, Hamtramck’s mayor-elect, did not respond to Votebeat but told the Detroit Free Press he opposed counting the votes.
In its canvassing meeting the week before Thanksgiving, the Wayne County Board of Canvassers debated extensively on whether to count the 37 ballots in question. Republican members Lisa Capatina and Toni Sellars expressed concern over the broken chain of custody, while Democratic members Richard Pruess and Edward Keelean said they felt that the ballots should be counted and that further investigation was warranted.
Because the ballots had not been included in the unofficial tally, at least three of the four canvassers would have needed to vote to count them in order for them to be included.
The lawsuit asks for immediate consideration, but it is not clear when the case will be heard or resolved. Hamtramck’s new mayor is scheduled to take office Jan. 1.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The seven members of the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled unanimously in all but one of 105 written opinions issued in the past year.
The two years prior, the high court unanimously decided about 95% of its 272 written decisions. Exceptions included dissents in cases dealing with voting rights for felons, whether the state could be held liable in cases of child sexual assault and what constitutes a “single subject” for some legislative bills.

Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke, who joined the Supreme Court in 2016 and was promoted to the top job in November 2024, told the Nebraska Examiner in a broad November interview that justices “try really hard to get to a unanimous vote.”
“The reason we do that is our cases are stare decisis, a precedent for the lower courts and the attorneys, practitioners, to use as guidance. They’re binding authority,” Funke said. “We want to be able to say something as clearly as we can and as unanimously as we can so that trial judges have confidence that that’s what the law is.”
Oral arguments
The Nebraska Supreme Court consists of a chief justice, who represents the state at large, and six associate judges who each represent a different district. The Supreme Court looks at all appellate cases and decides whether to keep or send them to the state’s Court of Appeals, Funke said. 
Supreme Court justices get every seventh case, as assigned by the clerk. Justices then begin working the case up with the assistance of two law clerks on where it might go. Attorneys are scheduled to file briefs on their cases before oral arguments.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Judicial Branch)
At those monthly oral arguments, all justices have an opportunity to ask questions about cases beyond what Funke said is an often “sterile record” devoid of emotion or chances to weigh credibility and see witnesses live. It’s a chance to connect with attorneys who have “lived with the case” for two or three years, if not longer, but who justices have had in front of them for just a couple of months.
“It’s just an opportunity to really have a conversation about the case,” Funke said.
Crafting an opinion
Immediately after oral arguments, the Supreme Court justices head back to a consultation room behind the courtroom. The “author judge,” whose assignment is not announced publicly, leads the discussion and sometimes says how they feel it should be decided, pending feedback.
The lead judge then takes that information back and starts drafting an opinion, which can take a couple of weeks to a month, or even six months. It’s often circulated to other justices for review, with chances for other justices to ask informal questions or suggest changes.

Once the case is ready, it will be put back up for formal consultation — a weekly meeting every Wednesday at 9 a.m. — before a final vote on the case, which is recorded internally.
If a Supreme Court justice disagrees on the legal argument or outcome of a case, they can sometimes work with the author judge on small tweaks that, if made, wouldn’t materially change the majority’s decision on a case but could bring that justice more on board. It might also move a judge to “concur” with the outcome, but for different legal reasons.
Often, Funke said, a dissenting judge has already shared their view and already shared a draft. Justices can also “concur” if they agree with all or part of the majority opinion but do so by a different legal reason or want to bring up other issues they feel should have been addressed. Of the decisions issued in the past three years, about 10% included one or more concurrences.
If the assigned author judge happens to also be the dissenting judge, Funke said he’s seen that resolved in one of two ways.
One, the author judge won’t agree with the majority but understands the issue well enough to write how the majority wants it. The case might then be signed off as “per curiam,” without saying who wrote it, and the justice might still write a separate dissent.
Two, the author judge might ask the chief to reassign the decision. The resulting judge might take some thoughts from the first assigned justice.
Nebraska Supreme Court restores LB 20 and lets people with felony pasts register to vote

One rare case in recent years came in 2024, when a divided Supreme Court agreed to force Secretary of State Bob Evnen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers to comply with a new state law that gave voting rights back to convicted felons immediately after they completed their sentence, rather than two years after. It was decided 5-2 in favor of voting rights groups.
Every justice wrote in that case, plus the majority “per curiam” outcome. One justice concurred with the outcome but dissented with part of the majority opinion.
Supreme Court opinions are released every Friday morning, while the Court of Appeals releases its decisions every Tuesday morning. The day before, the courts announce what cases the courts expect to weigh in on.
A typical day-to-day
Funke said Supreme Court justices spend their days reading cases assigned to them and reviewing records, transcripts and attorney arguments on why a trial court decision was right or wrong. The remaining time, justices write, which Funke said is about 200 opinions each year.
Each Supreme Court member also has specific duties, such as overseeing probation, problem-solving courts, court technology, security or disciplinary complaints.
“Not what I would call super exciting on the cutting edge of activity, but we spend a lot of time in our offices reading and writing and preparing for court,” Funke said.
‘Fortunate and blessed’
Funke served as a trial court judge between 2007 and 2016 before joining the Supreme Court, which he said was a separate “baileywick.”
A “good” trial judge, Funke said — one who people respect and know will listen and hear evidence to make an informed decision — will often spend their days in trial but write decisions on nights and weekends. Trial judges then spend additional time researching and writing more opinions and orders “purely on what the law is,” Funke said.
There are about 150 judges statewide who annually deal with close to 335,000 cases each year, Funke said. Of those, about 300,000 are in county courts, another 34,000 are in district courts and about 1,000 are considered by the Court of Appeals or state Supreme Court.
Many judges spend time in and give back to their local communities, too.
Said Funke: “We are fortunate and blessed to have really good judges that just really remember where they came from and who they’re supposed to be serving.”

(Photo courtesy of New Mexico PBS)The jewel thieves at the Louvre captured international attention for their brazenness in stealing some of France’s most treasured possessions. In terms of national treasures in the United States, we don’t have much in the way of crown jewels, but what we do have are our public lands. 
And our public lands are not some inert relics in a museum. Public lands are living and breathing parts of our communities. Public lands are the living source of family stories and traditions, home for abundant native fish and wildlife, and economic force multipliers for our communities. Public lands mean freedom. 
The Bureau of Land Management manages over 20% of the land mass in Idaho, totaling nearly 12 million acres in Idaho and 245 million acres in the United States. While we all may have differences of opinion on how these lands should best be managed, Idahoans agree that these public lands belong in public hands. 
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, has rightly called our public lands “the heart and soul of Idaho.” Sen. Risch, along with U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo and Congressman Mike Simpson, both R-Idaho, stepped up on behalf of Idahoans this summer and prevented the sale of millions of acres of public lands to developers. 
Trump nominates former NM GOP Congressman Steve Pearce to lead federal public lands agency

So Idahoans might be surprised that the latest nominee to serve as the national BLM director, Steve Pearce, is an ardent supporter of selling off public lands. Steve Pearce is an oil executive and former Congressman from New Mexico (2003-2009 and 2011-2019). In a 2012 letter to then U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, Mr. Pearce made the following recommendation to reduce the deficit: 
“[d]ivesting the federal government of its vast land holdings could pay down the deficit and reduce spending. The federal government owns roughly 650 million acres of land, or ⅓ of the entire landmass of our country. Over 90% of this land is located in the western states and most of it we do not even need.” 
In a 2012 speech at the Colorado Conservative Political Action Conference, then-Congressman Pearce boasted “… we’ll reverse this trend of public ownership of lands.” 
Confirming Steve Pearce would be the equivalent of hiring one of the “smash and grab” jewelry thieves to manage the national treasure of our living public lands. Of course, any good thief should know that the public is now watching so we should also beware of under-the-table handouts for billionaires with proposals to “scale back” current land protections. 
Our BLM lands are already in enough trouble — understaffed, underfunded, and under increased pressure from invasive species, wildfires, and development and other risks. We do not need an auctioneer to hold a fire-sale of our public lands to the highest bidder or transfer them to the states (where they would inevitably be sold off). 
Instead, we need a BLM director who treasures our public lands in the same ways that we do. We need someone who can build relationships, bring people together with collaborative solutions, and work in good faith to restore, protect and steward our public lands for future generations of Idahoans. 
Idaho has an important voice in this decision. Sen. Risch serves on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee which will vet Mr. Pearce. Sen. Risch is well-known for asking tough questions. Idahoans deserve to know if Mr. Pearce still supports the sale of America’s public lands.

Bill Lee has released its first set of recommendations for conservation of the Duck River. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)An advisory group tasked with identifying ways to balance conservation and water needs on a treasured Tennessee river issued its first recommendations to Gov. Bill Lee on Nov. 20, a year after Lee issued an executive order prioritizing the river’s protection.
The 269-mile Duck River is known for its biodiversity, hosting the largest variety of living organisms of any freshwater river in North America. But the scenic river is also under increasing pressure as Middle Tennessee’s population growth ratchets up demand for water and drought conditions lead to low flows. 
The proposed measures include implementing drought preparedness initiatives and regulations, analyzing the feasibility of a pipeline bringing water from the Tennessee River to Middle Tennessee, and raising winter water levels in the Normandy Dam, a reservoir that allows the Tennessee Valley Authority to regulate water flows on the Duck.
Lee created the Duck River Watershed Planning Partnership — a 19-member advisory group made up of state and local officials, utility representatives, and conservation group leaders — to steer the creation of a plan to manage the delicate watershed while continuing to provide water for more than 250,000 people.
The partnership met several times over the last eight months and conducted a community survey that collected responses from 850 people.
The group’s initial recommendations do not come with a total estimated price tag, though some price estimates for individual components were included in an earlier draft of the document. 
Group seeking to build Columbia Dam on Duck River teams with Ogles to pursue federal funds for study

A separate feasibility study completed by the Mallory Valley Utility District in September estimated that a pipeline connecting to the Cumberland River — about 30 miles away from Columbia — could cost around $1.9 billion. This pipeline was not among the advisory group’s recommendations, though the group did state that information gathered during this feasibility study may help inform the study of a potential Tennessee River pipeline.
A proposal to build a dam on the Duck River in Columbia was not included in the recommendations. A group called “Columbia Dam Now” has been advocating for a new dam for months, positioning it as the only solution to keeping water affordable in fast-growing southern Middle Tennessee. The idea has been staunchly opposed by environmental groups that say a dam would have detrimental environmental impacts and question the project’s feasibility and land requirements. 
Columbia Dam Now announced in July that the group was working with U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles to secure congressional funding for a feasibility study for the proposed dam, but that funding has yet to materialize. The Maury County Commission passed a non-binding resolution supporting a feasibility study for the dam proposal in November. In a social media post, Ogles wrote that the resolution “affirms my work to secure a feasibility study for this dam so we can provide water ASAP.”
The Duck River Watershed Planning Partnership’s initial recommendations range from short-term to long-term, covering issues including drought preparedness and response, meeting regional water needs, conserving water and habitats, and public engagement.
Drought
Within two years:

Revise and adopt a Duck River Regional Drought Management Plan including voluntary and mandatory water use restrictions based on drought level, monitoring for river flow and withdrawals, and voluntary conservation commitments. 
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, TDEC, or the Governor’s Office should establish a water monitoring council composed of members from state water, wildlife and emergency management agencies and the Tennessee Climate Office, which will coordinate with national weather, water and emergency management agencies to respond to drought and flood conditions.
Develop a Duck River Dashboard that tracks current data from the Normandy Dam at TVA, U.S. Geological Survey stream gages, discharge monitoring and utilities (water withdrawals and returns).

Within five years:

TDEC should update its statewide drought management plan rules to require utilities to have water shortage response plans — including water withdrawal and water use reductions — that are activated during periods of drought or low river flow.
TDEC and the Duck River Development Agency should consider installing more gauges to measure flow, groundwater and water quality, potentially in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey to better understand the relationship between groundwater and surface water during low-flow periods.

Within six years or more:

Create off-stream storage ponds near water treatment plants to capture and store water during high-flow periods, providing an alternative supply during droughts.

Regional water needs
Within two years:

TDEC should commission a water needs analysis for the watershed, to be completed by August 30, 2026.
TDEC should commission a regionalization feasibility study of water and wastewater utilities to be completed by August 30, 2026.
TVA should evaluate raising the Normandy Dam winter pool up to 5 feet, retaining more water during winter months to reduce risk of low flows during the summer.
TDEC should provide an analysis of a possible pipeline to the Tennessee River.

Within five years:

Develop financial incentives for regionalization activities based on the findings of the regionalization feasibility study.

Within six years or more:

TVA and TDEC should begin a feasibility study on raising the height of the Normandy Dam’s summer pool up to five feet, informed by the findings of the water needs analysis.

Water and habitat conservation
Within two years:

Establish a water loss reduction program that works with utilities across the state to audit water loss and address issues found during these audits, with incentives for reducing loss.

Within five years:

Provide incentives to private landowners who pursue conservation easements and/or practice sustainable agriculture that protects the river’s habitat and water quality.
Invest in groundwater recharge, green infrastructure and rainwater harvesting projects.
Create a wetland restoration fund to restore and expand wetlands in the Duck River watershed.
Encourage local governments to consider adopting overlays creating permanent development buffer zones on each riverbank.
Develop a watershed-wide growth plan.


Develop a water use efficiency plan to evaluate, promote and track efficiency practices.

Within six years or more:

Promote water-efficient fixtures, smart irrigation, industrial reuse, green infrastructure, and other initiatives to reduce water use and demand. 

Public engagement
Within two years:

Create and promote educational materials about the Duck River and watershed protection for multiple audiences, including recreational users, nonprofits, farmers and utilities.
Create and promote a ready-to-use tool kit linking watershed issues like drought and land use to education and actionable steps.

Mandela Barnes in his launch video for his 2026 gubernatorial campaign. | Photo courtesy Mandela Barnes for Wisconsin campaignFormer Lt. Gov. and Senate candidate Mandela Barnes launched his campaign for governor on Tuesday — pledging to stand up to the Trump administration and work to make Wisconsin more affordable.
The 2026 gubernatorial election is the first open race for governor since 2010 and Barnes joins a crowded field of Democratic hopefuls. Some of those candidates include Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), Milwaukee County Exec. David Crowley and former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes.
There are about 10 months until the August primary. 
In his announcement video, Barnes accuses President Donald Trump and the federal government of looking the other way as working people struggle to keep up with costs. He says the state needs to reject the “Washington Way” and get things done the “Wisconsin Way.”
The video kicks off with Barnes highlighting his family ties to unions, grabbing a jacket with the insignia of UAW, Local 1866, which is the Oak Creek chapter of the United Auto Workers union. He says it belongs to his dad who “wore it everywhere because being part of a union wasn’t just a job.” In the video, construction workers walk behind Barnes while he speaks. 
“It meant you looked out for each other. It meant you had each other’s backs,” Barnes continues, adding that union jobs helped people afford a home, support their families and save for retirement. “That’s not the case anymore. Seems like the harder you work, the more Washington looks the other way. Lower taxes for billionaires, higher prices for working people.” 
“Under Trump, the name of the game has been distraction and chaos to avoid accountability,” Barnes says.  “It’s not about the real world. It’s a show. Outrage. Performances. Everybody trying to go viral. Meanwhile, families doing everything right are still falling behind.” 
Barnes also announced Tuesday that he plans to kick off his campaign with a tour across the state, with stops in Madison, Milwaukee and Green Bay this week. He said he plans to meet voters to hear about their concerns about rising costs and to share his vision to improve affordability. According to a press release from his campaign, Barnes as governor would seek to expand BadgerCare — Wisconsin’s Medicaid program — and “close tax loopholes for the ultra-rich so we can cut taxes for middle-class families.” 
“It isn’t about left or right. It’s not about who can yell the loudest,” Barnes says in his ad. “It’s about whether people can afford to live in the state they call home. A state where you can afford your health care, where your kids can learn a skill and stay close to home, where a good day’s work earns a good day’s pay and where families can not only get by, but thrive.”
Barnes will need to overcome concerns about his prior statewide loss to U.S. Senator Ron Johnson as he campaigns to win the Democratic nomination.
In the 2022 Senate race, Barnes won the Democratic nomination after the crowded field thinned and when some high-profile Democrats dropped out in the weeks before the primary date. He lost his general election challenge to Johnson, who had been considered one of the most beatable Republican incumbents in the country for Democrats, by a narrow margin. 
Before launching his campaign, Barnes had already faced pushback to his run for governor due to that 2022 loss.
The New York Times reported in October that some Wisconsin Democrats were uneasy about Barnes running statewide in 2026. A few days later the Milwaukee Courier, the city’s longest-running Black-owned newspaper, published an opinion piece urging Barnes not to run, saying the state couldn’t risk another loss. The Courier noted that Barnes ran 50,000 votes behind Gov. Tony Evers in 2022, with Evers winning a second term that year. Barnes lost the Senate race by a little over 26,000 votes.
“We need a candidate who can unite this state — and win. Mandela Barnes already showed us he can’t,” the Milwaukee Courier oped stated.
Barnes is pushing back on that narrative. In his campaign ad, he says he knows how to “bring people together” and “how to get things done.” 
“I’m running for governor because this jacket wasn’t just something my dad wore. It was a promise,” Barnes says. “We show up. We look out for each other.”
Barnes served in the Wisconsin State Assembly for two terms from 2013 to 2017 before he was elected as the state’s first Black lieutenant governor. He won the lieutenant governor nomination in 2018 in a two-person race, going on to win on the same ticket as Evers.
Since losing the Senate race in 2022, Barnes has served as president of Power to the Polls Wisconsin, a community-based organizing project focused on getting people out to vote. According to his campaign, he led a team that helped knock on over a million doors to engage infrequent voters and improve turnout and get people out to vote for Supreme Court Justice Janet Protasiewicz and Justice Susan Crawford in their successive winning campaigns. 
The primary election is scheduled for Aug. 11, 2026. The Republican field is less crowded with U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, considered the front runner, and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann the only announced candidates.

Patrick Morrisey  gives updates on the National Guard members in Washington, D.C. during a news conference on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025, in Charleston, West Virginia. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)When a breaking news event happens, you should be able to look to your governor for information to inform the public. However, Gov. Patrick Morrisey has fumbled the National Guard tragedy since his first post about it.
My heart breaks for two West Virginia families whose lives have been changed forever because of last week’s shooting in Washington, D.C.
As soon as we heard that members of the National Guard had been shot, we worried they might be from West Virginia, and we soon learned they were from Morrisey’s social media post.
The shooting was around 2:15 p.m. Wednesday. At 3:33 p.m., Morrisey posted on X that one Guard member had died. At 3:42 p.m., he posted that both were dead. At 4:04 p.m., he rescinded that due to “conflicting reports.”
The post saying both members of the Guard died received over 6.7 million views, compared to 2.2 million views for the post taking that back. And while our governor should be a reliable source of information, we began to worry when we realized he was the only person quoted saying that our Guard members had died. 
Unfortunately, Morrisey’s office didn’t respond to emails from us and other West Virginia news outlets trying to get updated information for West Virginia readers. But the governor was busy doing the national TV interview circuit — he did at least six national television news interviews between Wednesday and Sunday and only one with a West Virginia station, MetroNews. Monday was the first press conference he held for the local media. 
This situation has felt more like an excuse for Morrisey to get on national TV than a genuine show of remorse and concern for the victims.
The governor has handled the National Guard situation poorly since he decided to send troops to Washington, D.C.
In August, President Donald Trump manufactured a “public safety emergency” to mobilize the National Guard to “take back” the capital from what he described as violent criminals. 
In 2024, the Department of Justice said D.C. crime had hit a 30-year low. In fact, both Charleston and Huntington, West Virginia, have higher crime rates than Washington, D.C.
Trump and Morrisey — two men who have never served in the military — have sent young men and women to fight their imaginary war.
In fact, just days before the shooting, a federal judge ordered an end to the National Guard deployment in the district, declaring that the use of troops was “unlawful.”
Morrisey should have never sent members of our National Guard to D.C.
But he did. And now family and friends are mourning 20-year-old West Virginia National Guard member U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom of Summersville. 
Morrisey was nearly an hour late to her vigil on Saturday, which evidently held up the entire event. 
But just to be clear — Morrisey doesn’t want anyone to blame him for Beckstrom’s death. 
“She was there because she volunteered to be there, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.” Morrisey said during the vigil.
He also made an angry post on Facebook during the holiday weekend.
“If you are not all in for the WV Guardsmen who defended our nation’s capital city, who did nothing but protect DC from crime, then YOU are the problem.
“Our Guardsmen were brave and have done everything to defend your freedoms and protect the homeland from evildoers — can we at least unite against cold blooded murder or is that too much???
“Let’s stop the insanity and protect our country. #WVStrong”
On Sunday, he again posted on X emphasizing that the 160 National Guard members who are in D.C. volunteered to stay. He might as well just post, “Please stop blaming me!”
Make no mistake — I support our National Guard members, and I appreciate all they do for us. My thoughts are with Beckstrom’s family and with the family of U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, who is still in the hospital.
But they didn’t need to be in D.C.
Along with West Virginia, five other states — Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and South Carolina — sent more than 2,000 combined troops to the nation’s capital.
Early in August, the Associated Press reported that the troops were mostly doing crowd control at national monuments and protecting landmarks like the National Mall and Union Station. Other outlets reported they picked up trash.
In an interview with CNN, Beckstrom’s former boyfriend said while she believed in the D.C. mission, she said being there was “pointless” because their authority was limited.
“She wanted to make a difference,” said Adam Carr. “She was happy with it, and she just was also like, ‘Why am I here if I can’t do nothing’ where they limited them so much?”
“She got deputized in there, and they gave them no rights to do anything,” Carr said. “She was like ‘people spit towards us, cuss at us, throw things at us, and we can’t do nothing.’ She couldn’t detain nobody. She couldn’t stop them from doing wrong. They told them to call the cops.”
Morrisey didn’t announce that flags would be flown at half staff for Beckstrom until Monday — four days after her death.
West Virginians take care of West Virginians. Guard members sign up to help in real emergencies — like natural disasters and helping distribute food when food assistance was delayed last month. Governor, I hope you don’t send them to wherever Trump makes up his next “emergency.” Let this be a lesson for you.

(Photo provided)This time of year, Louisville nonprofit publishing house Sarabande Books would typically learn how much federal grant money it could rely on for the next publishing cycle. 
This year, that money isn’t coming. 
Kristen Renee Miller, the editor in chief and executive director of the nonprofit, refused to sign a compliance agreement promising to not promote diversity, equity and inclusion and “gender ideology” this year, nor did she have the authors she wants to promote comply with the new rules. Sarabande’s mission is, in part, to “find and promote what’s been underrepresented,” Miller said — the antithesis of those restrictions. 
The Trump administration’s rules governing what the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) supports were successfully challenged in court this year. At the time Miller would have had to agree to them, though, she had no idea what the outcome would be, or how long a legal challenge would take.
“We didn’t feel like we were willing to wait around to see if they would or wouldn’t (suspend the new rules), and in the meantime, sign our name to them,” she said.
For most of its existence the publishing house, founded in 1994, has received $25,000–$50,000 each year in NEA grants. This year, the NEA changed its rules, requiring arts applicants to abide by President Donald Trump’s executive orders restricting DEI initiatives and condemning “gender ideology.” A court ruled in September that the “gender ideology” compliance requirement violated the First Amendment, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.  
Miller interpreted “gender ideology” to mean “publishing and promoting trans, gender fluid and non-binary authors, which is something we absolutely do,” she said.  
Because of its noncompliance, Sarabande is losing an already-promised grant for this year worth around $25,000, Miller said. She has turned to readers and the broader community seeking to raise the lost funds. 
New priorities: 
Previous Sarabande projects that got NEA funding include:

“Leaving Biddle City” by Marianne Chan
“Master” by Simon Shieh
“A Terrifying Brush with Optimism” by Brian Leung and 
“A New Race of Men from Heaven” by Chaitali Sen. 

The projects that would have benefited from the next grant include: 

“Ancient Algorithms”  by Katrine Øgaard Jensen
“The Longest Way to Eat a Melon” by Jacqueline Zong-Li Ross
“Terra” by Kiki Petrosino and
“Held: Essays in Belonging” by Kathryn Nuernberger

A letter rescinding the 2025 grant, which Miller shared with the Lantern, states the NEA terminated the latest grant because it “is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the president.” 
“The NEA will now prioritize projects that elevate the nation’s HBCUs (historically black colleges and universities) and Hispanic Serving Institutions, celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence, foster AI competency, empower houses of worship to serve communities, assist with disaster recovery, foster skilled trade jobs, make America healthy again, support the military and veterans, support Tribal communities, make the District of Columbia safe and beautiful, and support the economic development of Asian American communities,” the letter says. “Funding is being allocated in a new direction in furtherance of the administration’s agenda.” 
‘Not a theoretical good’ 
Sarabande took to social media Nov. 17 with a defiant message, saying it was “exceedingly proud to be misaligned with this administration’s vision for the arts” and asking people to donate cash to make up the difference. 
Miller crafted this message from her own reaction to the NEA rules, she said, but also felt it was a “unifying message” for others with similar reactions. 
“The power of demoralization is a huge project of this administration. It’s overwhelming us with demoralization, with the fear of things we’ve relied on being taken away, the sort of insistence that things we thought about our culture, about our society weren’t fragile, making them look fragile,” Miller said. “It seems to be just sort of a relentless assault on our resilience, on our sense of hope. And … I do take that very personally.”  
Motivated by the idea that the arts tell the story of a society’s values, books should represent all people, Miller said. 
“What I do at Sarabande is not a theoretical good,” Miller said. “I believe that it is a crucial element of our culture.” 
She’s counting on others agreeing with her. Nonprofits often juggle uncertainty, she said, and while cutting books already in production is “not an option,” the publishing house will look at ways to cut costs while simultaneously fundraising. 
“We refuse to be aligned, and we will be very loud about how misaligned we are with” the administration’s priorities, Miller said. “We’re not alone, and we know the community that agrees with us is bigger than those who are trying to push us out.”

The coal unit, Colorado’s largest, with 750 megawatts of generating capacity, had begun producing electricity a few weeks before.
“The beast has risen,” said a sign along my tour.
It had been a difficult birth. Problems had delayed completion by a year. Troubles continued. The unit was down an average of 91.5 days per year during its first 10-plus years. That included 374 days beginning in 2020 and extending into 2021.
In August, 2025, the unit went down again. Xcel Energy, its operator and primary owner, expects the outage to last into June 2026.

Environmental organizations question whether Xcel — and hence its 1.6 million electrical customers in Colorado — should bring back this problematic coal unit. They suggest that letting this coal plant remain silent will be the most effective use of ratepayer money. It is scheduled to retire at the end of 2030.
To ensure the lights — and especially the air conditioners next summer — stay on, Xcel and the administration of Gov. Jared Polis want to delay the retirement of Comanche 2, a neighboring coal-burning unit, for a year beyond its scheduled retirement in December. The retirement has been planned since 2018. The unit is older and smaller. It began producing electricity in 1975 with a maximum capacity of 335 megawatts, less than half that of the newer unit. It has, however, been far more reliable.
The Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and others do not challenge the plan. They worry, however, about the emissions if both coal units are operating a year from now. They advocate limits on combined operations. “This allows the same total amount of generation from the two units as if Comanche 3 were available for all of 2026,” they said in a filing with the PUC.
Given Comanche 3’s problems, should it even be brought back to life?
“Ratepayers continue to bear the consequences of (Xcel subsidiary) Public Service’s failings when it comes to Comanche 3,” said the city of Boulder in its PUC filing. “At some point, the bleeding must stop.”
That bleeding has been costly. A 2021 report by the PUC staff found Comanche 3, instead of delivering electricity at a cost of $45.70 per megawatt-hour, as had been projected, had cost $66.25 during its first decade.
Some see parallels to the St. Vrain nuclear plant. That nuclear plant along the South Platte River near Greeley operated from 1976 to 1989. Like Comanche 3, it had problem after problem. Finally, operations ceased. The bleeding continued long after. Customers of the utility that is now Xcel paid $2 a month from 1993 until 2005 to cover the $125 million cost of decommissioning St. Vrain. The utility then spent $250 million to retrofit it into a natural gas plant.
Why has Comanche been such a lemon? Xcel frowns on that word but the evidence is clear. A former PUC commissioner has suggested that ramping operations up and down instead of chugging along steadily were to blame. What then explains the problems during the first decade?
The 2021 PUC staff report said “poor maintenance practices likely contributed” to the 2020 outage of Comanche 3. The report also pointed to insufficient communication protocols, lack of thoroughness in procedures, and other problems. A jury awarded CORE Electrical Cooperative, the Sedalia-based cooperative that owns 8% of the unit, $26 million because of the year-long outage.
The question before PUC commissioners now is whether the unit needs to be kept online until 2030. After a decade of very slow growth, Xcel now predicts a fast-paced increase in demand for electricity. It has sounded the alarm about “resource adequacy.”
We’re using more electricity for cars and to replace natural gas from buildings. Data centers are the elephant in this story of rising demand. They use electricity, although how much is debatable. Data center developers want more financial incentives from Colorado, while wary environmental groups want guardrails. This will be a key legislative item in January.
Craig provides another element of the evolving coal-burning story in Colorado. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association has been planning for almost a decade to close one of its three coal-burning units there this December. Tri-State now expects to get orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to keep the coal unit operating into 2026.
A few years ago, Colorado was triumphantly easing out of coal generation in orderly fashion. The narrative has shifted, this energy transition — what I call the big pivot — has gotten more complex.

James Thomas, the nationally noted preservationist whose lifetime of work at Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill transformed a fading Kentucky historic site into one of the nation’s most admired restoration projects, died Nov. 24 at his home in Mercer County. He was 86.
He is survived by his wife, Susanna, and their two sons, Ian and Mason.
Thomas devoted more than four decades to Pleasant Hill, a former Shaker settlement overlooking the Kentucky River. When he entered the project in the 1960s, the property’s 34 surviving buildings were in various stages of decline, and the Shakers — a celibate Christian sect known for its communal living, pacifism and austere craftsmanship — had not yet entered the broad public consciousness.
The initiative to restore the Shaker Village was initiated by a group of civic-minded Lexingtonians in 1961, led by Earl D. Wallace and Joseph Graves. By 1964, the year Thomas was hired, the Friends of Pleasant Hill had organized a nonprofit and raised funds for operating expenses. They secured a $2 million loan to purchase and restore the site. Later, Wallace was able to have the loan forgiven.
The revival of interest in Kentucky’s Shaker heritage was advanced by Louisville civic leaders, including The Courier-Journal editor and publisher Barry Bingham Sr., his wife, Mary, as well as editorial writer and arts patron Adele Brandeis, whose advocacy for American folk traditions helped bring renewed attention to Pleasant Hill. Their support, as well as that of many others, helped create the cultural conditions in which Thomas’ work would flourish.
By the time Thomas retired in 2004, Pleasant Hill had become a nationally recognized model of historic interpretation, architectural restoration and landscape stewardship. Scholars frequently cited the project as one of the most complete and faithful reconstructions of any Shaker site in the United States.
“Those of us who cherish Shakertown hold Jim Thomas in high esteem for coming to Mercer County to work with Jim Cogar,” observed Lois Mateus, retired Brown-Forman executive and a member of the Shakertown board. Her farm is near Harrodsburg.

In 1964, James L. Cogar — the former Colonial Williamsburg curator who led the early restoration at Pleasant Hill — hired Thomas, then 23, as a staff member. He soon became indispensable to the project. He helped develop the Village’s preservation ethic, shaped interpretive programs, supervised building restorations and created a furniture reproduction initiative that ultimately produced nearly 2,000 pieces based on original Shaker designs.
“Tutored by Mr. Cogar, Jim made it his life’s work to carry on Shaker traditions and perfection with a love of history and a fine aesthetic eye to the highest standards of preservation,” Mateus remembered. “He loved the buildings. He loved the craft. He loved the land.”
James Cheston Thomas was born in Philadelphia in 1939 and moved to Louisville at age 15. He attended Louisville Country Day School and later the University of Louisville. His early training in historic preservation began at Locust Grove, the home of George Rogers Clark, where he worked with the restoration architect Walter Macomber, known for his work on Colonial Williamsburg.
For many Kentuckians, their first entry into the world of Jim Thomas came in a May 5, 1963, article in The Courier-Journal by Marion Porter, at that time one of the newspaper’s top feature writers. Jim was pictured with his brother, Sam, outside the log cabin where they lived at Locust Grove, the early Kentucky residence being restored on Blankenbaker Lane. With them was Clark, their German shepherd named for George Rogers Clark, who helped the brothers protect the property. (Samuel Thomas died in October 2012.)
Locust Grove was far more than a source of income and a shelter for a pair of college post-graduates. Sam went on to become among the most prolific and influential historians of Louisville and its historic neighborhoods. And Jim gained the attention of those who were instrumental in Shakertown’s preservation.
The team that brought Shakertown’s restoration to fruition gathers behind one of the village’s distinctive fences.

Jim Thomas was named curator in 1968 and steadily advanced through the organization: vice president in 1971, executive vice president in 1974, and president and chief administrative officer in 1975 upon Cogar’s retirement. In 1990, he was appointed chief executive officer, assuming responsibility for restoration, interpretation, education programs, lodging, dining services, craft operations and long-range planning.
Thomas also wrote extensively about Kentucky history and architecture. With his brother, he wrote “The Simple Spirit,” a pictorial study of Pleasant Hill. He was co-author with Stephen Beal of “Old Mud Meeting House,” the definitive account of the oldest Low Dutch Reformed church west of the Alleghenies. His consulting work made him a widely recognized authority on Kentucky log buildings and early frontier construction.
“Pleasant Hill is not solely inhabited by the ‘simple spirit’ of the Shakers who built and lived in the community,” observed Billy Rankin, president and CEO of the nonprofit. “It also graced the presence of those who saved what remained after the Shakers and shared it with the world. Chief among these presences is Jim Thomas.”
His leadership at Pleasant Hill earned numerous honors, including the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s Trustee Emeritus Award for Excellence in 2001. Thomas himself received the Kentucky Heritage Council’s Ida Lee Willis Memorial Award in 1998, the Blue Grass Trust’s John Wesley Hunt Award in 1999 and the James Harrod Trust’s Jane Bird Hutton Award in 2003. In 2025, he was named president emeritus of Shaker Village at Pleasant Hill.
His influence extended across the commonwealth. As interest in the Shakers grew, Thomas became a central figure in helping Kentucky articulate a broader vision of cultural preservation, one rooted in accuracy, landscape stewardship and respect for vernacular craftsmanship.
One of Jim Thomas’s first responsibilities was to train local carpenters to make reproduction furniture to populate the buildings. Much of this furniture is still being used today throughout the site. (Photo courtesy of Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill)
Thomas and his family lived for many years at Barter Farm, a 185-acre property near Pleasant Hill. In 1967, he reconstructed a circa 1800 double-pen log house there using traditional methods and materials. His wife, Susanna, continues to live in the home. Susanna Massie Thomas, a noted horsewoman, long has advocated, as she describes on their website, for protection and preservation of farmland and scenic byways, the value of local economies and the importance of organic home cooking. The Thomas partnership made them true Kentucky treasures.
He was a devoted parishioner of St. Philip’s Episcopal Church in Harrodsburg.
Today, Pleasant Hill stands as one of the most complete Shaker restorations in the country, drawing visitors from around the world. Many of the site’s architectural details — from the sweep of its stone fences to the cadence of its restored staircases — bear the imprint of Thomas’s scholarship and discipline.
“Jim combined a love for our state’s heritage with the expertise and willpower to carry out the work of preserving it,” concludes Billy Rankin. “This was no easy task, and generations of Kentuckians are forever in his debt for the good work he has done. We do this noble work still today, with the knowledge that we are standing on his broad shoulders.” 
The person who knew him best, Susanna, offered this appraisal of his character, which encapsulates Jim Thomas simply and eloquently: He was “exacting, honest, hard-working, self-taught, keenly attentive to detail, gracious, authentic, humble, respected, and loved. Invariably, when his name is mentioned, people who knew him will say, ‘Jim Thomas was a good man.’”

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)In an effort to protect healthy soils and boost vitality, the American Farmland Trust has opened up applications for farmers and ranchers in Virginia and across the nation to apply for grants that encourage regenerative agriculture practices.
The two grants are part of a national push to help farmers finance measures to mitigate climate impacts and build more resilient land. The main goal of the American Farmland Trust, which is managing the grants, is to protect farmland from erosion through climate change and farming methods that deplete the land. 
“Regenerate Virginia brings together the tools farmers need to build healthier soils, strengthen their operations, and secure the future of agriculture in the Commonwealth,” said Amanda Cather, AFT’s Mid-Atlantic Deputy Director. The organization was started in 2020 to help farmers on the national scale.
The healthy soils grant offers up to $30,000 to help farmers partake in four key soil health measures: planting cover crops to reduce soil erosion; minimizing the use of harmful chemicals or over working the soil; maximizing living roots; and diversifying crop species while integrating livestock to naturally fertilize the soil.
The farm vitality grant allows up to $25,000 per producer for product and market expansion, business development, and to apply for equipment that can aid in regenerative practices. This will help farmers and ranchers make business decisions to adopt regenerative practices and get equipment to start right away on new methods to help their soil.
Equipment that could qualify for the grant include no-till seed drills, solar-powered irrigation pumps, roller-crimpers, and several other options.
The funding stems from the Brighter Future Fund, a part of the American Farmland Trust that focuses on conservation of agricultural land and promoting farming practices that help keep the land viable. In July, 38 Virginia farmers and ranchers were awarded $896,600 between the two grants.
Regenerative farming methods are believed to be a major driver in reducing carbon emissions. There is also a growing concern among communities about valuable agricultural land being dismantled in favor of development. Grants such as this aim to help farmers follow regenerative principles that will help them save money in the long run and keep their soil usable for future generations.
Applications are now open until Dec. 19.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis received some difficult but not entirely unsurprising news over the Thanksgiving holiday: her sweeping election subversion case against President Donald Trump and several allies was officially dismissed, ending one of the most bizarre legal chapters in Georgia history.

Willis, an elected Democrat, quickly emerged as one of the president’s most prominent political foes after the 2020 election, when her office launched an investigation into Trump’s attempts to stay in power following his narrow defeat. The investigation stemmed from a January 2021 phone call between Trump and state election officials, where he was heard urging them to “find” enough votes that would erase his deficit.

Her office would spend the months and years that followed interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence. The Fulton County Courthouse was surrounded by orange barricades and armed guards as threats to Willis increased. She unveiled the sweeping 41-count indictment in August 2023, accusing Trump and 18 allies of participating in a criminal enterprise. An angry Trump would travel to the Fulton County Jail to have his booking photo taken, becoming the first American president to appear in a mugshot.

At the time, the case seemed like it would be the strongest chance to hold the then-former president accountable in a court of law, particularly for his actions leading up to the events of Jan. 6: the central piece of evidence was caught on tape, and state prosecutions are outside the realm of presidential pardons. It also made Willis, a veteran prosecutor who spent years working in the district attorney’s office she now leads, something of a rising star in the Democratic Party as she took on an ex-commander-in-chief.
But the case was stopped in its tracks last January after defense attorneys filed a bombshell motion accusing Willis of being romantically involved with Nathan Wade, the prosecutor she hired to help lead the investigation. A native of nearby Cobb County, Wade spent years handling low-level criminal cases both as an attorney and a judge. But he had never taken on such a high profile case prior to being tapped by Willis to take on Trump and his allies.
Indeed, Willis did confirm that she and Wade had begun a relationship. But a financial connection was also established during Wade’s divorce proceedings: credit card statements found that Wade had been paying for airline tickets and other items for himself and Willis using his county-funded salary. Defense attorneys argued she was improperly reaping financial benefits from the case.
After months of hearings and motions, a top court would bar Willis and her office from prosecuting the case. Peter Skandalakis, the head of a nonpartisan prosecuting attorneys commission, assigned himself to oversee the prosecution. He quickly pulled the plug on the case, outlining the impracticalities of having a sitting president as a criminal defendant.
He also questioned whether Trump’s January 2021 phone call amounted to illegal activity: “While the call is concerning, reasonable minds could differ as to how to interpret the call,” he said. “When multiple interpretations are equally plausible, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and should not be presumed to have acted criminally.”

Even before her ultimate removal, bad judgement calls from Willis were already derailing parts of her investigation. One of the key witnesses was Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a Trump ally who participated in the so-called “fake elector” scheme as a state senator. But after hosting a fundraiser for Jones’ political opponent, a ruling from a judge would prevent Willis from bringing any charges against the Republican due to a conflict of interest.
Jones’ case also ended up in Skandalakis’ hands. His decision to dismiss the matter without bringing charges would foreshadow the ultimate demise of what had earlier seemed like the biggest legal threat to the president.
Willis has offered no public regrets about taking on the case. But the toll of a years-long, high-stakes prosecution that ultimately yielded no convictions — financial, professional, and personal — remains unclear. Only now, as the dust settles, is the full cost of her choice to take on Trump beginning to come into view.
Republican lawmakers at the Gold Dome, just a 10-minute walk from the courthouse, had blasted the case from the start and pushed for a series of measures targeting Willis and other so-called “rogue prosecutors.” One of those measures could leave Fulton County taxpayers on the hook for the defendants’ legal costs.
But the scrutiny now extends far beyond Atlanta. In Washington, congressional Republicans — and reportedly, Trump’s Justice Department — are probing Willis and many of the president’s courtroom and campaign adversaries.
So while she is showing no remorse for bringing the indictments, Willis and certainly many others have to be asking: was it all worth it? Trump is back in the White House with his aforementioned mugshot now hanging outside the Oval Office. Willis’ reputation as a skilled prosecutor has undoubtedly taken a hit, and taxpayers must now foot the bill for a prosecution that never made it before a jury.
History will look back on Willis as the first and only local prosecutor to square off with Trump over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. But her lapses in judgment and the case’s ultimate dismissal threaten to cast a shadow over her efforts to hold him accountable when it seemed like no one else would.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC0105_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 05:57:41.380059

 According to the Atlantic Council’s tariff tracker, Trump has imposed import taxes ranging from 10% to 60% on just about every country in the world — with the notable exception of Russia.
The Cleveland Fed’s Survey of Regional Conditions and Expectations found a big jump in the percentage of businesses that expect to cut staff in the coming year.
“The share of respondents who expected their firms to decrease employment levels in the next 12 months more than doubled between November 2024 (7%) and November 2025 (18%),” it said of the survey, which was conducted in late October and early November. 
However, the report pointed out, less than a fifth of businesses expect to cut staff while 51% expect to maintain it at current levels, and 32% expect to add employees.
The Cleveland Fed produces a second report — the Beige Book — based on interviews, questionnaires and other inputs. 
The most recent addition indicates that the Trump import taxes are helping to drive inflation.
“Overall, nonlabor input costs increased at a robust pace in recent weeks, continuing the trend seen over the past four reporting periods,” it said. 
“Manufacturers reported tariff-related cost increases for equipment and materials, and one observed that most manufacturers had run out of lower-cost pre-tariff inventory. One large retailer’s average costs had increased around 20 percent year-over-year because of tariffs, and it was trying to determine how it would distribute these increases.” 
Tariffs weren’t the sole driver of inflation, the report said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“By contrast, another large retailer did not anticipate further cost increases, stating that tariff impacts had stabilized,” it said. 
“Outside of tariffs, many contacts continued to report rising utilities and insurance costs. In general, nonlabor costs were expected to grow at a strong pace in the coming months.”
The Beige Book added that demand for manufactured goods was down slightly, but that it was being propped up by the rapid development of data centers.
“Although multiple contacts continued to report strong demand related to rapidly expanding AI data center construction, some described a ‘collective holding of breath’ as these fast-paced buildouts became a primary driver of demand even as other industry segments remained weak,” it said. 
“Multiple contacts added that demand from data centers was not enough to offset softer activity in other industries. Still, manufacturers generally expected demand to increase slightly in the coming months.”
As the wealthiest Americans grow ever richer — and see their taxes cut — their low and middle-income neighbors are seeing skyrocketing health, grocery and utility costs without commensurate increases in pay. It’s a phenomenon that some economists are calling the K-shaped economy.
Retailers who gave input for the Beige Book reported seeing aspects of it in their stores.
“Consumer spending was flat in recent weeks, and contacts expected demand to decline modestly in the coming months,” the report said. 
“Among retailers reporting flat sales, one noted continued pressure on lower-income consumers and early signs of strain on middle-income consumers, while a higher-end grocery store observed price-conscious behavior among customers.”
Adding to the pain was Trump’s decision to — unlike previous administrations — disrupt federal food benefits during the partial government shutdown. 
The move created record demand and many Ohio food pantries, while the shutdown itself meant that federal workers went weeks without a paycheck.
“Several contacts connected changes in consumer spending to federal policies,” the Beige Book said. 
“A grocery store reported a decline in sales, citing the pause in (federal food subsidies) alongside a general pullback in spending due to economic concerns. A food and hospitality contact reported that customers, many of whom are federal workers, were spending cautiously.”

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Angela Graves has lived in Merrimack almost all her life. She grew up aware of the Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant on the edge of town, and as a teenager learned alongside her community of the dangerous “forever chemicals” it emitted for years. Now, eager to see those pollutants scrubbed from her hometown’s soil and frustrated by a lack of progress, Graves herself has proposed an experimental solution: fungi.
“They haven’t made a remediation plan,” said the recent Plymouth State University graduate who now works as a field organizer with the League of Conservation Voters, though she is pursuing her remediation work independently. “So I was like, all right, I’m tired of waiting. I’m just going to make my own.”
Graves has secured preliminary support from the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services for an experimental trial in mycoremediation, or the use of fungi to clean up pollutants from a contaminated area. 
The use of mushrooms and other organisms to help absorb and break down pollution is a relatively new area of study. The pilot will focus on one type of forever chemical, perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and it’s not yet clear how much contamination could be removed through this method.
Graves, however, views the study as a crucial step toward finding out. She hopes the work will ultimately demonstrate a more affordable and natural way to lighten the load of contaminants burdening her community.

A daunting problem
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, are called forever chemicals because of their resistance to breaking down, giving them lifespans that can exceed thousands of years. This becomes a problem when, as in the greater Merrimack area, the chemicals — which are linked to health concerns from low birth weight to certain cancers — are released into the environment, where they accumulate in soils, leach into drinking water, and find their way into plants and animals. 
An area of significant PFAS contamination surrounds the former Saint-Gobain site and adjacent communities. The Department of Environmental Services attributes it to pollution from the former factory’s smokestack that settled onto a broad swath of land that stretches into multiple towns. 
Though the department considers Saint-Gobain liable for necessary remediation in the area, no plan for how that will occur yet exists. The sheer amount of affected land in the region poses a unique challenge, Waste Management Division Director Michael Wimsatt said earlier this year.
Typical means of PFAS remediation call for removal of the affected soil, which can then be treated through high-temperature incineration or placed in a hazardous waste landfill, but that hasn’t seemed feasible in as large an area as the Merrimack region, he said in September.
A natural remedy
Graves hopes more feasible means of managing large-scale forever chemical pollution may still be uncovered. The idea of mycoremediation first hit her during an ecology course at Plymouth State.
The technique harnesses the abilities of some fungi to break certain strong molecular bonds, including some of the uniquely strong bonds that give forever chemicals their namesake staying power.
Laboratory studies suggest a group of fungi called white rot fungi, which includes species like these oyster mushrooms, can help break down certain forever chemicals.

In laboratory studies, scientists have shown that fungi can help digest forever chemicals through two main routes: by releasing enzymes into the soil around them that help break down the chemicals, and by absorbing the contaminants into their own tissues to digest them.
One class of fungus capable of breaking some PFAS bonds is commonly called white rot. Graves has proposed establishing a 10-square-foot study plot on or near the former location of the Saint-Gobain plant and propagating the fungi, which are found naturally in North America, on the soil within. 
Taking PFOA — one of the forever chemicals known to be present at the site — as their focus, her research team plans to measure soil contamination within the plot before and after the fungi are cultivated. When the mushrooms have matured and formed above-ground fruiting bodies, the team will harvest them, measure the amount of contaminant they have absorbed, and then send them to an incinerator hot enough to destroy PFAS.
Comparing the levels of PFOA in the soil before and after the fungi are cultivated, and measuring the amount of contaminants the mushrooms themselves take up, will reveal whether the experiment is successful, Graves said.
She added that the method was appealing because it is both relatively inexpensive compared to other means of remediation and more natural.
“I don’t think Merrimack needs more chemicals on the land,” she said.
A step, not a cure
Paula Mouser, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New Hampshire, said mycoremediation and other types of biological remediation are, broadly, an under-explored area. 
Mouser declined to comment on the specific project proposed for Merrimack, saying she was unfamiliar with the details. But speaking generally, she said a major challenge with measuring the success of biological remediation projects is the difficulty of tracking the pathways through which PFAS are broken down.
Generally, even when organisms can break some of the bonds within PFAS molecules, those pathways do not completely neutralize the compounds. Instead, they may simply leave different PFAS or PFAS components at their stopping points.
Furthermore, fungi typically grow in the upper layer of soil and may not reach deeper contaminants. The method is therefore best suited to remediating surface-level and shallow soils, Mouser said.
Graves acknowledged these challenges and said the difficulty of tracking PFAS through many different channels of decomposition had already challenged her process. There are thousands of PFAS chemicals and products, and many cannot be easily detected. For this reason, Graves is focusing specifically on PFOA first. She hopes detection technology will continue to advance, allowing her to learn more in the future.
For now, she is moving ahead with her proposal and hopes to begin propagating mushrooms on site in the spring. Graves has worked with the Department of Environmental Services on the proposal, which was met with interest and will be partially funded by the department, she said. As of Nov. 25, she had requested about $7,000 for the pilot project to pay for tests that would determine baseline PFAS contamination in soil and fungi; it was not yet clear how much funding the project would be awarded.
Also unclear was whether the study would be allowed to proceed on actual Saint-Gobain property. Though the plant was demolished in July, the property is still owned and managed by the multi-national corporation. If the company does not agree to allow the study on its land, Graves plans to work with adjacent landowners to site the pilot plot.
At a meeting of the Commission on the Environmental and Public Health Impacts of Perfluorinated Chemicals on Nov. 14, Merrimack Democratic Rep. Wendy Thomas expressed enthusiasm about the pilot program. “Angie has a very exciting proposal,” she said later in an email.
Graves said she wants to see the PFAS contamination in Merrimack resolved to ease health concerns and water filtration struggles for her community. Her hope, she said, is that those affected by and working to remediate the former Saint-Gobain site continue to press ahead toward an eventual solution, even when progress may feel incremental.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-02 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Two families, one child: the case that reshaped foster parents’ rights in Connecticut",Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/02/ct-foster-parents-rights-case/,Her father implored DCF officials to help him get her back. Her foster parents battled to adopt her. The case landed at the state Supreme Court.,"On July 17, 2017, at the Carl Robinson Correctional Institution, Inmate Number 230558 was issued a disciplinary report, placed on a 60-day probationary period and moved into a more secure dormitory for trying to carry contraband into a supervised visit. 
The visit was with his 2-year-old daughter, Jewelyette.
The contraband in question: a crayon.
Inmate Number 230558, known outside the prison as John Masserio Jr., would later write to the parole board that he had only wanted to “color and make a memory with my daughter.” He didn’t want the indiscretion to hinder his efforts to get his daughter out of foster care when he was released.
“Did I just seal my fate?” he asked the parole board.
Masserio was granted probation and released in 2018. When he left, he donated a set of crayons for other prisoners to use during visits with their children. Then he continued his fight to regain custody of his daughter.
What unfolded over the next few years was a complicated legal and emotional journey for everyone involved — Masserio; John and Diana Norman, the foster family caring for his daughter; and Jewelyette herself. 
Masserio spent that time imploring officials at the state Department of Children and Families to help him get his daughter back. Meanwhile, the Normans battled to adopt Jewelyette and for their legal right to have a say about what would happen to the child who lived with them for seven years.
That legal battle would wind its way through appeals and eventually land before the state Supreme Court, which overturned 2023 case law and established that foster families have the right to be legal intervenors in some cases involving foster children.
The case, which irrevocably changed the course of Jewelyette’s childhood, occurred amid a persistent national debate about the best role for foster parents in court hearings. Foster family advocacy groups want more legal rights, while biological families and their advocates say it makes it harder for children to reunify with their families.
The Connecticut Mirror conducted interviews and exchanged messages with Masserio over the course of two years, interviewed the Normans, spoke with dozens of experts and people involved with the case and reviewed thousands of pages of documents related to Masserio’s case.
At the heart of Jewelyette’s story is a fundamental tension of the foster care system itself: some families foster to adopt, or fall in love with a child and decide to adopt, even while biological families fight to get their children back. 
During his August 2017 parole hearing, Masserio asked the Connecticut Board of Pardons and Paroles for a chance, saying that he feared if parole was denied, his parental rights would be terminated.
“I am asking you to please give me this chance to be reunited with my daughter and preserve my family,” he said in his opening statement.
After about 20 minutes of questioning, some of which centered on the crayon incident, the board granted Masserio parole. He was released a few months later, but the struggle to get custody of Jewelyette was far from over.
The beginning
Masserio, a tall man with broad shoulders and brown eyes that crinkle at the edges with his smile, described the day his daughter was born as “the best day of my life.” His partner chose the name, but Masserio decided how to spell it.
He wanted it to be special, something just for her, he said in an interview. 
“She is precious to me, like a jewel,” he wrote in a folder of notes about the custody case. 
Before they had a child, Jewelyette’s mother was using drugs and Masserio was drinking, according to DCF documents. The police were called repeatedly to their home for domestic disturbances.
But when he found out his girlfriend was pregnant, Masserio said he tried to get sober, but had setbacks, as there are with many sobriety journeys. When Jewelyette was born in 2015, she tested positive for exposure to substances and went through withdrawals. She had to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for weeks while she recovered.
Over the next several months, Masserio struggled with his sobriety. He was pulled over in 2016, and charged with his third-ever DUI. This one landed him in prison, where he served a sentence with a three-year maximum that began in June 2016.
DCF records show that he regularly attended his monthly supervised visits with his daughter, even while incarcerated. In letters, he asked the cousin Jewelyette lived with for more — more updates, more photos, more contact with Jewelyette.
“Jewelyette is so adorable,” he wrote to the family member. “Please put yourself in my shoes for 1 min. She is my only daughter and I will never give up on her.”
As for Masserio, DCF workers noted that his maximum release date was three years away. 
“His maximum release date is 5/26/19, therefore he will not be available as a reunification or parenting resource for Jewelyette … in a reasonable time frame,” they wrote in the documents that recommended terminating his rights. “Even if he is released early, he will need a period of time to reestablish housing, employment.”
DCF then pursued a plan to terminate both biological parents’ rights to Jewelyette so she could be adopted by her foster family.
Jewelyette had, at this point, been in foster care for more than 15 of the last 22 months. Federal law mandates that a child must be on a path to permanency within that timeframe — either in the process of adoption or reunification.
Advocates for family preservation say the timeline punishes families who have trouble finding housing, for example, or parents who are incarcerated.
“The ASFA [Adoption and Safe Families Act] timelines, which is what we’re talking about here, are an obscenity as well, in that they do not count what’s called relational permanence. He’s visiting, he’s trying to maintain contact,” said Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform.

DCF works with the Department of Correction to facilitate visitations between parents and children. Parents also still have the opportunity to participate in administrative hearings and to come to court when necessary, said Ken Mysogland, DCF’s chief administrator of external affairs.
DCF also tries to connect recently incarcerated parents with services, officials said.
“It’s difficult for parents to have access to services, to address the reason why the children came into care. Visitation is limited when parents are incarcerated, and we have to take into consideration the length of time that a parent may be incarcerated,” said Maritza Velez, chief of child welfare at DCF. “We have to think about, what does that mean, and how does that impact a child?”
Masserio appealed decisions and attended hearings. His files show he took courses in anger management, attended group sessions to talk about sobriety, and took a parenting class. 
Another home
At the age of 2, as her father entered his second year of incarceration in 2017, Jewelyette was moved to a new foster home after the first adoption plan fell through. DCF told the new foster family the agency was pushing to terminate parental rights.
That family was the Normans. 
John Norman was on the fence about having children until he met his now-wife, Diana Norman. Their friends had children, and seeing them become parents convinced Norman. The Normans quickly learned they couldn’t have biological children, however, so they decided to adopt.
In 2014, they got licensed as foster parents, and Norman said DCF put them on the “foster to adopt” track. DCF officials say they always make it clear that foster placements are temporary, but Norman says that was far from true in their case.
“Typically, when a child comes into care, the plan is reunification,” Velez said. That isn’t always possible, she added, but it’s what DCF strives for.
Despite those goals, Connecticut children who come into foster care are less likely, on average, to be reunified with their parents, according to federal data. About 39% of children who exited foster care in Connecticut in fiscal year 2024 were reunified with their parents, compared to 45% nationally. In Connecticut, about 29% of children who left foster care in fiscal year 2024 were adopted, compared to 27% nationally. Others age out of the system.
The Normans adopted their older daughter, Peyton, after fostering her for two years. Jewelyette, then 2, was placed with them on the day of their daughter’s 4th birthday, and in a family of mild-mannered, quiet people, she was loud. They called her “the megaphone.” 
“It was funny,” Norman said. “Jewelyette was just loud, which we liked.” She was a happy child, he added.
John Norman agreed to be interviewed for this story, but his wife did not join him because she still finds the topic too distressing to discuss. 
DCF workers told them it would be “the easiest case” because her mother’s parental rights had already been terminated and they planned to terminate her biological father’s rights in a matter of months, Norman said.
“So we took her. Ten years later, she’s still …,” Norman said, trailing off. “Things don’t always work out the way they tell you.”
They gave her a bedroom all to herself, which was painted green and decorated with Minnie Mouse ears. They put her in tae kwon do and swimming lessons, took her to specialists for her allergies. When they played family games, their older daughter and Diana Norman would be on one team, and Jewelyette and John Norman on the other. He said she was his “little buddy.”
“My wife and I’d be in another room, and just out of nowhere, Jewelyette would be like, ‘Daddy, I love you,’ same with my wife, and so it kind of breaks my heart the way this went down,” he said, tears in his eyes.
Meanwhile, Masserio worried about his daughter’s psychological well-being because she withdrew and acted out during visits, he said.
Over time, the friction between Masserio and the Normans became obvious. There were frequent irritants and misunderstandings, such as Jewelyette spelling her name differently, which Masserio said was done at the foster family’s behest. Gone was the “Jewel” that he’d given her. She scribbled “Juliet” at the top of her math homework.
Norman said this was an accident. They planned to change the spelling of her name once she was adopted, so her teachers taught her to write it both ways. The shorter spelling — Juliet — was easier and stuck with the child.
During one visit, she told Masserio that Norman was her real dad.
“You’re not my daddy, I can only have one daddy,” he recalled her saying. “My Mommy and Daddy hate you,” she said another time.
“They’re just tearing at my heart,” Masserio said in a 2023 interview. By then, Jewelyette was 8. 
Norman said that’s not true, that he thinks Jewelyette didn’t understand the concepts of a biological family or a foster family.
“I think in her head, I’m her dad. He’s the guy in the visits is what she would say,” Norman said. 
I have moments that it’s between heartbroken and frustrated, and that it went down this way. I keep thinking back to all the things we should have done. John Norman
Masserio, the second youngest in a household of seven siblings and step-siblings, wanted her to be connected to her family as much as possible. He took her on a visit to John D. Masserio Park, named for his father, in Berlin. The family had donated the land to the town to create the park.
For a while, even though he’d found an apartment and ran a construction company, Masserio tried to get on board with the adoption plan. He suggested to the Normans that they enter an open adoption. He wanted to see Jewelyette at least twice a year — sometime around her birthday and Christmas — and asked for school pictures to be mailed to him every year.
They declined, instead offering only school pictures and occasional written updates.
Norman said he and his wife didn’t trust John to stick with that plan and DCF was still on the path toward terminating Masserio’s parental rights, so they didn’t think they needed to make a deal.
“I have moments that it’s between heartbroken and frustrated, and that it went down this way,” Norman said. “I keep thinking back to all the things we should have done. That offer about the open adoption agreement, that sort of thing, I think about things like that. So if we only pursued that more.”

Reunification
In 2020, Masserio and Jewelyette got a new team of DCF social workers. This isn’t uncommon for DCF, where about a third of newly hired workers leave the agency within a year, and another 20% leave in the second year.
The agency is examining ways to improve its retention rate, including hiring a new director of organizational development to look at recruitment.
“Turnover can negatively impact the length of time it takes to achieve a positive outcome on a case,” DCF’s Mysogland said.
Jewelyette’s journey through the foster care system veered when the new team took over. They shifted her permanency plan, aiming to reunify her with Masserio.
For Masserio, it was a relief, an acknowledgement that he’d been right all along — his daughter belonged with him.
For the Normans, it sparked different emotions altogether. They filed motions asking to be party to the court case; Jewelyette had lived with them for seven years, and they thought she should stay with them.
“All Jewelyette ever said was, ‘I want to be adopted. I want to be a Norman,’”  Norman said.
There are sundry reasons a case plan might switch from adoption to reunification, but they tend to boil down to the biological parents making some change that convinces DCF they are able to provide a safe and stable home for their child.
“Our decisions are very fluid, and so we could easily be heading down the track of TPR [termination of parental rights], but until that TPR is granted, we provide services to the family, continue to provide visitation, continue to assess the progress that the family is making,” Velez said.
The voice of the child is also a point of consideration. Jewelyette changed her mind frequently, according to court documents, and Masserio said her foster parents tried to influence her decision.
A DCF reunification readiness report noted that Jewelyette reported that her foster mother would scream at her if she said she had a good visit with her father, a claim the Normans deny. The worker said it seemed Jewelyette would report bad visits, even if she seemed to have a good time, to make her foster family happy.
“This clinician understands that if this child is removed from the care of FP [foster parents], the negative influence against her father as reinforced by FP will decrease and even disappear, and this will help the child to stop her pretending behavior that she does not like father. This child will be able to value and enjoy her father completely and her paternal family as well if there is nobody telling her the opposite,” the report says.
“The relationship of this child with her father will be made whole with reunification, helping this child to gain emotional stability.”
Norman said he and his wife avoided saying negative things about Masserio in front of Jewelyette. He said it was frustrating that DCF interpreted Jewelyette telling the Normans that she didn’t want to be with her father as anything other than her true feelings.
“I know there’s times she told us things just to make us happy, or things we wanted to hear. And so we knew that, and we talked to her about it,” Norman said. “I honestly believe Jewelyette’s voice wasn’t heard throughout this whole process.”
Legal filings
Whether and to what degree foster families should be allowed to participate in custody court cases has long been a subject of national debate. Connecticut law requires that foster families be given the opportunity to testify so they can tell the judge what they think is best for the child.
Generally, people involved in the child welfare system exist along an ideological spectrum.
One one end, there are abolitionists, like Wexler, who believe the entire system is built on surveillance and separation of families. They think it should be abolished and a new system should be built from the ground up; that new system ought to be established on provision of services and keeping families together.
On the other end, there are advocates who think the state is too quick to favor family unification. Some believe foster parents should have more rights and that adoptions and termination of parental rights should be easier.
Connecticut has advocacy groups working on both ends of the spectrum to make changes to state law and DCF policy.
If I kidnap a child at birth, flee to Mexico, take really good care of him and come back in two years, can I keep him? That’s the equivalent here.Richard Wexler, National Coalition for Child Protection Reform
Research shows it’s best for kids to stay with their biological families whenever possible. The majority of children are taken from their homes during neglect cases, which are tied often to poverty, according to federal data. 
A group of Connecticut foster families in 2022 lobbied the state legislature to pass a law offering them more rights. That law didn’t pass, but they kept trying. 
“Foster parents are the ones on the front lines each and every day; we see what our children go through, and we understand the system very well,” Crystal Laffan, the group’s organizer, said in written testimony. “Yet we are rarely, if ever, consulted in our children’s cases nor in the policies governing their precious lives.”
Laffan told lawmakers on the Children’s Committee in early 2023 that she’d like foster parents to have the automatic right to intervene after a case has gone on for a year.
The law as written didn’t pass, although earlier this year, the legislature passed a law requiring DCF to develop a “foster parents’ bill of rights.”
Laffan said Indiana has one of the strongest pro-foster parent laws in the country. Initially, she and her group advocated for a version of that law, known as “Judah’s Law,” named for a 4-year-old who was tortured and killed by his biological father. He’d been placed there a few months before he was killed after being in foster care all his life.
The Indiana law sparked several other efforts in states across the country, including Connecticut.
The Normans were granted intervenor status in 2021, but claim their rights were violated. They argued they didn’t get enough opportunity to speak to the judge and were removed from hearings.
DCF filed to place Jewelyette with her father in 2021, but a judge ruled against the agency, and the girl stayed with her foster family.
In July 2023, a state appellate court ruled in a different case that a foster family should not have been allowed to intervene in a custody case involving their elementary-aged foster son, Ryan C. The case law offered an avenue for DCF’s attorney to shut down the Normans’ attempt to be a part of Jewelyette’s case.
Abolitionists like Wexler liken the idea of a foster family getting attached and trying to adopt a child to kidnapping.
“If I kidnap a child at birth, flee to Mexico, take really good care of him and come back in two years, can I keep him? That’s the equivalent here,” Wexler said. “They didn’t commit an illegal act in taking the child, but in terms of the notion that simply taking the child by force of law in this case, and holding the child somehow entitles you to that child forever is obscene.”
Acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio, who represented the Normans in their appeals when she was in private practice, said foster parent intervention should be rare, but possible. She said foster parents already have the right to be heard in court.
“There are times when the foster parent has information that would be helpful for the judge to have in making decisions that other parties may choose not to bring to the judge,” Ghio said. “A motion to intervene is only going to happen when there’s some really significant concern, and the foster parents don’t see another vehicle for raising those concerns.”
Even Dorene Masserio-Beach, one of Masserio’s older sisters, said it’s not clear what should be done.
“It’s a really, really tough thing, and I feel bad for them [the foster family] because they had this child ripped away from them,” she said.
DCF has in recent years worked to build better relationships between biological and foster families by holding meetings between the two early on and encouraging the foster families to ask questions of the biological family, such as about the child’s bedtime routine or favorite snacks.
Foster parents are the ones on the front lines each and every day; we see what our children go through, and we understand the system very well. Yet we are rarely, if ever, consulted in our children’s cases nor in the policies governing their precious lives.Crystal Laffan, foster parent
The damage to those relationships, if foster families intervene in court cases, is a concern for DCF, Mysogland said.
“What we don’t want is for that to be an adversarial relationship between the foster parents and the birth parents,” Mysogland said. If foster families become party to the case “that certainly may lead to this adversarial relationship, which is counter to the quality parenting work we are trying to build, which we know is so successful for children and families.”
After the Ryan C. case decision was released, Jewelyette and her father moved more quickly toward reunification. They had more frequent and longer visits. He prepared a room for her at his home, painting it pink and hanging curtains with his sister.
For years, he’d been buying Jewelyette clothes and toys, hoping for the day she would live with him again. The room overflowed with stuffed unicorns, plastic horses and books.
“He was so excited,” said Karleen Masserio-Giarratana, Masserio’s older sister. “He was ready to spoil that girl.”
She tried to talk him into taking some of the clothes and toys back because no one child could use that much, she said, but he refused. He was making up for lost time.
In August 2024, Jewelyette moved into her father’s Farmington apartment, and had a handful of supervised visits with the Normans, who were still appealing for custody in court.
Her foster family didn’t have any warning that she would be taken, Norman said. His wife and daughter went on a trip that week, and it was supposed to be a week he spent with Jewelyette. He still recalls walking around the empty house, wishing it was filled with her presence.
Over the following months, Jewelyette’s mental health declined, and she threatened to hurt herself, according to court documents. She wanted to see her foster parents, but Masserio was afraid they’d take her again. Over months of therapy and other services, she adjusted, her father said.
By Christmas, he said, she was settled in at her new home. Meanwhile, the Normans pushed their appeal of the decision to the Supreme Court. Norman said he still thinks they would be a better home for Jewelyette. At their home, she had two parents, a pet dog and a sister. They were stable, and he saw Masserio as a risk.
“We raised her from 2 to 9,” Norman said. “She was part of our family, and I know we’re not biological, but she was our daughter — is our daughter.”
‘Never gave up’
Masserio and Jewelyette lived in a second-floor walkup apartment in a home without an in-unit washer and dryer. When the opportunity arose to move into a first-floor unit that was larger and offered easier access to laundry, Masserio jumped at the chance.
He started moving their belongings downstairs in early January 2025, despite the cold and snow. Then, 9-year-old Jewelyette got sick, spiking a fever and coughing. She had the flu, and Masserio responded with the fear of a first-time parent and stayed by her bedside through the night, listening to her breathe.
She recovered within a few days, and he continued the move. He kept going, moving them into the new apartment, even when he felt tired and weak and his own fever spiked. 
On Jan. 10, Jewelyette hid in the bathroom and called her foster parents. Her dad was sick and sleeping all day and she hadn’t eaten, she said. Norman suggested she call 911.
In the call recording obtained by CT Mirror, the 911 operator stayed on the phone with her until the police arrived. Jewelyette whispered at moments and seemed to cry during others. She wanted to go back to the Normans, she said, and she was hungry. 
In the call, she referred to both Masserio and Norman as her dad.
Police arrived and noted she needed treatment for mental health issues. Masserio told them she was in intensive therapy.
Days after the incident, Masserio called his middle sister, a nurse, and told her he was having trouble catching his breath. She called an ambulance to take him to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a bad case of the flu.
When he arrived at the hospital, the doctor said he was severely dehydrated, that years of smoking would make it harder for his lungs to heal, and that he was in renal failure. Masserio-Beach knew her brother didn’t have much time left.
“It totally flipped his world upside down once he became a dad,” she said. “He just never wanted her to feel like he gave up on her. Sadly, he didn’t take care of himself when he got the flu.”
Doctors told the family that the outlook was grim. He’d weakened his body with the move and failed to care for himself in his urgency to care for his daughter. Jewelyette visited briefly, although he wasn’t conscious. 
She made a card for her father with a drawing in crayon of the two of them —both smiling, with thought bubbles above their heads that say “I love you,” and a broken heart above them. The top of the card says “me with out you is inposible.”

A card Jewelyette made for her father when he was in the hospital. 
“I am going to be lonle with out you,” she wrote in a child’s scrawl. “I all wees will love you.”
A nurse read it to him and wrote Jewelyette a note after Masserio died on Jan. 21, just five months after he’d gotten his daughter back. The nurse told the girl that when she told Masserio he had a card from Jewelyette, he raised his eyebrows, assuring her that he could hear and comprehend what she was saying.
After her father’s death, Jewelyette moved in with Masserio-Giantarra. The child handwrote thank you notes to everyone who sent cards or flowers for her father’s funeral. His obituary noted that their relationship, and his devotion to it, is the quality he’d be most remembered for.
“He was a father whose love for his daughter was boundless, a quiet strength in every experience they shared, a hidden knight as he pushed against the tides, always fighting for his little girl,” it said. “His heart was a sanctuary for her, always protecting, always guiding and in his care, she knew the truest form of love.”
Three months after Masserio died, in March, the Connecticut Supreme Court overturned Ryan C. case law and said the foster parents should have been granted intervenor status in Jewelyette’s case.
The ruling opens the opportunity for foster parents across the state to intervene in legal cases, but for the Normans, it did no good. Masserio was dead, the case ended. Jewelyette was on her way to permanency with her father’s family.
“It won’t help us,” Norman said, of the ruling. “I guess it will help other families.”
They still haven’t gotten over their loss. Norman said his wife still can’t talk about what happened, and that his daughter still puts the clothes she outgrows into Jewelyette’s old bedroom, waiting for the girl she considered her sister to come home.

Adoption
As he lay dying in the hospital, Masserio said he wanted his daughter to be with his family.
Masserio-Giantarra and her husband, Sal, filed for legal guardianship so they could adopt Jewelyette. Compared to the reunification process and previous adoption pushes, this moved quickly. 
Jewelyette had her official adoption ceremony in June.
The New Britain courtroom was filled with family members and at least a dozen DCF workers who’d interacted with Masserio and Jewelyette over the years. Many carried balloons or flowers for the girl, whose 10th birthday was the day after her adoption.
Jewelyette donned the last dress Masserio ever bought her for the occasion, smoothing the tulle blue and purple skirt as she sat beside her aunt in the courtroom. The tiara he’d bought her when she was younger glittered on her head.
It was a moment of profound happiness tinged with profound grief. After all these years, Jewelyette was welcomed home, but her father wasn’t there. The case was closed, but it wasn’t the ending anyone had initially hoped for.
“This has gone on for far too long, and ultimately, the greatest impact has been on you, Jewelyette. I want to acknowledge that you are handed circumstances you never asked for,” Jewelyette’s attorney Deetta Roncone-Gondek said in a statement at the hearing.
“I will never forget the sound of your father’s voice saying your name,” Roncone-Gondek said. “The look he had on his face when speaking to you, interacting with you, is one that will be etched in my memory forever. Your banter with him, the way you made him laugh, the joy you both shared in my presence; Jewelyette, carry him with you always.”
She and the guardian ad litem recommended that the judge approve the adoption.
At the attorney’s words, Masserio-Giarratana planted a firm kiss on Jewelyette’s left cheek while the girl wiped tears off the right.
Jewelyette carried a photo of her and her father, their heads pressed close together and noses wrinkled in a smile, to the adoption ceremony, and wrote out a statement to read to the judge. With a nudge from her aunt, she stood, eyes on the paper.
“I wanted to say thank you guys for helping me get here and not giving up,” she said, her small voice cracking. “We all know my dad has passed, but I thank him because he says ‘I’ll never give up on my daughter. I love her,’ and I love him very much.”
At the end of the ceremony, the judge invited her to join him at the bench.
It was with the wide smile inherited from her father on her lips and the hint of a giggle in her voice that she banged the judge’s gavel.
“Court is adjourned,” she crowed. She gingerly placed the gavel back on the desk, then rushed down the steps, tumbling into her family’s waiting arms.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FOSTER-CARE-05-e1764613544704-1024x793.jpg,,,2025-12-02 05:57:41.380059

If you or someone you know needs support now, call, text or chat the 988 Lifeline.
Operators of group homes for Ohioans with mental illness gathered in Columbus this week to hear about where care and funding are headed for some of the neediest Ohioans.
The Ohio Adult Care Facilities Association is a statewide trade association representing operators of adult group homes for those with severe and persistent mental illness. 
The group sprang from the National Alliance on Mental Illness of Ohio, a non-profit organization.
About 100 homeowners and operators attended the association’s annual conference to learn about topics ranging from funding and Medicaid cuts to finding new residents and administering critical psychiatric medications.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While they come from different backgrounds and parts of the state, group homeowner operators have one thing in common: they are not in it for the money. 
More often than not, owners struggle to pay for home upkeep, feeding, transporting, and caring for residents, many of whom don’t have family members to depend upon.
Richard Barnes Jr., who operates Barnes Caring Services in Toledo, received the association’s Resiliency Award after he took on second and third jobs to pay for home repairs.

Dawn Campbell Lavey, operator of three facilities in the Lancaster area, got the Lifetime Achievement Award for decades of advocacy for those with mental illness. 
“She has changed the world for many people in need,” her award nomination said.
Lavey was first exposed to mental health issues when she was 13 and working in a nursing home. 
After she graduated from Baylor University, she saw a real need for helping mentally ill patients. 
“My passion has always been for the indigent and the mentally ill,” she said.
Raven Oglesby, executive director of the Ohio Adult Care Facilities Association, provided some troubling news about funding in view of federal cutbacks but followed it up with a pep talk.
“We are advocating for you and you should start advocating for yourself,” Oglesby said. 
She urged home operators to look to state psychiatric hospitals, county jails, homeless shelters, and mental health agencies to find residents to fill empty beds in their homes.
The group homes are predominantly located in five urban areas of the state – Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Dayton, and Toledo. Many parts of Ohio have no designated group homes.
The need for homes for adults with mental illness developed quickly about 20 years ago when the state closed ten psychiatric hospitals, pushing some of the most vulnerable, severely ill people into homeless shelters, private homes, hospitals, jails, and to the streets.
As a result, Residential Class 2 Adult Care Facilities were established, mostly private businesses or through faith-based organizations.
Funding has been a problem since day one.
Money to operate the homes comes from private payments, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) funds, scarce local dollars from county mental health boards, private fundraising, and the Residential State Supplement program operated by the Ohio Department of Behavioral Health (formerly the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services). 
The residential state supplement allocation is $1,600 per month per resident. The state is paying $23.3 million annually for the supplement to about 2,500 home residents.
Sonya Durosinmi-Etti, the association’s board president and a Columbus home operator, said she is motivated by helping others not making money from her business.
“We have such a passion for what we do. We love our work. We love our residents,” she said in an interview.
Officials from the Ohio Department of Behavioral Health updated conference attendees about on-going programs, including the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline which received 592,294 calls and text messages for help in the first three years of operation. 
It takes an average of 23 seconds for an operator to answer calls and texts at one of 19 call centers around Ohio.
Roma Barickman, head of Housing and Homelessness Policy and Programs for the state, has worked for many years with people who provide homes for those with mental health issues who might otherwise have nowhere to go.
“I love the passion in this room,” she said. “I love what you do for your residents. But you are also a business. You have your compassion hat and you have your business hat.”

In comments submitted to the U.S. Department of Transportation, they argue that the change is based on unfounded safety concerns about non-citizen drivers and that the restrictions would harm the livelihood of license holders as well as the state’s economy. 
If the rule goes into effect, 100% of current non-domiciled commercial driver’s license holders in Maine would no longer be eligible, according to the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles. A non-domiciled CDL is issued to people who are legally permitted to work but are not yet permanent U.S. residents. Nationwide, an estimated 97% of current non-domiciled CDL holders would lose eligibility.
In September, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration announced the emergency interim final rule — titled “Restoring Integrity to the Issuance of Non-Domiciled Commercial Driver’s Licenses (CDL)” — which would make it so only green card holders, U.S. citizens and certain employment-based visa holders would be eligible for a CDL. 
But in November, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a stay pending review of the rule, preventing it from taking effect. However, some states have independently decided to no longer issue or renew commercial driver’s licenses to certain foreign-born drivers, including Texas and New Mexico.
The comment period for the rule closed Friday. Several Maine entities weighed in.  
When initially announcing the change, President Donald Trump’s administration cited recent fatal crashes caused by non-domiciled drivers. This issue was thrust into the public consciousness in August when an undocumented truck driver licensed in California and Washington killed three Floridians in a road accident. 
In the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles’ comments submitted in opposition to the rule, the agency pointed out that the federal government’s data shows that the vast majority of fatal crashes in 2025 were caused by those with regular CDLs, not non-domiciled CDLs. 
Of the 2,399 fatal crashes involving citizen and noncitizen commercial drivers of large trucks and buses in 2025, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration identified five incidents (0.21% of identified fatal crashes) “to blame non-domiciled CDL holders … as an imminent ‘threat to public safety and direct threat to national security,’” wrote Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and Deputy Secretary of State for the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles Cathie Curtis.
They added, “these isolated anecdotes do not explain any connection between the drivers’ immigration status and the cause of the crashes, and FMCSA acknowledges, as noted above, that it lacks any reliable data demonstrating that the selected category of noncitizens is more likely to be involved in fatal crashes.”
Bellows said in a statement shared with Maine Morning Star that the rule “is yet another cruel attempt by the Trump administration to punish immigrants who are legally here and make their existence here as difficult as possible.” 
Bellows and Curtis also stated in their submitted comments that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration bypassed legally required consultation with states before submitting the rule.  
When announcing the rule, the White House also cited a federal audit that found some states had issued licenses illegally to foreign drivers. California now plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates exceeded the date the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S.
The Maine Immigration Rights Coalition, the convener of a statewide network of about 85 organizations representing diverse ethnic communities, and Maine Equal Justice, a non-partisan civil legal aid and economic justice organization, also submitted comments in opposition, highlighting the benefits of this license to help fill workforce gaps. 
“Maine is a rural state with a high average age, a persistent worker shortage, and industries deeply dependent on immigrant labor,” wrote Ruben Torres, Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition’s advocacy and policy manager. “Commercial driving is a critical pathway to economic security for many of our constituents, particularly asylum seekers and other legally present immigrants who rely on Employment Authorization Documents to work.”
Portland Adult Education has a CDL training pipeline that produces at least 20 newly trained commercial drivers each year, funded with a combination of local, state and federal dollars. Torres wrote that these workers, many of whom are immigrants, have helped stabilize transportation systems across the state by filling vacancies in the public bus system, school bus system and municipal transit operations.
Maine Equal Justice similarly wrote that the rule would interrupt established workforce pathways and burden employers and training providers who have invested resources to grow the commercial trucking industry in Maine. 
The Maine Motor Transport Association estimated in May that the state needs 1,100 more drivers to meet existing demands, and industry experts estimate the new rule could remove about 200 Maine drivers from the road.
Noting this, Maine Equal Justice wrote, “If there are fewer license-holders, existing drivers may have to work overtime or drive longer trips, increasing the likelihood of distracted driving and potential crashes, a result that violates the agency’s own safety rationale articulated in their interim rule.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bus_greaterportlandmetro-1024x733.jpg,,,2025-12-02 04:56:29.072388

Jess Geren’s four children are regular churchgoers — they participate in Christian youth groups and study the Bible at home. When LifeWise Academy, a fast-growing program that allows students to leave school during the day for religious instruction, came to Ayersville Local Schools, their northwest Ohio district, she saw it as a chance to spread the gospel.
“It’s not my kids that I worry about,” she said. “This is their opportunity to be a light. Their mission field is the public school.”
For many other Ohio parents, that’s a problem.
Since he was 8, Cherie Khumprakob’s son, now 11, has been receiving written invitations from classmates to join them at LifeWise. She found one in his backpack.
“He hates getting these notes from his friends and having to tell them ‘No’ repeatedly,” said Khumprakob, who lives in the Columbus area. “Training kids to pressure their friends into religious activities while at public school, during school hours, crosses a line.
Kids who attend LifeWise often return to school with invitations for their friends. Some parents are opposed. (Photo courtesy of Cherie Khumprakob.)
The opposing views illustrate the tension in Ohio and other states where LifeWise is rapidly expanding. The $35 million organization expects to serve close to 100,000 kids in 34 states this school year. It has 1,600 employees and runs its own fleet of eye-catching red buses.
Founded in 2018, LifeWise is the most visible group behind a movement to spread off-campus religious instruction during the school day. Since 2024, the nonprofit has successfully lobbied for legislation in Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas mandating that districts allow students to attend LifeWise or similar programs. Some say the requirements violate the separation of church and state.
“That’s a big shift,” said Mark Chancey, a religious studies professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. “This whole mandatory aspect is historically something different.”
In a moment when Republicans are fighting to hang the 10 Commandments on classroom walls and squeeze biblical passages into reading lessons, LifeWise has taken these programs in a more evangelical direction. The organization faces pushback from parents and district staff who think Bible study should be relegated to afterschool hours. LifeWise programs that reward students with items like candy and encourage kids to recruit their friends have proven particularly divisive.
But those are the strategies LifeWise recommends as a way to increase participation. “Send students back to school with ‘Invite a Friend’ flyers,” urges a tip sheet on “boosting enrollment.” A Q&A document says treats are “fun incentives” that are meant to foster a “positive and engaging learning environment.”
“Most students who enjoy a sport, activity or program will talk about it with their friends and encourage them to give it a try as well,” said LifeWise spokeswoman Christine Czernejewski. “Lifewise is no different.”
The 74 found examples of financial transactions between districts and LifeWise that could create the appearance of promoting the program. Especially in Ohio, LifeWise often enjoys strong support from school officials; one superintendent warned staff to avoid such activity while the district was “under the radar.”
Supporters argue that LifeWise and similar classes respect the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause because they require parent permission, don’t meet on school grounds and aren’t supposed to rely on school resources for support.
Some districts are putting “tacks on the road so the big red bus loses air in the tires” just because the program teaches the Bible, said Jeremy Dys, senior counsel with First Liberty Institute, a law firm specializing in religious freedom cases.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The 46,000-student Columbus, Ohio, district banned religious groups from sending kids back to school with any “materials, snacks, clothing, candies, trinkets or other items.” Then the legislature amended the law to say districts can’t prevent organizations from distributing educational materials, but have some discretion over limiting non-educational items like treats. For now, Dys, who represents LifeWise, is waiting to see whether the new restrictions interfere with the program.
“There’s just a lot of animosity and hostility towards religion,” he said. But recent Supreme Court decisions, like one siding with a football coach who held mid-field prayers and another allowing parents to opt their children out of hearing LGBTQ-themed story books, have expanded religious influence at school. “The courts … have basically been telling school districts, ‘Cool it.’ ”
In total, 16 states require districts to allow students to participate in religious studies during school hours, but a few, like Pennsylvania and New York, have had such laws on the books for years. Some states aren’t ready to take that leap. Legislation requiring districts to release students stalled this year in Alabama, Georgia and Nebraska.
At an education subcommittee hearing in February, Georgia state Rep. David Clark, a Republican running for lieutenant governor, said the programs could solve one of the most pressing issues facing public schools — enrollment loss.
“We have thousands of students leaving public schools. It could be private school; it could be home school,” he said. “I think this … protects our public schools, because it allows parents, [if] they want the religious studies, they can sign their kid up.”
Clark alluded to data suggesting that attendance increases and behavior improves in schools with LifeWise programs. The findings, from a 2023 report sponsored by a supporter, are frequently cited by LifeWise founder Joel Penton and officials who pitch the program to school boards across the country.
But some researchers say the report’s conclusions overstate the program’s benefits. Charles Riedesel, a computer scientist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, called the work “shoddy.” For one, it included the COVID year, a time when states changed how they tracked attendance because so many students were learning remotely.

 ‘Blows my mind’

Even though the legislation failed in Georgia, LifeWise still has programs in about six districts statewide, and church leaders are pushing for more.
On a sunny Friday morning in October roughly an hour outside Atlanta, about 20 Cartersville Elementary fifth graders piled onto a LifeWise bus for a short drive to a local church. Ebby McCoy said she was missing a computer class, but likes how the LifeWise lessons “go a bit deeper” into the Bible than what she learns in church.

Former elementary school teacher Danielle Ruff energetically led the kids through a fast-paced lesson on the 10 plagues that the Bible says God inflicted on Egypt for keeping the Jews enslaved. As she spoke, students connected puzzle pieces linking the disasters in order — water turning to blood, frogs infesting homes and gnats “biting them like crazy,” Ruff said.
“The next set of plagues only happen to the Egyptians. They don’t happen to the Israelites,” she said. “It blows my mind every time.”
Jason Morrow, a LifeWise board member, was among several volunteers on hand to help kids locate Bible verses. He called the program a “touchpoint during the week” that teaches his daughter, one of the fifth graders, that faith is “not just a Sunday weekend thing.”
But Clay Willis, who works at the church hosting the program, said LifeWise leaders try to respect the school’s boundaries. For one, they don’t hand out candy.
“If we sugar them up, that’s not the best way to serve the teachers,” he said.

 ‘It’s insulting’

Supporters of LifeWise and similar programs point to a 1952 Supreme Court decision, Zorach v. Clauson, that legalized the practice. But the fact that these programs pull kids out of school during the day offers critics their leading argument. During a meeting last fall, Amber Skinner, a board member in the Worthington, Ohio, district, near Columbus, said checking students in and out of school for their LifeWise session is disruptive and eats up staff time.
“Teachers who are funded with taxpayer dollars” spend time providing a lot of “hands-on assistance” to elementary students who need help signing themselves out, she said.
The classes, usually held once or twice a week, often coincide with non-core offerings like art and music. Some educators think students are losing out on important material.
Alan Limke, a retired STEM teacher from the Milton Union district, outside Dayton, kept a list of the lessons that students missed every Tuesday when they left for LifeWise. They included simple circuits, building and launching foam rockets and 3-D modeling. Leading up to the 2024 solar eclipse, when Milton was in the path of totality, he planned a month of activities, including a visit from a mobile planetarium.
“It’s insulting,” said Limke, who grew up Catholic, but now considers himself an atheist. “I work very hard to come up with lessons that are rigorous and fun and important.”

While LifeWise requires parent permission, specific procedures vary by district, according to Czernejewski, the organization’s spokeswoman. In Ayersville, Ohio, the district Geren’s children attend, the initial permission form remains in effect year to year unless a parent requests a withdrawal. That seems wrong to Nick Sullivan, whose oldest daughter wanted to stop attending after fifth grade.
“You’ve got to send in a paper stating that you do not want your kid to attend LifeWise or they’re going to automatically enroll them,” Sullivan said. He thinks schools should require the permission slips annually, just like other paperwork.
Sullivan withheld his daughter’s name to protect her privacy. Now an eighth grader, she told The 74 she found the LifeWise lessons repetitive and said the instructors “would give us a full bag of candy” for reciting Bible verses.
“I was supposed to be in study hall and they kept on sending me whether I liked it or not,” she said.
 ‘Crossing the line’

Experiences like those contribute to the growing opposition to LifeWise. The Secular Education Association, formed in 2023, keeps a lookout for incidents where they think school officials inappropriately promote the program or allow LifeWise too much access. They’ve found school officials who tout LifeWise in newsletters or post photos on social media with the group’s leaders. Other examples they’ve gathered since 2023 include:

Continental Elementary in northwest Ohio shared a video of a LifeWise representative on its Facebook page in 2022. The woman displayed baked goods students could choose from if they attended a LifeWise fundraiser. “We have yummy brownies, cookies with M&M’s,” she said. “It’s just so beautiful.” The district did not respond to questions about the video.


The Culver district in Indiana, west of Fort Wayne, held a LifeWise-related assembly during school hours last year that caught the attention of attorneys at the Freedom from Religion Foundation. The organization, which advocates for church-state separation, reminded Superintendent Karen Shuman of the district’s policy stating that “no solicitation for attendance at religious instruction shall be permitted on [district] premises.”In an email to The 74, Shuman said the district is “not conducting Lifewise programs” and that she had “no idea” what the assembly was about.


The Supreme Court said religious instruction during the school day should be held off school grounds. The Elmwood Local Schools, south of Toledo, rents space to LifeWise near a school. Superintendent Tony Borton said the lease “has not been an issue in our community.” But last year, he warned against mentioning LifeWise during high school announcements after someone complained, according to an email the Secular Education Association obtained through a public records request. “We are crossing the line with these type things,” Borton wrote. “I am trying to reign in [sic], with the hope we can do more later when we are not under the radar.”

Zachary Parrish, co-founder of the Secular Education Association, grew critical of LifeWise when his daughter was sent to study hall, and missed reading instruction, while other students went to the program.

A 74 analysis of data from GovSpend, a company that tracks government purchases, turned up a few additional examples of expenditures that could raise questions. In 2022, Ohio’s Franklin Monroe school district paid Caleb Crevier, a basketball spinning performer, $800 for a “LifeWise assembly.” A LifeWise representative, Tara Schwartz initiated the event, according to district emails. The district did not respond to questions about it.
Another Ohio district, River View, cut a check for $2,000 to LifeWise earlier this year. The funds came from community members donating to the organization, but were improperly routed through the district, said district Treasurer Kara Kimes.
“I’d like to get these funds cleaned up ASAP as donations that are directly for Lifewise shouldn’t be flowing through the district,” she wrote to another staff member in an email The 74 obtained through a public records request.
Community members in the River View, Ohio district, donated to their local LifeWise program, but an official said those funds shouldn’t come through the district.
Czernejewski, the LifeWise spokeswoman, said the organization does not advise local school districts, but that its “role is to operate in compliance with applicable laws.” She added that she was unaware of school officials promoting the program, noting that LifeWise can submit announcements to district newsletters, just like other community organizations.
 ‘Develop good relationships’

Off-site religious studies during the school day date back to the early 1900s when the Mormon church offered “seminary” classes to students in Granite, Utah.
Around the same time, a Gary, Indiana, superintendent launched an off-site religious studies program, and the concept began to grow across the country.
One of the longest-running examples is School Ministries, based in South Carolina, the first state to allow districts to award elective credit for such programs. Like the lawmaker in Georgia, Executive Director Ken Breivik said the classes allow parents who can’t afford private school “to get some sort of religious experience.” But he thinks forcing districts to release students can spark a “visceral reaction” from school leaders and prefers not to talk much about LifeWise.
“We are just a different organization. We have never done a school board presentation,” he said. He will ask districts to allow a small pilot program before spreading to multiple schools. “We work really hard to develop good relationships with the schools we serve.”
In January, Penton, LifeWise’s founder, joined a Christian broadcaster to discuss an unlikely competitor in Marysville, outside Columbus: Hellion Academy for Independent Learning, or HAIL. The Satanic Temple sponsors the program as an alternative to Christian groups meeting during the school day. The organizers’ intent, Penton said, is “to rattle people” and get districts to stop releasing students for any religious instruction.
HAIL, which focuses on secular humanism rather than Satan worship, began as parent Susannah Plumb’s response to her kids’ classmates leaving school for Joy El Bible Adventure, a Pennsylvania program.
“It’s not in-your-face proselytization, but little kids don’t understand. They see Johnny get on the bus once a week … and go on a field trip,” Plumb said. “My kids felt left behind.”
Students from a Pennsylvania district attending the Hellion Academy for Independent Learning painted “kindness stones” to place in a local park. (Photo courtesy of Susannah Plumb.)
HAIL meets at a nearby library, where the kids conduct science experiments, launch community service projects and paint “kindness stones” to place in a local park at the end of the year. But she said the program wouldn’t exist if Joy El, LifeWise and others didn’t.
“I believe in the separation of church and state, but I also believe in plurality,” she said. “When there’s one, there needs to be another.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)As of late last year, more than 1,300 children torn from their parents’ arms at the U.S.–Mexico border from 2017 to 2021 had not been reunited with their parents. This figure represents nearly a third of the 4,600 children forcibly separated from their families.
Human rights organizations described this as potentially a form of torture, due to the intentional infliction of suffering and the systemic nature of the separations as an immigration deterrent.
Such measures enjoyed support and even celebration from the American Christian right, leaving many to wonder: What kind of religion endorses such cruelty, the withholding of health care, winking at racism and embracing xenophobia?
There’s little Christian about this, it seems, unless viewed through a theologically Calvinist lens.
The Rev. Robert Johnson, who leads Church of the Resurrection’s new Lee’s Summit location, said the seeming detachment from suffering, tolerance of destructive ideas like “Manifest Destiny” and more likely have Calvinist roots.

“In their minds, God has already chosen,” said Johnson, who earlier led a United Methodist Church in Wichita. “Social justice is viewed as impudence to God’s executed will, and it’s also anti-empathy. In fact, empathy is meaningless.”
In August, PBS News published a story headlined, “Is empathy a sin? Some conservative Christians argue it can be.”
“For them, empathy is a cudgel for the left,” the article explained. “It can manipulate caring people into accepting all manner of sins according to a conservative Christian perspective, including abortion access, LGBTQ+ rights, illegal immigration and certain views on social and racial justice.”
Allie Beth Stuckey, author of “Toxic Empathy: How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion,” was quoted as saying: “Empathy becomes toxic when it encourages you to affirm sin, validates lies or supports destructive policies.”
Christian right beliefs have buttressed political conservatism for decades, from the Confederacy’s “Lost Cause,” to Jerry Falwell’s “Moral Majority,” to today’s MAGA movement. Falwell’s Liberty University didn’t originally admit Black students. To be fair, not all evangelicals hold such beliefs, but we should try to understand where the beliefs of so many might come from.
A review of Anthea Butler’s “White Evangelical Racism: The Politics of Morality in America,” by Bianca Mabute-Louie, identifies evangelicalism as a nationalist political movement to support white, Christian hegemony. Racism is a feature, not a bug, of the movement.
Butler, according to Mabute-Louie, said, “interpretation of Scriptures, theology, and belief informed evangelicals’ social and political actions, and justified the oppression of African Americans during and post-enslavement.”
Many Americans have been puzzled by evangelicals’ devotion to President Donald Trump despite his lurid personal picadilloes, his seeming lack of religiosity and the cruelty of his recent attempt to deny millions, including children, of food benefits.
Christians and non-Christians alike have asked earnestly how any believer — left, right or otherwise — could support such policies and such a person.
Johnson suggested these beliefs reach deep into 1500-era teachings of John Calvin and “predestination.”
Most students learned about Calvinism from a historical, not religious, perspective. The Pilgrims, for example, were Calvinists. That’s also where the “Protestant work ethic” originated, as well as interpretations of the Bible as “without error.”
Calvin believed that “even before creation,” God had chosen some people for salvation, a belief associated with predestination, according to Christianity.com. Calvin fumed at how Catholicism reduced religion to “salvation by works.”
His refrain? People shouldn’t try to manipulate God nor place Him in their debt. Saved people are saved only Him, not by good works.
“This is the perfect theology for what we see in the evangelical movement,” Johnson said. “This is why they may not consider themselves bigoted or racist. They have found a denominational justification for our racial caste system. It’s why they don’t like social activism. To them, there is no social Gospel, only individual salvation.”
Johnson pointed to the acronym TULIP for understanding.
TULIP stands for total depravity (there’s no good in us), unconditional election (God has already chosen those who prosper), limited atonement (Jesus died specifically for the elect), and perseverance of the saints (the elect will be saved).
John Wesley, a founder of modern Methodism, provided an alternative to this theology for many, including for Johnson.
Wesley, Johnson said, looked at slavery and like Calvin, saw the total depravity. But Wesley also saw God in the tortured enslaved people and heard an ecclesiastical call to rescue them.
“From his deathbed, John Wesley pleaded with people gathered around him to promise to end the scourge of slavery,” Johnson said. “I follow United Methodism in that spirit.”
A photo of a crying toddler caught up in a nighttime border raid remains an enduring image from the first Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy.
The prolonged family separation stemmed from the federal government’s failure to maintain a central database. A 2018 court order halted the practice, and a 2023 settlement requires continued reunification efforts and support through 2031.
But a lifetime of damage already has been done, especially to the children. Pope Leo has called out the “extremely disrespectful” treatment of migrants in the U.S., according to an NPR report.
The question then becomes not if God exists in the crying toddler or her parents, but where is God in a faith tradition that embraces such wanton and intentional cruelty?

In fact, the GOP-led chamber has only worked 14 days since July 25. As Congress sat idle, hardworking Ohioans faced rising health care costs, farmers battled dangerous market instability, and millions may lose necessary food assistance.
It’s time for Congress to show up for the people it serves — to lower costs, raise wages, and protect the freedom to make choices about our own lives. As the Communications and Policy Director for the Rural Democracy Initiative, I worked with 40 local, state, and national organizations — including the Ohio-based Black Appalachian Coalition (BLAC) — to create the Rural Policy Action Report, which offers a roadmap of popular policies lawmakers could implement today.
Here are five priorities to help families, small businesses, and rural communities thrive.
 1. Fix health care.

To start, lawmakers should reverse the Medicaid cuts and renew the Affordable Care Act tax credits that they allowed to expire to pass tax breaks for billionaires.
More than undoing the damage Congress did this year, we need them to go further: lower prescription prices, support rural hospitals, and ensure reliable care close to home. 
Access to life-saving services shouldn’t depend on your ZIP code or your income.
 2. Stand with farmers, not just corporations.

For farmers, rising health care costs are just part of the growing challenges.
“Our members are feeling the pain of a chaotic trade policy, massive cuts to USDA programs that serve all farmers and rural communities, and the ever-growing threat from monopolies that manipulate the agriculture marketplace,” said Aaron Lehman of the Iowa Farmers Union, a contributor to the report.
With the Farm Bill years past due, it seems Congress only makes time to fund programs for the biggest agribusinesses. 
But Congress could help develop local markets by investing in local food systems, reinstating the Local Food Purchase Assistance program that helped schools buy fresh food from local farms, and helping farmers protect soil and water. 
They should retool crop insurance and credit programs so they work for smaller, more diverse farms.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Farmers watched as new tariffs hurt the U.S. soybean market, and boosted sales for Argentina. 
To top it off, the Trump administration promised Argentina an additional $20 billion bailout gift. Congress must rein in our trade policy and prioritize independent producers, small-town businesses, and workers.
 3. Strengthen public schools.

Rural schools are the heart of their communities, preparing students with the skills to compete. 
But the federal government diverted billions from public schools to private schools with a voucher tax credit that could cost taxpayers up to $51 billion a year — more than the federal government spends on all public K–12 education.
Lawmakers should stop the voucher programs and instead ensure students have properly funded schools with speech and reading services and support for kids with disabilities.
 4. Empower workers

Rural workers often earn less, have fewer benefits, and face higher injury rates. When workers are respected and fairly paid, they spend locally and keep main streets alive. 
But the Trump administration has tried to eliminate dozens of worker safety rules, rescinded an important overtime rule, and ordered immigration raids at work sites across the country.
Congress should protect the right to organize, ensure safe work sites, and guarantee paid family and medical leave.
 5. Make essentials affordable

Everyone should be able to afford groceries, medicine, and energy bills — but prices keep climbing. 
Congress must work to lower prices and enable small businesses to be competitive so people have real choices.
Congress should also restore food assistance, cut costs for childcare, housing, and energy, and expand broadband access.
Congress needs to work for us, not for the special interests of big corporations and the ultra wealthy.
Rural communities have been overlooked — or actively harmed — by federal policy. 
The Rural Policy Action Report shows a better path: a practical plan with example legislation to improve health care, support farmers, strengthen public schools, stand with workers, and lower costs.

(Getty Images)Some 135 days after its deadline, Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a bipartisan budget compromise into law and ended a monthslong impasse — but many Pennsylvanians working in home care were shut out of any additional funding, prompting a call for more investment in 2026.
The Pennsylvania Homecare Association seeks to raise Medicaid rates by 23% and invest upwards of $800 million into home care to “stabilize” the industry, citing studies commissioned by the Shapiro administration and a bipartisan legislative committee. But the 2025-2026 budget allotted just $21 million for Direct Care Workers, which the association said helps just 6% of the workforce.

“Pennsylvania’s in-home care crisis is both devastating and straightforward— the workforce is collapsing, and people are going without care,” Mia Haney, the association’s CEO, said in a release. “The Governor and Legislature have taxpayer-funded studies that spell out exactly what must be done. Families are missing hours they’re authorized for, medically fragile children are losing care, and seniors are being left without help. We don’t need more reports — we need leadership.”
PHA represents more than 700 homecare, home health and hospice providers across the commonwealth. The organization filed a formal Program Revision Request for a 13% increase in personal assistance services — at minimum — and a $59 per hour nursing rate in the next fiscal year, which starts on July 1. 
According to PHA, the average hourly reimbursement rate for personal assistance services is “the lowest among neighboring states” at $20.63, a rate that ranges from $36.31 in New York to $25.58 in Maryland. The group added that managed care organizations report that 10% of personal assistance staff hours and 27% of nursing hours are unfilled each month. 
Pennsylvania’s growing senior population is straining home care resources, especially in rural areas, as the Baby Boomer generation reaches retirement age. By 2030, rural Pennsylvanians aged 65 or older are expected to outnumber those under the age of 20.
“Raising rates isn’t an item on a wish list — it’s an absolute necessity for tens of thousands of vulnerable Pennsylvanians,” Haney continued. “This is both a moral and fiscal imperative. Every month of delay costs taxpayers millions and leaves more Pennsylvanians without care. The Commonwealth cannot keep balancing its budget on the backs of vulnerable families and underpaid caregivers.”
 A little more about the budget process

When Shapiro signed the state’s budget into law last month, Pennsylvania’s Office of the Budget was already months into the process for developing the next fiscal year’s funding plan. 
Instructions for state agencies submitting budget requests went out in August, amid the impasse. They directed each to submit “cost to carry budget requests,” or plans maintaining current levels of service. The 74-page document warns agencies that federal funds that are lost — or anticipated to be cut — should be incorporated into their requests.

 
However, “agencies should not request increased state resources to address these impacts in their agency submissions unless directed by the Office of the Budget.”
Agencies submitted their funding requests on Oct. 15. Program Revision Requests, which alter current programs outside of the submitted agency budgets, increase or decrease funding by more than 15% and have more than a $200,000 impact. 
Sometime this month, the governor’s office typically meets with the General Assembly for a mid-year briefing on budget issues and “to apprise them of anticipated spending and revenue levels and to discuss major fiscal issues.” 
The governor’s office then finalizes their budget proposal before a formal submission to the legislature in early February, kicking off negotiations before the June 30 budget deadline.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/NURSE-OLDER-MAN-.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 04:56:29.072388

Bessent announced the investigation via social media, replying to a post from right-wing propagandist Christopher Rufo, who recently published an article claiming that ill-gotten gains from Minnesota have wound up in the hands of al-Shabaab.
Bessent’s investigation would seem to be duplicative, however.
Over the past three years, federal prosecutors in Minnesota have charged 78 people in what they have called the largest pandemic relief fraud in the country, known as Feeding Our Future after a nonprofit that bilked a food aid program out of at least $250 million. They’ve charged others with Medicaid fraud.
They’ve yet to charge a single person with terrorism financing, however, even though the office has a previous history of charging Somalis for ties to al-Shabaab and ISIS.
Federal prosecutors have reported that fraudsters spent their proceeds on lavish purchases, including real estate abroad. But not in Somalia, which has no formal banking system.
The al-Shabaab claim is not new. Fox9 reported in 2018 that child care fraud was funding Al-Shabaab. In his recent article, Rufo even cited the same retired Seattle police detective as the Fox9 story from seven years ago. There were no federal charges leveled then either, and a report from the Office of Legislative Auditor could not substantiate the al-Shabaab connection.
If fraudsters sent money to Somalia via cash remittances to rural areas of the country controlled by al-Shabaab, it’s possible the group would have “taxed” the money and wound up with some of it.
But former U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said recently that the fraudsters were not motivated by ideology. They “were looking to get rich, not fund overseas terrorism,” he told the Star Tribune.
The Star Tribune reports that Gov. Tim Walz said last week that he welcomed an investigation.
“I think it’s the right thing to do,” Walz said. But he added, “I don’t know if they’ll find the connection.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/scottbessent-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 01:57:43.869888
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-02 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Overruled in CT small claims court,James Cornelio,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/02/overruled-in-ct-small-claims-court/,The CT small claims system is broken -- at least as I think most of us would like to think the system should function.,"On August 15 I took part in a remote trial in small claims court seeking to recover several thousand dollars of damages to the heating element in the water pipe serving my home. It was caused by the negligence of a local water and well repair company.
Early on, as I apparently failed to properly follow courtroom protocols, there was some tension between me and the magistrate. But it’s the reasoning for the decision in my case which has caused me to put pen to paper.  If it is in any way emblematic of how magistrates are approaching their duty in deciding the cases before them, then the system is broken, at least as I think most of us would like to think the system should function. 
But before I offer a thought or two about what I think may help to fix that brokenness, let me share some context.
I’m 70 years old and for the 25 years I lived in New York City. Before moving to New Preston in 2008, I was involved in two small-claims cases, one against an auto repair shop and the other against a landlord.  Upon moving to Connecticut, I brought two other claims: one against a furniture store and the other against a restaurant.  And though I only prevailed in three of the four cases, I thought the process in each was fair, and critically to the point of this piece, more concerned with dispensing justice than with rigidly adhering to legal formalities.
In this case however … well, here are a couple of hints of what was to come:
During a settlement conference before an arbitrator prior to the hearing, the attorney for the defendant acknowledged the damage but offered less than a pittance to settle.  As I rejected that, we then went before the magistrate.  There, when the issue of the damage was again raised, I responded that the attorney had already acknowledged the damage.  
Oops, whatever is said in the settlement is not admissible, I was told by the magistrate.  OK, fine, but I told him that I had the damaged element available and could present it to the court.  Oops, again.  No more evidence allowed as, after all, he had earlier stated that all evidence must be presented before the substantive arguments began.
Curious (to say the least) about this ruling, I subsequently queried Chat GPT and learned that even in venues where one might consider legal process to be more important than in small claims court, exceptions to a “no further evidence” rule may be granted for “good cause” or “to prevent a miscarriage of justice.”  But not here, I guess.
Chat GPT, though again after the fact, also challenged the magistrate’s decision to uphold the attorney’s multiple objections to questions I asked his witness because they required “speculation.”  AI will tell you, however, that when a witness is considered an “expert,” speculative questions are allowed.  And this witness, ironically, had been qualified by his own attorney as an expert.  But Perry-Mason-like, I guess I had to object to his objection.
Though other examples abound which might warn one that even in small claims court you better have your favorite AI bot by your side to navigate the legal thicket, how, in the end, did the magistrate rule?  Did he rule that I failed to show that the damage had occurred, or that the defendant had caused the damage, or that I had retained a professional to repair that damage at a cost of several thousand dollars, or that, in fact, the professional had performed the repair?
No.  The evidence which was admitted was just too overwhelming.
So then why did the magistrate rule against me?
Because even though I testified that, of course, I had paid the several month-old bill submitted by the professional I had hired to repair the damage, I hadn’t included in my papers a copy of the cancelled check to that professional.  In other words, though the magistrate didn’t question the defendant’s negligence and the cost to repair the consequent damage, he did question whether I pay my bills.  So, he denied me any relief.
Fortunately, there is a process for opening a judgment in small claims court.  I followed that process and included with it a copy of the cancelled check to the professional who had billed me.  Given the magistrate’s straightforward reason for denying my claim, I thought that with this incontrovertible proof that, as I had testified, I pay my bills, it was a slam dunk.
Unfortunately, though, guess who gets to incontrovertibly decide whether to open the judgment.
From his pen to mine in ruling against me: “The fact remains that the case is now complete and judgment has entered.”  In other words, even if I was wrong in not believing that you pay your bills and even if it cost you a bundle, you lose.
So, what might help in fixin this kind of result?
First, it should be a “slam dunk” that if a magistrate denies recovery because of a specified lack of evidence and if that evidence is then offered when a motion to reopen is submitted, then that motion should be granted regardless of any current legalistic excuses not to do so. Lacking that, the existing process to reopen judgments is not just seriously neutered, it seriously undermines one’s faith in the system. 
Second, to assure an implicit check on power and possible bias, the motion to reopen should be handed over to a set of eyes other than those of the original magistrate.
For the past several years, I feel, as I’m sure do many readers, that our institutions and the people with power over us are failing us.  I just never expected to feel it quite so personally, especially from one institution which I think all of us thought was for justice and fairness over process and empty formalism.

Brown and Dartigue announced last week that the collaborative has been dissolved. (Photo by Willam J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A historic partnership formed with the Maryland attorney general and public defender has come to an end.
Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) and Public Defender Natasha Dartigue announced in a letter dated Wednesday that the Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative has been dissolved, a little more than two years after its October 2023 launch.
The collaborative — which included working with about three dozen groups that included state agencies, law enforcement personnel and nonprofit and community organizations — has fulfilled its original charge to deliver recommendations on ending mass incarceration, the letter said.
“The structure that guided its work has now reached its natural conclusion. However, the mission and momentum it created are continuing through multiple, coordinated efforts designed to carry the recommendations into implementation,” Brown and Dartigue wrote in the letter.
“Although the MEJC has officially concluded, its core values and partnerships remain strong. The relationships, trust, and ideas built through this collaboration will continue to influence Maryland’s reform efforts,” they wrote.
The collaborative released a more than 100-page report in March with one main statistic: Blacks account for about 30% of the state’s population, but make up about 71% of the state’s prison population. The report also pushed for several criminal justice reform bills that eventually became law this year, such as the Second Look Act.
Maryland Public Defender’s office seeks more help

That legislation, sponsored by Baltimore County Democrats Sen. Charles Sydnor III and Del. Cheryl Pasteur, gives those incarcerated for at least 20 years the ability to petition for a sentence reduction, if they met several other criteria. It excludes sex offenders, people sentenced to life without chance of parole, individuals who were older than 25 when they committed their offense, or those convicted of killing a first responder.
The collaborative also backed medical and geriatric parole, which finally became law this year after being pushed by Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County) for at least four years. It requires parole hearings for those over age 60 who are incarcerated with severe medical conditions.
“Our focus was to really articulate the problem, identify solutions on best practices and make recommendations … to solve the problem of mass incarceration,” Brown said in an interview. “As we are going to this implementation phase, the collaborative isn’t really designed to drive implementation. That I believe is done better through existing structures, whether it’s advocacy groups that do their work in the community or in Annapolis.”
Future work
Some collaborative-backed bills failed this year, but at least one — to stop the state practice of automatically charging youth as adults — will be reintroduced in the 2026 General Assembly.
Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), the chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee, will reintroduce his bill, which didn’t advance beyond a Senate committee in 2025. His bill would raise the age at which a youth would be tried as an adult, from 14 to 16. It also would have made those 16 and younger eligible for juvenile court if charged with crimes that include first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving firearms.
Besides the collaborative, Smith’s proposal has also been endorsed by the Commission on Juvenile Justice Reform and Emerging and Best Practices, which noted in a report that Maryland youth spent 90 to 180 days in adult jails before being transferred back to juvenile court. Federal guidelines say youth must not be held in adult facilities for more than six hours “unless a court finds it is in the interest of justice based on a seven-factor test.”
Gordon Pack, who served on the collaborative’s prison, jail and detention facility reform work group, said Monday he’s disappointed to see the collaborative dissolved.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I didn’t anticipate that happening, at least not this soon. It allowed people to come together and present different viewpoints,” said Pack, who was released in 2022 after serving 42 years in prison on charges of rape, kidnapping and armed robbery when he was 15.
One particular measure Pack would like to see returned for the upcoming session is parole reform, specifically a measure sponsored by Del. Elizabeth Embry (D-Baltimore City).
Her bill would have required the Maryland Parole Commission to report on the number of cases it has heard and approved in a year, breaking it down by the race of those incarcerated, the number of cases granted or denied, and the number of those eligible for parole but never granted it. Those incarcerated have to currently ask for that information.
Embry said in a text message Monday she plans to bring the bill back. It passed the House this year but did not advance in the Senate.
“When we do something, we have to do things together. I will be talking with Del. Embry if she brings this bill back up, again,” Pack said. “We will try to achieve something that will really make a difference in Maryland.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PD-Natasha-Dartigue-and-AG-Anthony-Brown-6-4-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 07:57:19.474349

(File Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The Maryland Office of the Public Defender plans to continue pushing its mantra to pursue justice and equity to serve all people fairly — but says it needs help to do so.
Boosting the size of the office to keep pace with an increased workload will be am0ng the office’s main requests to legislators next year, along with trying again to end the practice of charging youths as adults and cutting down on random traffic stops by police.
The office’s workload increased from 85,000 cases in fiscal 2023 to more than 100,000 in fiscal 2025. Public Defender Natasha Dartigue said in an interview last week that the office needs another 550 attorneys and 240 administrative positions, which include secretaries and  paralegals. The office’s 2025 report states it has about 630 attorneys in 52 locations in all 23 counties and Baltimore City.
There’s no price tag for that request yet, but Dartigue put the salary for an entry-level attorney at $85,000, rising to the low $100,000 for an individual with several years of experience.
Acknowledging the state’s fiscal woes — latest estimates predict a nearly $1.5 billion deficit for fiscal 2027 — Dartigue said her request tries “to address our needs, even though that is not going to make us whole.”
“We have to invest in OPD [Office of the Public Defender] because either you’re going to pay it on the front end, or you’re going to pay it on the back end,” she said.
On that point, she noted recent Board of Public Works payments to people wrongfully convicted, like the August payment of $3 million to Baltimore resident James Langhorne, who spent 27 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit.
She also pointed to a 2023 National Public Defense Workload Study that said excessive attorney caseloads not only affect client representation, as “overloaded public defense attorneys simply cannot give appropriate time and attention to each client,” they can harm communities as well.
“A justice system burdened by triage risks unreliability, denying all people who rely on it – victims, witnesses, defendants, and their families and communities – efficient, equal, and accurate justice,” the report said.
Dartigue said her office is currently working on a new workload study. That report, being done in conjujction with the RAND Corp., will include an assessment of the number of cases and hours spent on juvenile cases. The study produced two years ago focused on adult cases.
In a Nov. 18 legislative briefing, Dartigue asked for the public’s help to “support budget requests.” She also highlighted two criminal justice reform proposals that failed last year, but which her office will push for again in 2026.
Traffic stops
Baltimore County Democrats Sen. Charles Sydnor III and Del. N. Scott Philips plan to bring back a bill to reclassify a number of primary traffic violations — for which police can pull a driver over — to secondary violations.
Their 2025 bills would have made secondary offenses out of driving without a mirror or with obstructed or damaged mirrors, excessive noise, and failure to illuminate a license plate, among others. Drivers could still be cited for those violations, but only after being pulled over for another primary violation.
Sydnor said last week that work continues on drafting a bill for the incoming session that may cut down on the number of targeted primary offenses.
The proposal aims to combat racial profiling, which Sydnor said is even more important now, after a preliminary U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in September that lifted a lower court’s ban on law enforcement officials using “apparent ethnicity” as one factor in determining reasonable suspicion, as long as it is not the only factor.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“You’ve given it a foundation where you give them the go-ahead to racially profile,” Sydnor said of the court’s ruling. “It’s … on us as state officials to protect our citizens from this stuff, and to make certain that our law enforcement is not acting in that manner.”
But Maryland Fraternal Order of Police President Clyde Boatwright said some of the targeted primary violations have “value” such as when a motorist leave a bar at 2 a.m. without the headlights on.
“That person could be pulled over and given a warning [and told], ‘Hey, cut your headlights on,’ or that could be a person that’s driving under the influence of some sort of substance,” said Boatwright, who’s running for Baltimore County sheriff in next year’s election.
‘We care’
Dartigue’s office also plans to again back Sen. William C. Smith Jr.’s (D-Montgomery) bill to ban the state’s practice of automatically charging youth as adults.
Smith, who talked about the legislation last month at a juvenile justice forum at Georgetown University, said eliminating the practice could save the state $17 million, which could be used for mental health treatment and other social services. Smith said at least 85% of cases that involve youth brought into adult court are dismissed or brought back to juvenile court.
Smith to push again for bill to ban automatically charging youth as adults for some crimes

His bill this year would have raised the age at which a youth would be tried as an adult, from 14 to 16. It also would have made those 16 and younger eligible for juvenile court if charged with crimes that include first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving firearms.
Boatwright said youth who commit serious crimes are having an “impact on the officers in the line of duty.” He pointed to the case of Baltimore County Police Officer Amy Caprio, 29, who was struck and killed in 2018 by a stolen vehicle driven by Dawnta Harris, then 16. Harris was eventually sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, and another 20 years for burglary. Three other teens in the vehicle, ages 15, 16 and 17, pleaded guilty to felony murder and were sentened to 30 years.
“Young people, particularly minors, involved in violent crime should be able to be held accountable, and the law already provides guardrails on who can be charged as an adult and who shouldn’t,” Boatwright said.
“We care about how experiences impact young people and shape their lives,” he said. “Allowing kids to be kids? Yes, we agree with that statement, to the extent that people are not being severely injured or killed.”
Dartigue reiterated a statistic that hasn’t changed: Maryland ranks second in the nation, behind Alabama, in the number of 14- to 17-year-olds automatically sent to adult court. The number in Maryland rose from 618 in fiscal 2024 to 798 in fiscal 2025.
About 81% of the children charged as adults are Black, compared to a 30% Black population in the state overall.
“We somehow forget that they are children,” Dartigue said. “We, as the adults and the system operators, also have to be accountable to our communities and one another.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Natasha-Dartigue-10-25-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 06:56:28.622882

“I have accepted responsibility and am accountable for my actions,” López said in a written statement Monday. “On the advice of counsel, I will not comment further on legal proceedings at this time. I appreciate the support I have received from family, friends, and colleagues.”
In January, a “Ralph Lopez” was charged in Washington, D.C., with driving under the influence and operating a vehicle while intoxicated. That individual was revealed to be López, Maryland’s secretary of Human Services.

A police report said a Metropolitan Police officer saw a car showing several potential signs of impaired driving, such as swerving between lanes multiple times and sitting at a green light, near the U.S. Capitol on the evening of Jan. 8. When the officer pulled López at North Capitol and E streets NW, he noticed López’s “red, watery eyes” and a “strong odor of alcoholic beverage.”
López told the officer he had had two drinks — later he said one drink — between 3 and 6:30 p.m. The traffic stop was a little before 7:30 p.m. López failed a field sobriety test, and a subsequend breath test recorded a breath-alcohol content of 0.097. The legal limit in the District is 0.08.
López was charged with driving under the influence and operating a vehicle while impaired. He initially pleaded not guilty when first arraigned. But on Monday, he pleaded guilty under a delayed sentencing agreement and agreed to perform community service.
According to the D.C. Superior Court, if a defendant pleads guilty under a delayed sentencing agreement and abides by whatever terms come with that plea, they can return after six months and “will be allowed to withdraw their guilty plea and the charges will be dismissed.” If they fail to abide by the terms, a harsher sentence would be applied.
In López’s case, sentencing was deferred for a year. He has another court appearance scheduled for Dec. 1, 2026.

The office’s traffic safety unit is now conducting a full accident reconstruction.
“The process is detailed and complex, particularly when injuries or fatalities occur, or when multiple vehicles, commercial vehicles, potential criminal charges, or unclear circumstances are involved,” the release said. “Investigators are actively interviewing drivers, passengers, and witnesses, and the analysis may take several weeks or longer to determine how and why the crash occurred.”
Reports from the county’s coroner’s office, such as an autopsy, could take up to six weeks.
People who witnessed the crashes are encouraged to reach out to Deputy Benjamin Sears at bsears@arapahoegov.com.
Winter, a Broomfield Democrat who served 11 years in the state Legislature, is survived by her son Tobin, 16, and daughter Sienna, 14. She was engaged to former state Rep. Matt Gray, also a Democrat.
Winter helped advance significant policy related to transit, environmental concerns and family leave.
There will be a memorial for Winter at the Colorado Capitol at 2 p.m. on Friday.

(Photo by C. Anderson/National Park Service)This article was reported and published in collaboration between the Chilkat Valley News and the Alaska Beacon.
Skagway’s former paramedic is alleging wrongdoing by the Southeast Alaska town, saying in a newly filed lawsuit that she was illegally fired after submitting a grievance against the city’s fire chief and deputy fire chief. 
In a lawsuit filed Nov. 20 at Juneau Superior Court, Samantha Philemon — the town’s lone licensed paramedic for much of her employment since 2023 — alleges she was fired due to disputes over recordkeeping and the department’s decision to purchase an all-terrain vehicle known as an Argo.
According to Philemon’s complaint, at the time of her firing, Skagway officials said she was being let go due to violations of HIPAA, the federal medical-privacy law. Philemon’s attorney says in the complaint that the accusation “was a sham.”
Philemon filed a formal complaint against the chief and deputy and was fired by Skagway’s deputy borough administrator the day after the complaint was resolved.
“We’re excited to have our day in court, so to speak, and we think that a jury who hears Sam’s story is going to do the right thing and understand what happened here, and we’re just looking for this to never happen again,” said her attorney, Miye D’Oench of the Anchorage-based Northern Justice Project.
Philemon said her firing has left Skagway, a town of roughly 1,100 year-round residents, without a trained paramedic.
“There are firefighters with EMT 1 and EMT 2 and some (EMT) 3 training, but there are no paramedics, and that harms the community because paramedics are trained and licensed to do things that EMTs are not,” she said.
Neither Fire Chief Emily Rauscher nor Borough Manager Emily Deach responded to requests for an interview that would allow them to respond to Philemon’s complaint.
The borough denied a public records request by the Chilkat Valley News. Robert Blasco, the city’s hired attorney, did not return messages left at his office on Friday and Monday.
Philemon moved from Mississippi to Skagway in 2023, she said, and enjoyed working with the department at first. 
“I wanted to be between the mountains and the ocean,” she said.
According to the complaint, she encouraged a friend to work for the department this past summer, but when he arrived, he was told his position had funding for only one week. Philemon believed that was because the department had recently purchased an Argo. 
When she raised the issue, according to the complaint, “Rauscher and Mead then turned on Ms. Philemon,” and “began silencing and excluding her from department business.” There were additional disputes about medical procedures performed by the fire department and accounting at the department..
Philemon submitted a formal grievance to the borough manager in July. The manager, Emily Deach, said in an August memo that Skagway “will take action to address the behavior and prevent reoccurrence” as well as take steps toward formalizing fire department training. 
“The actions of the department supervisors do not require termination of those supervisors, as 
you requested verbally,” Deach wrote to Philemon.
Philemon, who had been placed on administrative leave while the grievance was investigated, was ordered to return to work under a separate plan. She objected, concerned that she would be returning to work under the same supervisors and conditions as before, and appealed to a committee that included the Skagway Mayor. 
The committee upheld Deach’s work on Sept. 10. Philemon planned to return to work, but the deputy borough manager fired her the following day.
Philemon said she’s been looking for work since then but hasn’t found success.
“I’m looking for a new job after being fired from a job that I never wanted to leave. I’m devastated because I love my job, and I love Skagway,” Philemon said.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Although the country is more divided and democracy is more unstable than he’s seen in his lifetime, former President Barack Obama said young people give him hope for the future. 
Obama shared his thoughts Monday on democracy, civic engagement and understanding others during the inaugural conversation of Building Bridges, a new lecture series hosted by Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art focused on “meeting in the middle with curiosity, courage, and care,” according to a press release. 
After speaking with hundreds of Arkansas students about civic engagement, the former Democratic president spoke to around 700 people who packed into the Heartland Whole Health Institute’s ballroom on Crystal Bridges’ Bentonville campus.
Ahead of the nation’s 250th anniversary next year, museum board chair Olivia Walton, who moderated the lecture, asked about the American spirit. Obama described the country as an“eternally youthful” and “forward-looking nation” where each person can pursue their dreams and there’s a sense of working together to build the country up. 
“The last element, and I mentioned this to the young people that I was speaking to today, of the American spirit is each successive generation deciding we can remake this,” he said. “There’s a process of self-invention that is uniquely American.”

After noting his concern that the country is losing some of those elements, Obama rejected the notion that patriotism means you can’t criticize the country. 
“The reason I think patriotism got politicized is that both the left and the right sometimes got confused in thinking that it was not possible to take an honest look at America’s flaws and be critical of it and still love it and that’s a mistake,” he said. “It is a great expression of love for this country to say that we have not always been perfect, and the reason that we have kept getting better is because we had a bunch of people who said this isn’t as good as we can be, but the ideals were there.”
The first and only African American to hold the nation’s highest office, Obama served two terms after being elected the 44th president of the United States in 2008. Since leaving office, Obama said he didn’t expect to see the legitimacy of an election and the peaceful transfer of power challenged. He’s also been surprised by how the politicization of the Justice Department and the military has been encouraged.
“You don’t have your military involved in partisan politics,” he said. “Its loyalty is to the Constitution. Its loyalty is not to any party and it is not to any president.”
Democracy “absolutely” will survive, Hillary Clinton says in exchange at Crystal Bridges

Obama said it’s concerning to see how people have been willing to overlook the erosion of norms and values in part because of fear of being punished by the state.
“The reason I think that we have found ourselves in a position where we have folks in power who are not abiding as much as I would like with these norms and rules does have to do with underlying divisions in our society that had been building up for some time,” he said. 
There are several reasons for this, Obama said, including political rules, like gerrymandering, that encourage political polarization. Social media has compounded the issue by giving people with the most extreme views the most attention, he said. The country has also lost genuine communities where it’s possible to learn that people are complicated and have nuanced views on issues. 
“This undermines the part of American exceptionalism that I mentioned earlier about us being joiners and us just constantly interacting with people and being in public spaces and getting to know each other and telling each other stories so that we understood each other and gave each other the benefit of the doubt,” Obama said. “That’s what we’ve lost.”
This can’t be solved simply by fixing political rules or electing one party over another, he said. Civic habits underlying these issues need to be addressed. 
One step in that direction will be the opening of the Obama Presidential Center in the South Side of Chicago next year. The space will be a community hub with exhibits, a library and programming to help “train the next generation of leaders,” Obama said.
“The center, it is explicit about championing democracy,” he said. “All our programming, all our displays argue and insist that for all its flaws, it is the best system we got.”
Several Democratic state lawmakers who attended Monday’s lecture said they were inspired by the former president’s speech, including Rep. Tippi McCullough of Little Rock who said she felt “a sense of relief” that the country will get through hard times. Rep. Denise Ennett of Little Rock said she liked how Obama emphasized the importance of leading for everybody, not for one side. 
“I love that he reveres democracy in a time when nobody reveres it at all,” Ennett said. 
For his part, Obama said young people give him hope because of their energy, insights and their natural instincts toward including people and being interested in others even if they’re not exactly like them.  
“I am hopeful as long as young people don’t succumb to cynicism or despair because if they believe in their future, they will lift us all up,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-02 02:16:19+00:00,CT Mirror,AG to CT court: Some General Assembly records aren’t public,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/ct-foi-legislature-records-exempt/,"The AG's office argues that all records relating to the ""legitimate ... activities” of the CT legislature are exempt from public disclosure.","The office of Attorney General William Tong is asking a Connecticut court to rule for the first time in the 50-year history of the state Freedom of Information Act that all records relating to the “legitimate legislative activities” of the General Assembly are exempt from public disclosure.
The request was made in an administrative appeal filed Friday in Superior Court objecting to the Freedom of Information Commission’s rejection of an assertion by Tong’s office of a constitutional “legislative privilege” on behalf of the Office of Legislative Management.
“The Privilege is designed to ensure legislative independence from external interference by other persons, entities, or branches of government, and is a critical safeguard of the separation of powers,” the attorney general’s office states in the appeal.
Tong said in an interview that the existence of the legislative privilege is well-established, even if it has never been asserted in a case before the FOI Commission or tested in Superior Court.
“We are not breaking new ground,” Tong said. “This is a time-honored and established privilege.”
The FOI commission, as well as legislative leaders who say they were not consulted by Tong’s office about the appeal or its view of legislative privilege, expressed surprise at how a relatively narrow case was producing a legal showdown over the applicability of the FOI to legislators and staff.
At issue is the meaning of the 55-word “speech or debate” clause of the Connecticut Constitution. Like a similar provision in the U.S. Constitution, the clause creates a legislative privilege intended to protect legislators from arrest or other interference by the executive or judicial branches.
It says, “The senators and representatives shall, in all cases of civil process, be privileged from arrest, during any session of the general assembly, and for four days before the commencement and after the termination of any session thereof. And for any speech or debate in either house, they shall not be questioned in any other place.”
The U.S. Supreme Court has defined the core protection of the federal speech or debate clause as providing lawmakers immunity for statements made in legislative debate, plus “protection against civil as well as criminal actions, and against actions brought by private individuals” and “the Executive Branch.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, all said they never had used legislative privilege to withhold documents. None said they were consulted by Tong’s office.
“It’s a broad privilege to assert on behalf of all four caucuses without a conversation,” Candelora said. “On a bipartisan basis, I think the House has an understanding of the Freedom of Information Act as being something that brings transparency and disclosure requirements to public officials.”

Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said lawyers for his Senate Democratic majority caucus had been consulted, though they were deferring to Tong’s office on the question of whether to appeal. The legislature, he said, has a legitimate interest in preserving a measure of privacy.
“We have to have people be able to communicate with each other candidly,” Looney said.
The appeal arises from a complaint filed by John DiIorio, a principal in a defunct mortgage company, 1st Alliance Lending. With some success, he has been using the right-to-know law to explore the rationale behind state banking laws that he says were unfairly used by regulators against his company.
His latest complaint turned on the appropriateness of redactions made in 3,846 pages of emails and attachments. In October, the agency heard arguments from an FOI hearing officer who had reviewed the unredacted documents in private and a lawyer from Tong’s office.
Nicholas A. Smarra, the hearing officer, told the commission he concluded that some of the material was exempt from release as preliminary drafts or the product of attorney-client exchanges, but the rest should be public without redactions.
Assistant Attorney Timothy J. Holzman, representing the legislature, said all the redactions should remain under the privilege created by the speech or debate clause of the state Constitution — a claim never made previously to the commission on behalf of the General Assembly.
“We’re not claiming that everything that comes out of the legislature is covered by the privilege,” Holzman told the FOI Commission. “It’s only things within the legitimate sphere of legislative activity, not administrative stuff, not political stuff.”
Colleen Murphy, the executive director and general counsel of the commission, told commissioners that Holzman’s argument “would turn everything that we’ve done heretofore upside down.”
“I find it really disheartening that the legislature comes before us now and makes this type of claim after years and years of an understanding of in what way the Freedom of Information Act applies to legislators, individually, and the legislature as a whole,” Murphy said.
Holzman said the legislature had no right to make public documents protected by the speech or debate privilege, even if the legislature never asserted the privilege previously.
“It’s just not relevant,” Holzman said. “Even if that’s what they wanted, even if they said that with explicit language in FOIA, which they haven’t, it still wouldn’t matter. Because that would just be an example of a statute abrogating a constitutional protection.”
Holzman did not say why the privilege was being asserted now.
Stephen Fuzesi Jr., a former chief counsel of Newsweek appointed to the commission by Gov. Ned Lamont in 2019, pressed him, asking who made the call to assert the broad privilege. 
“It has been a fascinating intellectual argument. I’m just trying to figure out, is there some policy motivation behind it?” Fuzesi asked. “Who is the client?”
“My client here is an office of the General Assembly. It’s the Office of Legislative Management, but I work with others within the General Assembly who know about the case,” Holzman said. He did not name names.
In the appeal to the Superior Court, Holzman repeated what he told the commission: “FOIA does not permit the Commission to violate the Connecticut constitution, nor does FOIA waive or abrogate common law privileges and immunities.”
Smarra had argued successfully to the commission in October that Holzman was wrong on case law. The speech or debate clause has been broadly interpreted, but not in cases exempting documents from public-records laws.
“Nothing in the available jurisprudence suggests the ‘legislative privilege’ functions as a constitutional carve out from a public records statute such as the Connecticut FOI Act,’ he said in the recommended decision adopted by the FOI Commission.
Smarra also wrote the separation of powers argument — that the speech or debate clause is intended to prevent intimidation of lawmakers by the other branches of government — is misplaced.
“Specifically, the FOI Act cannot be used by the executive or judicial branches as a means of intimidation, as the Act affords rights solely to the public,” Smarra wrote.
There is a legislative management committee co-chaired by Looney and Ritter, the two top leaders of the Assembly. Ritter was uncertain if it should have been consulted by Tong’s office.
The committee has not met since Jan. 14, 2019.
While Ritter does not agree with the expansive view of legislative privilege asserted by Tong’s office, he said the questions raised about legislative privilege and “legitimate legislative activities” might be in the right venue.
“Maybe the court case is helpful to spell out when it should be applied,” Ritter said. “Maybe it will help provide better clarification of when it can be used.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CT-state-capitol-1024x855.jpg,,,2025-12-01 21:56:39.401377

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma City Public Schools Superintendent Jamie Polk will receive a multi-year contract extension and a $25,000 salary increase, but a district school board member suggested she deserved more.
The Oklahoma City Board of Education voted unanimously Monday evening to approve Polk’s new contract, which would keep her in charge of the district through the 2028-29 school year. Her yearly base salary will increase to $275,000, but further contract details weren’t immediately made available after the board meeting.
The board’s vote follows weeks of growing complaints that Polk hadn’t yet received a new contract with a pay raise. Tulsa Public Schools, the state’s largest district, four days ago boosted the base salary of its superintendent, Ebony Johnson, to $290,000 and extended her contract by three years.
The Oklahoma City district, the state’s second-largest by only a few thousand students, “could have done better tonight,” board member Mike Shelton said before voting in favor of Polk’s extension.
“Oklahoma City Public Schools can do better at making sure that we not only pay fairly, pay our superintendent for the work that’s done but also all our employees,” Shelton said during the meeting. “We could have done better at making sure that we secured our superintendent at better equal pay.”

Polk, a first-time superintendent, was hired in May 2024 at a $250,000 base salary and $343,198 in total compensation. Her contract at the time was set to end June 30, 2027. It included insurance benefits, a vehicle, a $10,000 technology and vehicle stipend, and the possibility of an annual performance bonus worth up to 10% of her salary.
Polk was the seventh-highest paid superintendent in the state last school year, according to Oklahoma State Department of Education records. Yukon Public Schools Superintendent Jason Simeroth, now retired, was the highest paid with $437,217 in total compensation, followed by Norman Public Schools Superintendent Nick Migliorino at $412,016.
Dozens attended the Oklahoma City school board’s Nov. 10 meeting as the Rev. Derrick A. Scobey spoke in public comment to question why negotiations for Polk’s new contract had “stalled.”
Scobey, a prominent community leader and the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, pointed to an open superintendent position in Des Moines Public Schools in Polk’s home state of Iowa. Des Moines’ superintendent, Ian Roberts, resigned in September after Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him.
“We’re in danger of losing our superintendent for her to go home because she has no contract in place,” Scobey said during the Nov. 10 meeting.

Polk declined to speak with news reporters after the board approved her new contract, but in a statement through her communications staff, she said she is “fully committed to the work ahead” in Oklahoma City schools.
“I am honored to continue serving as superintendent of Oklahoma City Public Schools,” Polk said in her statement. “This contract extension reflects our collective belief that stability, clarity and collaboration are essential to sustaining the progress our students deserve.”
The $25,000 salary increase will apply to the current fiscal year, and the contract extension through June 30, 2029, is the “maximum term allowed by law,” board Chairperson Paula Lewis said in a statement.
“We are pleased to have concluded these negotiations,” Lewis stated. “The board remains fully supportive of Dr. Polk and is deeply grateful for her steadfast leadership and service to our students, staff and community.”

The Winooski School District is calling for the rapid release of a second-grade student who was allegedly detained, with his mother, by federal immigration agents during the Thanksgiving break last week.
“They were traveling out of state, they made a wrong turn and were stopped and taken into ICE custody,” said Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria, who has since received information they are being held in a detention facility in Texas.
“We’ve had caregivers be detained and deported here in Winooski but we’ve never had one of our children be taken into custody by ICE,” he said Monday. 
The most diverse school district in an otherwise predominantly white state, Winooski was the first in Vermont to pass a sanctuary school policy earlier this year to protect students and families from the impact of federal immigration enforcement actions.
Chavarria, an outspoken advocate for families there, said, “We know that there have been cases where the mother and the child are separated intentionally — and this would be the worst-case scenario. So we’re trying to get help as quickly as we can.”
That’s difficult to do, however, given the shortage of legal assistance in Vermont at a time when the Trump administration has amplified efforts to detain and deport immigrants. And the system is so overwhelmed that it allows federal authorities to “simply get away with disappearing a family,” Chavarria said.

“My team has had a hard time trying to find legal aid for these people,” Chavarria said. 
Winooski has a rapid response system in place via which volunteers learned the mother and son were stopped and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week. They located them Monday at a detention facility in Texas, spoke briefly with the mother over the phone and provided $1,000 in emergency relocation support from a private fund to the child’s father, who remained at home in Winooski, according to Chavarria.
The 7-year-old boy who attends JFK Elementary was absent from school Monday morning. A teacher said she called his home to make sure he knew school was back in session after the holiday. That’s when she learned from the father that he has not been able to contact the boy and his mother since Thursday.
They were pulled over, likely in Illinois, while driving to Minneapolis during the holiday last week. “And he tells us that over the weekend he’s been just desperately trying to figure out where his wife and child are,” Chavarria said.
Will Lambek, an organizer with Migrant Justice, denounced the detention and commended the school district’s response to it. 
“Since the start of the Trump administration, ICE and Border Patrol’s attacks against our community have exploded, with detentions in the state increasing more than tenfold,” he wrote in an email, adding, “Winooski is a model for how institutions in Vermont can respond to these unconscionable attacks.”
The Spanish-speaking family born in Ecuador recently moved to Winooski from Minneapolis. Chavarria said many of the district’s newer families came to the city because of its safe, inclusive environment to find “some sort of refuge here.”
“We’re trying to be as helpful as we can and we don’t expect this to be the outcome,” he said, adding that the district has been cautioning families to be extra vigilant in the current climate. “We are in dangerous times and we cannot live our lives as we usually would.”
The school district declined to identify the family. ICE did not immediately respond to comment.
“Our 2nd grader should be in his classroom, not in a detention cell,” Chavarria wrote on social media.
Chavarria, a U.S. citizen, was himself detained and interrogated by federal authorities in Texas for more than five hours while traveling back to Vermont after visiting family in Nicaragua in July.
He posted a message on the district’s social media page Monday afternoon strongly condemning the incident, calling for the Winooski family’s immediate release and for the federal government to bring back “basic humanity and due process.”
“This is yet another example of the terror our families face simply by doing things other people take for granted — going to school, shopping for groceries, or just visiting family,” he wrote.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s top state budget official is urging a close look at cash balances in some school districts as the governor and lawmakers consider ideas for property tax relief during the legislative session that begins next month.
Jim Terwilliger is the commissioner of the Bureau of Finance and Management and a member of the School Finance Accountability Board. He said the board should not condone excess school cash balances at a time when homeowners are complaining about high property taxes.
“When you start seeing a $600,000 excess balance, it begs the question, what are you doing?” Terwilliger said during a Nov. 12 board meeting. 
Lower spending, higher sales tax, revenue shifts: A closer look at 19 ways to reduce property taxes

The topic arose when leaders from six public school districts appeared before the board. The districts were required to appear because their reserves during the 2025 fiscal year exceeded limits in state law.
Reserves are calculated by dividing each district’s lowest monthly cash balance by its total general fund spending. The maximum allowable reserves are 40% for schools with enrollment of 200 or less, 30% for those with enrollment between 200 and 600, and 25% for those with enrollment of 600 or more.
When districts exceed the limits, the state board can recommend a full or partial waiver, a financial penalty or a financial review of the district by the state Department of Education. The recommendations go to the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee.
Earlier this month, Terwilliger asked the accountability board to take its duty seriously.
“I don’t want this board to be looked at as more of a rubber stamp of waivers,” he said.
The board ultimately recommended denial of one waiver and a financial review of that district, while recommending three full waivers and another two partial waivers with financial penalties.
The legislative committee on Monday approved the denied waiver and financial review; approved two of the full waivers; suggested making one of the full waivers contingent on a financial review; and suggested waiving the two financial penalties. The committee’s proposed changes now go back to the board.
School funding, property taxes discussed
Under the state’s school funding formula, each district’s funding need is calculated based on factors including enrollment, target teacher pay, benefits and overhead. Local funding sources known as the “local effort,” including property taxes, are applied toward that need first, and state funding (which comes primarily from the state sales tax) fills any remaining gap.
If a district’s local effort fulfills its need, the district receives no general state aid. That situation applied to four of the six districts that exceeded their allowable cash balances during the 2025 fiscal year: Agar-Blunt-Onida, Hoven, Hill City and Lead-Deadwood.
School superintendents urge lawmakers to tread carefully with property tax reform

It’s reasonable, Terwilliger said earlier this month, to ask whether property taxpayers in those four districts are overburdened.
Local effort during the 2025 fiscal year exceeded the calculated need by about $1.1 million in Agar-Blunt-Onida, about $588,000 in Hill City,  about $676,000 in Hoven, and about $4.3 million in Lead-Deadwood.
Because those school districts don’t receive state aid, the board was not able to financially penalize them. 
Rep. Liz May, R-Kyle, worried at Monday’s meeting that a lack of financial penalties for those school districts will mean they won’t be held accountable.
“That doesn’t help the people back home that are paying the taxes,” May said.
Along with May, other lawmakers echoed Terwilliger’s concern at the Monday meeting, asking about factors affecting property taxes, including school spending and saving.
Financial reviews for Hoven, Agar-Blunt-Onida
Officials from Agar-Blunt-Onida told the board last month that a decision to close Blunt Elementary at the end of the 2023-24 school year reduced expenses and drove up cash balances, while an increase in rural electric generation tax revenue also pushed cash balances higher than expected. The additional cash will help launch expanded career and technical education and possibly junior kindergarten or preschool in the coming years, and district officials said they’re prepared to lower the general fund property tax levy if revenue remains strong.
The School Finance Accountability Board recommended a full waiver for Agar-Blunt-Onida. The Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee rejected the recommendation, suggesting the board recommend a financial review of the school district.
Lawmakers suggested the review partly because the school district has appeared before the accountability board four times in five years.

A financial accountability review allows the state Department of Education to monitor the district more closely, Director of Finance and Management Cody Stoeser told lawmakers on Monday. The district and department create an in-depth correction plan to spend the excess funds and meet the state requirements. If school districts don’t comply, then they risk losing their accreditation, which can impact federal funding or sports programming. 
“We can’t go ahead and tell them how to spend their money,” Stoeser said. “We just go in there and make sure they’re going to comply with the requirement.”
The board will meet within 30 days to consider the legislative committee’s action.
Lawmakers approved the state board’s denial of the Hoven School District’s waiver request and the board’s recommendation that the state Education Department complete a financial review of the district. Hoven has appeared before the board four times in five years as well.
Officials from Hoven said their higher cash balance reflected the realities of operating a small district that does not receive general state aid. They said the district needs a larger reserve to weather swings in property valuations and enrollment, because it lacks a state backstop if revenues fall short. 
Waivers approved
Hill City officials said they became newly eligible for a federal grant and received two years’ worth of funding in a single fiscal year.
Lead-Deadwood officials said they had an unfilled teaching position during the school year that resulted in less expenses and higher cash balances. They also said their food service fund is not self-sufficient, so they supplement it with general funds, and they will adjust the timing of that transfer to the beginning of the year rather than the end to better manage cash balances. Additionally, monthly state funding for the Box Elder Job Corps influenced cash balances, even though the district merely acts as a pass-through for the funding. 
The state board recommended a full waiver for Hill City and Lead-Deadwood, which the legislative committee approved.
Lawmakers disagree with financial penalties
The two districts that exceeded allowable cash balances while receiving general state aid were Frederick Area and Miller.
Leaders from Frederick Area said their overage was a timing issue caused by delayed startup costs for an agricultural career and technical education program and higher-than-expected interest earnings. 
The accountability board recommended a partial waiver for Frederick Area and a fiscal penalty of 10% of the excess amount, which would result in a reduction of $9,265 in general state aid for the 2026 fiscal year.

Miller officials said their overage was tied to their recovery from a fire, infrastructure upgrades, staffing vacancies and revenue sources that were difficult to forecast. They said insurance proceeds and more efficient equipment lowered utility and maintenance costs, which in turn reduced expenses and pushed cash balances higher.
The accountability board recommended a partial waiver for Miller and a fiscal penalty of 10% of the excess amount, which would result in a reduction of $7,474 in general state aid for the 2026 fiscal year. 
Lawmakers voted to reject the penalties for both districts, in part because this year was their first appearance before the board in the last five years. The actions go back to the board, which will have 30 days to consider them.
School Finance Accountability Board Chairman Eric Stroeder told lawmakers that board members made the 10% penalty recommendations because they “want the board to mean something.”
“At some point,” Stroeder said, “it has to be done just to enforce the law.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/591A1601e-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 20:58:29.149916

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)An outside review of Charlie Kirk’s assassination at Utah Valley University and the school’s security protocols is expected to begin in January and conclude before summer 2026.  
The Orem university laid out the timeline in a request for proposals posted last month on its procurement website for contract vendors. UVU had announced in September that it was “initiating a comprehensive independent review with an external organization” but didn’t give a timeline or disclose the name of any firm. 
UVU starts independent security review after the assassination of Charlie Kirk

A spokesperson did not immediately provide answers to questions from Utah News Dispatch Monday. The college of more than 46,000 students in Orem — the state’s largest — is accepting bids from would-be reviewers until Wednesday. 
The development comes as the shooting of Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, has also drawn new focus to security protocols and police resources on college campuses across the state. 
While the university’s request for bids doesn’t explicitly mention Kirk or reference a shooting, it says the purpose of the probe is to analyze what happened before and after an incident on Sept. 10, “including contributing factors.” Evaluators will also scrutinize the university’s “security and emergency preparation and response actions and protocols” and make recommendations for improvement, according to the 22-page call for proposals.
Kirk was shot from a roof on campus while answering a student’s question in a courtyard, killing him. Security experts have said UVU seemed to miss important security steps such as monitoring rooftops and criticized the school for not staffing the event with more police officers. 
UVU Police Chief Jeffrey Long said just after the shooting that six officers worked the event, in addition to Kirk’s private security team of eight. 
The university announced last month it was in the process of hiring eight new campus police officers and two new safety managers to its existing force of 23 officers.

The coming review is set to begin in the first week of January and end sometime in late spring 2026, and will include a report prepared for the public. Evaluators are expected to conduct interviews with university leaders, law enforcement, emergency management workers, employees and students, the document says. 
They’re also tasked with looking over video, emergency plans, training records, incident logs and other relevant records that will help them piece together a timeline “and identify key decision points.”   
Also under the microscope is the university’s coordination with outside agencies like local law enforcement and emergency services. The Utah County Sheriff’s Office has said it was not involved that day until the shooting happened.  
Reflecting on campus safety throughout the state, Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters last week that “we want to make sure we have the funding necessary to keep our kids safe on campus.”
Asked whether he’d push for the state to free up funds for public universities to expand police forces, Cox replied, “We’re having that conversation with the department of public safety and all of our colleges and universities. We want our students to be safe. I’ve got kids on college campuses right now. It’s important to all of us.”
He noted UVU is the state’s largest university in terms of student enrollment, but said its campus is more compact than most, saying that’s a factor in the size of its police force. 
A newly formed state task force on higher education and public safety includes officials from Utah universities, law enforcement agencies and private businesses. 
Its members are set to convene for their first meeting on Dec. 8, Katie Mazzie with the Utah System of Higher Education told lawmakers on a school safety panel at the Capitol Monday. 
The task force plans to start by evaluating policies across Utah’s public colleges, Mazzie said, with the eventual goal of standardizing practices to make campuses safer.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — In 2024, Aberdeen’s DemKota beef processing plant bought cattle from 400 producers. 
This year, they bought from 300.
“That wasn’t because we chose to,” CEO Adam Bode told the Sioux Falls Downtown Rotary Club on Monday. 
It’s because the producers aren’t there any longer. Raising or feeding cattle is “a great business and an even better lifestyle,” said Bode, but it’s one fewer and fewer people — particularly young people — can afford to get into. He said the average age of a South Dakota cattle producer is 63.
In South Dakota, the Governor’s Office of Economic Development facilitates loans to beginning farmers and ranchers, but only for a handful of people each year. Since 2019, the office’s board approved a total of $4.6 million in bonds for 13 applicants statewide, an average of about $354,000 per award.
Bode sees plenty of opportunity in cattle, but others need to see the same.
“To the bankers in the room: Loan that money to that young producer,” Bode said. “It is a high capital business to get started. That’s the biggest hurdle to get new players in it, and we desperately need them.”
Volatility embedded in business
Dave Geraets, who has 2,500 head of cattle and grows row crops outside of Colton, said the cattle side of the business is wildly volatile. Diversified operations can help producers weather price fluctuations — particularly when corn prices are high, Geraets said — but adding cropland only makes it harder to start from scratch.
“No matter if it’s land or cattle, all of it is expensive,” said Geraets, who hopes to see his kids stay involved in the business.
American ranchers hit with ‘gut punch’ as Trump follows through on Argentina beef import pledge

This year, the wild price swings for cattle have been historic. A low inventory pushed prices to an all-time high in August. 
The prices didn’t last. Citing a desire to lower beef prices for consumers, President Donald Trump announced his intention to push for the importation of more beef from Argentina this fall by increasing the number of tariff-free metric tons each year from 20,000 to 80,000.
“We retracted that market by 25% in two weeks,” said Ryan Eichler, founder and board president for the South Dakota Cattlemen’s Foundation. “Imagine the stock market retracting 25% in two weeks.”
Craig Bieber, vice president of the South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association, told South Dakota Searchlight last month that the Argentina move was “a gut punch.” U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, met with the Trump team last month to discuss the concerns of ranchers. 
Trump would later ask his departments of Justice and Agriculture to launch an investigation into “hyperconsolidation” of the beef packing industry. The investigation would look into the “big four” packers – JBS, Cargill, Tyson and National Beef – “for potential collusion, price fixing and price manipulation.”
Capital access hinders smaller operations
Bode, the DemKota CEO, said his company slaughters about 300,000 cattle a year, and tries to stand out by processing higher-end cuts of meat. When asked by Rotarian and former Gov. Dennis Daugaard what it would take to process more, Bode said capital investment.
Much like a young farmer, he said, the price of entry for a processor is high enough to make financing difficult. 
South Dakota program offers aspiring farmers a rare path into agriculture

“We have an internal joke in our industry: If you ever want to make a couple million bucks in beef processing, just start with a couple billion,” Bode said.
The large beef packers aren’t immune to volatility, either, Bode told South Dakota Searchlight after the discussion. The same low inventory that pushed prices to record levels has made it harder for the Big Four packers to keep their processing plants up and running. 
Last month, Tyson announced the closure of its Lexington, Nebraska plant, which has the capacity to process 5,000 cattle a day but had recently been processing around 3,600 a day.
The closure won’t have an impact on DemKota, which is a smaller-scale operator, Bode said.
But it does show that the bigger players are having the same problem he is: too few producers raising too few cattle to meet high demand.
“There still aren’t enough animals,” he said. “Even with that giant plant, there’ll be another plant closure. It’s the first of several, really, in our opinion.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PXL_20251201_185032594-scaled-e1764635853520-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 19:57:54.045325

A North Carolina political race that has been brewing for years became official Monday, with Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page filing to run against Senate Leader Phil Berger in the Republican primary in the district that includes Rockingham and part of Guilford. 
Candidate filing started Monday. When it ends at noon on Dec. 19, it’ll be clear where primary elections will be and who will glide into office unopposed next year. 
The conflict between Berger and Page burst into public view with Berger’s support in 2023 for expanding casino gambling in the state — and building one in Rockingham County. Berger has since called that proposal dead, but that hasn’t dulled the sharp accusations the two campaigns have traded this year. 
Berger was elected to the state Senate in 2000. He is in his eighth term as Senate leader — formally Senate president pro tem  — and is one of the most powerful politicians in the state. No other candidates had filed to run in Senate District 26 by Monday afternoon.
A Democratic primary that produced one of the closest results in the state in 2024 is headed for a rematch. Longtime former Rep. Michael Wray is challenging the current occupant of the NC House District 27 seat, freshman Rep. Rodney Pierce. In 2024, Pierce defeated Wray in the district that includes Halifax, Warren, and Northampton counties by 34 votes, or less than a percentage point. Pierce went on to run unopposed in the general election.

Cook was appointed to the seat a few weeks ago to replace former House member Cecil Brockman. Brockman resigned after being charged with sex crimes involving a minor, charges he has denied..

 Who will run in the new 1st Congressional District? Davis, Hanig are in

Republicans are aiming to turn the northwest 1st U.S. House District red in 2026, thanks to a new congressional map approved by the legislature and upheld by a federal court. 
Which Republican will vie for that seat? That remains to be seen.
Its current occupant, Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis, said Monday he would run in the redrawn district despite new boundaries that strongly favor a Republican. Davis no longer lives in the district — he was drawn out of it by Republican map-makers and now resides in the neighboring 3rd district. But members of Congress are not required to live in a district to represent it.
“Many feel Washington, D.C. isn’t serving their needs, and the redistricting battle clearly proves it,” Davis wrote on social media Monday.
On the other side of the aisle, a contested primary is likely. Just one candidate has filed for the seat as of Monday: state Sen. Bobby Hanig, a Republican who has emerged as a rare dissenting GOP voice in the Senate on issues like a ban on shrimp trawling.
“I’ve always been very vocal when it comes to people coming after folks in my district,” Hanig told reporters. “People bring me to Raleigh to defend them and make sure that we’re taking care of them.”
Will President Donald Trump weigh in on the GOP primary? “We’ll see,” said U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, who heads the national campaign arm to elect House Republicans. 
“We’ll stay in contact as candidates emerge in the 1st district, and we’ll see,” he said. “He may decide not to endorse, he may endorse.”
Hudson has also drawn an early official opponent — Democrat Nigel Bristow, who serves as chief probation and patrol officer in Anson County, filed for the 9th district on Monday. He ran against Hudson and lost in 2024.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/berger-page.jpg,,,2025-12-01 19:57:54.045325

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill announced Monday that running mate and Lt. Gov.-elect Dale Caldwell will serve as secretary of state when the two take office next month.
Sherrill, a Democrat, told reporters that Caldwell had been vying for the job since their first meeting during her campaign to become governor. The two appeared Monday at Delia’s, a restaurant in Caldwell’s hometown of New Brunswick.
“He served in state government before and knew that, given his background, as he sometimes says, in bringing together small actors in the community, small businesses, small churches, small nonprofits, that he really felt there was an opportunity in the state department,” Sherrill said.
Caldwell is the first person to be named to Sherrill’s cabinet.
In New Jersey, the lieutenant governor also serves as the head of a department, and two of Caldwell’s lieutenant governor predecessors have also served as secretary of state. Caldwell will be New Jersey’s fourth lieutenant governor when he takes office Jan. 20.
The secretary of state oversees state government offices supporting New Jersey’s arts, history, and business communities, in addition to overseeing state elections.
Caldwell said he would enhance transparency in elections by ordering votes counted faster, addressing intimidation at polling sites, and allowing people to quickly challenge contested votes in front of judges. 
Caldwell previously served as a deputy commissioner at the Department of Community Affairs. Most recently, he was president of Centenary University in Hackettstown and also served on the New Brunswick school board for over 25 years.
On the campaign trail and on Monday, he invoked his father, the late Rev. Gilbert Caldwell, who marched with Martin Luther King Jr.
“This is a time when we have an assault from an administration on trying to do everything they can, and so often unconstitutionally, to really interrupt our election process,” Caldwell said.
He joined the Sherrill campaign in July and now also co-chairs her transition team. 
Sherrill said Caldwell will work on improving business development and tourism in New Jersey. He’ll cut “red tape” for the state’s businesses and ensure New Jersey is prepared for the World Cup in 2026, he added.
“You are going to see some really interesting things happening in the Department of State, from a community-up level, so it’s kind of exciting,” Caldwell said.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (2024 file photo)Some Georgia lawmakers want to use state resources to keep drones from dropping off contraband like drugs and cell phones at detention facilities.
Matthew Wolfe, director of the Office of Professional Standards within the Georgia Department of Corrections, said a months-long investigation that led to the arrest of 150 suspects drove down drone activity last year, with only 15 drone incidents reported last December, but Wolfe told the House Appropriations Committee on Public Safety Monday that incidents have increased steadily this year, reaching 63 in November.
Despite the illegality, flying contraband into detention facilities can be a lucrative business, said Georgia Department of Corrections Commissioner Tyrone Oliver, and inmates are often willing to clamber up pipes to access the roof to retrieve the illicit packages.
“Some of it is dropping on the yard. The majority of them are dropping on the ceiling,” he said. “So what you have, when you’re talking about our aging infrastructure, most of the prisons that were built, they have internal pipe chases inside the dorm, inside the dormitory themselves. The inmates are able to get inside the pipe chase, access the roof, which is the metal roof, push it up, get the contraband, come back in.”
When prison officials spot a drone, the first thing they do is call local law enforcement, Wolfe said.
“That local law enforcement starts patrolling looking for a vehicle or suspicious people in the area. My canine team is also dispatched to the location in case there’s something in the woods that needs to be tracked. That’s the normal protocol.”
But the protocol does not include knocking drones out of the sky, whether by shooting it or jamming its communications. Oliver said that’s because Washington has tied their hands.
“When we talk about mitigation, especially when it comes to drones, federal law prohibits us from interfering with that unmanned aircraft,” he said. “So, even if it’s flying to where I can reach it, ceiling high, I can’t touch it.”
“I might as well just go ahead and go to Hartsfield Jackson and interfere with a Delta jet going across the sky, it’s the same penalties,” he added.
Cochran Republican state Rep. Danny Mathis was incredulous.
“You’re telling me that you don’t have the legal authority if you have a restricted area like a prison, and that drone flies in that restricted area, you don’t have the authority to stop it?”
“That’s correct,” Oliver said.
“That needs to be changed,” Mathis said. “That just makes no sense.”
Oliver said he has been lobbying the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Communications Commission and members of Congress for change at the federal level and expressed optimism that a resolution could be coming soon.
The state Legislature can’t overrule federal laws, but Mathis suggested the state government could pitch in dollars to help counties offset spending on prosecuting drone-related crimes.
“Some of them are very poor counties and they can’t afford to do this,” he said. “So the state has got to step up, in my opinion, to help these counties offset some of this.”
Hartwell Republican state Rep. Alan Powell suggested skipping the middleman in the state’s lobbying efforts and petitioning President Donald Trump directly.
“Water runs downhill and it runs from the White House,” Powell said. “We have a system of government that’s being run off of executive orders today, which is scary to me at the least. But it seems to me like probably the best thing the legislators can do in the various states would be to send the president an appeal to let him deal with the federal aviation and things like that and move forward.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/DSC0329-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 19:57:54.045325

“People are literally going to go hungry,” said Amelia Vath, an advisor to Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark, adding that her team believes “we are very likely to win this case.”

Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined a multistate lawsuit against the Trump administration last week over an Oct. 31 federal memo that mandated new food assistance restrictions for noncitizens. 
The move came after Clark signed a joint letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture last month, criticizing both the new rules and the department’s manner of delivering them. 
The lawsuit alleges that the mandates incorrectly deny a number of groups, including some refugees and other humanitarian entrants, access to the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Not only did certain changes contradict federal law, Clark and her colleagues argued in the suit, but language in the memo created confusion, and set unreasonable deadlines for implementation.
While the bulk of recent cuts to 3SquaresVT, Vermont’s version of SNAP, will remain unchallenged, the lawsuit could see benefits return to dozens of noncitizen households across the state.
On Monday, Vermont cut off or reduced food aid to a new group of roughly 22 noncitizen households — per an estimate from the Department for Children and Families — in order to comply with the federal guidance in question. Refugees and asylees, who previously qualified for the program if they held green cards, are now subject to a five-year waiting period, which Clark and her colleagues dispute.
In the raft of changes that Vermont had previously made to the program this year, a group of largely Afghan immigrants who assisted the U.S. military in their home country also lost eligibility. Last week’s suit challenges that restriction as well, which the October memo appeared to confirm. 
The lawsuit, joined by Clark and officials in 20 states and the District of Columbia, seeks a preliminary injunction from a federal judge in Oregon that would allow states to quickly reinstate lost benefits where appropriate. The case is scheduled for oral arguments on Dec. 15.
“People are literally going to go hungry,” said Amelia Vath, an advisor to Clark, in an emailed statement Monday, adding that her team believes “we are very likely to win this case.” 
Vermont’s Attorney General has said in recent weeks that while she disagrees with parts of the USDA’s guidance, leaders in Gov. Phil Scott’s administration have done what they feel they must in implementing new rules.
“The Trump Administration is failing the most vulnerable people, leaving states in the impossible position of trying to comply with confusing and incredibly poorly timed guidance, all while fearful of massive penalties that could be held against us for errors,” Clark said in a release last week.
July’s federal budget law outlined significant consequences for states that carried out the new food assistance changes incorrectly. Officials have projected that a small increase in Vermont’s “error rate” could incur a loss of nearly $8 million in federal funds.
Tracy Dolan, director of the state’s Refugee Office, said she could not comment on Clark’s suit, but said more generally in an emailed statement that “any changes in federal policy that would provide SNAP to non-citizens who were previously eligible would be welcome.” 
“Even with full time work, some refugee families like other Vermonters are finding it hard to make ends meet due to high food costs, high housing costs and low wages,” Dolan said.

Christine Chandler.","New Mexico lawmakers speak Monday, Dec. 1, 2025, at Central New Mexico Community College about state-level artificial intelligence regulation. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)A handful of New Mexico lawmakers described their plans for the upcoming legislative session during a summit Monday focused on artificial intelligence, which states increasingly find themselves trying to regulate amid a permissive federal environment. 
New Mexico Reps. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos) and Linda Serrato (D-Santa Fe) moderated a panel conversation in Albuquerque, featuring a national expert with the National Conference of State Legislatures and a state lawmaker from Virginia. 
They all described a difficult and changing landscape for states that seek to, for example, crack down on discriminatory algorithms; prevent chatbots from sparking inappropriate relationships with children; or require artificial intelligence companies or their clients to disclose more with the public about their use of the technology. 
New Mexico’s AI future

The Virginia lawmaker, Michelle Lopes Maldonado, said her efforts at “comprehensive” AI reform at her statehouse failed due to there being “just too much gap between comfort levels, understanding, etc, to be able to move forward with more.” 
One challenge she and other state lawmakers have faced is in defining “artificial intelligence” in legislation, she said. 
“I don’t believe that any of the states have a definition for AI. There really isn’t one quite sufficient yet, because the technology is growing so rapidly,” she said. 
In the meantime, she recommended New Mexico lawmakers use a definition for “AI system” that the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international organization of 38 developed economies, has developed. 
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 38 states adopted 100 pieces of AI-related legislation in 2025. But Chelsea Canada, who advises states on AI regulations for the organization, said Monday that few states have adopted comprehensive legislation that tackles consumer protection or data privacy concerns. And, in some cases, governors have vetoed those bills, she said.  
As AI takes the helm of decision making, signs of perpetuating historic biases emerge

Instead of more ambitious proposals, states have increasingly focused more on “narrow” protections, like the 10 states that adopted AI regulations governing the healthcare industry in 2025, Canada said. 
Chandler told Source New Mexico after the panel that she intends to reintroduce a pared-down version of House Bill 60 during the upcoming legislative session. That bill, which died in the House, contained 15 different sections aimed at “developers and deployers” of AI, including transparency and anti-discrimination requirements. 
“That was a big algorithm bill, and the forces were out and about to try to squash that,” she said, adding later that she was referring to “Big Tech.” During the next legislative session she said she intends to focus more narrowly on transparency measures, including ensuring users know when they’re communicating with AI chatbots.
“At a minimum, people need to be reminded that they’re interacting — especially young people — with a machine and not a human,” she said. 
Looming over any state-level AI regulation is the possibility that the federal government will ban states from imposing rules on companies or their clients. President Donald Trump recently drafted an executive order that would punish states that enact their own AI regulations. 
“I’ve been told that [AI companies] are continuing to push” Trump to prohibit states from regulating AI, Chandler said. “And the President is very amenable.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3221-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 18:58:51.562637

During the holiday weekend, the Montana Department of Health and Human Services announced plans to construct a new behavioral health facility near Laurel. 
During the 2025 legislative session, a long-range planning bill set aside $26.5 million for the 32-bed forensic mental health facility. 
“We are grateful to the City of Laurel and its leaders for their interest in partnering with the state on a new behavioral health facility,” DPHHS Director Charlie Brereton said in a statement. “Laurel provides access to a critical health care workforce and infrastructure necessary to ensure the facility’s success. Furthermore, Laurel’s geographic location is ideally situated for improving transportation logistics for patients and their families, staff, and law enforcement across central and eastern Montana.”
The location announcement came after a brief pause by the Board of Investments, which will oversee construction of the facility, as the Board sought guidance on the location and services desired for the facility. The Board of Investments will own the facility as a state investment, with plans to lease it to DPHHS. 
In the announcement, DPHHS said that Laurel was selected because it “provides access to a critical health care workforce and infrastructure necessary to ensure the facility’s success,” and the geographic location helps with transportation logistics for patients and their families, staff and law enforcement across the eastern portion of the state. 
“As many Montanans know, DPHHS has experienced surging demand for forensic psychiatric services over the past several years, resulting in a problematic statewide waitlist that adversely impacts local communities,” Brereton said in a letter announcing the site selection on Nov. 26. “While DPHHS has taken a variety of steps to try to address this issue operationally, its bed capacity remains severely limited, and the agency believes that the funds granted to us by the Legislature must be prioritized for the forensic population.” 
Despite the announcement by the state, there is no actual location determined for the new facility. 
The city of Laurel didn’t even submit an application for consideration. 
In a Nov. 17 letter sent by Laurel city officials, they said the city did not apply as a potential location because the suitable land they felt could accommodate the behavioral health facility isn’t located in city limits. 
Laurel Chief Administrative Officer Kurt Markegard wrote that along with Mayor David Waggoner, he had described to the Board of Investments a location just outside city limits that would “make building the facility remarkably successful.”
Markegard said city laws require land to be annexed before receiving city services and while that had prohibited the city council from applying as a potential location, the process for annexation could begin if the state chose the Laurel area as a final location. 
Laurel city officials did not respond to questions about the exact location they had proposed for the facility. 
Board of Investments executive director Dan Villa said in an email to the Daily Montanan that the search for a site is ongoing, but that a location near Laurel, but outside of city limits, would lead to a request for annexation by the city. 
While the legislature authorized funds through the BOI for the new facility it is unlikely the $26.5 million will be enough to construct a facility that meets the needs outlined by DPHHS. 
“It is anticipated that these funds may be insufficient to construct a “hardened” facility designed to safely and securely serve a forensic population,” Brereton wrote. 
Brereton added that the department is prepared to allocate additional funding from its Behavioral Health Systems for Future Generations special revenue account, which currently has nearly $42 million, to cover additional costs outside of the legislatively authorized funding. 
According to the state’s website for the project, Custer County and Big Horn County also submitted proposals to locate the new facility near Miles City and Hardin, respectively.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG-4965-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 18:58:51.562637

(Photo by Nadia Engenheiro, Half Street Group) Two Rhode Island nonprofits joined a federal lawsuit filed Monday by a coalition of municipal governments and nonprofit organizations challenging the Trump administration’s push to overhaul a key federal homelessness and housing grant program.
The 85-page lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) from slashing the amount of grant funds that can be spent on permanent housing, or subsidized units that provide a stable residence for formerly homeless people, often those who have experienced mental illness or spent years on the streets. 
Lead plaintiffs include the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, along with Providence-based nonprofits Crossroads Rhode Island and Youth Pride Inc. — among other groups and cities across the country.
The plaintiffs are challenging changes to HUD’s Continuum of Care grant program announced Nov. 13 that shift over two-thirds of the $3.9 billion program toward transitional housing and other short-term interventions for people without shelter. The lawsuit claims the new policy is contrary to “well-established and proven strategies that reduce homelessness” and jeopardize the housing of more than 170,000 people across the nation. 
The so-called “housing first” model prioritizes stable housing before offering case management, mental health treatment, substance use services, and supported employment services. Research has shown this approach leads to more long-term housing stability than programs that require residents to consent to treatment and abstain from using substances before receiving housing.
HUD’s new policy was announced a little over a month before the Dec. 12 deadline set for Rhode Island’s care operators to apply for the federal dollars, the lawsuit notes.
In federal fiscal year 2024, Crossroads Rhode Island, the largest homeless service provider in the state received four Continuum of Care grants totaling over $2.1 million — much of which goes toward subsidizing residents’ rents across the 375 permanent supportive housing units it operates across the state. 
The loss of federally-funded subsidies could mean the residents Crossroads serves would be responsible for paying 100% of the rental cost.
Crossroads claims that following the new federal rules would jeopardize the organization’s professional ethical standards and increase the potential that it could “face enormous risks of litigation and government inquiry.”
“Our goal is simple: to protect the programs that keep families and vulnerable individuals safely housed and ensure that permanent housing initiatives remain accessible in every state in America,” Michelle Wilcox, Crossroads’ CEO and president, said in a statement Monday. 
HUD’s new rules also prohibit future funds from being used to conduct activities that “rely on or otherwise use a definition of sex as other than binary in humans.” The lawsuit claims the policy violates the First Amendment and HUD’s own policy.
“HUD’s Equal Access Rule applies to CoC-funded programs and protects transgender individuals from discrimination,” the lawsuit states.
An ‘incomprehensible’ policy change
For Youth Pride, compliance with that rule would mean no longer using preferred names or chosen pronouns for the queer youth it serves at its Westminster Street headquarters in Providence. The group would also have to shut down its support programs for transgender and nonbinary youth and could be forced to terminate transgender and nonbinary staff or require them to hide their identities.
“Unhoused and housing-insecure youth are one of the most vulnerable populations in our communities,” Youth Pride Executive Director Rush Frazier said in a statement. “It’s incomprehensible that any administration can justify or endorse changes that leave young adults unhoused, diminishing their chances of completing college, finding long term housing, and risking their physical and mental health in the process.”
In federal fiscal year 2024, Youth Pride received a Continuum of Care grant of $183,260, according to the lawsuit.
Like all lawsuits filed against the Trump administration, attorneys for the coalition argue HUD’s new policy is “arbitrary and capricious” and claim the department violated the Administrative Procedure Act in the sudden issuance of a new notice of funding opportunity.
Because of those issues, the coalition is asking the court to declare the new conditions unlawful and reinstate language from prior funding notices. They’re the same demands being made by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, along with 18 other AGs and two governors, in a separate lawsuit filed Nov. 25. That case has been assigned to Judge Mary S. McElroy, who has not yet scheduled a hearing.
A HUD spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Other plaintiffs in the suit filed Monday include the County of Santa Clara, Calif.; San Francisco; King County, Washington; Boston; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Nashville; and Tucson, Arizona.

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey Senate panel unanimously approved legislation Monday that would strip some investigatory powers and staff from the state’s comptroller over overwhelming opposition from activists, other watchdogs, and New Jersey’s chief law enforcement official.
Over nearly four hours of testimony in front of the Senate state government committee that included several shouting matches, a range of critics urged lawmakers not to advance legislation that would end the Office of the State Comptroller’s ability to issue subpoenas and launch investigations into waste, fraud, and abuse.
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), the bill’s chief sponsor, defended the measure at the start of the hearing and said criticism of it is overblown.
“This is a reallocation of small resources from one department to another which is more properly equipped to handle them,” Scutari said.
The bill would remove powers and duties the comptroller inherited from the state’s defunct inspector general’s office in 2010.
The proposed shift would eliminate the office’s duty to investigate complaints of governmental waste, fraud, and abuse flagged by members of the public and strip the comptroller of some investigatory tools.
The comptroller’s office would keep its authority to audit state and local governments and the state’s Medicaid program, though the bill would make it harder for it to obtain documents to aid those audits.
Though state law requires governments to share documents with the comptroller at the office’s request, the office has said some bodies — including joint health insurance funds with ties to South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross — have declined to turn over records.
The bill would shift the comptroller’s lost powers to the State Commission of Investigation, a body originally convened in 1968 to combat organized crime that has grown less relevant and less productive as New Jersey’s mobs weakened.
Bruce Keller, who was appointed as the commission’s executive director in July, argued during Monday’s hearing that his agency is better positioned to conduct investigations now overseen by the comptroller’s office.
“Investigations is 100% of the SCI’s work, and the SCI does it with former prosecutors and deeply experienced state and federally trained investigators, and we’re adding even more in the months ahead,” he said.
The legislation would grant the State Commission of Investigation an expanded mandate, allowing it to investigate misuses of taxpayer money as the comptroller does now. The bill would also allow it to investigate misconduct by law enforcement.
The latter provision, combined with another allowing the commission to seek approval for wiretaps, pushed New Jersey’s top law enforcement official to sound the alarm.
“The idea of wiretapping conducted by a civil enforcement agency never once came up to me, in my four years as an attorney general, as an idea we should even consider, much less one I should be testifying about before this body,” said Attorney General Matt Platkin.
Platkin added that he has significant concerns about the bill’s constitutionality, warning the provisions that would allow staff at the State Commission of Investigation — an agency overseen partly by the Legislature — to seek wiretaps or participate in prosecutions risk trampling on the separation of powers by allowing the Legislature to enforce laws, rather than draft them.
“What it does is it creates a rogue prosecution agency reportable to legislative leadership with an executive director — as great as Bruce Keller may be — the Legislature reaffirms can be fired at will with no notice,” said Platkin.

Few who testified Monday said they oppose making the State Commission of Investigation more robust, though almost universally, witnesses said changes should not come at the expense of the comptroller’s office.
Acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh said his office is more productive, noting it had published 25 reports in 2025 to the commission’s zero.
“The reality is SCI can return to its glory days, and Mr. Keller may even be the one to do it, but it doesn’t need to come at the cost of undermining the executive branch’s watchdog when we have been more effective, more prolific, including in investigations,” Walsh said.
The comptroller’s falling out with legislators began in 2023 after the office released a report that Union County had improperly paid some of its top officials, and that conflict heated to a boiling point over the following two years.
Subsequent reports that found waste in Essex County’s COVID-19 vaccine program and procurement violations in Hudson County spurred calls from county officials to rein in the office with legislative hearings.
Some witnesses — including some of the state’s other oversight officials — suggested the bill is retaliation over the comptroller’s work.
“While it has been presented as if it were not an attack on one agency, it does appear to be an attack on one agency — not because it’s doing a bad job, but quite a good job, I think,” said Terry Schuster, New Jersey’s corrections ombudsman. “Independent oversight bodies have to be able to say the truth, even when it’s unpopular.”
State Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Burlington) said the bill was drafted because of dissatisfaction “with how things have been running” at the comptroller’s office, though neither he nor any other members of the committee named particular problems there.
Sen. Jim Beach (D-Camden), the committee’s chair, suggested the bill was spurred by discontent with Platkin’s performance as attorney general, though the bill does not affect Platkin’s office outside of allowing the commission to seek wiretap approval for employees of the Office of the Attorney General.

Beach, who chairs the Camden County Democratic Committee and is a close Norcross ally, imposed a strict three-minute time limit on testimony by most of the bill’s roughly three dozen opponents — including, at times, by cutting their microphones — but not its supporters.
Beach engaged in shouting matches with Walsh and also with U.S. Sen Andy Kim (D-NJ), who was among those to testify against the bill. Kim had asked to testify at the start of the hearing, but Beach would not allow him to speak until near the end, even when some witnesses whose names were called earlier said they would cede their time to Kim.
When Kim’s testimony surpassed the three-minute mark, Beach told him he had to conclude.
“Sir, I have been here for five-and-a-half hours,” Kim told Beach.
“Yeah, so what?” Beach responded. “So has everyone else. Why do you think you’re special? You’re not.”

The commission is considering a rate increase for Xcel Energy. (Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Xcel Energy has agreed to cut a proposed electricity rate increase for North Dakota customers. 
The agreement that is pending approval with the North Dakota Public Service Commission would raise overall rates by 10.37%, with the increase for residential customers at 12.92%. 
Northern States Power Co., part of Minnesota-based Xcel Energy, had originally asked for a rate increase of 19.34% with the residential rate increasing by more than 24%.
A Public Service Commission hearing on Monday went over details of the rate request and the compromise agreement. 
North Dakota customers have already been paying a higher electric rate this year under an interim rate increase. Customers’ bills should not change dramatically if the rate increase is approved as currently proposed, said Victor Schock, director of utilities for the PSC.
A vote by the three-person commission could come in January. 
Xcel’s coal exit an issue in North Dakota electric rate case 

Xcel had not asked for a rate increase in four years, which a representative said was needed in part to address high inflation. The rate increase will also help pay for a new Grand Forks service center, a new substation and equipment upgrades.
Xcel has about 97,000 customers in North Dakota, including in Fargo, Grand Forks and Minot. 
During the hearing, Public Service Commissioner Sheri Haugen-Hoffart said in reviewing the 165 public comments, she noted four themes, which she asked Allen Krug, vice president of state regulatory policy, to address.
Data centers: Krug said the rate increase has nothing to do with data centers in North Dakota or Minnesota. Krug said Xcel was committed to not making existing customers pay for new large electric load projects such as data centers. 
Impact to seniors and those on fixed incomes: Haugen-Hoffart said those relying on Social Security cost-of-living increases feel the rate increase more than others. 
Krug said “no cost increase is without pain,” but noted the increase is less than the rate of inflation since the previous rate increase. 
Effect of Minnesota policies: Minnesota has been pushing utilities away from fossil fuels such as coal. Xcel is retiring coal-fired power plants in Minnesota earlier than North Dakota regulators anticipated. 
Krug said the rate increases are not driven by those policy differences between the two states. He said Xcel has made investments to ensure power reliability. 
He also said Xcel continues to use natural gas and said there is potential for a natural gas-powered plant in eastern North Dakota if a pipeline to bring natural gas from the state’s oilfields in the west is built.
Xcel profits: Krug said the company’s profits are in line with what investors request. 
The Public Service Commission had set aside the whole week for the hearing, but it wrapped up before noon Monday as a result of the compromise.

,DC,2025-12-01 23:22:00+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Arizona’s Kelly vows to stay outspoken despite threats over illegal order video,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/arizonas-kelly-vows-stay-outspoken-despite-threats-over-illegal-order-video,,"WASHINGTON — Arizona Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly said Monday the threat of a court-martial for a video he and other senators released telling military members not to follow illegal orders is an effort to silence the president’s political opponents. Kelly, a retired Navy captain, was one of six Democratic lawmakers with backgrounds in the military or intelligence agencies who appeared in the video that was posted on social media in mid-November. President Donald Trump alleged the lawmakers had committed “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” for telling members of the military and intelligence communities that they “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”Kelly said during a press conference that he and his wife, former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot during a town hall in 2011, have experienced a sharp increase in threats in the weeks since Trump reacted negatively to the video. “My family knows the cost of political violence. My wife, Gabby, was shot in the head and nearly died while speaking with her constituents,” Kelly said. “The president should understand this too. He has been the target of political violence himself.”Kelly then listed off other recent instances of political violence, including the killing of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, the arson at the official home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk during a rally at Utah Valley University. “Every other president we have ever had in the history of this nation would have tried to heal the country,” Kelly said. “But we all know Donald Trump, he uses every single opportunity to divide us, and that's dangerous.”The Defense Department has announced officials are looking into recalling Kelly to active duty for a potential court-martial. The FBI has also contacted the House and Senate Sergeant at Arms to request interviews with the six lawmakers in the video. Kelly said he and the other Democrats in the video would not be intimidated or silenced by Trump’s comments or the investigations.“It's a dangerous moment for the United States of America when the president and his loyalists use every lever of power to silence United States senators for speaking up,” Kelly said. “But we all know that this isn't about me and it's not about the others in that video.“They're trying to send a message to retired service members, to government employees, the members of the military, to elected officials and to all Americans who are thinking about speaking up — you better keep your mouth shut, or else.”Video caused stirThe lawmakers’ video reminded servicemembers they’d sworn an oath to the Constitution, something Kelly said shouldn’t have been controversial. “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” the Democrats said in the video. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”Kelly declined to say directly during the press conference if the video was a response to ongoing strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea that Trump and others in the administration have said are shipping illegal substances to the United States. “I think it's good for people to get a reminder. And we wanted to show that we had their back and we understood the situation they were in,"" Kelly said. “And we said something that is in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, according to the law of armed combat.”Investigations openedThe House and Senate Armed Services Committees have each opened investigations into the strikes after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to make sure everyone died during a Sept. 2 strike on one of the boats. Kelly said that he has “tremendous confidence” in committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi and ranking member Jack Reed of Rhode Island. But he repeatedly criticized Hegseth as unqualified, saying he often “runs around on a stage like he's a 12-year-old playing army.” “If there is anyone who needs to answer questions in public and under oath, it is Pete Hegseth,” Kelly said. The Armed Services Committee, he said, should have both a public hearing and one for senators in a classified setting to get more details on the strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, including whether the Trump administration has a strategy. Kelly said if Trump wants to remove Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, then he must make that clear so Congress can have a debate and Americans can have a say in a potential war.“Regime change as a policy in the United States, generally, in our history, has not worked out well. Think of South Vietnam, think of the Bay of Pigs, Iraq and Afghanistan. It results in the deaths of U.S. service members without the intended outcome,” Kelly said. “And in this case, I don't even think we know the intended outcome. The president needs to make a case to the American people when he is about to put thousands of American men and women in harm's way.”",,,,2025-12-01 18:58:51.562637

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, introduced bipartisan legislation to streamline the process to recover missing U.S. military members. 
Crapo and U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, on Monday announced the re-introduction of the Bring Our Heroes Home Act. The senators also introduced the bill in 2023. 
“Idaho welcomed home another missing hero just a few weeks ago, and we cannot give up on our efforts to identify and bring home every remaining missing servicemember,” Crapo said in a press release. “We must cut the bureaucratic red tape that delays bringing them to an eternal resting place here at home. We owe their families and loved ones the assurances they have not been forgotten.” 
In mid-October, the remains of 2nd Lt. Charles Atteberry were returned his family in Parma after being missing for 80 years, KTVB reported. Atteberry was born in Parma and joined the Army in 1937. He was reported missing in 1942 and later reported as a prisoner by Japan in the Philippines until 1944, the Idaho Statesman reported. 
Atteberry was aboard a Japanese ship in January 1945 when it was attacked and sunk by U.S. forces. The Idaho native reportedly survived the attack but died a few days later at sea, the Statesman reported. His remains from a mass grave in Taiwan were identified decades later by the U.S. military using DNA testing. 
 What would the Bring Our Heroes Home Act do?

The legislation introduced Monday would create a collection of missing Armed Forces and civilian personnel records at the National Archives and Records Administration, require certain agencies find and send records of missing servicemember records to the archives, and create an independent Missing Armed Forces and Civilian Personnel Records Review Board.
Under most circumstances, the board would be required to publicly report its records. 
The review board would comprise five members appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, according to the bill. The board would include at least one attorney and at least one professional historian. 
The board would be required to submit an annual report that includes its expenditures, progress made, and suggestions or requests for Congress. The bill authorizes funding in such “sums that are necessary to carry out this Act,” but does not specify how much that would be. 
The Congressional Budget Office did not do a cost estimate of the similar bill introduced in 2023. 
 There are nearly 81,000 Americans who remain unaccounted for from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Cold War, the Gulf Wars and other conflicts, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Around 360 of those missing servicemembers are from Idaho, including Atteberry’s brother, Lloyd Atteberry, who has been considered missing in action since he was reportedly shot down in 1943. 
Fellow U.S. Senator from Idaho Jim Risch is a co-sponsor of the bill, as well as U.S. Sens.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Four Republican states have agreed to help the Trump administration gain access to state driver’s license data through a nationwide law enforcement computer network as part of the administration’s hunt for alleged noncitizen voters.
The Trump administration said as recently as October that federal officials wanted to obtain driver’s license records through the network.
The commitment from officials in Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio comes as part of a settlement agreement filed on Friday in a federal lawsuit. The lawsuit was originally brought by the states last year alleging the Biden administration wasn’t doing enough to help states verify voter eligibility.
The settlement, between the states and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, requires the federal department to continue its development of a powerful citizenship verification program known as SAVE. Earlier this year, federal officials repurposed SAVE into a program capable of scanning millions of state voter records for instances of noncitizen registered voters.
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

In return, the states have agreed to support Homeland Security’s efforts to access the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, an obscure computer network that typically allows law enforcement agencies to search driver’s license records across state lines. Nlets — as the system is known — lets police officers easily look up the driving records of out-of-state motorists.
The Trump administration and some Republican election officials have promoted the changes to SAVE as a useful tool to identify potential noncitizen voters, and Indiana had already agreed to provide voter records. Critics, including some Democrats, say the Trump administration is building a massive database of U.S. residents that President Donald Trump or a future president could use for spying or targeting political enemies.
Stateline reported last week, before the settlement agreement was filed in court, that Homeland Security publicly confirmed it wants to connect Nlets to SAVE.
A notice published Oct. 31 in the Federal Register said driver’s licenses are the most widely used form of identification, and that by working with states and national agencies, including Nlets, “SAVE will use driver’s license and state identification card numbers to check and confirm identity information.”
A federal official also previously told a virtual meeting of state election officials in May that Homeland Security was seeking “to avoid having to connect to 50 state databases” and wanted a “simpler solution,” such as Nlets, according to government records published by the transparency group American Oversight.
The new settlement lays out the timeline for how the Trump administration could acquire the four states’ records.
Within 90 days of the execution of the agreement, the four states may provide Homeland Security with 1,000 randomly selected driver’s license records from their state for verification as part of a quality improvement process for SAVE.
According to the agreement, the states that provide the records will “make best efforts to support and encourage DHS’s efforts to receive and have full use of state driver’s license records from the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System” and state driver’s license agencies.
The language in the agreement is open-ended and doesn’t make clear whether the pledge to help Homeland Security obtain access to Nlets is limited to drivers from those four states or is intended to require the states to help the agency acquire the records of drivers nationwide.
An agreement to help
The agreement could pave the way for Republican officials in other states to provide access to license data.
Nlets is a nonprofit organization that facilitates data sharing among law enforcement agencies across state lines. States decide what information to make available through Nlets, and which agencies can access it. That means the four states could try to influence peers to share Nlets data with the Trump administration.
Homeland Security wants state driver’s license data for sweeping citizenship program

“They’re not just talking about driver’s license numbers, they’re talking about the driver’s records. What possible reason would DHS have in an election or voting context — or any context whatsoever — for obtaining the ‘full use of state driver’s license records,’” said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research.
Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, said in a statement to Stateline that the settlement agreement provides another layer of election integrity and protection as officials seek to ensure only eligible voters are registered. He didn’t directly address questions about Nlets access.
“The SAVE program provides us with critical information, but we must also continue to utilize information from other state and federal partners to maintain clean and accurate lists,” Pate said in the statement.
Two weeks before the Nov. 5, 2024, election, Pate issued guidance to Iowa county auditors to challenge the ballots of 2,176 registered voters who were identified by the secretary of state’s office as potential noncitizens. The voters had reported to the state Department of Transportation or another government entity that they were not U.S. citizens in the past 12 years and went on to register to vote, according to the guidance.
In March, Pate said his office gained access to the SAVE database and found 277 of those people were confirmed to not have U.S. citizenship — just under 12% of the individuals identified as potential noncitizens.










What possible reason would DHS have in an election or voting context — or any context whatsoever — for obtaining the ‘full use of state driver’s license records.’ 


– David Becker, executive director, Center for Election Innovation & Research


Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.
Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — the agency under Homeland Security that oversees SAVE — told Stateline last week that USCIS was committed to “eliminating barriers to securing the nation’s electoral process.”
“By allowing states to efficiently verify voter eligibility, we are reinforcing the principle that America’s elections are reserved exclusively for American citizens,” Tragesser said in a statement.
The SAVE program — Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements — was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. In the past, SAVE could search only one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches; federal officials in May also connected the program to Social Security data.
“It’s a potentially dangerous mix to put driver’s license and Social Security number and date of birth information out there … where we really don’t know yet how and when and where it’s going to be used,” Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon said in an interview on Monday.
Democratic states object
As the Trump administration has encouraged states to use SAVE, the Justice Department has also demanded states provide the department with unredacted copies of their voter rolls. The Trump administration has previously confirmed the Justice Department is sharing voter information with Homeland Security.
The Justice Department has sued six, mostly Democratic, states for refusing to turn over the data. Those lawsuits remain pending.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

On Monday, 12 state secretaries of state submitted a 29-page public comment, in response to SAVE’s Federal Register notice, criticizing the overhaul. The secretaries wrote that while Homeland Security claims the changes make the program an effective tool for verifying voters, the modifications are “likely to degrade, not enhance” states’ efforts to ensure free, fair and secure elections.
“What the modified system will do … is allow the federal government to capture sensitive data on hundreds of millions of voters nationwide and distribute that information as it sees fit,” the secretaries wrote.
The secretaries of state of California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington signed on to the comment.
The settlement agreement purports to make this year’s changes to SAVE legally binding.
The agreement asks that a federal court retain jurisdiction over the case for 20 years for the purposes of enforcing it — a move that in theory could make it harder for a future Democratic president to reverse the changes to SAVE.
But Becker, of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, said he doesn’t expect the settlement agreement would make it more difficult for a future administration to undo the overhaul.
“Should a different administration come in that disagrees with this approach,” Becker said, “I would expect that they would almost certainly completely change how the system operates and how the states can access it and what data the federal government procures.”

(Photo courtesy of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services)With the arrival of the holiday season, Utah state officials are holding an annual giving drive to gather donations for those who may feel alone — including mental health patients, adults who are wards of the state, and youth in the juvenile justice system. 
“This effort helps make sure vulnerable people receive gifts, necessities, and the assurance that someone cares,” the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release issued Monday. 
As part of the giving drive, Department of Health and Human Services staff manage donations, purchase and wrap gifts, and distribute them to those in need. 
Here’s a breakdown of how to help: 
The Forgotten Patient 
The Forgotten Patient Holiday Project is meant to bring holiday cheer to patients at the Utah State Hospital who otherwise may not receive anything due to a lack of family or other difficult circumstances. 
The Utah State Hospital, based in Provo, is a state-run psychiatric hospital for people with severe mental illness. 
“Being in a hospital over the holidays can be difficult for patients, especially for those without family or loved ones to visit them,” state officials said in Monday’s news release. 
The Forgotten Patient Christmas Project has a long history in Utah — having helped hospital patients for more than 60 years, according to the Utah State Hospital’s website. Each year, about 400 volunteers donate their time, money and gifts to make it possible. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2022, 315 patients were sponsored, “and each patient knew that someone was thinking about them during the holiday season,” according to state hospital officials. 
For the project, each patient writes a list of what they would like for Christmas, and a sponsor purchases some or all of those items. Some community groups also do service projects to provide stockings filled with candy and personal hygiene items, while others put on musical concerts for the patients. 
Those who volunteer as sponsors will receive an information sheet about a person, which includes clothing sizes, hobbies, interests, favorite treats, and other requests. The sheet will also include safety guidelines for those buying gifts. 
The gifts will then be delivered to the hospital, where staff will check them for safety concerns before wrapping them and delivering them to patients on Christmas morning. 
The state hospital also accepts cash donations if you want to help but aren’t able to sponsor a patient. 
To learn more or to volunteer, contact Cami Roundy at camiroundy@utah.gov. 
Office of Public Guardian clients
The Utah Office of Public Guardian is a state agency that provides guardianship services to about 250 adults who are unable to make basic life decisions for themselves and have no other family to care for them. 
Each holiday season, many people served by the Office of Public Guardian are in need of items like clothing, bedding, and personal care supplies. 
The Office of Public Guardian uses donations to give clients a “personalized and positive holiday experience and to make sure they have what they need throughout the rest of the year as well,” state officials said. 
The office is accepting donations in the form of cash, checks or gift cards to ensure everyone the office serves receives a gift during the holidays. 
Gift cards can be purchased via the office’s Amazon wish list. You can also email  utahopg@utah.gov or call 801-538-8255 for more information. 
Juvenile Justice and Youth Services
State officials are also holding a gift drive for the Division of Juvenile Justice and Youth Services, which is meant to benefit youth in the juvenile justice system. 
The gift drive helps gather personal items, clothing, books, and other gifts for kids in 13 youth centers across the state.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Millions of Hoosiers would have different representation in the U.S. House under a proposed redrawing of Indiana’s congressional maps that aims to produce a 9-0 GOP delegation.
Indiana House Republicans released their redistricting plan Monday, just hours before the start of a one-week fast-track process toward that chamber granting President Donald Trump’s demand to create more GOP-friendly districts ahead of the 2026 elections.
A court challenge is anticipated if a redistricting plan is adopted. But provisions in the redistricting legislation, House Bill 1032, also would prevent county-level judges from blocking new congressional maps and direct any appeals immediately to the Indiana Supreme Court.
 

The House Elections and Apportionment Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing beginning at 9 a.m. Tuesday on the redistricting bill. The hearing is set for the House chamber and to end no later than 2:45 p.m. 
The online form to sign up to testify in person is available beginning at midnight Tuesday.



Passage of the redistricting plan isn’t assured because of persistent resistance from several Republican state senators. Several of those senators have cited widespread voter opposition to changing the current GOP-drawn maps adopted in 2021 that have seen Republicans maintain a 7-2 Indiana congressional majority.
Republican House Speaker Todd Huston acknowledged the political motivations behind the proposed new map, which splits strongly Democratic Indianapolis among four districts that all stretch far into rural, heavily Republican counties.
“We’ve always had districts that span hundreds of miles,” Huston told reporters. “The maps were put together with the interest of trying to create as many Republican seats as possible.”
Proposed maps overhaul all 9 districts
Linda Butler of Lawrence in northeastern Marion County was among a few hundred protesters at a Monday anti-redistricting rally inside the Statehouse.
Butler criticized the proposed map for obliterating the current 7th District, where she lives. It is currently held by Democratic Rep. André Carson. The proposal would put her home in a new 7th District, spanning from the north side of Indianapolis to the Ohio River near Cincinnati.
“They’re doing it so that they can win elections,” Butler said of Republicans. “It is terrible. I think it’s terrible. That’s an illustration for me that this is wrong.”
The proposed map drastically overhauls all nine Indiana congressional districts, but Huston said he did not know how many people would be in different districts.
For instance, the 8th District now held by Republican Rep. Erin Houchin, who is from rural southern Indiana’s Washington County, would lose its southeastern Indiana counties near Cincinnati. The revamped district would span from near downtown Indianapolis to the Ohio River counties just north of Louisville, Kentucky. 
State Rep. Wendy Dant Chesser, D-Jeffersonville, called the proposal “completely unfair to residents of Southern Indiana.”
“We’re impacted more by Louisville than by Indianapolis,” Dant Cheser said. “It’s not the same for Central Indiana. Our representative in Congress will have split loyalties between two major metropolitan areas with two very different needs.”
It was uncertain from the proposed map released Monday whether the Indianapolis home of Carson, the Democratic congressman, was placed in a district with Houchin or Republican Rep. Jefferson Shreve of Indianapolis.
“Splicing our state’s largest city — and its biggest economic driver — into four parts is ridiculous,” Carson said in a statement. “It’s clear these orders are coming from Washington, and they clearly don’t know the first thing about our community.”
The Lake Michigan shoreline area that now makes up the 1st District held by Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan would be split in two by the new map.
Republicans propose a new 1st District taking in Democratic-friendly Lake County then heading southeast to take in the areas around the small cities of Logansport, Peru and Wabash.
Political breakdown of proposed maps
Trump won each of the districts under the proposed map by at least 12 percentage points in the 2024 election, according to an analysis by Indianapolis City-County Councilor Nick Roberts, a Democrat.
Trump’s narrowest win was in the proposed 1st District, where Republican Gov. Mike Braun won by a 6 percentage point margin, according to Roberts.
J. Miles Coleman, the associate editor of political analysis site Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia, predicted Democrats’ performance there would mirror broader electoral trends — such as if the 2026 midterms end up a “Democratic wave.”
“Under that logic, maybe Mrvan actually does have a decent shot of holding onto his seat,” Coleman said.
The new Indianapolis-area seats, however, would be “fairly secure,” according to Coleman: they “vote pretty much like the state as a whole,” 60-40 for Trump, when using 2024 election data.
State Rep. Earl Harris, D-East Chicago, told the anti-redistricting rally crowd that he objected to Republicans calling the Legislature back into session weeks ahead of its planned Jan. 5 return to push through redistricting.

Harris, who is chair of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus, argued redrawing of the 1st District where he lives did not make sense and shouldn’t take priority over dealing with problems such as rising health care, utility and child care costs.
“If we come in early, we need to come in for real issues facing real Hoosiers,” Harris said.
Republicans shift on map standards
Huston acknowledged the proposed congressional map was developed in conjunction with the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which was also involved in drawing the new map adopted by Texas Republicans this summer.
While this year’s redistricting wave started in Texas, Indiana House Elections Committee Chair Tim Wesco, R-Osceola, said he supported Republicans responding to previous congressional maps drawn in Democratic-led states.
“You could trace it back to when Illinois adopted their maps years ago, and they’re ridiculous, where they eliminated three Republican seats in the 2021 redistricting,” Wesco told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Wesco in 2021 praised the Republican-sponsored Indiana maps for their compactness and maintaining “communities of interest.”
Asked whether those standards should still apply, Wesco replied, “The maps we adopted in 2021 were excellent maps, no doubt. But 2025 is not 2021.”
Court fight anticipated
Redistricting opponents vowed to challenge a finalized map but said they’re still tailoring their legal strategies to the draft released Monday.
“It’s a little too early to speak specifically, but I can tell you: absolutely, conversations are being had right now, and should maps be passed, they will be challenged almost immediately,” said Julia Vaughn, executive director of nonpartisan elections watchdog Common Cause Indiana.

Racial gerrymandering could be the centerpiece of a lawsuit at the federal level, but there’s also discussion of state-level legal fights, she said.
Lawmakers could be part of that fight. The Indiana Black Legislative Caucus, made up of more than a dozen Black lawmakers — all Democrats — gathered Monday afternoon to denounce the proposed districts.
“They’re racially gerrymandered. There’s no ifs, ands and buts about it,” said Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis.
Language in the bill, however, would constrain challenges in state courts.
The legislation would prohibit seeking or granting temporary injunctions, which would otherwise block the map from going into effect.
Lawsuits can “disrupt the orderly conduct” of elections, the bill reads – and so can “judicial alterations.” Court action can “undermine voter confidence.”
It also mandates that the Indiana Supreme Court have “exclusive” jurisdiction over any appeal of an order promoting an injunction. Actions covered by this chunk of text “must be given priority over ordinary matters,” the bill reads.
Huston said the intent of that language is “just making sure there’s a process to get to the Supreme Court as quickly as possible. They’re the final determinant.”
Asked if the provisions could overstep separation between the three branches of government, he said, “No.”
 Threats continue

Several GOP senators and Indiana Gov. Mike Braun have reported intimidation attempts, plus swatting and bomb threats. Their stances on redistricting run the gamut, from opposed to undecided to supportive.
Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, on Monday became the latest to confirm a bomb threat targeting his home. Sen. Jean Leising, R-Oldenburg, also reported a “pipe bomb threat” at her home Saturday evening.
Both Bohacek and Leising have said they are against redrawing the congressional maps.
“I will not cave” on redistricting, Leising wrote in a message to constituents. “I will be fighting for all of you in this early session!”

(Joshua Bowling/Source NM)A child or teenager will be arrested and charged with possessing a firearm on three out of four days in New Mexico, the governor’s senior public safety adviser said Monday.
“That number is way too high,” Benjamin Baker, senior public safety adviser to Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told Republican members on the New Mexico GOP’s Public Safety Legislative Task Force. “Work needs to be done to address what is happening with that age creep and violence related to our juvenile offenders.”
He said that the Albuquerque Public Schools system has caught students bringing guns to school 10 times this academic year.
Baker was one speaker in a daylong series of panel discussions that ranged from the challenges of preventing drug trafficking to barriers to holding repeat offenders in jail. Public safety has factored prominently into the governor’s legislative agenda. Last year, she called a special legislative session on crime reporting, gun violence, drug overdoses and more. The special session adjourned after just five hours without passing any legislation related to crime, public safety or drug use — though Senate Republicans introduced more than a dozen.
The subject of repeat offenders has become a common refrain on the campaign trail among New Mexico gubernatorial hopefuls. However, a 2024 Legislative Finance Committee report found that “most dismissals for repeat offenders were due to issues with evidence collection and victim or witness cooperation.”
That same report found that New Mexico’s crime rate is consistently above the national average. In the state’s largest city, though, police data shows that levels of property crimes, violent crimes and homicides are down year-over-year, while arrest numbers are up. The data shows that Albuquerque logged 5,260 violent crimes from January to September of 2024 and 4,601 from January to September of this year. Likewise, there were 87 homicides logged by September of 2024 and 58 by September of this year.
In November, Legislative Finance Committee analysts told state lawmakers that youthful offenders in New Mexico return to the justice system because of a lack of prevention programs and significant gaps in behavioral health services. The Legislative Finance Committee report found that New Mexico’s kids experience outsized rates of adverse childhood experiences like physical abuse and household substance abuse. It noted that juvenile suspects have faced an uptick in charges of battery, fighting, carrying a deadly weapon on school property and cannabis possession in restricted areas. New Mexico routinely ranks 50th for child well-being in the national Kids Count report published by the nonpartisan Annie E. Casey Foundation, which is dedicated to researching child welfare. 
While elected Democrats and Republicans alike have called for legislative remedies to juvenile crime, members of the legislative task force on Monday voiced frustration with how their public safety proposals have failed to advance through the state Legislature. Multiple times, they mentioned Senate Bill 166, sponsored by Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque) in this year’s regular session, which would have changed the state law’s definition of “a harm to self’ and ‘harm to others” to permit more people to be civilly committed to locked facilities. The bill cleared the Senate but died in the House.
“When we’re bringing this legislation,” said Rep. Nicole Chavez (R-Albuquerque), whose son was killed in a 2015 drive-by shooting, “they die in their first committee.”
Behind the dais at Monday’s meeting was a panel made up solely of Republicans. When discussion drifted toward partisan talking points, one senator was quick to defend the Democratic governor. 
“Keeping New Mexico safe should not be a partisan issue,” said task force Co-Chair Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte). “The far right is pretty quick to say ‘Well, crime is up, we’re the most dangerous state in the nation because we have a Democrat governor.’ The reality is, that’s not fair. We’re not even getting these bills to her desk.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/122125-legislative-task-force-1024x767.png,,,2025-12-01 18:58:51.562637

When Chesapeake Bay governors and other leaders gather at the National Aquarium on Tuesday to consider the next bay cleanup agreement, they’ll be joined by leaders from several federally recognized Native American tribes in Virginia.
The tribal leaders will present a symbolic gift of wild rice, to represent growing a partnership between the tribes and state and federal leaders — who are about to spend seven months determining whether the tribes can have a seat at the table as decisions are made about the bay.
It’s taken almost a year for tribes to even get to this point.
“We’ve come such a long way from where we started — which was another absence, which was no conversation,” said Melissa Ann Ehrenreich, executive director of the Indigenous Conservation Council. The council was formed in 2022 to represent the seven Virginia tribes that gained federal recognition between 2015 and 2018.
The tribes formally asked to be included as signatories to the next bay agreement, only to run up against the layers of bureaucracy at the Bay Program that Ehrenreich concedes have proven stifling.
“It has been frustrating to participate at multiple different levels and feel like: ‘Wow, why couldn’t we have done this over the last year?’” Ehrenreich asked. “The bay can’t wait.”

The yearlong delay is partially about timing: The Bay Program is led by the executive council, which includes Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D), Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D)  and other governors in the watershed, who only convene once a year. At its last meeting, in Annapolis last December, the council only directed staff to revise the bay agreement — not to add signatories.
That was the reason cited in a June letter in response to the tribes.
A document going before the governors on Tuesday will give Bay Program officials the go-ahead to study tribal inclusion, and “develop recommendations by July 1, 2026, on how best to include tribes across the watershed in the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) partnership.”
That could include adding the tribes, or the ICC, to the Bay agreement as a signatory, on equal footing with Maryland and the other states, according to the document.
The document also states that officials “may prepare a draft memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the federally recognized tribes within the watershed outlining CBP partner expectations and commitments, recognizing budgetary and resource needs and constraints,” the document continues.
The tribes are approaching the Bay Program at a difficult juncture for the agreement.
The states in the watershed, including Pennsylvania, failed to reach pollution-cutting goals outlined in the previous agreement by 2025, forcing them back to the drawing board to revise their pact. After months of deliberation, the states and federal officials agreed to a 2040 deadline for those same pollution reductions.
The proposed new plan also updates a host of other goals, including for underwater grass acreage, wetland restoration and forest conservation. But some environmentalists have raised alarm that some of the goals were revised downward compared to the earlier version, making them easier for the bay states to achieve.
Even with a series of bay agreements dating back to the 1980s, improving conditions in the bay has proven a challenge. In the late ‘80s, water quality testing determined that 26.5% of the bay’s tidal waters met standards. Today, that number is 29.4%. Bay Program officials view it as a victory, since they’re up against climate change and increasing development and population in the watershed.
Not everyone agrees.
“The effort is expensive, and it’s failing. They’re not making any progress at all, hardly,” said Chief Frank Adams of the Upper Mattaponi Indian Tribe, an ICC member, in an interview last month. “Why keep doing the same thing over and over? Let’s try something else. Let’s include the Native cultural knowledge and Native people.”
Part of the problem is that East Coast states are unaccustomed to considering tribal governments, with federally recognized tribes a rarity, Adams said.
“This is the first time the state of Virginia has ever had a federally recognized tribe, and they didn’t know how to deal with us,” Adams said. “Up and down the East Coast and the states that are feeding into the Chesapeake Bay: Pennsylvania, Maryland, all the other states, have no federally recognized tribes, so it was not even a thought that they should include the sovereign nations of Virginia into the discussion.”
Adams argues that tribes have lots to contribute. After the Upper Mattaponi won federal recognition, for instance, an environmental department was the first to be established, using grant funding. Adams said the department now has five staff members and focuses on issues including battling invasive fish. Other Virginia tribes have taken a similar approach.
Tribal leaders said they were not expecting the Bay Program to have such a lengthy procedure for considering their inclusion.
“I just saw it as more walls of colonialism — that [they] had not had Indigenous people involved,” said Chief Anne Richardson of the Rappahannock Tribe, an ICC member, in a November interview.
“And they felt there was no need to have Indigenous people involved at that level, although all of our watersheds are feeding off of the bay, and we’ve stewarded the bay and these rivers for thousands of years — and did a good job, without the millions and billions of dollars that the government seems to be pouring into it now,” she said.
In fact, the very name of the Chesapeake Bay is derived from an Algonquian word, Chesapiooc.
“We just want a seat at the table, so that we have decision-making authority, just like everybody else that sits at the table,” Richardson said. “You would think in 2025 that wouldn’t be an issue, but obviously it is.”
Leaders at the Bay Program say they aren’t throwing hurdles in front of the tribes.
“It’s not a ‘no.’ And it’s not like if you miss this boat, we move on,” said Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, during an interview earlier this year. The commission is a signatory on the bay agreement which represents lawmakers from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
In more recent comments, Bay Program officials said they’re optimistic about future discussions with the tribes.
“Indigenous communities in this region have thousands of years of insight into land and water management that the Chesapeake Bay Program can greatly benefit from as we continue our work to improve Chesapeake Bay water quality and wildlife,” said Leila Duman, bays restoration officer for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
“Maryland is supportive of the efforts to include representatives from these communities more formally as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program,” Duman said. “We look forward to participating in the next steps.”
Virginia officials declined to comment through the Bay Program, but added that their sentiment is similar to Maryland’s.
Dan Coogan, a 20-year EPA veteran who was named Bay Program director in October, said the “EPA and the Bay Partners are working with those federally recognized tribal nations to develop recommendations on how best to include tribes across the watershed. EPA looks forward to this discussion at the upcoming Executive Council meeting.”

If the Virginia tribes were to win signatory status on the Bay agreement, and representation on the executive council, it would be a relatively rare occurrence in the United States, said Lauren Wiederkehr, a law student at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, who studied the issue as a summer law clerk this year for the Chesapeake Legal Alliance.
The closest analogy might be the Puget Sound Partnership in Washington, which currently includes two Indigenous representatives on its leadership council.
One of them is Russell Hepfer, 69, a member of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, who has been serving on the Puget Sound leadership council since 2014. Hepfer said that fishing rights treaties between tribes and state governments make inclusion more commonplace at groups like the Puget Sound Partnership.
He said it has also helped that he could follow in the footsteps of other tribal leaders, including Billy Frank Jr., a Nisqually tribal member and well-known activist for tribal fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest who served on the leadership council as well.
But just getting a seat on the leadership council wasn’t enough: It’s a constant battle to educate others in leadership about tribes and their roles, Hepfer said.
“When people leave, retire, or whatever happens, you have to re-educate the next person,” he said.
Hepfer, who has served on the tribal council of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe for 24 years, said he views that education as a personal mission.
“We’re still a second-class group, but we have to keep telling our story,” he said.

Betsy Wackernagel Bach, chairperson of the Partners Hope Foundation, said hospice supporters in Montana toured seven different places, and they quizzed those who had forged the path.
“We asked them: What did they like? What didn’t they like? What did they wish they had done?” Bach said.
Then, when the in-patient hospice in Billings closed, Amanda Yeoman Melro, executive director of Partners Hope Foundation, said she called to learn their lessons, and Billings was ready to share.

In their research, the team learned that it was just as important to plan for sustainability as it was to plan to open a hospice. They learned that families are as integral to the mission as their loved ones, even that it’s advisable to have multiple USB ports in a room and couches that convert into beds.
Now, four months after opening its doors to families across Montana, the Hope Hospice Center has served more than 100 patients and their families, exceeded a $15 million capital campaign by $200,000, and it’s embarking on its next phase, to connect with referral sources that will help keep the center open and make good on its mission.
“Hope Hospice Center is a community promise to care for our neighbors through all of life’s stages,” Yeoman Melro said.
Up next?
“We’re moving into sustainability,” Yeoman Melro said.
Indeed, sustainability is an intrinsic part of the project, Bach said; the team wanted to not only build a center, but ensure it could stay open, and it saw this value as key.
“Sustainability became our mantra,” Bach said.
Only in-patient hospice in western Montana
The Hope Hospice Center is the only in-patient hospice facility in western Montana, and since RiverStone Health Hospice Home closed in Billings in June 2024, it is one of just two in-patient hospice centers in the state, Yeoman Melro said.

The other is in Great Falls, Benefis Peace Hospice of Montana, part of the Benefis Health System.
The Missoula center serves people from across the state and beyond, Yeoman Melro said. For example, if a Missoula resident has a family member who lives out of state but needs help in Montana, that family member can be a patient here.
The recent closure and the demographics of Montana make the center especially important, Yeoman Melro said.
“Montana is a huge state, and our population is aging quicker than others, and a lot of our seniors — (an estimated 40%) — live alone,” Melro said. “We see a lot of people who don’t really have a lot of family around.”
In 2017, the Partners Hope Foundation formed, put together by a group of community members and medical professionals dedicated to opening a hospice center “owned by the community,” not a large medical system.
Yeoman Melro said a land donation by community philanthropists Terry and Patt Payne helped kickstart the project, and Bach said an article in The Atlantic about how corporate medicine was dragging down hospice care showed the importance of sustainability.
The idea led to a partnership with a nonprofit provider, Partners In Home Care, and it also helped lead to the Compassionate Care Fund, which collects donations and supports patients who can’t afford the cost of regular care.
The center takes insurance, and it offers a sliding fee scale for room and board fees for residential patients. Hospice care is most often covered by the Medicare Hospice Benefit, Medicaid Hospice Benefit, Veterans Affairs benefits, Indian Health Service and private insurance plans.
The center offers general in-patient care for patients who need intensive 24-hour medical management; residential hospice for those who need more support than caregivers at home can offer; and respite care, a five-day admission that gives a primary caregiver temporary relief.

In July, supported by 800 donors, the center opened on the west side of town a couple of blocks off of Reserve Street, a main thoroughfare in Missoula.
It has 12 individual patient rooms, plus other spaces in 15,000 square feet, such as a room for children; snack bar offering soup and cookies 24 hours a day; living area with fireplace, library and educational resources; staff offices; and more.
The center opened with six patient rooms in operation, and Yeoman Melro said the goal is to be full by July 2026 with all 12 rooms occupied. It operates with 18 staff members, plus volunteers, who Melro said are critical to the operation.
Two nurses and one aide are on duty throughout the day, part of the support from Partners In Home Care, which has a medical director, nurse practitioners, pharmacist, nurses, social workers, chaplains, CNAs and administrators.
At the time the center opened, Corin Schneider, CEO of Partners In Home Care, said the highly skilled team was committed to delivering comprehensive, “whole-person” medical and emotional support for patients and loved ones.
“As Montana’s population continues to age, the need for inpatient hospice services is greater than ever,” Schneider said.
A homey place that looks and feels like Montana
Now that the center is open, the next phase is developing referral sources, Yeoman Melro said. Outreach meetings are taking place with physicians and medical groups, all part of the plan for sustainability.

Ongoing fundraising is important to maintain a reserve fund, refill the Compassionate Care Fund, and support some of the beautification and operational needs of the center, such as for sprinklers on the grounds in common areas.
“This is a startup. These are really expensive to run,” Yeoman Melro said.
Most hospice centers are owned by hospitals or other private providers or existing businesses, but this one is “owned by the community,” or stewarded and supported by community members, Yeoman Melro said, including a board of directors of 19.
(The center was designed to be able to expand in the future as well; for example, the HVAC system can handle another 12 beds down the road, Yeoman Melro said.)
The center was designed to look and feel like Montana, showcase artists from the state, including Indigenous ones, and be more homey than a clinical space, she said.
It has windows that let in natural light, natural wood features, and pieces of art throughout by Montana artists, including Stephanie Frostad, of Missoula, and Aspen Decker, based in Arlee.
Decker was and named one of the state’s top emerging artists this year by the Montana Museum of Art and Culture, which curated additional pieces for the center.

The center has rooms for both patients and families. For example, a spa room has a wash bowl and a bathtub that are easy for patients and caregivers to use, and in that space, caregivers can clean wounds or help with other needs.
“Sometimes you just need a haircut and a shave,” Yeoman Melro said.
Yeoman Melro said one thing the team learned from other hospices is they had “no place to pause,” no place for families to reflect after their loved ones die, so the Hope Hospice Center created an area with that idea in mind.
It has items for people of all denominations, a room for a chaplain to visit, and a fan for smudging ceremonies, she said.
Bach, board chairperson, said support for families evolved as the team did its research. They found hospice is as much about family care as it is a transition for someone who is at life’s end, and they’ve heard families feel cared for there, and the space feels warm.
Now, they want to get the word out, both that the center is taking patients, and also, that people shouldn’t assume they can’t afford it, given the insurance options and Compassionate Care Fund, Bach said.
“People need to know that we’re open,” Bach said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hospice-Centerpiece-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 17:57:30.442726

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Some of North Carolina’s political hopefuls made their 2026 bids official Monday, lining up at the state fairgrounds to file for election. Democrats aim to hold a crucial Supreme Court seat and chip away at Republican majorities in lower courts.
Candidates for state and federal office have until Friday, Dec. 19 to file for the March 3 primary election. Among the most high-profile contests for the midterm year: an open U.S. Senate seat, a state Supreme Court seat that could determine next decade’s redistricting, and a redrawn congressional district.
“I am just really excited about the prospect of, over the next 11 months, going out and explaining to voters of North Carolina why our state courts matter so much to them,” said state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, a Democrat running for re-election to the high court, after filing Monday in Raleigh.
Her vision for the court, Earls said, is as a “check and balance” on the executive and legislative branches, the latter of which is controlled by Republicans. So is the Supreme Court, which has final say on key legislative maneuvers and congressional mapmaking. But if Democrats can hold Earls’ seat, they have a chance to oust two of three Republicans up in 2028 and retake a majority.
Earls will likely face state Rep. Sarah Stevens, a Surry County Republican in November, assuming neither of them attract primary challengers. The race will be high-profile, expensive and potentially litigious: Republicans unsuccessfully sought to overturn another Democratic high court incumbent’s victory in 2024.
Stevens had not yet filed paperwork for her campaign as of Monday afternoon.
Earls was joined Monday by two Democrats running for re-election to the Court of Appeals, Judge Toby Hampson and John Arrowood.
Another Court of Appeals seat, being vacated by Judge Allegra Collins, will see a contested Democratic primary. Judge Christine Walczyk, a longtime district court judge in Wake County, and James Whalen, a Raleigh attorney who served on Justice Allison Riggs’ legal team in the 2024 election court battle, both filed to run for the seat Monday.
Republicans hold 12 of the 15 seats on the Court of Appeals.
The race for U.S. Senate, meanwhile, is almost certainly set but not yet official. Former Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, and former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley have both announced runs but did not file Monday.
Republican Don Brown of Waxhaw, N.C. has filed to challenge Whatley for the Republican nomination. Democrats Justin Dues, who unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Rep. Mark Harris in 2024, and political newcomer Orrick Quick have also filed federal paperwork to challenge Cooper for the seat.
Just one candidate, Republican Elizabeth Temple of Smithfield, has filed for Senate in North Carolina as of Monday afternoon. A former primary candidate for state House, Temple was accused of making offensive comments to students as a substitute teacher for Wake County Public Schools in 2019. She later defended herself, saying the allegations were “not true.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_4778-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 17:57:30.442726

The populist senator looks for candidates with a similar progressive stripe.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  How Bernie Sanders Is weighing 2026 endorsements.","Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, left, and Sen. Bernie Sanders raise their arms after addressing supporters during a rally for El-Sayed on Aug. 5, 2018, in Detroit. File photo by Carlos Osorio/AP
This story by Torrie Herrington was first published in NOTUS on Nov. 24, 2025.
A Bernie Sanders endorsement doesn’t always mean a primary win — some voters might even see it as a red flag. But for progressive and populist candidates, the Vermont senator’s stamp of approval can be a major boost.
So how does Sanders determine which candidates to back?
It comes down to values, strategy and who wants it, a spokesperson for Sanders’ campaign arm told NOTUS.
“Sen. Sanders is always interested in working with progressive candidates who are running strong grassroots campaigns, prepared to work hard, and want to challenge establishment status quo. He doesn’t endorse any candidate unless they want his endorsement,” Anna Bahr, communications director for Sanders, said in a statement to NOTUS.
For the 2026 election cycle, Sanders has endorsed three Democratic Senate candidates: Graham Platner in Maine, Abdul El-Sayed in Michigan and Peggy Flanagan in Minnesota. For the House, he is backing Randy Villegas in California, Robert Peters in Illinois, Donavan McKinney in Michigan, Bob Brooks in Pennsylvania and Rebecca Cooke in Wisconsin. He also endorsed Troy Jackson for Maine governor and Keith Ellison for Minnesota attorney general.
Joe Calvello, a senior adviser for the Platner campaign, said the campaign reached out for an endorsement because Platner has been a longtime supporter of Sanders. He said they were “extremely grateful” for the endorsement, which came at a “Fight the Oligarchy” rally in Portland, Maine, on Labor Day.
“To be able to do a big event with him in Portland was really special, to do that right when our campaign was getting off the ground,” said Calvello, who is also a former Sanders adviser.
In the 2024 election cycle, Sanders endorsed seven people in congressional races, five of whom lost their primary elections and two who went on to win in the general: Reps. Ilhan Omar and Summer Lee. On the state legislature level, Sanders endorsed four people in 2024, three of whom won.
Sanders-backed candidates have won big this year, particularly New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who received a Sanders endorsement in June in the Democratic primary. (The Mamdani campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the endorsement.)
In 2025, Sanders also endorsed Rep. Adelita Grijalva, who won her special election in Arizona, and he endorsed Susan Crawford, who won the general election for the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
The only person Sanders endorsed who lost in 2025 was Joshua Weil in the special election for the U.S. House in Florida’s 6th Congressional District.
“I can tell you, talking to individuals who worked for Zohran Mamdani, who just won the mayoral race, they will tell you that when Sanders endorsed Mamdani, that had a huge impact on his support,” said Matthew Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College in Vermont. “That legitimized him as a voice of the progressive left. So it can certainly have a big impact.”
He described an endorsement from Sanders as a “powerful tool.”
“Sanders is probably the individual with the most clout who represents that side of the Democratic Party, along with AOC,” Dickinson said of the senator and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “His endorsement, I think for that reason, might potentially carry more weight going forward, because the Democratic Party is searching for a winning message.”
That’s not to say it’s always a good thing. Dickinson said that for “people who don’t share Bernie’s opinions — it’s not going to have much impact on them. If anything, it might polarize them to oppose the candidate.”
El-Sayed told NOTUS he reached out to Sanders when he was thinking about getting into the race for Michigan’s open Senate seat. El-Sayed said he and Sanders have a “long relationship” — the senator also endorsed him in a failed 2018 bid for governor.
“As I was thinking about running, I certainly sought his counsel and his support. And I’m really grateful that he offered both,” El-Sayed said.
He said he hoped that he could be a senator in the mold of Sanders.
“Bernie has been fighting for working people his entire career, since before I was born, and that he sees that fight in this campaign … that means a lot to me,”El-Sayed said. “I look forward to carrying forward that kind of leadership and the work on behalf of working people in the U.S. Senate, hopefully, when I get to join him.”
A spokesperson for Flanagan, who is facing Rep. Angie Craig in Minnesota’s U.S. Senate primary, said Sanders’ endorsement shows off her progressive bona fides.
“Folks from across the country trust Bernie Sanders because of his unwavering commitment to working people, so his stamp of progressive approval means a lot to the movement Peggy is building,” campaign spokesperson Alexandra Fetissoff said in a statement to NOTUS.
Sen. Peter Welch, who represents Vermont alongside Sanders, was endorsed by Sanders when he launched his Senate bid in 2021.
“It was very helpful,” Welch said. “Bernie is one of the few senators whose endorsement has a lot of punch.”

(Photo courtesy of Entergy Louisiana)Entergy Louisiana began construction Monday on a pair of gas power plants that will generate electricity for what will be the world’s largest data center.
Entergy Corp., the largest investor-owned utility company in the state, announced it broke ground on its Franklin Farms Power Station project in Richland Parish. The company disseminated a photo from the groundbreaking ceremony showing a group of politicians, regulators and corporate executives digging into a box of sand at the construction site. 
The facility will power a massive $27 billion data center Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is building. It will feature two natural gas-powered plants able to generate about 1,500 megawatts of electricity, many times more than what the sparsely populated farming community of Richland Parish consumes. 
Proposed less than a year ago, the fast-paced power project received expedited approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission in August. New power plants of similar type typically go through several years of planning and hearings before construction begins. 
Construction on Meta’s largest data center brings 600% crash spike, chaos to rural Louisiana

The new power plant complex is being built specifically for the data center, though it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could supply power to other customers. 
Construction on the data center itself is also underway, bringing loads of new workers and traffic to the normally sleepy Richland Parish. 
The Franklin Farms project, which is expected to come online in late 2028, is not the only power station Entergy is building for the data center. Entergy plans to build a third plant at its Waterford nuclear power plant site in St. Charles Parish, with an expected operational date by the end of 2029. 
Together, all three gas plants will be able to generate approximately 2,200 megawatts of electricity, which is more than twice the capacity of the entire city of New Orleans, according to the Alliance for Affordable Energy.
“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” Entergy Louisiana CEO Phillip May said in a news release. “By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.”

Vermont is among many federal districts where President Donald Trump has not nominated a U.S. attorney for confirmation through the U.S. Senate.

The U.S. Department of Justice lists the top prosecutor position in Vermont as vacant, but the person who has been running that office for nearly a year said he is running the show.
The situation in Vermont is not unique, and has led to confusion and court cases around the country regarding who is legally carrying out federal law. 
Michael Drescher — a longtime federal prosecutor in Vermont — has held the post of acting U.S. attorney for Vermont since President Donald Trump took office in January.
U.S. attorneys are responsible for prosecuting federal crimes and immigration law as well as representing the United States in civil matters. 
Drescher’s title changed from “acting” last month but he wasn’t named to the U.S. attorney post on a permanent basis by Trump, which would have required Senate confirmation.
Instead, Drescher is listed as “First Assistant U.S. Attorney” in press releases issued by his office. In an email to VTDigger, Drescher stated, “I am still leading the office.” 
He did not respond to a followup email seeking answers to why the change was made, or who made the decision. 
The U.S. Department of Justice, headed by U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, did not respond to a request for comment. 
“There is a lot of confusion around the use of ‘interim,’ ‘acting’ and ‘first assistant’,” said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who tracks U.S. attorney and judicial nominations.
“From my perspective, it’s avoiding what the Constitution requires, which is advice and consent of the Senate,” he said of the naming of U.S. attorneys. “In Trump 2.0 they’ve played fast and loose with that, and this is another example of it.” 
Tobias said it’s difficult to say for certain why Trump doesn’t simply nominate a U.S. attorney for Vermont and go through the U.S. Senate confirmation process. 
It’s possible, Tobias said, that the president doesn’t want to go through that process or fears that nominee’s confirmation wouldn’t be successful, or that he hasn’t found someone he wants to formally name to the post permanently.
Tobias said he also didn’t know the exact number of times during the Trump administration that an acting U.S. attorney for a federal district has later been named first assistant U.S. attorney to lead an office. 
“I can’t tell you how many places this has happened, but it has happened,” he said, adding that many other districts are overseen by either acting or interim U.S. attorneys.
In only about 20 of the 94 federal districts, Tobias said, has a U.S. attorney gone through the U.S. Senate confirmation process during Trump’s current administration. 
It’s difficult to determine from the U.S. Department of Justice website exactly how many interim, acting, first assistants and Senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys are leading federal districts. 
In addition to Vermont, the only other federal district listed on the website as vacant is the Western District of Pennsylvania. That office, like Vermont’s, is also now headed by a person with the title of first assistant U.S. attorney, according to the website.
The main difference between an acting and interim U.S. attorney revolves around how long a person can stay in the post with that title, Tobias said, with the acting title allowing for a longer period of time. 
According to federal law and rules, an interim U.S. attorney can generally serve for 120 days, while an acting U.S. attorney can generally serve for 210 days. There is no such limit for a person serving as first assistant U.S. attorney. 
It’s unclear of the exact repercussions if a person stays longer in the post than they are allowed by their title, Tobias said, and whether any cases they oversee could be invalidated.
“It has to be raised and litigated,” Tobias said, adding that there have been cases challenging the authority of specific prosecutors around the country in other federal district courts that had reached varying rulings.
The person holding the first assistant title, he said, is usually the second in command in a U.S. attorney’s office. However, Tobias said, when there is no Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney or acting or interim U.S. attorney for an office, an argument could be made that the first assistant would then be in charge since technically the top post would be vacant.
“I think that’s the kind of fast and loose stuff,” he said.
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, could not be reached for comment.
During the last Trump administration, Christina Nolan was nominated by the president to serve as the U.S. attorney for Vermont and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in November 2017. She left the post in 2021 following President Joe Biden’s election.
Nikolas Kerest had served as the U.S. attorney for Vermont throughout most of the Biden administration but resigned in January after Trump was elected president.

The record federal government shutdown may be over, but the dysfunction to which it gave rise and helped spur continues to plague North Carolina. Here in our state alone, millions of average people who have long relied upon government structures and services to help make basics like health care and access to food more affordable are suddenly confronting dire situations.
Whether it’s Medicaid, Affordable Care Act Marketplace health insurance policies or SNAP food assistance, recent actions of the Trump administration and its congressional allies are causing havoc for people living on the edge. What’s more, as we learned in a recent conversation with North Carolina State Senator Natalie Murdock of Chatham and Durham Counties, Republican leaders in the North Carolina General Assembly, who could be taking action to ease the confusion and suffering, have instead chosen inaction.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted unanimously Monday to modify its order imposing a number of requirements on the Madison city clerk’s office due to the loss of nearly 200 absentee ballots in the 2024 election. 
In August, the commission ordered the city to make a number of changes to its election practices in an effort to prevent the loss of future ballots. 
The original order requires the city to develop an internal plan delineating which employee is responsible for statutorily required tasks, change the absentee ballot processing system so bags and envelopes aren’t lost, update instructional materials for poll workers and complete a full inspection of all materials before the scheduled board of canvassers meeting after an election. 
In a special meeting on Monday, the commission voted 6-0 to approve a request from newly appointed clerk Clerk Lydia McComas to modify a section of the order about the timing of printing and preparing poll books. 
Under the original order, Madison is required to print its poll books no earlier than the Tuesday before an election and must arrange to receive those books no later than the Friday before the election. 
McComas told the commission in a memo that the city had found a vendor that could print the poll books on the Friday before an election and deliver them by the Sunday before the election. This would allow the final printed poll books to include as many absentee ballots as possible, limiting the number of absentee ballots that are returned after the poll books are printed. 
In her memo, McComas wrote that the modification would allow the city to achieve its “shared goal” with the commission of reducing “the chance of human error.”

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska State Auditor Mike Foley has called out a state agency for allowing “outrageous” dysfunction in a publicly funded program that provides personal assistance to people with disabilities.
In an 11-page letter Monday to Steve Corsi, chief executive of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, Foley’s team alleged “ongoing financial abuse” in the personal assistance services (PAS) program that helps Medicaid-eligible Nebraskans with mobility, hygiene and housekeeping.
“Numerous PAS caregivers continue to milk the program with false, inflated and duplicate billings,” Foley said, adding that the alarm to DHHS was his office’s third since February 2024.

He said DHHS “oversight failures may, in fact, be feeding the problem — effectively setting the stage for some truly mind boggling improprieties, financial and otherwise.”
Information uncovered by the audit team was forwarded to law enforcement for review of possible legal violations.
 Energizer bunny?

In one case, the auditors said, a caregiver had been authorized to deliver 66 hours of personal assistance services a week despite holding down a full-time job as a school bus driver. Auditors identified 28 days during which the caregiver billed DHHS for performing client services at the exact times she was documented to have been driving students. 










(DHHS) oversight failures may, in fact, be feeding the problem — effectively setting the stage for some truly mind boggling improprieties, financial and otherwise.


– Nebraska State Auditor Mike Foley



In another example, Foley described a personal caregiver who billed DHHS for 70 days of client services while working full-time for a family counseling business. He said that created an “impossible scenario” of the caregiver working more than 24 hours in each of 45 days during a three-month period reviewed. 
“Some of these caregivers claim to be performing work schedules that would make the Energizer Bunny look like a slacker,” said Foley. 
That caregiver had tapped into other public programs as well, including the larger personal care services (PCS) budget and foster care. Particularly troubling to the auditor was that the caregiver in that case provided help to two adult clients who lived in her home. And one, a relative, was on the sex offender registry for having been convicted of felony sex trafficking of children in 2014. Living in the home as well, said Foley, was a 14-year-old girl in the state foster care system.
He said the caregiver appeared to have been purposefully deceitful in failing to disclose to foster care agencies that the past offender lived in the house. In seeking personal care aid, the provider reportedly claimed the relative lived in a backyard “cabin,” for which cleaning was authorized.
“When the audit team reported this bizarre and unsafe domestic arrangement, DHHS removed the foster child from the home,” Foley said.
The findings surfaced during the ongoing statewide annual audit and were reported to Corsi early due to “urgent need for corrective action,” the letter said.
For fiscal year 2025, PAS expenses totaled $10.5 million, of which the federal government covers 60% of costs and the state pays 40%. The PCS program has the same federal-state split for a much larger budget. Foley said the Monday letter aimed mostly at the PAS program.
Revelations outlined in the Monday letter were based on a review of four care providers and one 10-client agency that deals with high dollar amounts. Of the fraction reviewed, the auditing team found about $19,300 in questionable spending.
 ‘Increasingly egregious’

Another of the examples cited by Foley was a caregiver authorized by DHHS to be paid for 118 hours of service per week, split across three separate clients. Two were her parents, who did not live with her.
“This would require the provider to perform services for more than 16 hours every day of the week,” the team noted in the report, calling that authorization unreasonable.

Foley said he is convinced that a more thorough combing would lead to “a whole lot more” problems. His concern was heightened by an ongoing pattern, he said. Monday’s letter is the latest in a series of communications to DHHS over the past decade alleging potential fraud and other issues that, according to Foley, “appear to have grown increasingly egregious.”
DHHS leadership saw the findings before the public release, and included a response in the letter.
In it, agency managers said they agree with the auditor team’s recommendations to implement procedures that ensure proper payments. They also said DHHS already has taken “significant” steps to implement controls that should mitigate most of the conditions observed by auditors.
In February, for example, the Medicaid and Long-Term Care team started requiring GPS/IVR visit verification and recipient signatures to support a claim payment.
Among other actions, the Child and Family Services will work with the Nebraska State Patrol to develop an automated process that compares addresses of foster parents with the Sex Offender Registry on a quarterly basis. The system is to help ensure no offender resides at the same address as a ward of the state. 
DHHS contacts were listed as Jeremy Brussen of Medicaid and Long-Term Care and Kathleen Stolz of Child Family Services.
 No pushback

Contacted Monday, a DHHS spokesman referred to the agency’s response in the auditor’s report, reiterating that the department agreed with recommendations and was actively implementing procedures and controls to ensure proper payment for services. 
Foley said that with “all the attention” the personal assistance program has gotten, he would have expected more progress. However, he said, he is optimistic in the ability of Corsi’s DHHS, adding that his predecessor “used to fight us on everything.”
“We’re not getting any pushback,” Foley said of the agency.

The Oklahoma School Report Cards, released Monday, graded every public school in the state. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma State Department of Education has assigned the state a D grade for academic achievement in public schools but a C in learning growth for the 2024-25 school year.
The agency on Monday released its annual Oklahoma School Report Cards, which included A-F grades for each public school and for statewide averages. 
Results of state reading and math tests, the basis of the “academic achievement” category and the No. 1 factor in a school’s overall grade, came out two months ago with more rigorous scoring. A stricter definition of “proficiency” in reading and math lowered academic achievement rates across the state.
Three fewer schools received an F grade, but grades declined overall with more schools earning a D, the Education Department reported.
Only 26% of Oklahoma students scored proficient or advanced on state reading and math tests, demonstrating they met or exceeded their grade-level expectations, the report cards show. Another 37% made a basic score, indicating partial mastery of reading and math. 
In reading, 36% of students scored below basic, and 38% scored below basic in math, suggesting they have fallen significantly behind their grade level.
However, more students improved their reading and math scores from the year before. That caused the statewide academic growth score to increase by 3% and resulted in a C grade for the growth category.
Students learning English as their non-native language also showed a slight uptick in progress. The state gave itself a B for English learner progress with 34% of these students meeting their language acquisition targets.
Another statewide B grade came from college and career exposure, known as “postsecondary opportunities.” Fifty-four percent of high school juniors and seniors completed college preparatory courses like Advanced Placement, an industry certification program, a work-based internship or a college class through dual enrollment.
The state failed to meet a goal state leaders set eight years ago to achieve a 90% high school graduation rate by 2025. The report cards show only 82% of the class of 2025 graduated in four years, and 84% of the class of 2024 and 2023 completed their high school credits in five and six years, respectively.
Potentially in its final year as a core component of the state report cards, the chronic absenteeism category showed only 80.2% of public school students maintained good attendance, defined as missing less than 10% of the school year. 
The state Legislature passed a law this year to remove student absenteeism from school evaluations starting in the 2025-26 academic year, though schools with strong attendance rates could earn bonus points. The U.S. Department of Education must approve the change for it to become official.
State lawmakers decided schools shouldn’t be penalized for students’ poor attendance, a factor they said is outside of the school’s control.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — CoreCivic is looking at all options, including the possibility of applying for a special use permit from the city of Leavenworth, a company spokesman said Monday.
After a federal judge handed the private prison company a loss in court last week, the company is reassessing its stance.
“We maintain our legal position that we should be able to lawfully operate our facility, as we’ve done for almost 30 years,” said CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin. “That said, we are assessing all available avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter for us, our stakeholders and our community, up to and including filing for the Special Use Permit.”
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse on Tuesday dismissed CoreCivic’s request to overturn an injunction that blocks the company from housing immigration detainees immediately in its Leavenworth prison.
Now, the company is considering what Leavenworth officials asked it to do in the first place — go through the city’s development process to get a special use permit.
CoreCivic has been fighting since spring with Leavenworth to reopen its private prison without going through the city’s permitting process. But the city, citing numerous issues with the way the prison was run before it closed in 2021, said CoreCivic must file for the permit.
It’s been a winding road to get to a place of possible resolution.
When Leavenworth officials told CoreCivic the company had to go through the permit process, the two ended up in court in May. There, a judge barred CoreCivic from taking immigration detainees and fulfilling its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract while state-level litigation was ongoing.
The federal government jumped into the fight in September, backing CoreCivic’s contention that Leavenworth is violating the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and accusing Leavenworth of “aggressive and unlawful interference.” That clause sets federal laws as supreme over state laws.
Crouse’s decision to deny CoreCivic’s request to overturn the injunction apparently was a turning point in the case.
“We’re pleased with the results,” said Leavenworth city manager Scott Peterson. “It went the way we certainly hoped it would.”
CoreCivic has said all along that it would “suffer irreparable injury” if the injunction were denied. 
The company in September signed a contract with ICE valued at $60 million a year to house migrant detainees at its Leavenworth facility, but the agreement doesn’t take effect until legal issues are resolved.
The new contract is for a fixed monthly amount and then additional payments based on the number of detainees held in the facility, which can house up to 1,033. It will not begin until the temporary injunction put in place by a Kansas district court is “no longer enforceable,” a CoreCivic news release said.
Peterson said the city is ready to continue work on the special permitting process with CoreCivic should the company decide to apply. CoreCivic had been four months into the process  when it decided to withdraw, he said. 
“We just want them to apply for a special use permit so that we can put together some standards that both parties agree to that we can hold CoreCivic to, which was something we thought we had agreed to prior to this whole situation,” Peterson said. 
“We were ready to go,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CoreCivic-MRRC-sign-1024x661.jpg,,,2025-12-01 17:57:30.442726

(Photo by Lori Duckworth/Courtesy of the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department)OKLAHOMA CITY – The state has sued a contractor after a fire caused damage to the Sequoyah State Park lodge and restaurant.
The Office of Management and Enterprise Services on Nov. 25 sued The Lookout Kitchen, RPW ENT, LLC, and RCC Ventures LLC on behalf of the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation.
The suit was filed in Oklahoma County District Court and alleges breach of contract and negligence and seeks more than $5 million.
The tourism agency had contracted with RPW to operate and manage restaurants in six parks, including Sequoyah State Park.
On Dec. 14, a fire at the Sequoyah Lodge caused $4.5 million in damages, according to the filing.
“Investigation into the Sequoyah Lodge Fire revealed the fire originated when an RPW employee disposed of a rag containing greasy and combustible materials into a container that ultimately caught fire and spread throughout the restaurant and lodge,” the suit said.
The fire damaged substantial portions of the kitchen and hotel rooms, the suit said.
Tourism officials said in July that the lodge, which has 104 rooms, had reopened in May. In a Facebook post at the time of the fire, the local volunteer fire department said the fire had been contained to the kitchen and dining area and nobody had been injured.
The contract required the restaurant contractor to obtain insurance, which it failed to do, the lawsuit said.
A spokesperson for The Lookout Kitchen could not be reached for comment Monday.
In July, JP Wilson, the owner of The Lookout Kitchen, told Oklahoma Voice that the restaurant was insured and the damage was minimal. He said it was up to the state to reopen the restaurant, which it had not done seven months later.  
That same month, the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation announced that the restaurants in six parks were closed due to a contract dispute with The Lookout Kitchen. The restaurants reopened but closed again permanently in September.
The lawsuit marks the second time since 2022 that the state has sued a vendor it hired to run state park restaurants. 
In 2022, the agency canceled its contract with Swadley’s Foggy Bottom Kitchen and sued the company, seeking to recoup millions for breach of contract.
Swadley’s counter sued, arguing the state owes it nearly $2.6 million.
In 2024, the state’s multicounty grand jury indicted three people, including Swadley’s founder Ronald Brent Swadley, in connection with the controversial state contract to operate park restaurants. 
Swadley and the two others pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the state and five counts of presenting false or fraudulent claims against the state.
A trial is pending.

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Around 170 West Virginia National Guard members remain in the nation’s capital following the targeted shooting of Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe blocks from the White House.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey stressed that the Guard have been there on a voluntary basis assisting with President Donald Trump’s proposed crime crackdown.
“There was never any pressure … if people wanted to stay and fulfill the mission they could,” Morrisey said Monday at the state Capitol. 
One of the shooting victims, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died Thanksgiving Day, while the other, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was critically injured and remains hospitalized. Morrisey said Wolfe was able to hear and respond to a nurse, and was also able to wiggle his toes.
The governor said his administration was focused on supporting the Guard members who remain in D.C., and counseling services have been made available.
There is no known end date to the Guard members’ time in D.C., and Morrisey said there would be a periodic review of the situation to assess if people could come home for the Christmas holiday.
“I don’t think we have a specific date in mind yet,” Morrisey said. 
In August, Morrisey sent about 300 members of the state’s National Guard to D.C. at the request of the Trump administration. The remaining Guard members volunteered to remain for  the Trump administration for “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.” 
Beckstrom had volunteered to work during the Thanksgiving holiday, Morrisey said.
“I emphasize that these are people that knew the mission … I think the mission has been largely successful,” he said. “I wanted to make this voluntary, because anytime someone is doing that, there’s a lot of sacrifice that’s involved.”
In a news release Monday, the West Virginia Democratic Party called on Morrisey to clarify the scope and purpose of the ongoing deployment of Guard personnel to D.C., “particularly in light of multiple public reports documenting that Guard units — including those from West Virginia — have been assigned to landscaping, beautification, and trash-removal duties in the nation’s capital.”
“Respectfully, West Virginians deserve to know whether this deployment was designed primarily for public safety or whether our Guard was assigned work far outside its traditional responsibilities while putting themselves in harm’s way,” said Mike Pushkin, chair of the state Democratic Party. “The party expresses its deepest condolences to their families, friends, and fellow service members and asks all West Virginians to keep them in their prayers.”
Days before the shooting, a federal judge ordered an end to the monthslong National Guard deployment in  D.C., declaring that the use of troops was “unlawful.”
West Virginia Adjutant General Maj. Gen. Jim Seward said that after the Secretary of the Army extended Trump’s mission in D.C., the West Virginia National Guard was asked how many members they might be able to provide.
“We had our commander in D.C. survey the troops,” Seward said. 
Morrisey said that Guard members had the “background and training” to go to D.C.
Following the shooting, President Donald Trump requested 500 more National Guard members be sent to the city. West Virginia has not been asked to send additional guard members.
Morrisey also responded to reporters’ questions about why had to walk back a false social media post Wednesday afternoon that both Guard members had died in the shooting. He reversed course later that day, explaining that he’d received conflicting information. 
“When there’s a change, then you alert the public if there’s an error, you correct the error. That’s what happened, and that’s what we did. So, I won’t go into additional details at this time,” he said.
The suspected gunman in the incident, 29-year-old Afghan refugee Rahmanullah Lakanwal, will face a first-degree murder charge along with other charges.

Funeral details for Beckstrom haven’t been released. The governor ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in recognition of her death.
Trump said on Sunday that he invited Beckstrom’s family to the White House, adding that he spoke to her parents and they were “devastated.”
Morrisey asked for continued prayers for Wolfe as he remains in the hospital. 
“The family is going through a very difficult situation right now as Andrew fights to survive,” he said.

The push will also include phone calls encouraging constituents to contact their state senators to support redistricting. That chamber has been more reluctant to pursue redistricting.

“If Indiana does nothing, they’ll flip Congress overnight. Stopping tax cuts, letting waste, fraud and abuse pile up, and impeach Trump again. Indiana has one chance,” it continues. “Redraw the maps. Protect Hoosiers.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)LOUISVILLE — Jefferson Circuit Judge Brian Edwards once again heard arguments Monday in a three-year old court case seeking to strike down Kentucky’s abortion ban and clarify the legality of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in the state. 
Lawyers for Jessica Kalb argued that Kentucky has a patchwork of laws that could complicate their client’s ability to safely continue with the IVF process, including discarding unneeded embryos and having access to a medically-necessary abortion. 
The attorney general’s office argued that IVF is protected in state law and embryos that are not implanted in a person don’t fall under relevant homicide or abortion laws. 
Edwards initially ruled against Kalb when she was one of three Jewish women seeking to challenge Kentucky’s abortion ban on religious grounds, finding none of the women — who want to expand their families through in vitro fertilization (IVF) — had standing to challenge.

An appeals court, however, found that while the other two women do not have standing, Kalb does. That ruling then sent her back to Edwards’ court, resulting in a new round of oral arguments to hash out the case. Standing is the question of whether plaintiffs’ circumstances meet legal standards entitling them to challenge the law. 
Kalb has nine frozen embryos that she’s paying to preserve and doesn’t know how she can proceed with the IVF process under the state’s restrictions on abortion and definition of life. She also canceled having an embryo implanted in 2022 because she was unclear what interventions she would have under Kentucky’s near-total ban on abortion. 
She also has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can cause cysts to form in the ovaries and lead to infertility. This condition also means her pregnancies are more likely to end in miscarriage and that she might need an abortion or other complicated interventions.  
After Monday’s hearing, Kalb said she still wants to grow her family, and the uncertainty around the case — which was filed in October 2022, months after the United States Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion — leaves her with many questions about how she can do that. 
“This is hard. This is always hard. I’d really like it to be not still going on,” she said. “I think that everybody here wants the same thing. We all want to be able to safely have children in Kentucky. And right now, we can’t. I can’t.” 
At 35, Kalb will be considered “geriatric” in any future pregnancy. Her risk of complications increased at this age, according to the Cleveland Clinic. 
“I think that the lawyers did a fantastic job today pointing out statutes that apply to the embryos. I still think there’s a lot of kind of skew as to focusing on the non-life that exists in those petri dishes and not focusing on the life that is here: Me, my life as a mom, my daughter who deserves to have a mom,” Kalb said. “And I think that we’re still fighting the wrong fight in some capacity. We’re not really looking at the bigger issue, which is, what is motherhood? What is being a pregnant person in the state of Kentucky right now, and how do we make that safe?”  
The arguments
Lindsey Keiser argued for the Kentucky attorney general’s office — which is named as a defendant — on Monday that Kalb “can freely engage in the conduct she desires to undertake without legal consequences or fear of prosecution” when it comes to implanting and disposing embryos. 
“IVF is a procedure, in the plaintiff’s words, to assist with pregnancy, not to terminate it, and disposing of embryos that have not been implanted is not conduct to or upon a pregnant woman,” Keiser said. “Therefore, the Human Life Protection Act prohibitions simply do not apply.”

Kalb’s lawyers, Benjamin Potash and Aaron Kemper, have argued that Kentucky, in heavily restricting abortion, has imposed and codified a religious viewpoint that conflicts with the Jewish belief that birth, not conception, is the beginning of life.
Keiser on Monday said that the idea that life begins at conception is not inherently a religious or exclusively Christian idea. 
“Not all Christians hold that idea, and there are certainly religious groups outside of Christians who hold that idea as well,” she said. 
While speaking with reporters after the hearing, Kemper said that idea sidesteps the religious freedom point. 
“I don’t want to get into an argument about what is or is not Christianity,” he said. “We know it’s not a Jewish ideal. Our clients are Jewish, and Judaism does not define life (as beginning at) conception. And that is clear.” 
Keiser did not speak with reporters after the hearing.
Jefferson Circuit Judge Brian Edwards (jeffersoncircuitcourt.com)
Keiser, representing the attorney general, argued that the appeals court ruling that gave Kalb standing on questions about the IVF process doesn’t extend to the abortion ban. For Kalb to maintain that if she became pregnant and if a complication required her to get an abortion are “speculative” claims and “not sufficiently concrete.” 
Potash said Kalb is far from asking for a “carte blanche” to do whatever she wants. She’s asking the court for a “pretty precise, limited remedy,” he said. 
As it stands now, Kemper said after the hearing, people like Kalb have a “pinky promise that they won’t prosecute” and that the attorney general is asking citizens to “‘just have faith my (successor) will be like me,’ which is just not good enough.”
Edwards ended the hearing by saying he would “get something out as quickly as possible.”
The judge, Potash said afterward, “is taking the case very seriously, and we’re going to have a sober and reflective decision from this court, and we look forward to the next steps.”

Edwards Sr. High School started celebrating academic achievement as well as congeniality for homecoming-specific titles to motivate students to excel in their academic coursework as well as extracurriculars.","Homecoming remains an important enough tradition in the Delta that the violence that happened in Leland and Rolling Fork in October didn’t diminish the crowds. Relatives still traveled home. Dozens still set up grills and canopies at games. Mississippi Today produced a collection of stories of homecoming events in the Delta, where traditions have evolved over time.
RULEVILLE — Trumpets blared through the hallways of Thomas E. Edwards Sr. High School. Three administrators, including one who was pregnant, dashed down the green-and-white tiled hallway toward the auditorium.
“What happened to the grannies with the sewing kits in their bags?” one asked, out of breath.
Homecoming Queen Jaiilah Holmes would need to make her entrance soon, but her dress was coming apart at the shoulders. The rest of the homecoming court was already announced and seated. The emcee was stalling.
Down the hall from the gym, in a classroom with algebraic equations scrawled on the white board, an administrator and a teacher were helping repair the queen’s regalia.

Jazlyn Hopkins, Jaiilah’s mother, bent in black gladiator sandals to adjust her daughter’s tiara. The teen blushed, projecting a wide smile. She shimmered in a white dress with a silver floral pattern down both sides and a bodice encrusted with imitation pearls.
Trumpeting resumed as Hopkins and a teacher trailed the queen, carrying her six-inch train. 
The gym lights flicked off. The crowd cheered.
Jaiilah emerged from behind thick curtains in a glimmering gown wired with a green light.
The house lights revealed what a party supply company billed as a Venetian masquerade scene. White construction paper covered the floor, and black palm trees framed the space. Two black thrones perched atop a raised platform where the teen royals took their seats before dozens of clear banquet chairs. Girls in black gowns wore sashes that read Miss Psychology, Miss Drug Education and Miss Algebra I.
An incentive to achieve
In the last decade, the school started celebrating academic achievement as well as congeniality for homecoming-specific titles to motivate students to excel in their academic coursework as well as extracurriculars. Now, most of the 40 categories for the homecoming court recognize excellence in an academic course, giving many students a chance to wear a sash or crown.
“It starts something big,” school resource officer Lafagus Carpenter said about how the titles motivate students. “They start feeling like they got some work to them. They start seeing what they can be.”

Nikita Foster was most proud that her son Thomas won homecoming king because of his academic performance and involvement in athletics and other activities. She adjusted the crown atop his head as he powered on his phone outside the gym. He had thick dreadlocks that wouldn’t accommodate the sparkling headwear. 
Through dual enrollment, Thomas is a high school senior and a sophomore at Mississippi Delta Community College. He hopes to enter the University of Southern Mississippi as a junior kinesiology major and, after graduating, work as an exercise scientist.
“It’s just like a sense of peace and happiness to see them grow up,” Foster said. “I’m so proud.”
Monthslong planning for a royal touch
Many homecoming attendees and title holders prepare their outfits and campaigns months in advance. Edwards High previously boasted pyrotechnics as part of the homecoming display in the gym, contracting with a local decorator who made use of her contacts.
Jazlyn Hopkins had a designer in nearby Indianola make a custom dress for her daughter. She wanted her daughter to feel “glamorous.”
By the time the designer, Chezzrae Fowler Parker, began working on Jaiilah’ dress in September, other parents started calling about her custom gowns. A photograph of a lapis dress she made for a Gentry High School senior last spring lingered in some of their minds, and on their social media timelines.

The night of homecoming, administrators connected the clasps on the flowing gold and emerald robes worn by the king, Antwan Brinkley, and Jaiilah, the queen. They initiated a dance to the R & B record, “Hey Girl.” The attendants followed the steps of a choreographed waltz.
The evening ended with speeches from the king and queen, and announcements from principal Errick Lakes.
Elementary and middle school boys in black-and-grey patterned tuxedo jackets and Venetian masks met their families outside. Blown-up photos of King Thomas and Queen Jaiilah were unfurled at the back auditorium entrance.
Parents and neighbors captured the queen’s prance down the black carpet. Their focus was kept until the last beat. When the pageant came to a close, spectators fumbled through their purses and pockets for their car keys and made the rounds of relatives and former classmates.
The Edwards High parking lot was full by the court’s last dance. Cars were parked wherever people could find a spot, sometimes diagonally in front of double parked vehicles. Some slipped out of the gym early to avoid the rush of sedans and trucks — and the possibility of a fender-bender.
One mother gave directions to a cousin unaccustomed to squeezing out of a tight parking spot. 
“It’s a town of 2,000. It never gets this packed,” she said.
The car eased out, nearly nicking a Pontiac sedan and illuminated parents and attendants with its crimson taillights. Engines roared, and teen queens in floor-length gowns lifted their hoop skirts off the dirt road home.

The state expects to receive $6 million from the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program, a $42 billion initiative included in the infrastructure bill passed under the Biden administration. The funding will be awarded to a pair of local internet carriers, BEK and Midco, to install fiber connections to the last 279 locations in the state without access to high-speed internet. 
North Dakota would become the first state in the nation to provide 100% access to broadband internet. The final connections are expected to be completed by 2028, though it may be sooner depending on construction timelines.
The achievement will be the culmination of decades of work and investment by local carriers to create a broadband network across the state.
“We’re helping them bring in the final percent,” said Brian Newby, director of the North Dakota Information Technology’s broadband program. “The 99% was all the sweat and financial risk that they took over the last 20 years.”
The 279 locations that remain unconnected to high-speed internet as of mid-2025 are scattered across the state, though many are located near Cass County, that likely face geographic obstacles like river crossings, Newby said. 
“While we’re incredibly proud that North Dakota is widely recognized as one of the best-
connected states in the country, our main focus has always been on our citizens,” said Corey Mock, North Dakota’s chief information officer. “This approval represents a major leap forward in achieving universal connectivity.”
The milestone will mean high-speed internet access will be available as an option throughout the state. But not all North Dakotans will automatically benefit. Approximately 16% of North Dakota households do not subscribe to a broadband internet service, according to 2020 census data cited in the state’s 2023 plan for the federal funding. 
While affordability can be a factor, a National Telecommunications and Information Administration survey has shown the bulk of those who do not pay for high-speed internet access don’t see a need for it. 
Three of the North Dakota counties with the lowest broadband subscription rates as of 2023 were Benson, Sioux and Sheridan counties. 
U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., views the federal government’s approval of the funding plan to be key to the state’s future. 
“Not only does approval of North Dakota’s final proposal unlock new opportunities across the state, that’s a given, but it really opens the door to a more connected future which is everything,” Cramer said in a statement.
Cramer and Newby emphasized that much of the credit for North Dakota’s robust broadband network is owed to the local providers that have built it out over the years.
“They did a lot of personal investment, took a lot of risks, maybe as long as 20 years ago, the co-ops and the local exchange carriers, to get North Dakota to a place where they only have a few hundred left at this point,” Newby said. “We’re facilitating the funds to get to the carriers, which is very important, but it’s really not meant in any way to overshadow the huge accomplishment that they’ve done.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird announced Monday that Iowa, alongside three other states, has reached a settlement agreement allowing state officials to access a federal immigration database to verify citizenship status of voters for the next 20 years.
Bird, as well as Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, were plaintiffs in the case alongside officials from Florida, Ohio and Indiana. The lawsuit challenged the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which contains the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, for allegedly withholding information unlawfully about people registered to vote in states including Iowa that were flagged by state officials for potentially not having U.S. citizenship.
Bird celebrated the agreement as a way to ensure Iowa elections’ integrity.

“Only American citizens can vote in Iowa elections,” Bird said in a statement. “This agreement with the Trump Administration will help Iowa safeguard the integrity of our elections for years to come by preventing an illegal vote to cancel out the vote of Iowa citizens.”
Bird and Pate filed their lawsuit on this issue in December 2024, shortly after the 2024 general election. Two weeks before the Nov. 5, 2024 election, Pate issued guidance to Iowa county auditors to challenge the ballots of 2,176 registered voters who were identified by the Secretary of State’s office as potential noncitizens, as they had reported to the state Department of Transportation or another government entity that they were not U.S. citizens in the past 12 years and went on to register to vote.
Pate said the call to challenge these voters’ ballots was necessary because USCIS, under former President Joe Biden’s administration, denied the state permission to verify the citizenship status through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database. While federal officials confirmed at a federal court hearing in 2024 there were at least 250 people registered to vote in Iowa who appeared to be noncitizens, but did not share further information with Iowa officials.
The Iowa Attorney General’s office said in a news release that DHS had told the Iowa secretary of state, “Iowa had hundreds of noncitizens on our voter rolls, but they would not tell us who they were, nor grant us access to the database that would give us the information.”
In March, Pate said his office gained access to the SAVE database and found 277 of the 2,176 people flagged to have their 2024 ballots challenged were confirmed to not have U.S. citizenship — just under 12% of the individuals identified as potential noncitizens. Voting or registering to vote as a noncitizen in U.S. elections is a felony in Iowa, punishable by up to five years in prison and fines of $750 to $7,500.
With the DHS settlement agreement, reached with the department and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem under the Trump administration, Iowa and other states will retain access to SAVE for 20 years through a binding agreement. The AG’s office wrote: “Iowa will have free access to the cutting-edge technology necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting in Iowa elections” under the agreement.
The Iowa Secretary of State’s office reported Iowa will be one of four states participating in a pilot program with DHS under the settlement, receiving “expanded access” to the SAVE database while also providing more information to the federal system through bulk uploads “which allows election officials to upload batch data, including Social Security numbers, to verify SAVE information against voter registration lists.”
According to the settlement, the state of Iowa will gain access to SAVE within 90 days of the Dec. 1 agreement, meaning the state will be able to use the database for voter citizenship verification during the 2026 primary and general elections.
During the 2025 legislative session, Gov. Kim Reynolds also signed a law allowing the Secretary of State’s office to contract with federal and state agencies as well as private entities for voter roll verification and maintenance. Pate said the law will give his office better access to tools like SAVE and other resources to verify registered voters’ eligibility to participate in Iowa elections. The measure also creates a process to set a voter’s registration status as “unconfirmed” when state or county officials have received “reliable” information that the person is not qualified to vote. It also allows registered voters to be challenged over their citizenship status at the polls.
Pate said in a statement Monday the agreement provides his office with “another layer of election integrity and protection — the ability to audit our lists and ensure only eligible voters are registered to vote and voting in Iowa elections.”
“Protecting the integrity of Iowa elections and ensuring only eligible Iowa voters participate in Iowa elections continue to be priorities of our office, as does encouraging voter participation from every eligible Iowa voter,” Pate said. “We continue to take additional steps to audit Iowa’s voter lists and verify that the information is correct and up to date. The SAVE program provides us with critical information, but we must also continue to utilize information from other state and federal partners to maintain clean and accurate lists.”

The Pride Center of Vermont, which announced in October it was closing its doors, has received a $350,000 anonymous donation that will help it reopen.
In announcing the financial contribution, the organization stated that the donation will not mean an immediate reviving of the group’s operations, but instead will allow it “breathing room” to develop and implement a sustainable path moving forward. 
The Burlington-based organization’s board of directors revealed news of the “transformation gift” in a statement last week.

“This is a pivotal moment to reimagine the Pride Center of Vermont’s future: a necessary reset to confront long-standing structural challenges, repair internal systems, and rebuild trust after years of operating in crisis mode,” the board said in the statement.
“Instead of rushing to restore the status quo,” the statement added, “we are intentionally taking this moment to design a stronger, healthier and more community-rooted organization.”
The Pride Center, one of the state’s largest organizations supporting the LGBTQ+ community, announced in October it was shutting down after 26 years, citing a lack of state and federal funding. At the time, the organization said the closure was not intended to be permanent, as the board was working to raise the roughly $350,000 it needed to resume operations.
Some community organizations have helped provide some of the support and programming the Pride Center had done in the past, such as its SafeSpace Anti-Violence Program support hotline, which continues operation at the Vermont Network.
Following news of the $350,000 anonymous donation, the Pride Center of Vermont stated it will work to address debt, invest in a comprehensive community needs assessment and develop “a strategic plan that reflects a clear vision and timeline” for when it will reopen.
“This work will take time,” the organization’s board said in its statement. “Once the new strategic framework and budget are finalized, we will announce a clear plan and timeline for reopening. In the meantime, we are committed to keeping our community informed through regular updates.”
Connor Daley, a member of the Price Center’s board, said Friday that the financial gift came through a donor-advised fund, a type of a charitable savings account that allows for giving over time while also providing certain tax advantages and anonymity protections. 
In this case, Daley said, the organization does not know the donor’s identity.
Now, Daley said, the work will begin on developing a strategy to reopen by working with stakeholders and community members to determine what kind of support and programming the organization should provide.
“The board is very intentionally not saying, ‘OK, here is our plan to reopen and bring back everything.’ We are not doing that,” Daley said. “Our first priority is saying, ‘What does the community actually want?’”

,DC,2025-12-01 21:35:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,White House intensifies push for mass deportation after National Guard shooting,"Ariana Figueroa, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-intensifies-push-mass-deportation-after-national-guard-shooting,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has accelerated his drive to curb legal immigration, after a native of Afghanistan who had been granted asylum was accused in a shooting in the nation’s capital that left one member of the West Virginia National Guard dead and another in critical condition.“In the wake of last week's atrocity, it is more important than ever to finish carrying out the president's mass deportation operation,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during Monday’s press briefing. “They must go back to their home countries.”The Trump administration at the beginning of the president’s second term launched an unprecedented crackdown on all forms of immigration. The deadly shooting on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday, in a commercial area of the District of Columbia just blocks from the White House, has intensified the push.The Department of Homeland Security in a social media post after the Wednesday attack called for immigrants to “remigrate,” which is a far-right concept in Europe that calls for the ethnic removal of non-white minority populations through mass migration.“There is more work to be done,” Leavitt said, “because President Trump believes that he has a sacred obligation to reverse the calamity of mass unchecked migration into our country.”The suspect in the guard shooting is a 29-year-old Afghan national who entered the country during the Biden administration through a special immigrant visa program for Afghan allies after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country in 2021. Authorities identified him as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who worked for a CIA counterterrorism operation in Afghanistan, according to the New York Times. He was granted asylum under the Trump administration earlier this year.The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia plans to charge Lakanwal with first-degree murder after one of the National Guard soldiers, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died as a result of her injuries. Still hospitalized is U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24. Trump has indicated he intends to honor both Beckstrom and Wolfe at the White House.District officials said the shooting of guard members was “targeted,” but the motive remains under investigation. Pauses on asylumLeavitt said the Trump administration will continue “to limit migration, both illegal and legal,” after the shooting.Separately on Wednesday, the administration ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 330,000 nationals from Haiti, opening them up for deportations by February. Within hours of Wednesday's shooting, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services halted all immigration requests from Afghanistan nationals. On Thursday, USCIS head Joseph Edlow announced that by direction of Trump the agency would reexamine every green card application from “every country of concern,” which are the 19 countries on the president’s travel ban list.  And by Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed all U.S. embassies to suspend all visa approvals for individuals with passports from Afghanistan. Over the weekend, Trump told reporters that those pauses on asylum could last “a long time,” although it’s unclear what authority the executive branch has to suspend a law created by Congress through the 1980 Refugee Act. This is not the first time Trump has tried to end asylum this year, as there is a legal challenge to the president barring asylum seekers from making asylum claims at U.S. ports of entry.Venezuelan boat strikesDuring Monday’s press conference, Leavitt also defended the Trump administration’s continued deadly strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela allegedly containing drugs. The attacks have been occurring since September. The president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have stated, without evidence, that the boats’ operators are narco-terrorists and that the strikes are legal, since they have taken place in international waters. Roughly 80 people have been killed in nearly two dozen attacks since September. Leavitt disputed any questions of wrongdoing by the administration during a Sept. 2 strike, when two survivors clinging to boat wreckage were allegedly killed by a follow-on strike, as first reported by The Washington Post Friday.“President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narco-terrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war,” Leavitt said, adding that Hegseth authorized a military commander to conduct the operation.However, the attacks have raised concern among members of Congress, and following the Post story, the U.S. Senate and House Armed Services committees moved to open bipartisan inquiries into the military strikes, with a focus on the alleged follow-on attack that killed two survivors. How the National Guard wound up in the districtTrump initially mobilized 800 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital in August after claiming a “crime emergency” in the district, despite a documented three-decade low in crime.Many were instructed they would be carrying service weapons, The Wall Street Journal reported on Aug. 17. The White House effort was accompanied by a heightened U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence in the district.The mobilization then became tied up in court for months.A federal district judge in the District of Columbia found the administration’s deployment of more than 2,000 guard troops in the city illegal but stayed her Nov. 20 decision for three weeks to give the administration time to appeal and remove the guard members from the district’s streets.The guard troops had been expected to remain in the district through the end of February.The administration filed an emergency motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for a stay to be issued on the order by Thursday. The administration filed the emergency motion the same day as the attack on the two National Guard members.Trump ordered an additional 500 guard members to the district following the shooting.The Joint Task Force District of Columbia has been overseeing guard operations in the district, including units from the district, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia.",,,,2025-12-01 16:58:27.765299

Before Edie Perkins heads out to explore a new trail, she runs through a mental checklist.Is there accessible parking? How far is it from her car to the trail? Is the surface hard-packed or uneven? For most people, those questions barely register. For Perkins, who uses a wheelchair, they determine whether she can venture out at all.
“Exploring new places is always exciting. It can also be a little frightening…there are so many things that able-bodied people don’t understand about accessing the outdoors,” she said.  
Perkins, a lifelong cyclist who lives in South Burlington, was paralyzed from the chest down in 2017 after a car hit her while she was biking. Now she uses a wheelchair or a hand-cycle on trails. Recently, she visited the Vermont Institute of Natural Science (VINS) in Quechee, a forested campus known for its treetop boardwalk and network of accessible trails. 
VINS’s trail system was improved with support from the Upper Valley Trail Alliance (UVTA), a member of the Vermont Trail Accessibility Hub (TAH). The Hub is a statewide initiative led by the Vermont Trails & Greenways Council (VTGC), and a partnership of six organizations working to expand access to trails for people of all abilities.
“We believe forest immersion is not just for the young, fit, and able-bodied. With the help of partners like UVTA, we’ve sought to make our woods accessible to all,” said Alden Smith, executive director of VINS. 
When barriers are removed, Perkins says, everything changes.“Everything at VINS felt thoughtfully designed for accessibility without losing that wild, natural feel. The paths are subtle, the views are incredible, and the experience left me grinning ear to ear…the sense of peace was exactly what I’d hoped for, ” Perkins wrote in a post she recently wrote about VINS for Trail Finder. 
More and more trail managers are hearing from their communities that they want more nature-based places where they can bring family members of all abilities. That rising demand is shaping the work ahead.


The outdoor access gap
While Vermont is rich in trails, mountains, and scenic landscapes, when the Hub launched in 2024, there was limited, incomplete information online about accessible trails.  
Trail Finder, managed by UVTA and maintained by Hub partner Community Geographics, is one of the few map-based trail databases in Vermont focused on accessibility. The free-to-use website helps trail-seekers to discover diverse, four-season trails across Vermont. 
With recent grant funding, the team has added or improved descriptions and maps for over 60 trails covering 125 miles, and continues to add routes of all types, from rail trails to adaptive mountain biking. Website users can click the “Access(ible) Experience” search filter to find trails that offer greater levels of access. 
“Trail managers regularly contact the Hub and UVTA for help understanding how to update their trails,” Russell Hirschler of UVTA said, “The steady flow of inquiries shows that communities want to make improvements; they just need guidance to do it well.”
It’s critical work, as Vermont Department of Health data shows one in four residents has a disability, and nearly 28 percent are over age 60, making Vermont the fourth-oldest state in the country. 
Hub partner Vermont Adaptive has seen a 350% increase in demand for its inclusive sports and recreational programming over the past decade. 
Expanding accessible trails isn’t just about recreation; it’s about community health, inclusion, and quality of life for everyone, from parents with strollers to older adults and people recovering from injury. 
“When we talk about trails, we’re really talking about people,” says Sharon Plumb, program manager for VTGC. “Who gets to be here? Who feels welcome? What can we do to say yes to more people?”

A statewide movement to make trails welcoming for all
As awareness of accessibility needs has grown, funders are increasingly taking notice. 
In 2024, the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation’s Vermont Outdoor Recreation Economic Collaborative (VOREC) introduced an “Equity” track to its Community Grant Program, awarding grants to nine municipalities and organizations focused specifically on improving trail accessibility. Program staff say they’ve also seen an uptick in applications seeking funding to build or upgrade accessible trails.
A VOREC Community Grant supported the Hub from June 2024 through December 2025. The $644,000 award, the largest grant VOREC has ever issued, helped expand accessibility work statewide. VOREC administers Vermont’s federal Recreation Trails Program (RTP), aligning national funding with local priorities.
Since 2024, the Hub has completed 55 trail accessibility assessments with more than 30 organizations to evaluate pedestrian, aquatic, and adaptive mountain biking routes. These assessments identify the specific improvements needed to enhance access or meet established accessibility standards.
The appetite for this technical support continues to grow. When the Vermont Land Trust hosted an accessible trail-building training at Pratt Refuge in Duxbury in fall 2025, 15 trail managers attended, some traveling more than an hour, to learn directly from Hub partners about design, maintenance, and assessment. Interest in trainings like this routinely exceeds capacity, underscoring the level of guidance communities are seeking.
“The enthusiasm and support we’ve received from TAH has helped keep accessibility as a priority for our organization,” said Jenna O’Donnell, executive director of the South Hero Land Trust. With recommendations from an assessment funded by TAH, the group recently updated its Recreation Park with a new boardwalk and plans to upgrade additional trails for accessibility by 2026.
Across Vermont, this work is reshaping familiar places, many funded by VOREC’s Community Grant Program. Accessible routes now exist or are in progress at several Vermont Land Trust-owned properties, including Brewster Uplands in Cambridge and Pratt Refuge in Duxbury. 
Projects with Vermont Huts & Trails at Chittenden Brook in the Green Mountain Forest near Rochester and the newly acquired Historic Goodell House at Little River State Park in Waterbury will add accessible overnight and day-use options. 
Towns like Lunenburg and Randolph, along with groups such as Northwoods Stewardship Center and Tucker Mountain Forest, are advancing new pedestrian trail designs.With support from Hub partners, including The Vermont Mountain Bike Association and The Northern Forest Canoe Trail, upgrades are being made to dozens of mountain biking trails and aquatic access points.
 Russ Hirschler and Randy Richardson of UVTA meet with South Hero Land Trust Executive Director Guy Maguire and UVM Intern Lilian Mae Olson to decide what can be done to improve the Rec Park trail in South Hero. 
Building accessibility with, not for
The Hub’s success stems from collaboration and the idea of “building accessibility with, not for.” 
People with disabilities are more than test users; they’re leaders, assessors, and storytellers. The Hub has paid adaptive athletes to help review trails and share firsthand experiences through case studies, audio stories, and webinars.
New Hub resource pages provide detailed information on how to build accessible pedestrian trails, mountain biking trails, and aquatic entry points, along with their benefits. 
At the recent Vermont Conference on Parks, Trails, and Recreation, 15 accessibility workshops featured partners including the Vermont Center for Independent Living, adaptive athletes, and a deaf trail and conservation crew.
Trail managers across the state say that without the Hub’s assessments, trainings, and technical support, they wouldn’t have the confidence or the capacity to move accessibility projects forward.
“The TAH provides important resources to groups who are eager to take the next step,” said Jeff Nugent of the Windham Regional Commission. “It informs them as to what’s possible when it comes to improving their trails, and how it can be done.”

A future where everyone can get outside more
Momentum is growing. Trail managers and disability advocates are collaborating more closely than ever before, and interest in accessibility assessments continues to exceed capacity.
Many communities now have accessibility upgrades in their long-term trail plans specifically because they’ve worked with the Hub or attended a TAH-led training.
For Vermonters like Derek Flint, who is blind, progress means more places are opening up to him and his family.
“It feels like a sense of freedom being on a trail that is safe and not having to worry about falling off some steep inclines,” Derek said of the trails upgraded through the Hub partners. “Thank you for all you have done and will do in the future.”

StebbinsAs Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge continues to seek final approval to begin construction of a tunnel project intended to replace an exposed section of pipeline running through the Great Lakes, environmentalists gathered on Monday to share a report detailing how much the line’s failure could cost Michigan taxpayers. 
Oil and Water Don’t Mix, a coalition of organizations committed to securing a shutdown of the Line 5 dual pipelines running through the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet, collected multiple analyses from over the past nine years into a single document to highlight the risks and potential costs of an oil spill.
Line 5 transports up to 22.68 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids through the Straits of Mackinac each day, with one University of Michigan researcher pointing to the region as the worst place for a Great Lakes Oil Spill. 
“The proposed Line 5 tunnel is not just an environmental risk, but it’s a massive financial threat to the people of Michigan” Sean McBrearty, the campaign coordinator for Oil and Water Don’t Mix, told reporters.
Risk-Report-Line-5
 
While arguments against the tunnel project have largely been focused on the environmental impacts, McBrearty said the conversation has not addressed the costs taxpayers could face should the tunnel fail.
After gaps in the pipelines’ protective coating were discovered in 2014, Enbridge would reach an agreement with the state to build a utility tunnel beneath the lakebed aimed at containing any potential oil spills.
However, the report points to language in the 2018 agreement between Enbridge and the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority, created by former Gov. Rick Snyder to oversee the construction of the tunnel, noting the authority will “accept ownership of the Tunnel.”
“Ownership can be transferred to the state of Michigan through the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority,” McBrearty said. “That means that Michigan taxpayers, not Enbridge, could be responsible for the catastrophic … cleanup, water system repairs, tourism losses, public health emergencies and multibillion dollar infrastructure disruptions if something goes wrong.”










The proposed Line 5 tunnel is not just an environmental risk, but it's a massive financial threat to the people of Michigan.


–  Sean McBrearty, the campaign coordinator for Oil and Water Don’t Mix


Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy also pointed to the tunnel agreements, noting that the company has agreed to “defend, indemnify, protect and hold harmless the Authority and the State of Michigan, and all of its officers, officials, agents, contractors providing expert advice to the [Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority], and employees” from any liability tied to the design, operation or maintenance of the tunnel and the replacement pipeline segment housed within. 
“The bottom line is this: Enbridge takes full responsibility and pays for all costs related to any incident anywhere along our system. Under the terms of our easement, the State of Michigan is fully indemnified from any costs associated with our operations,” Duffy said in a statement. “The 2018 agreements with the State also require us to maintain the financial tools and resources necessary to cover incident response and clean-up costs, and we certify our financial strength to the State of Michigan.”
However, the report raises questions about Enbridge’s ability to cover the cost of a major spill, pointing to a 2019 analysis by American Risk Management Resources Network, LLC on behalf of the Department of Attorney General, Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.
As of August 2019, Enbridge’s Canadian parent company, Enbridge Inc. had the financial resources to cover $1.87 billion in damages tied to a Line 5 oil spill, with the analysis placing that “on the low end” of the potential cost of a major release.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the analysis advises against accepting the parent company’s assets as proof of financial assurance, noting that only the company’s subsidiaries – Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership, Enbridge Energy Company, Inc. and Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. – are signatories on the agreement, and subject to the indemnity agreement. 
Should these subsidiaries go bankrupt, taxpayers are left to foot the bill, Oil and Water Don’t Mix argues in the report. 
Additionally, Enbridge’s liability insurance covers $940 million, the report notes, while the federal oil spill trust fund covers $1 billion, leaving the state to cover at least $3.6 billion when using a 2018 projection from Michigan State University’s Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, which places the damage from a Line 5 oil spill at $5.6 billion. 
“The worst case scenarios are far more costly,” McBrearty said. “Up to $45 billion has been identified in economic losses if the straits shipping channel shuts down. Nearly $5 billion in tourism losses alone have been identified. Hundreds of millions in water system shut down and emergency public health impacts. Decades of environmental cleanup and restoration, and all of this is before we even consider a tunnel failure which Michigan, not Enbridge, would own.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC_0161-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 16:58:27.765299

Burkman and Wohl were initially charged with actions aimed at suppressing the vote during the 2020 general election. The no contest pleas and the subsequent sentencing agreement were hashed out by the defendants’ attorneys and the Wayne County 3rd Circuit Court.
The Department of Attorney General was not involved in the agreement.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on Monday, in a statement, said that Burkman and Wohl engaged in conduct that “used every racist dog whistle – fear of incarceration, fear of the government and fear of one’s benefits being taken away – to steal the most fundamental right that we often take for granted: the right to vote.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“While on probation, if they engage in these types of criminal behaviors, they will be held to account here in Michigan,” Nessel said. “We all are aware, and this court has made these defendants aware, that continuing to engage in criminal conduct while on probation is a violation, for which the department will be ever vigilant about bringing to the attention of their probation agents and this court. If they willingly choose to engage in the types of repulsive behaviors they have gained notoriety for, this court and my department will be watching.”
Burkman and Wohl, the department said, attempted to discourage voters from participating in the general election by creating and funding a robocall targeting specific and multiple urban areas across the country, including Detroit. A news release said the calls were made in late August 2020, sent to nearly 12,000 residents with phone numbers registered to an address with a Detroit ZIP code.
Among the falsehoods the pair promoted were: misinformation about voting by mail, saying the practice could place voters’ personal information in a public database that would be used by police departments to track down individuals with outstanding warrants; that a public database would be used by credit card companies to collect outstanding debts; and that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would use vote by mail records to track individuals for mandatory vaccines.
In doing so, the calls also identified Burkman and Wohl as the source of the disinformation. The two activists, one of whom had close ties to the 2016 and 2020 campaigns of President Donald Trump, also claimed they were the founders of a civil rights organization called Project 1599. The robocall messages sent during the election included a call to predominantly Black residents to not be “finessed into giving your private information to the man. Stay safe and beware of vote by mail.”

Nessel’s office filed charges against the pair in 2020, and both were bound over for trial. A motion to quash the charges was denied, and the case was appealed up to the Michigan Supreme Court.
The state’s high court eventually remanded the case to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which determined that the alleged conduct met the statutory and constitutional thresholds to keep the charges intact.
The Michigan Supreme Court kicked it once more back to the lower court following that decision, but declined to hear it a final time once the state Court of Appeals narrowly tailored the charges as to not ensnare constitutional free speech protections.

That chain of events led to the plea agreement and the probation sentence.
Burkman and Wohl agreed to plead no contest to single counts of intimidating voters, conspiracy to commit an election law violation, using a computer to intimidate voters, and using a computer to commit a conspiracy.
Michigan was not the only state where Burkman and Wohl faced charges.
In New York, Burkman and Wohl reached a settlement with the state’s attorney general’s office in 2024 to pay up to $1.25 million targeting thousands of Black voters in New York during the 2020 election.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Criminals who persuade children to harm or sexually abuse animals could face up to five years in prison under a new bill filed with the support of Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Sponsored by Democrat Sen. Kristen Arrington and Republican Rep. Linda Chaney, the identical SB 676 and HB 559 would create a third-degree felony charge for Floridians who either abuse animals in front of children or encourage children to do the same. 
That could include bestiality, forcing animals to fight, or harming them. Third-degree felonies are punishable by up to five years in prison, up to $5,000 in fines, or a combination of both. 
The legislation would create a new pattern of penalties for adults who use “any act that causes, tends to cause, encourages, or contributes” to a child committing an offense. So, an adult who assists a minor convicted of a third-degree felony would be charged with a first-degree misdemeanor, a second-degree felony with a third-degree felony, and so on.
DeSantis first hinted at these proposed additions to Florida’s animal cruelty statute last week at a press conference at Big Dog Ranch, a Loxahatchee animal rescue site where he’d previously signed two other pro-animal bills into law.
“There are some bad actors who keep these animals in inhumane conditions and we want to put an end to that type of practice in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said. “The mission is, you legislators, churn this out and then we’ll set a date to come back here and … then we’ll do an even bigger celebration.”
He referred to both Chaney’s and Arrington’s measures as well as another, yet-to-be-filed bill cracking down on inhumane dog breeders. 
During the 2025 session, lawmakers overwhelmingly passed the two anti-animal cruelty bills that DeSantis signed into law at Big Dog Ranch.
Trooper’s Law, named after a Bull Terrier nicknamed “Trooper” by Florida Highway Patrol, makes it a third-degree felony to restrain and abandon a dog outside during a natural disaster. Trooper was found tied to a Tampa fence ahead of Hurricane Milton as floods rushed in. Animal cruelty charges were dropped against his former owner for lack of evidence of intent.
Dexter’s Law lengthens prison sentences for Floridians who torture, mutilate, or kill pets. This came after Dexter, a bulldog mix, was found decapitated and dumped in St. Petersburg.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-01 20:55:57+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Graduation framework recommends new high school tests,Sam Drysdale | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/education/graduation-framework-recommends-new-high-school-tests/,"Initial recommendation documents released by the council on Monday include a ""demonstration of mastery"" that has two components: exams administered by the state, taken at the end of courses; and capstones or portfolios that are designed, administered and scored locally.","HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS would take end-of-course tests designed, administered and scored by the state under new graduation requirements recommended by a state council and cheered by Gov. Maura Healey as consistent with the state’s “high expectations” for all students.
Passing the tests would not be a condition of receiving a diploma, as it was under the former “high stakes” MCAS system, but a major teachers union said the proposal still “defies the will of the voters” in 2024.
Voters in 2024 approved a ballot law to eliminate the MCAS graduation requirement. The K-12 Statewide Graduation Council that Gov. Maura Healey formed through an executive order in January was charged with advising the governor and Legislature on the development of a statewide graduation requirement. 
“I said a year ago that we were going to work together to create a new model for students in Massachusetts, a new vision that sets every high school student up for success, and today we’re speaking to that. Because here in our state, we don’t turn away from students, and we don’t back down from high expectations,” Healey said at a press conference at Dedham High School on Monday.
Initial recommendation documents released by the council on Monday include a “demonstration of mastery” that has two components: exams administered by the state, taken at the end of courses; and capstones or portfolios that are designed, administered and scored locally.
In addition to proving “mastery,” other recommendations include requiring that students complete a “rigorous program of study that aligns with the admissions requirements for higher education,” developing and maintaining an individual career and academic plan, completing federal or state financial aid forms, developing financial literacy skills, and having the option to earn state-designed seals of distinction.
The state is searching for new standards after voters detached the MCAS exam from diploma eligibility. Critics said the high stakes exam caused teachers to teach to the test while supporters said tests are the best way to ensure educational consistency and equity across the state.
Healey was joined in Dedham by Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll, Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler, Education Commissioner Pedro Martinez and American Federation of Teachers of Massachusetts President Jessica Tang. The Massachusetts Teachers Association, which led the ballot question effort against the MCAS graduation requirement, does not endorse the recommendations.
The end-of-course assessments would be administered at the end of specific high school courses, like Algebra I, English Language Arts, Science and Social Studies. “The recommendation for end-of-course assessments functions alongside the recommended program of study,” the recommendation document says.
“Research on EOC assessments specifically has found that EOC assessments are generally positively correlated with high school graduation rates, with the impacts of Math and English Language Arts EOC assessments being statistically significant,” the document says. “Additionally, administering a greater number of EOC assessments generally correlates with higher graduation rates.”
A press release from the governor’s office says the end-of-course assessments “are different from high stakes testing because students do not have to pass an EOC to graduate. EOCs will be a more targeted and relevant approach to assessment than our current high school MCAS.”
The 100-page recommendation document is due to be followed by the council’s final report in June 2026. The recommendations require legislative action after they are filed, according to the Executive Office of Education. July is the last month for scheduled formal legislative sessions in 2026.   
“The administration is assessing the best way to approach implementation,” said EOE spokesperson Alana Davidson.
Over the next six months, the council will discuss which courses should have an assessment, the weight and role of the tests as a component of a system that determines readiness to graduate, and accommodations and alternative formats for students with disabilities, English learners and newly-arrived immigrant students.
The council’s report also outlines the purpose behind redesigning the graduation framework. Co-chairs Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler and K-12 Commissioner Pedro Martinez wrote that the post-MCAS transition offers Massachusetts “an opportunity to update what it means to graduate from a public high school… prepared for today’s workforce and postsecondary education opportunities.”
“What we’re releasing today,” Tutwiler said, “is an initial framework, a starting point. It outlines the importance of coursework, offers more opportunities for students to demonstrate their learning in ways that reflect their strengths, and supports them in planning the next chapter of their lives.”
The report frames the effort as a response to concerns about inconsistent expectations across districts and says a uniform statewide requirement is intended to support “rigorous, uniform, and equitable” standards for all students. It further situates Massachusetts’ work within national trends. A review of other states’ graduation requirements found growing use of flexible pathways, mastery-based demonstrations, and combinations of coursework and performance tasks.
The council wrote that a statewide requirement supports “mobility, consistency, accountability, and transparency” for students and families, and argues that a Massachusetts diploma should signal that graduates are well-prepared for college, career and civic life.
Brooke Thomson, president and CEO of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, said the business group supports the standards.
“Massachusetts’ economic future depends on a strong and measurable education system. Ensuring that all students meet clear and standardized expectations in core subjects is critical not only for their own success, but for the long-term competitiveness of our state,” Thomson said. “AIM urges parents, employees, and employers to engage in this work in supporting this vital set of recommendations to ensure Massachusetts remains a leader in educating our children and our future workforce.”
Though the governor’s advisory said union officials were joining Monday morning’s press conference, the Massachusetts Teachers Association — the largest teachers union in the state — said they are not endorsing the recommendations. 
“By making new state standardized tests a central component of the new graduation requirements, the proposal defies the will of voters who made clear their wishes in the 2024 Question 2 referendum, which passed by nearly 60 percent in favor,” MTA President Max Page and Vice President Deb McCarthy said in a statement.
Healey shot back at the union.
“Let me be perfectly clear, the end-of-course assessments are not a high-stakes test. They’re not. So that’s an inaccurate characterization by the Massachusetts Teachers Association,” Healey told reporters in Dedham. “What the end-of-course assessments are, are basically the tests you take normally at the end of your course… That gives us the opportunity to assess how much the students learned, whether the right kind of progress has been made.”
Though the union is represented on the council, they say members “did not vote on the recommendations; these are the recommendations of the secretary and commissioner, speaking on behalf of the Healey administration.”
Tang, representing the second largest teacher’s union in the state, stood by the governor’s side for the unveiling of the recommendations in Dedham. 
“This is a starting point,” Tang said. “Our hope is that the final recommendations accurately reflect what we know residents want: a better secondary school graduation system that moves away from high-stakes testing as well as over testing. There is an opportunity here to create a better system that authentically reflects and supports the current educational needs of our students, including a focus on deeper learning, critical thinking, life long learning and preparedness for college, vocation, and career.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Yes-on-2-Max-Page-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C793&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-01 15:58:33.787770

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Much like his resume, Republican Aaron Guckian’s gubernatorial campaign kickoff featured a little bit of everything: An operatic rendition of the first line of the “Battle Hymn of the Republic,” aphorisms from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, fist pumps and multiple references to “compassionate conservatism.”
“Compassion is strength, not weakness,” Guckian, told the crowd of supporters gathered at Brewed Awakenings Coffee House in Warwick Monday morning. “That’s the Rhode Island I believe in, one where families can afford to live and work, where compassion meets common sense, and where every child growing up here, the American Dream is still within reach right here in the Ocean State.”
Guckian, 49, of East Greenwich is the sixth candidate — three Democrats and three Republicans – to enter the 2026 governor’s race. Though he’s never held elected office, the self-described “middle of the road Republican” has played a prominent role in state politics and policy for decades, including as special assistant to Gov. Don Carcieri. 
Throughout his kickoff speech Monday, Guckian frequently invoked his former State House boss and mentor Carcieri, who led the state for two terms from 2003 to 2011 and was the last Republican to hold the governor’s seat in Rhode Island. 
Like Carcieri, Guckian espoused a message of fiscal responsibility, calling for the state to rein in spending and get rid of burdensome taxes and fees on small businesses and residents. But the familiar GOP talking points were married with moderate takes on mental health care, housing and renewable energy, reflecting Guckian’s personal experience and breadth of professional roles. 
Indeed, it’s hard to find a sector Guckian hasn’t touched, from his background as an opera singer and music teacher at North Kingstown High School, to several stints in banking, as fundraising head for the Rhode Island Foundation, and, most recently, executive director for the Rhode Island Dental Association. He recently stepped down from the leadership role representing dental providers and promoting access to care after nearly three years.
Guckian ran for lieutenant governor in 2022, losing to Democratic incumbent Sabina Matos by eight percentage points in the general election.
Reflecting back on his failed state office bid four years ago, Guckian said he started too late — a mistake he hopes to avoid this time by launching his campaign earlier.
“It was like ‘Rocky 1,’ and I want to get to ‘Rocky 2,’” Guckian said, referring to the first two films in the fictional franchise of boxer Rocky Balboa.
Guckian is also looking to grow his campaign finance account — which held about $2,000 as of his most recent filing in January —- by taking advantage of a state law that offers matching public funds to general officer candidates who raise money on their own and agree to spending caps. 
The 1988 law, adjusted at the start of each year by the state elections board, lets general office candidates receive taxpayer-funded matches for up to 20% of the total amount raised, providing they meet conditions around minimum donor numbers, among other requirements. 
“I think I can raise the money to be competitive, and once you get the match, then it all has to do with the person’s heart, soul, conviction, and who they are as a candidate, and I know that I will resonate with the state of Rhode Island, because people want change,” Guckian said.

The competition 
Gov. Dan McKee and Helena Buonanno Foulkes, the two most prominent declared Democratic gubernatorial candidates and 2022 rivals have been actively fundraising for nearly a year. As of Sept. 30, Foulkes had $2.4 million cash on hand in her campaign account, while McKee ended the reporting period with $1 million, according to reports filed with the Rhode Island Board of Elections. 
Gregory Stevens, who owns the trio of local Pat’s Italian Restaurants, also filed his paperwork to run as a Democrat earlier this month, according to news reports.  
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, widely speculated as a fourth potential Democratic candidate for governor though he has not confirmed it, remains the top fundraiser of any state official, with $4.2 million cash on hand.
McKee’s campaign took aim at Guckian in a statement ahead of the event on Monday.
“Aaron Guckian is back with the same tired Republican playbook that would turn Rhode Island into a testing ground for Donald Trump’s agenda,” McKee’s campaign said. “While he will continue to push the same Trump economic agenda that is raising the cost of living in Rhode Island, Governor McKee is focused on what actually matters: lowering costs for families, strengthening our public schools, and keeping Rhode Island’s economy moving forward. Governor McKee will put his record of real results up against Aaron Guckian or any Trump-aligned Republican who intends to run.”
Jon Romano, a spokesperson for Foulkes’ campaign also issued a statement but did not name Guckian at all. 
“As we face an increasingly chaotic and unpredictable Trump administration in Washington — Rhode Island needs a strong Democratic governor now more than ever,” Romano said. “We need a governor who will address our housing affordability crisis, bring down costs for working families, protect our rights and values, and provide the steady, competent leadership our state deserves.”
Guckian also faces competition from within his own party. Retired comedian Elaine Pelino quietly unveiled a campaign website in July. Local businessman Robert Raimondo, a distant cousin of former Gov. Gina Raimondo, filed his candidacy paperwork in November. Neither has held a formal kickoff events or promoted their campaigns to the press.
Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz and 2022 Republican gubernatorial candidate Ashley Kalus are also rumored to be mulling a run for governor. Guckian said he had not spoken with Kalus since her 2022 campaign. He called de la Cruz a “good friend,” and said she had not indicated to him that she planned to run for governor.
A spokesperson for de La Cruz did not respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
Guckian drew several big names in the state GOP to his campaign kickoff, including GOP Chairman Joe Powers, former Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Bob Flanders and David Levesque, coffee shop owner and co-founder of the new political action committee, The League of RI Businesses. Cranston Mayor Ken Hopkins introduced Guckian to the crowd Monday.
“His commitment to public service is not just a political ambition,” Hopkins said. “It’s a calling. He knows that every decision that we make impacts our neighbors, our friends and our families.”

‘Get up and grind’
Guckian emphasized his humble beginnings as the son of a plumber and respiratory therapist who instilled in him the value of hard work, even when it requires long hours.
“You got to get up and grind,” Guckian said. 
The grind mentality is what Guckian sees as missing now, both from state leaders and the state’s overall attitude. 
“People love to talk about problems” he said. “They love to run to Twitter. They love to say, ‘Oh, this is the problem, but how are we going to get to the solution?’ And it’s very simple. You get people in the room, you tell them, how can we do better? And you remove obstacles. And ladies and gentlemen, that’s what I do every single day.”
Guckian pointed to his track record leading the state dental trade group as evidence of his ability to work across the aisle and achieve results, including increasing Medicaid fees paid out for dental work and a state review at provider reimbursement rates. Guckian also helped to influence Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha’s directive to use the bulk of an $11 million state settlement with Route 6/10 Interchange contractor Barletta Heavy Division to pay for dental care for children in underserved neighborhoods of Providence.
His rousing speech grew somber as Guckian explained his own battles with health care challenges, specifically the difficulty of getting sober. He did not elaborate on his sobriety, but stressed the need to prioritize addiction treatment and mental health care.
Guckian repeatedly steered focus back to state issues despite repeated reporters’ questions about his view on President Donald Trump and the national Republican agenda. 
But, Guckian acknowledged that he did not agree with the Trump administration’s halt to work on the Revolution Wind project this summer — reversed a month later under a federal judge order. And on social issues like gay marriage and abortion, Guckian said he would not reverse the protections already enshrined in state law.
“You have to have a bipartisan spirit,” Guckian said. “You have to work with the legislature. You have to not always talk about the things that you disagree with, but what do you agree with?”
Guckian gave a measured response when asked about firing McKee’s cabinet members, specifically Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr. and Rhode Island Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education Angélica Infante-Green. The former faces public scrutiny for his handling of the Washington Bridge collapse and rebuild and the latter for student performance in Providence schools.
Guckian understood the frustrations over the continued traffic delays created by the bridge rebuild, but said it was too soon to commit to firing anyone. But, he said he would do a “hard analysis,” agreeing that “things are not going well” with state traffic and infrastructure work generally.
He also pledged to find unspecified “efficiencies” in state government to help reduce costs and burdens on taxpayers, while also incorporating “modern technology” to better serve people. But not, Guckian cautioned, at the expense of jobs. He stressed the need to bolster workforce training programs, collaborate with unions, and support frontline workers like health care providers through student loan reimbursement programs and other incentives.
On housing, Guckian backed the move to reduce local permits and red tape stymieing affordable housing, the same strategy championed by Shekarchi, though Guckian said  he did not believe in state mandates.
While Guckian might be the underdog in experience in state office, he’s not small in stature. “Think BIG” is Guckian’s campaign slogan, a literal nod to his towering 6-foot-7 frame.
A campaign rally for Guckian is scheduled for 6 p.m. Monday, also at Brewed Awakenings in Warwick.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)In a rare moment in Virginia’s legislative history, the Senate on Monday invited higher education leaders from the University of Virginia and Virginia Military Institute to speak in an open forum about how they are choosing their institutions’ leaders, and why UVA opted to sign a controversial agreement with the federal government to suspend civil rights investigations. 
Monday’s meeting comes as lawmakers are preparing to return to Richmond in January to develop the state’s next two-year budget that would include state funding to support Virginia’s colleges and universities’ operations and capital projects. The schools’ decisions raised alarms among lawmakers, who are charged with financially supporting the institutions and appointing governing board members. For months, Democratic legislators have expressed concern about federal overreach at Virginia’s universities. 
Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Chair on Higher Education Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, highlighted the stakes of the situation at Monday’s gathering, saying Virginia’s nationally ranked institutions have been one of the key drivers of the state’s success.
“They are one of the biggest components for the commonwealth, scoring highly on being the best state for business,” said Locke. “However, there have been recent actions at multiple institutions by their board members that could endanger the world-class nature of these institutions.”

Those actions could have both “direct and indirect financial impact,” Locke said. The meeting came as several Democratic lawmakers remain locked in a lawsuit over their rejection of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointees to the governing boards at UVA, VMI and George Mason University, which they said was an attempt to block the politicization of the universities’ governing bodies.
Here are five takeaways from Monday’s meeting.
 Interim President stands by UVA-DOJ agreement

UVA Interim President Paul Mahoney continued to defend the school’s agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to suspend seven investigations into the institution. The DOJ claimed UVA’s admissions, hiring, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs violated federal civil rights laws, and that its campus culture was inhospitable to Jewish students. 
While UVA leaders rejected the claims, the federal government’s investigation is part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to align colleges and universities with its views and crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
Some lawmakers, mostly Democrats, alumni and faculty opposed the agreement and said it opened the school up to legal liability conflict with existing law, and infringed on state sovereignty.

Still, Mahoney said, the agreement suspends costly and disruptive investigations and preserves institutional autonomy and academic freedom.
“For all of those reasons, I believe that signing the agreement was the best option available to us. In fact, we are in a clearly better position than if we hadn’t signed.”
Mahoney said that of the seven investigations, five have been suspended. Two of them were closed.
Lawmakers also questioned Mahoney about the agreement’s consequences. 
Compared to other institutions, UVA will not have to invest any money like Cornell or repay any money to the federal government Northwestern University. But senators wanted to know if there were other strings attached to the UVA-DOJ deal that put the investigations on ice, and questioned the efficacy of the federal department.
“I find it disappointing that institutions have been bullied into capitulating to the Department of Justice,” Locke said, “and I find the word ‘justice’ also moronic in this day and age, because that department is certainly rogue these days, and I certainly take issue with the idea of ‘seasoned investigators’ coming out of that department, because that’s a very toxic environment that’s operating there now, because many of the seasoned individuals have been fired or left of their own accord.”
 UVA’s presidential search won’t be impacted by the federal investigations

Mahoney doesn’t expect the issues surrounding the institutions to negatively impact UVA’s search for the next president.
Quoting Issacson, Miller, the firm advising UVA on the search, Mahoney said every institution has its own challenges but now that there is an agreement in place, the uncertainty about the number and quality of candidates has diminished. 
“The search firm stated that there was a surge of very high-quality applications right after that agreement was signed, so I am not persuaded that we will not receive high-quality applications,” Mahoney said. “Obviously, the search is confidential. I have no way of knowing who is or isn’t a candidate, but at least the search consultant has expressed confidence that we are receiving high quality applications.”

Last month, Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger asked UVA leaders to suspend their search for a new president until vacant seats on the governing board are filled and confirmed, likely in the upcoming legislative session. Spanberger said the board members “severely undermined” the public’s confidence in their abilities amid the agreement with the DOJ.
Youngkin, who is term-limited, said UVA should not delay its decision and characterized Spanberger’s request as an improper attempt to interfere with the hiring process and an incorrect depiction of board members’ efforts.
“It’s dangerous to wrongfully disparage committed individuals who volunteer to serve on university boards and the serious work they do,” Youngkin wrote in a letter in November. “Further, the governor of the commonwealth should speak thoughtfully and honor the service of those individuals.”
 UVA rectors are a no-show

Rachel Sheridan and Porter Wilkinson, the rector and vice rector of the UVA Board of Visitors, were not present at the meeting, although their names appeared on the initial agenda last week.
Jim Ryan, former UVA president, recently wrote that the two worked with the Department of Justice and Youngkin’s office to pressure him to resign. The governor’s office has not responded to earlier questions from the Mercury on the matter.
Locke said there are plans to invite them to a future meeting before the start of the next session. Other institutions may also be invited as well. The committee did not provide a date. 
 Senators meet new VMI superintendent

Senators also met newly appointed Virginia Military Institute Superintendent Lt. General David Furness Monday, who provided an update on institutional leadership and finances.
Senators questioned Furness about his working relationship with the institution’s governing board, which is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the General Assembly, like all public university boards in the state. He was appointed in August.
“Well, they are my, what I would refer to as my higher headquarters,” Furness said. “They’re appointed by the governor, confirmed by the legislature, and they’re going to direct me and the daily prosecution of my duties.”

Furness stated that he is accountable to the board for fiscal matters, good order, discipline, and daily operations, and that he maintains regular communication with the board president and members. 
He highlighted the board’s significant representation of VMI alumni, noted the importance of balancing tradition with change, and described his approach as “open” in his engagement with board members, seeking consensus and keeping them well-informed to ensure strong governance while advancing VMI.
Furness replaced former Ret. Major Gen. Cedric Wins, the first Black superintendent who was ousted by the governing board earlier this year. Since the decision, the governing board has made significant changes to its bylaws and modified the board’s responsibilities relating to diversity and inclusion.
 Institutions make legislative and funding pitches

In another segment of the meeting, Virginia’s higher education leaders provided an overview of budget requests and their legislative priorities ahead of the upcoming General Assembly session. The presentations come at a time when public perceptions of the value of a college education have greatly declined, prompting lawmakers to consider ways to support institutions facing uncertainty in enrollment.
“My read of the data is that higher education has never been more valuable than it is right now,” said State Council of Higher Education for Virginia Executive Director A. Scott Fleming, adding, “students who have not earned a credential, post-secondary credential, are struggling much more in the current workforce than those who have.” 
Council of Presidents Chair and President Troy Paino added that he believes access to and completion of college is vital, particularly for low-income and Pell-eligible students.
Paino, who is also the president of the University of Mary Washington, said financial barriers are the primary reasons students are not graduating, and that expanding support is essential moving forward.
The two leaders advocated for continued and increased state investments for operations, student financial aid, workforce development and capital projects.
“We have a significant responsibility in crafting those budgets,” said Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, who spoke with reporters after the meeting. “We, by all accounts, are going to have a challenging budget environment coming up, and more information is always better than less. There’s an awful lot that is on our plate right now, and hearing from SCHEV and from the Council of Presidents and from these two institutions was certainly important.”

(Getty photo by Coral222)No matter what a federal advisory committee recommends later this week, the Rhode Island Department of Health on Monday reasserted the state’s commitment to preserving continued access to the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is scheduled to discuss and potentially vote on changing the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants when it meets Thursday at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. The panel spent hours during its last meeting in September discussing a proposal to delay the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine after several members raised issues about the available data. 
The standard vaccination schedule calls for a hepatitis B vaccine birth dose within 24 hours of delivery, regardless of whether a birth parent has been infected. All children complete the full vaccination series within 18 months. A chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer or death. 
“The hepatitis B birth dose helps prevent a lifelong, potentially fatal, chronic infection, which can lead to serious liver disease and liver cancer later in life,” Director of Health Dr. Jerry Larkin said in a statement. “The hepatitis B vaccine has been tested extensively for safety, and we know that it works. Since 1991, when we started recommending it for all newborns, infections with hepatitis B virus in children and teens have decreased by 99%. No matter what is happening at the federal level, in Rhode Island, vaccine policy will continue to be grounded in science, data, and facts.”
Last week, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey’s administration also announced it would take all necessary steps to preserve continued access to the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, regardless of any future action by the federal panel. 
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices can have up to 19 voting members who are independent medical and public health experts who are not employed by the CDC. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all the panel’s members earlier this year, replacing them with 12 new advisers. The American Academy of Pediatricians and  other medical organizations filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Kennedy, saying the committee’s new appointees lack credentials and experience required of their role and asked for the group’s votes to be overturned.
Rhode Island’s health department joined a consensus statement on hepatitis B and newborns from the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, a coalition of public health agencies working together to share expertise, improve coordination, enhance capacity, strengthen regional readiness, and protect evidence-based public health.

A Superior Court judge ruled Saturday that he would not grant an injunction of the state’s return-to-office policy, paving the way for the state to enforce its Dec. 1 deadline for employees to begin in-person work. 
The Vermont State Employees’ Association had filed the lawsuit last month to challenge Gov. Phil Scott’s decision to order almost all state employees back to in-person work three days a week. 
In court last Wednesday, the union’s attorney argued that the policy would cause irreparable harm to certain employees forced to relocate or change their child care arrangements, among other impacts. That irreparable harm, Alfred Gordon O’Connell said, gives the court the right to intervene.

But in the ruling, Washington County Superior Court Judge Daniel Richardson sided with the state’s argument that employees have sufficient relief available through the state’s exemption process, in which employees can request temporary or long-term exemptions for their personal circumstances. 
Of the 3,000 employees newly expected to come into the office, 425 have requested exemptions, according to the state’s data cited in the decision. Only 25 exemptions have been granted, while the rest are pending. 
“On the present record, the Court would be speculating as to the scope, nature, and even severity of the harm if it went forward to grant relief in this case,” Richardson wrote.  
“This is not to say that there are not State employees who will be affected by this policy,” he continued. “Nor is it to minimize the hardships or concerns of those individuals, but it is to recognize that there are several processes in play, presently, that render a decision at this time from this Court inappropriate.”
The union has also filed complaints with the Vermont Labor Relations Board, which has scheduled an investigatory conference on Wednesday to determine whether the case should move forward, O’Connell said at the hearing.

It will now be the Commission on Fairness and Public Trust, the court announced in an order issued on Wednesday.
“The Commission became aware of two seemingly contradictory facts: that ‘DEI’ is now a polarizing concept in American life, while, at the same time, a commitment to fairness, acceptance of others, and equity is not,” Justice Elizabeth Welch, who served as one of the initial co-chairs of the Commission on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, explained in a concurring opinion to the order that called DEI a “political lightning rod.”
The purpose of the commission will now be to “ensure that all those served by the justice system are heard, valued, and respected,” while the previous version of the commission, which was initially formed in 2021, had a stated goal of the “elimination of disparities within the justice system.”

“The action of the Michigan Supreme Court is disappointing,” Lynna Kaucheck, the director of communications and coalitions at Michigan Voices, wrote in response to the change. “What remains to be seen is if this name change negatively impacts the original intent of commission, the consequences of that could devastate the progress that many of Michigan’s marginalized communities have made in recent years.”
The structure of the commission will remain largely unchanged in terms of membership and terms, but the duties of the commission will no longer focus on specifically demographic disparities, instead broadening to any disparities in the courts. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The change comes as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, especially in government, have come under fire in national politics, with President Donald Trump on his first day in office referring to such policies as “radical” and “shameful discrimination.”
“Now more than ever we must remain committed to ensuring that no matter what you look [like], where you come from, or how much money you have in your wallet you should have equitable access to all the resources and opportunities that are necessary to thrive,” Kaucheck continued. “Removing references to DEI amounts to nothing more than kowtowing to the Administration’s continued attacks on marginalized communities.”
Justice Brian Zahra, the sole Republican on the court, expressed his concerns with the change in a dissenting opinion.
“What does it say about our commitment to transparency that this Court is willing to scrape the name off its DEI Commission at a time when DEI just so happens to be losing its popularity among the people?” he asked in the dissension. “Is it transparent to alter the name of this Commission but leave its members and its powers unchanged?”
Justice Brian Zahra
Zahra also noted his concerns with DEI more broadly, noting that the changes in the order were not making any meaningful changes to the commission’s purpose, only obscuring the fact that it was originally a DEI commission.
“This is a DEI Commission, no matter what name the Court now intends to give it or how vaguely the Court intends to phrase its goals,” he wrote. “The majority ought to have stood by their conviction that DEI was necessary and allowed Michiganders to judge, on the basis of clear facts, whether they approved of this Court’s exercise of its authority.”
Welch pushed back against some of Zahra’s concerns, especially his concerns about the transparency of this change, by citing how closely the goals align with the Justice for All Commission, another Supreme Court body that Zahra chairs, which seeks to increase access to the legal system.
“The FPT Commission was created precisely to ensure that we center service to the people of the state and remain steadfast in our commitment to transparency, best practices for retaining and attracting talent, and processes that ensure dignity and fairness for every person who walks through our courthouse doors,” she wrote.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8824-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 15:58:33.787770

Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr., the University of Mississippi graduate accused of killing a fellow student and well-known member of Oxford’s LGBTQ+ community, pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder and tampering with evidence. 
The son of a prominent family in Grenada, Herrington was facing capital murder – and a potential sentence of life in prison – for killing Jimmie “Jay” Lee in the summer of 2022 and hiding his body. During a previous trial that ended in a hung jury, prosecutors alleged Herrington’s motive was to preserve the secret of his sexual relationship with Lee. 
The prosecution said it will now recommend a 40-year sentence with 10 years suspended. 
“He has accepted responsibility on his own instead of a jury placing responsibility on him,” said Lafayette County District Attorney Ben Creekmore. 
The plea deal came two and a half hours into jury selection in Madison County for the second trial. A judge ordered jury selection to take place outside Lafayette County, where trial was to be held, due to media coverage there.
It would have been the second time Herrington faced a jury. At the time of the first trial in December of 2024, law enforcement had not yet located Lee’s remains – a reason one juror reportedly refused to convict, causing a hung jury, according to Action News 5. This time, though, the state had Lee’s remains, which were found earlier this year in a wooded gully in Carroll County close to Herrington’s parents’ home. 
Herrington had been in jail since he was indicted for a second time earlier this year. 
Lee’s older sister, Tayla Carey, said she was “overfilled with happiness” at the plea, adding, “it’s well overdue.” 
Shortly after Lafayette County Circuit Court Judge Kelly Luther began winnowing the jury pool, a clerk approached the bench with papers. This prompted Luther to pause the selection and issue a warning to the nearly 150 potential jurors not to speculate or discuss the subject of the case before releasing them into the hallway.
An hour later, the prosecution and Herrington’s defense, Jackson-area attorney Aafram Sellers, reached a deal. Herrington’s mother tearfully met with the defense lawyers before she left the courthouse. 
Sellers did not want to comment on the plea until after sentencing, scheduled for Tuesday at 10 a.m. in Oxford. But he said the deal was possible once both sides “got to the courthouse steps.” 
Creekmore said the deal was unexpected. Though the defense had initiated some negotiations, he said they were “not robust.” Hotel rooms in Oxford had been booked for the jury; lunches and dinners ordered.
Though Lee’s family was already in Oxford, Creekmore said that Herrington was present for the deliberations in Madison. 
This resolution saves Lee’s family the agony of another trial and potential appeals, Creekmore said. It also adds back the charge of tampering with evidence, which Sellers had been successful in removing due to the statute of limitations. 
“It’s a terrible, sad, tragic story, and I’m relieved that the family does not have to relive the trauma of what happened to Jay Lee again,” Creekmore said. 
In Madison, some of the potential jurors said they knew what the case was about. One woman said it had been on the news this morning. But others were unaware, even after learning they had been called for a case from Lafayette County. 
Last night, some of Lee’s friends gathered outside the Lafayette County Courthouse with members of the local LGBTQ+ community. 
On the courthouse’s white exterior, they projected a graduation picture of Lee surrounded by azalea flowers as well as the name of their movement, “Justice for Jay Lee.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/01135130/AP25335671213685.jpg,,,2025-12-01 15:58:33.787770

The spike is an early estimate. Still, it’s likely to provoke fear for taxpayers, lawmakers and school administrators weary from years of rising costs.

Vermonters could see a nearly 12% property tax increase in 2026, according to early estimates from the state. 
The news arrived Monday in the form of the “Dec. 1 letter,” an annual Tax Department projection that represents the first public-facing estimate of the average expected education property tax rates. The estimate relies on data from the state Agency of Education and local school districts, which are already engaged in their budget-making processes, and is produced in collaboration with the Vermont Legislative Joint Fiscal Office. 
“The rate of increase that we’re talking about is simply unacceptable and certainly defines unaffordability,” Bill Shouldice, Vermont’s tax commissioner, said in a media briefing on Monday.

Education property taxes have risen more than 40% in the last five years, according to the Tax Department, even while student enrollment in Vermont has dropped. 
About half of the projected 11.9% average increase is due to anticipated increases in school district spending in the 2026-2027 school year, according to the Tax Department. The other half of the increase comes from not having the one-time allocation of roughly $100 million used last year to lower tax rates, a common practice in recent years adopted by the Legislature and governor. 
Property taxes rose on average by about 1% in 2025, though increases varied in towns and districts across the state. The modest increase resulted from lawmakers offsetting a 5.5% increase in school spending using one-time buy-down funds, a decision that makes this year’s increase appear higher.    
Rising property taxes — and the cost of public education — have been the driving force in Montpelier politics over the last two years. In the 2024 legislative session, property taxes were projected to rise by an average of more than 18%, leading voters to reject a historic proportion of school budgets. Reductions in spending and offsetting funds lowered the tax increase to less than 14%, but that spike fueled a wave of Republican House and Senate victories last November. 
Last legislative session, in response to rising education property taxes, lawmakers passed Act 73, setting in motion generational change to how education is paid for and governed in Vermont. But the bill depends on lawmakers approving new, consolidated school district maps this upcoming session. That requirement hit a speed bump last month, when the group tasked with proposing maps chose to endorse voluntary — rather than mandatory — district consolidation. 
Gov. Phil Scott labeled the task force’s recommendation a failure. Education Secretary Zoie Saunders added further criticism on Monday, arguing the state needs to act now to prevent an endless cycle of property tax increases and cuts to school budgets. 
“Rising property taxes have not prevented staffing cuts and school closures. Rising property taxes have not facilitated equitable opportunities for students in every community across Vermont, and rising property taxes have not moved the needle on improving educational quality,” Saunders said at the briefing. “Instead, we are contending with two enormous challenges: property taxes that families cannot afford and an education system that local communities cannot sustain.”
The 11.9% estimate was formulated using preliminary school budgets from about two-thirds of districts, according to the Tax Department. In years past, the Dec. 1 estimate has been higher than the ultimate average tax bill, as lawmakers have used new taxes and one-time money to bring down rates. School districts may also lower their budgets before votes on Town Meeting Day. 
Officials said Monday it was too soon to say whether Scott and his team would recommend budgeting money to buy down property tax rates this year. 
In the wake of the tax department’s Monday estimate, state political leaders chimed in to decry expected double-digit hike.
“The choice before lawmakers in 2026 is clear: show courage by working together to keep moving forward with our bipartisan transformation plan,” Scott said in a statement, “or explain to Vermonters why yet another double-digit tax increase is acceptable, and why we’ll continue to see them well into the future if we abandon our efforts.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, said in a statement the pattern of property tax increases could not continue. 
“The truth is that Act 73’s success depends on even harder work being accomplished this session. I am committed to continuing this mission — in collaboration with the Governor, the House and my colleagues in the Senate,” he said. 
Baruth’s counterpart in the lower chamber, House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, echoed his call to action in a separate statement. 
“​​It’s important for all of us to remember that the challenges before us are decades in the making,” she said, “and we will continue to see double digit property tax projections and loss of educational opportunities for kids if we do nothing.”

(Photo by Jim Obradovich for Iowa Capital Dispatch)Whatever the unfortunate topic, people think, “Oh, that will never happen to me.” Maybe they believe it, or maybe they are just putting it out into the universe hoping the proclamation will protect them. Either way, I am here to tell you that it absolutely can happen to you — just like it did to me.
First off, let me say that this story is not typical of what I write here. However, it is about life in the Midwest, or anywhere for that matter. I also want to say that I struggled a lot with deciding to put it out here. Vulnerability is a hard thing. You leave yourself open to criticism, judgment, pity, bullying, and all kinds of things we don’t want to deal with. Telling the story is hard enough, who wants to deal with that kind of backlash on top of it? BUT — I decided this story is important, and now is the time to tell it. And please know: If you find yourself anywhere in this story, you are not alone.
So I am going to tell you how I found myself in need of food assistance. Did I EVER think that would happen to me? Certainly not. I was raised in a middle-class family that really never wanted for anything. We weren’t rich by any means, but we did OK. As life went on, I attended a good high school, went to business school, got a job, and found myself in a very short “practice” marriage. After having practiced long enough to figure out that was not the real deal, I later had another marriage that I imagined would be the last one. But, not so fast. After 12 years, I knew it was time to make a change. That I needed to make a change.
So with two small daughters, I found myself on my own. And I was more on my own than I ever imagined. Once the exceedingly long divorce ordeal finally ended, I found myself with nothing. Nothing. Somehow everything I had owned and all my money — every bit of it — had mysteriously been signed over to someone in my ex-husband’s family. “Devastated” does not even begin to explain how I felt. “Panicked” might be the word I want. What was I going to do?
Well, I had a pretty good job, but I knew I needed more, so I quickly found two others: Working part-time at the local Barnes and Noble bookstore and baking cookies for a coffee kiosk in the downtown skywalks. All the while trying to spend time with the girls. A trick for sure. But then it got even trickier, as my ex-husband managed to take over half of my income. With my house in foreclosure, and my hard-earned money going to someone else, I had to do something. I am telling you the truth when I say that some days, I did not have one dime to my name. Literally.
Through my bank, I was connected to an amazing person employed by the federal government who could help me with the house issue. She managed to get a low-interest second mortgage for me (that didn’t have to be paid back until I sold the house) that would take me out of foreclosure and allow me to get back to making regular house payments. That was a huge load off my mind — and checkbook — but I still had NO money.
Most of the time, I had to choose between driving somewhere and using precious gas, paying for a school activity, or buying food. Every single month I had to go down to the Waterworks office to pay my late bill in cash in order to keep the water on. Trying to be helpful, the woman who assisted me with the mortgage encouraged me to file for food stamps. But I just did not want to do that. What self-respecting member of society does that? Not me. That doesn’t happen to me.
Well, it did happen to me. Finally, armed with all my paperwork, including paystubs and tax documents that showed how much of my income did NOT come into my home, I gathered up all I had within myself and headed downtown to get food assistance. But — joke on me — at that time your eligibility was determined by your gross income. Not the net that you actually brought home. I’m not sure what the requirements are now, but according to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services website, one must now meet both gross and net requirements.
So it turned out that, of course, between my three jobs, I made “too much money” to be considered for food stamps. I could not believe that no one considered how many dollars actually came through one’s door. The actual money available. Having been courageous enough to even try to get food assistance, the woman helping me saw how disappointed I was with the news I had received.
So she said, “Well, you can always get food from a food pantry.” And, truth here, I laughed out loud and replied, “No matter how much I don’t have, I always put something in the food pantry barrel at my grocery store.” And I left to go home to try to figure it all out. Again.

And somehow, I managed without ever visiting a food pantry. I’m not sure how, but I did. I just couldn’t make myself go even though I knew there was no shame in that. None. But I feel that people seem to think it’s an admission of failure, when really, it’s just accepting needed help. And we all need help now and again. In the end, what kept me from going was that I knew it would add one more notch to the I’m-going-to-take-her-down belt of my ex-husband.
But going down was not an option for me and I did make it. I kept the house until I was ready to sell it and — literally –move on. The girls graduated from high school and attended college, and I eventually had all my money coming home with me again. I had finally reached that seemingly elusive point where I could look back and say, “That was horrible.”
Fast-forward to today. Now. As I sit here remembering that time in my life, I am lucky enough to not have to worry about food. At least not right now. But who knows? So for many years I have made it a point to send an automatic monthly monetary donation to DMARC. As their website states “The DMARC Food Pantry Network consists of 14 individual partner pantries, multiple mobile food pantry sites, and a home delivery service. DMARC provides a guaranteed supply of food to our partner pantries, free of charge, and operates a centralized intake database.” I also deliver a box of food I’ve purchased to the West Des Moines Human Services folks every couple of weeks.
Food insecurity is a crisis in our country, and even more so right now. But for any one individual it might be a crisis on any given day. I know. I’ve been there. So of course I’m donating right now, but I’ve made those two donations mentioned above for many years and will continue to do so for as long as I am able. Because you never know when, through no fault of your own, it might happen to you.

Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, holds up his proposed mid-census redistricting ban outside the Senate chamber on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025. He walked inside to file the bill. Qaddoura told reporters he would also request a meeting with the Senate's GOP leader and ask him to hear the bill. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)An Indiana Democrat on Monday filed a bill to ban early redistricting as Republicans heed President Donald Trump’s call for a 9-0 sweep of the state’s congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, knows his bill is a long shot, but said it “protects voters, safeguards democracy and ensures that political power is earned, not manipulated.”
He spoke during a news conference at the Indiana Statehouse, an hour after House Republicans unveiled their proposed map.
Redistricting is typically done every decade, with the release of new census data. Republican supermajorities drew the current maps in 2021, and they’re not due for a refresh until 2030.

Fady Qaddoura, and League of Women Voters Indiana President Linda Hanson speak at a news conference about Qaddoura’s proposed mid-census redistricting ban on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The new map pulls from the same 2020 census data. It splits the Democrat-held 1st District into two. The 7th District, a Democrat-controlled seat that largely follows Indianapolis’ borders, is splintered across four districts.
“This is a pure political hijacking of the voters’ will,” Qaddoura said.
His legislation would prohibit mid-census redistricting unless a court orders a redraw because of a constitutional violation — “not because one party is losing power, and not because a president wants to tip the scales, and not because insiders fear competition,” Qaddoura said. It would be effective upon passage.
He was joined by a coalition of voting rights groups known as ALL IN for Democracy.
“This bill is clearly necessary at a time when partisan politics is infiltrating everything we do in state government,” said Julia Vaughn, executive director of Common Cause Indiana.
After the news conference, Qaddoura walked to the Senate offices to file his legislation.

He told reporters he’d also ask for a meeting with Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray — and request a committee hearing for the proposal. Without a hearing, it will die early.
Qaddoura said the bill would have bipartisan support on the Senate floor, if it gets that far.
“Due to the political environment and the attacks against many Republicans, they preferred not to be publicly identified as sponsors or authors on this legislation, really, because of security issues,” he said.
Several GOP senators and Indiana Gov. Mike Braun have reported swatting, intimidation and and bomb threats. Their stances on redistricting run the gamut, from opposed to undecided to supportive.
“I honored their will … but I received their full support,” Qaddoura added. “If this legislation makes it to the Senate floor, they will be voting in favor of it.”
House Speaker Todd Huston previously said he’d support a federal ban.
“Ultimately, I hope Congress takes action to prohibit mid-decade redistricting to ensure every state is operating under the same rules,” he said in a statement last month. “But … the fight is already here. The choice is whether we choose to unilaterally disengage or use every legal tool at our disposal to win and ensure Republicans have a fair chance in upcoming federal elections.”

	“John Crowther brings a deep understanding of Alaska’s natural resources and a proven commitment to responsible stewardship. His balanced approach to development and conservation makes him an exceptional choice to lead the Department of Natural Resources and serve the long-term interests of Alaskans,” Dunleavy said in a statement.

After that, he returned to DNR, the governor’s statement said.
“The Department’s constitutional mission to develop, conserve and maximize the use of Alaska’s natural resources is critical to our state,” Crowther said in the governor’s statement. “I will continue working as hard as I can to advance this mission and improve Alaska’s future through stewardship and responsible use of our resources.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)With one day to go until the Middle Tennessee U.S. Congressional special election, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson headlined a rally in Franklin for Republican Matt Van Epps, while Democrat Aftyn Behn campaigned in Clarksville.
The two candidates are locked into a tight race, vying to replace former Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green, who resigned from the seat in July. 
Johnson and other speakers — including President Donald Trump, who Johnson called mid-rally — not only promoted Van Epps but also heavily criticized Behn. 
“You’ve got a radical on the ballot, we can’t hardly believe it,” said Johnson. “I thought Tennessee was deep red — how did it happen?”
“This is not a game: this is a dangerous far leftist, and (Behn) will be a rubber stamp for (U.S. House Minority Leader) Hakeem Jeffries and (U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez) and all the radicals in Congress,” he said.

Trump called Van Epps “fantastic.”
“He’s for everything that we represent,” said Trump, before saying Behn is getting “a lot of publicity cause she’s got a little something weird and television is doing whatever it can.”
While campaigning in Clarksville, Behn countered the Republican attacks by saying the Republican Party has no plans for lowering cost of living.
District 7 is a Republican stronghold which Trump won by 22% in the 2024 presidential election. The GOP has held the seat since 1982, through several redistricting cycles. 
But the race has become a priority for both parties since Democrats swept the Nov. 4 elections in other states, including New Jersey and Virginia — both of which elected Democratic governors — and in New York City, where Zohran Mandami won the mayoral election. 
Democrats across the nation drew hope from the November results and gave Republicans, who hold a three-seat majority in the U.S. House, anxiety about winning in Tennessee. A recent Emerson College/The Hill poll showed the race has narrowed to a 2% margin between the two candidates heading into Election Day.
Behn was elected to the legislature in a 2023 special election to replace the late Rep. Bill Beck. She beat three other candidates — including fellow state Reps. Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell  — to win the Democratic nomination. During her House tenure, she has twice proposed bills that would eliminate Tennessee’s grocery tax. 
GOP rally draws every prominent state Republican
Other speakers at the Van Epps rally included U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, U.S. Reps. Tim Burchett, Andy Ogles and John Rose, as well as several candidates who lost to Van Epps in the Oct. 2 Republican primary. 
One of those, Rep. Jody Barrett, the Dickson Republican who finished second in the primary, said it was the first Van Epps event he attended. 
About 300 people attended the event, held at the home of Willis Johnson, a billionaire and Republican donor, who is also the grandfather of state Rep. Jake McCalmon, a Franklin Republican. 
In making what is one of his final pitches to GOP voters, Van Epps said he plans to win decisively.

“We have the right solutions, the right plan to address affordability to drive down costs, to work on health care, childcare, housing and energy,” he said. “That’s what the president stands for, that’s what the speaker (Johnson) stands for.”
“The alternative is unacceptable,” said Van Epps. 
Mike Sholar of Franklin, who said he attended the rally because Van Epps shares similar values, referenced Mandami in speaking to the Lookout. 
“I am scared to death that what happened in New York will happen in my backyard,” he said.

Donations lean towards Behn, dark money spending split
Since the primary, Behn has out-fundraised Van Epps, posting just over $1 million in donations raised between the Oct. 15 pre-primary financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission and the Nov. 12 filing. For the same period, Van Epps reported raising $590,000. 
Money from independent groups has poured into both sides, with about $7 million being spent as of Nov. 25. 
Johnson is only one of the national politicians who have weighed into the race: Trump endorsed Van Epps in the primary and has held two tele-rallies for him, with another scheduled for Monday night. 
Former Vice-President Kamala Harris urged Democrats to vote during a visit to Nashville in November, and former Vice-President Al Gore, a Tennessean, will join U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York and Pramila Jayapal of Washington in a Monday tele-rally. 
Hagerty told the Lookout that despite the district’s regular Republican voting record, he takes nothing for granted.
“This is a special election, typically low turnout. That means they’re vulnerable to being gamed and we could get a result that doesn’t reflect the district.”

This story was originally reported by Ebony JJ Curry of The 19th.  Meet Ebony and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Seventy years have passed since Rosa Parks refused to surrender her seat on a Montgomery bus, and yet the country still tries to shrink her into that single moment — a tired seamstress who’d simply had enough.
Detroit, the city where she chose to continue her life, insists on remembering her differently. Not as an icon frozen in time, but as a Black woman whose lifelong organizing stretched from sexual violence cases in rural Alabama to open housing fights on Detroit’s west side.
That fuller story  — truth beyond the myth — is exactly what the Rosa Parks Scholarship Foundation has fought to tell for 45 years.
The Rosa Parks Scholarship Foundation (RPSF) has awarded more than $3 million in scholarships to more than 2,250 high school seniors since its founding by The Detroit News and the Detroit Public Schools (DPS) in 1980.
“Most people actually don’t know the story of Rosa Parks,” said Dr. Danielle McGuire, RPSF board member, historian and author of “At the Dark End of the Street”, whose research permanently shifted how historians write about Parks and the civil rights movement. “She’s so much more interesting, so much more radical, and so much more involved in all kinds of things that we forget about. We keep her stuck on the bus in Montgomery in 1955.”
According to Kim Trent, a  Detroit civic leader and former board president, the foundation, created through a racial discrimination lawsuit settlement involving Stroh’s Brewing Company, became one of the rare instances where federal accountability for racism produced long-term investment in Black futures.












Most people actually don't know the story of Rosa Parks.


– Dr. Danielle McGuire




A judge, DPS and The Detroit News agreed the money should honor Parks — who was living in Detroit and working for Rep. John Conyers at the time — by funding scholarships for Michigan students devoted to service and social change.
It is a statewide program, reaching students from Detroit to Grand Rapids to rural school districts where scholarship dollars often determine whether higher education is possible at all.
That framing makes her legacy active, not ceremonial.
“As part of her family, I feel grateful to be able to work together with my fellow board members to keep fighting for more opportunities to continue to provide scholarships,” said Erica Thedford, Parks’ great-niece and a foundation trustee. “I think Auntie Rosa would be extremely proud of what the Foundation has been able to achieve.”
The numbers tell one story — more than 1,000 scholars, millions awarded, forty $2,500 scholarships each year — and the essays tell another. Applicants must identify a modern social issue and explain how they would confront it using principles Parks embodied: discipline, non-negotiable dignity, community before self.
“Reading the essays of the students who apply is a great reminder that each person doing one act, no matter how small, creates a stronger network of love and kindness,” Thedford said. “Some of these students come from extreme hardship and still find the time and resources to volunteer at food banks, shelters… Some even take it upon themselves to be the organizer of ways to help the less fortunate at their schools.”
The award is one-time, not renewable, yet its impact stretches across decades.
“Once you become a Rosa Parks Scholarship Foundation recipient, you are a Rosa Parks Scholar for life,” Thedford said. “These students are now part of a network of people who root for each other, and that kind of support system is important.”
Trent knows that firsthand: She was a Parks Scholar herself when she graduated from Cass Tech High School.
“I received the scholarship in 1987,” she said. “Ironically, not only did I get it, but my best friend… also received the same scholarship. And then her son got the scholarship like 30 years later.”
Trent said the scholarship’s origin mirrors Parks’ life — created in response to injustice and sustained through community action.
“It’s one of those rare occasions where something beautiful grew out of an instance of racism and oppression,” Trent said.
Over the years, some Parks Scholars attended community college. Others enrolled at flagship universities. All had to articulate how their education would serve a community beyond themselves.
Some, like Emmy-winning actor Courtney B. Vance, who’s from Highland Park, Michigan, went on to shape national culture. Others are now attorneys, educators and nonprofit leaders across the state.
“What gets lost in what she did is the reason she did it,” Trent added. “It wasn’t just so she could sit on a bus. It was because she was trying to open up opportunity for people who had been denied opportunity.”
That is the heartbeat of the foundation’s lineage.
Parks was not simply resisting segregation. She was rejecting the entire machinery that kept Black women from safety, education and economic autonomy.
McGuire’s research highlights how Rosa Parks was investigating sexual violence cases long before #MeToo, defending Black girls like Recy Taylor, whose voices were dismissed in courtrooms and newspapers. She worked alongside the NAACP on equity cases. When she left Alabama under threat of death and moved to Detroit, she became the neighbor who knew everyone’s children, the church member who attended every meeting, the woman who collected information and names and needs.
“She was the person in the neighborhood who knew all the kids, who worked in almost every community organization you can imagine, to make life better for her people,” McGuire said. “The scholarship foundation is an example of that — just one of many.”
Every year, nearly 400 applicants encounter that fuller history — the Parks who fought for open housing in Detroit, who believed in Black self-determination, who, as McGuire notes, “never stopped fighting for equality and justice for people who didn’t have a voice that was being heard.”
That is not accidental. It is by design.
“We ask our applicants to become familiar with Rosa Parks and the tactics and strategies she used to make changes in her community and how they will do the same,” McGuire said. “I think it gives them hope. It links them to a tradition and a history of hope and change.”
This anniversary of Parks’ arrest arrives as school boards strip Black history from K-12 classrooms and as scholarship programs for marginalized students come under attack. Thedford sees the foundation’s work as a refusal.












No matter how hard people try to cancel the past, the past is very much alive.


– Dr. Danielle McGuire




“During this time, when we are hearing of funding being pulled from schools and programs that are needed to serve our youth, the Foundation is able to continue its provision of funds,” she said.
McGuire is blunt about what that represents:
“No matter how hard people try to cancel the past, the past is very much alive,” she said. “Rosa Parks’ history gives us so much honesty about America… and studying her is paramount to getting through any difficult time.”
Seventy years later, the lesson remains unchanged: Rosa Parks did not fight for a place to sit, she fought for the generations who would rise. Today, those students are still applying, still studying her strategies, still refusing to yield.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rosa-Parks-statue-Nov-14-2025-700x467-1.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Minneapolis-based attorney Chris Madel, whose high-profile defense of a state trooper charged with murder raised his profile last year, launched a campaign for Minnesota governor Monday. He joins a growing field of candidates who will battle for the Republican nomination.
Madel represented State Patrol Officer Ryan Londregan, who was charged with murder and manslaughter after he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II in 2023. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty wound up dropping the charges against Londregan.
Madel is also an attorney for the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association and the conservative news site Alpha News.
“Minnesota has been bled dry by special interests and fraudsters under Tim Walz’s failed leadership,” Madel said in a statement. “This needs to end and it will end with me as governor of Minnesota.”
Madel grew up in Waseca and was a trial attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division. He has a long history of defending law enforcement and white collar criminals, and he helped the late Minnesota Twins Hall of Famer Kirby Puckett win an acquittal against felony criminal charges in 2003.
Alliance for a Better Minnesota, a well-financed group aligned with Democrats, released a statement, saying Madel would be a “rubber stamp on President Trump’s harmful agenda.” Perhaps seeking to help his Republican opponents, ABM pointed out that Madel has contributed to Walz’s previous campaigns.
Other Republicans running include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth; Republican Rep. Kristin Robbins; 2022 GOP nominee for governor Scott Jensen; and Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive.
If Republicans can raise money and blanket the media, they’ll have plenty to work with to attack Walz’s nearly eight years in office, especially the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars from government programs.
In the past week, Walz and the state garnered national attention for the fraud that has infiltrated at least two of Minnesota’s Medicaid programs, in addition to the pandemic food aid program fraud known as the Feeding Our Future scandal. Trump has been attacking Walz and Minnesota’s Somali community for days.
The New York Times over the weekend published a front-page article detailing the fraud that has occurred in recent years.
Walz — who is seeking a third, four-year term — went on “Meet the Press” Sunday, where he was asked about Trump’s comments and his stewardship of Minnesota.
“I take responsibility for putting people in jail. Governors don’t get to just talk theoretically, we have to solve problems. And I will note, it’s not just Somalis. Minnesota is a generous state, Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We’re AAA bond rated. But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We’re doing everything we can. But to demonize an entire community on the actions of a few? It’s lazy,” Walz said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/P1163918-scaled-e1764617500172-1024x635.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Getty Images)The Florida Bar last week opened a disciplinary file on a Miami Beach City Commission candidate accused of defaming a local filmmaker who reported on her lasting affinity for her father, the serial killer inspiration for “Dexter” executed in 2012.
Monique Pardo Pope, one of two candidates in the Dec. 9 run-off election for the seat, has until the day after the election to respond to allegations that she defamed South Florida filmmaker Billy Corben when she claimed that he’d lost a defamation case.
This came after Corben discovered that her father was Manuel Pardo, an ex-cop turned drug dealer who murdered nine people in the 1980s and was executed for his crimes in 2012. Pardo Pope has since called her father her “hero,” signing off one Instagram post with his last words on the Florida State Prison’s execution table.
Opening a disciplinary file is the second step in a lengthy process to determine whether a Florida attorney has violated the Bar’s rules, although just 25% of yearly complaints against lawyers reach this step. This step simply means that if a complaint’s accusations are proven true, Bar rules would have been violated.
It is not an outright sign of guilt or non-compliance.
“The enclosed letter is an official inquiry by bar counsel,” reads the notice of grievance procedures emailed to Pardo Pope on Nov. 25, five days after Corben filed his Bar complaint.  “If you do not respond, the matter will be forwarded to the grievance committee for disposition … . Failure to respond may also be a matter of contempt.”
The letter asks the candidate to respond to Corben’s allegations by Dec. 10 via mail or email.
What happened?
The case emerged after the Miami New Times picked up Corben’s Sep. 25 report on Instagram that Pardo Pope’s father was a pro-Nazi, anti-Black serial killer executed by the state for the deaths of South Florida drug dealers and bystanders alike. Pardo Pope was four years old when the crimes occurred.
When the Times asked her to respond to Corben’s claims, she accused the filmmaker — known for documentaries like “Cocaine Cowboys” — of making a career off of “slinging mud, which has even resulted in losing a defamation case.”
Corben, who had not lost the defamation case against his movie-making company, in turn filed a Nov. 20 Bar complaint against Pardo Pope for allegedly defaming him.
He told the Phoenix at the time that his complaint was “not about the sins of the father, but about the lies of the daughter.”
When searching the Pardos family’s Hialeah apartment at the time, Corben said, officers found a family dog named “Satan,” tattooed with a swastika, Polaroid photos of Pardo’s victims, and a slew of anti-Black and anti-Jewish memorabilia.
After his death, Pardo Pope lauded her father as a “guiding light” on social media, vowing to bring the “kind of leadership” she learned from her family to City Hall.
“Happiest of Birthdays to this little girl’s first true love — her Daddy. You would’ve been 59 years young today. Missing you each and everyday, mi papi bello….my guiding light in the sky, my eternal best friend,” she wrote in 2015, including a photo of him holding her as a baby.
She signed it off with his final words on the execution table, “Airborne forever, love your Michi girl.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 19:22:35+00:00,CT Mirror,New Haven plant now the East Coast’s largest producer of biofuels,P.R. Lockhart and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/american-greenfuels-biodiesel-energy-manufacturing-ct/,American GreenFuels' growth has been spurred by laws requiring fuel dealers to blend home heating oil with biodiesel to reduce emissions.,"Inside a green metal-clad building in the Port of New Haven, a kind of modern day alchemy is at work, turning used cooking oil into fuel capable of powering trucks and heating homes.
Within a maze of tightly stacked tanks, pipes and collection units, workers take the grease — or other available waste products such as animal fats, tallow and vegetable oils — and add an alcohol catalyst to trigger a chemical reaction that produces biodiesel, which is marketed as a more climate friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels.
A series of rapid expansions in recent years has made the plant, home of American GreenFuels, the largest producer of biodiesel on the East Coast.
Originally opened in 2011 as Greenleaf Biofuels, the plant was later purchased by the American division of Swiss commodities trader Kolmar Group and renamed American GreenFuels. Since 2016, its output has quadrupled, from 15 million gallons to nearly 60 million gallons a year.
The most recent expansion, completed this summer, added a second story to the production floor.
“It often smells like french fries, as you might expect,” said Paul Teta, the vice president and general counsel for Kolmar Americas, which is based in Shelton.
The company’s growth has been spurred, in part, by government subsidies and laws requiring fuel dealers to blend home heating oil with biodiesel in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Teta declined to say how much the company has invested in its New Haven plant, other than to say it was in the “many millions of dollars.”
According to Kolmar, the biodiesel made at its New Haven facility produces 86% less greenhouse gas emissions, on average, compared with ultralow-sulfur heating oil. The emissions reductions are even more substantial when the fuel is sold and burned in Connecticut, removing the need to transport it long distances on trucks.
New York City passed the nation’s first blended biofuel mandate in 2012 and was followed by a state laws in New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
Connecticut’s law, Public Act 181 of 2021, required that heating oils contain at least a 5% blend of biodiesel starting in 2022. That amount increased to 10% this year and is set to grow steadily until reaching a minimum 50% blend in 2035. (Roughly 400 million gallons of fuel oil is delivered each year in Connecticut, according to the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association.)
In addition to state incentives, biodiesel fuels were previously eligible for a $1 per gallon federal tax credit. As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, those credits were replaced by other tax incentives based on lowering carbon emissions. Despite what he called an “ambiguity” around the changes to federal policy, Teta said that increasing blended fuel ratios in the Northeast has provided stability to the industry.
“When the law got passed, that gave us enough certainty to be able to make the next level of investment,” Teta said.
“The federal program’s certainly still important, because it incentivizes the price, otherwise biodiesel would be more expensive,” he added. “We want to keep the price low. So all put together, it has been a good mix for us to be able to expand.”
A controversial energy source
Not everyone is happy about the push to adopt biofuels. Environmental advocates, including the Sierra Club, have argued that biodiesel perpetuates a reliance on fossil fuels and that states should instead seek to transition as rapidly as possible to all-electric options such as heat pumps.
“Electrification is really the answer for reducing emissions from vehicles and from home heating,” said Samantha Dynowski, the president of the Connecticut chapter of the Sierra Club. “We just want to make sure that our emphasis is on the long term solution, not kind of a bridge, because the more we invest in this, the less you can get off of it.”
Supporters of biofuels, however, say they offer a path for states like to Connecticut to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next several decades. Earlier this year, Gov. Ned Lamont signed a law setting a statewide net-zero emissions target by 2050.

Chris Herb, the president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, said the state’s reliance on natural gas to meet its energy needs, along with the high cost of building out greener technologies such as solar and wind, make the expansion of biofuels essential to meeting to those targets.
“There’s no way to blend [natural gas] down like we can petroleum,” Herb said. “Our industry is the only way we, the state of Connecticut, are going to be able to continue to make gains in carbon dioxide reductions in the fastest, least expensive way.”
But even biodiesel production has faced concerns around environmental pollution. In September, the EPA announced that American GreenFuels will pay $143,000 to settle penalties in the wake of Clean Air Act violations that occurred at the plant between 2020 and 2022. In a press release, the federal agency explained that it “found that the facility failed to control the release of certain air pollutants” during maintenance and system repairs. 
When asked to respond to questions about the violations and the settlement, Kolmar Americas did not offer a detailed response. 
“American GreenFuels, LLC is in compliance with the Clean Air Act,” Teta said in an email.
When it comes to the carbon-reducing benefits of biofuels, it also depends on the kind of feedstock that goes into the production process.
Oils that are processed directly from crops such as soybeans and corn require land clearing and mechanical harvesting that itself produces more emissions than recycled feedstocks such as used cooking oil. Only 36% of the biofuels produced nationally in 2022 came from waste or recycled feedstocks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Teta declined to say what percentage of American GreenFuels’ products is recycled, but he said historically the company has sourced most of its feedstock from waste products.
That could change next year, he said, due to the elimination of tax penalties for biofuels derived directly from crops. The change, which was implemented as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump in July, is likely to result in American GreenFuels using more bean oils in its production.
“We are mindful that we must remain competitive and diffuse the market’s concern that we will be priced out of the market for waste feedstocks and therefore become uncompetitive,” Teta said in an email. 
Currently, Teta said the company sources cooking oil from more than 5,000 locations, including restaurants in New York City where it’s shipped to New Haven on trucks or barges. Middlemen who pick up the oil from the restaurants or food manufacturing facilities are supposed to filter it to remove bits of food and other impurities. Still, workers sometimes have to remove those impurities once the feedstock arrives or rejigger their process based on the types of oil used in frying machines.
“Using all these waste streams, all these different types of oil, it makes it harder on ourselves,” said Sean Hayden, the quality lab manager at American GreenFuels. “Luckily, our formulation is flexible.”
A growing business
The biodiesel industry has expanded considerably in recent years, a shift that has helped expand biodiesel applications beyond transportation to include uses like electric power and heating oil, one of the main uses of biodiesel in Connecticut. Those changes have had broader economic effects: Recent research found the biodiesel industry generated nearly $42.5 billion in economic impact nationally in 2024, along with 107,400 jobs and $5.8 billion in wages.  
While American GreenFuels is one of a handful of East Coast operations, much of the growth in biofuels — a broader category that includes ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable hydrocarbon fuels— has been concentrated in the Midwest. The majority of corn-based ethanol and biodiesel production takes place in states like Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, where crops used for these fuels are grown. That expansion has led to concerns that some crops, like corn, are being diverted to biofuel production rather than the food supply.

The exact impact of corn-based biofuel production on food supplies and prices has been a point of contention between environmental groups and biofuel supporters. Biodiesel industry experts say other production methods, like the use of soybeans and specific operations like American GreenFuels’ use of previously used oils and fats, sidestep those tensions.
“There’s no food-for-fuel issue,” said Stephen Dodge, the director of state regulatory affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, the trade organization that represents American GreenFuels and other member organizations. “It’s not like ethanol.” 
In its latest biodiesel plant production capacity report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration found there were 48 biodiesel production plants operating in the U.S. as of January 2025. Collectively, those plants are capable of producing nearly 2 billion gallons of biodiesel in a year.  
And the industry is expected to grow further. Estimates currently suggest that biodiesel use could top 6 billion gallons by 2030 and reach 15 billion gallons by 2050. 
But production has faced headwinds in 2025, with biodiesel output falling earlier this year due to uncertainty around the future of federal tax credits and lower-than-expected profit margins.
Even so, American GreenFuels’ growth has made it a notable example of the manufacturing industry’s efforts to bounce back in Connecticut. The biodiesel industry supports some 1,250 jobs in the region, according to Clean Fuels Alliance America, and brought in some $47 million in revenue, according to Dodge. 
Supporters of biofuels argue that the energy source can help serve as a transitional step as the country moves towards electrification. 
“It’s really paramount upon private industry and government to do everything they can to start reducing carbon emissions as quickly as they can,” said Dodge. “We think that biomass-based diesel is the way to go.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GreenFuels-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced Monday that applications were open to farmers, small businesses and nonprofits for cost-share grants to improve processing, equipment, facilities, training, food safety, continuing education and more. 
Iowa producers of locally made and raised products are eligible for up to $25,000 in matching funds, per project, from the state as part of the Choose Iowa program.
Choose Iowa is a network of more than 300 farmers, businesses and nonprofit organizations selling Iowa-made goods. The program is sponsored and marketed by the state. 
In April, IDALS awarded 33 value-added grants to producers. The grant requires a one-to-one match from recipients, which brought the 2025 investment total to $1.3 million for value-added improvements. Awarded projects included storage improvements, well and irrigation systems, automated bagging equipment, refrigeration and on farm-sale systems, according to the April release from IDALS. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said Monday in a news release Choose Iowa funding is helping farmers and small businesses “capture” the momentum building for local Iowa products. 
“These value-added grants make it possible for innovative projects to move from dream to reality, whether that’s expanding processing capacity, upgrading equipment, or creating new customer ready products,” Naig said. “I encourage farmers, small-businesses, and entrepreneurs to learn more and apply. Every successful Choose Iowa project strengthens our rural communities and gives consumers more access to the fresh and local products they are looking for.”
The Legislature allocated $500,000 for the value-added grants in 2025-2026 fiscal year. The Legislature also stipulated another $500,000 of the Choose Iowa total budget would go to the program’s dairy innovation grants, which similarly help local dairies with infrastructure and training improvement
Since 2022 IDALS has funded 100 projects with the Choose Iowa value-added grant program, with a total state investment of $1.6 million. 
Applications for the grant, and additional instructions are available online, where they must be submitted before noon on Jan. 16, 2026. IDALS said recipients of the grants will be announced in the spring.

(Phto by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)President Donald Trump’s unprecedented plan to redraw state congressional maps to preserve the GOP’s narrow majority in the House ahead of the 2026 election has hit some bumps, but Republicans appear confident they can flip several Democratic seats in Florida, where the first steps in that process will begin this week.
A select House committee on congressional redistricting will convene Thursday afternoon in Tallahassee. It’s the first legislative meeting on the issue since Gov. Ron DeSantis said in July that it would be “appropriate to do a redistricting” in the middle of the decade. He followed up on that in August, saying that he and Attorney General James Uthmeier supported an update to the 2020 Decennial Census.
DeSantis said Florida had been “shortchanged in the reapportionment stemming from the last census” in 2020, although no new update to that census has taken place.
Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell slammed the proposal Monday, saying the only reason it is happening is because Trump wants to “rig” next year’s midterm elections because “he wants to stop Americans from holding his administration accountable for their bad decisions.”
‘Swamp-like cynical behavior’
“Any attempt to draw new maps in Florida right now is a direct response to the president’s pressure to stack the deck before the midterms, and that is illegal in Florida,” Driskell said on a Zoom press conference for Florida reporters.
“The Fair Districts amendments to the Florida Constitution outlaw drawing maps to benefit one party over another. Redistricting decides who represents us in our government. A process that must serve the people, not politicians. This isn’t something that the people asked for. This is just the swamp-like cynical behavior that people hate about politics.”
Florida’s Fair District amendments prohibit line-drawing that intentionally favors or disfavors a political party or incumbent.
With the Democrats in superminority status in both chambers of the Legislature, Driskell acknowledged her party can’t stop GOP members but said she is putting some hope in the Senate rejecting the move.
“We don’t have the numbers to stop this, but we haven’t seen what’s going to happen in the Senate yet and, interestingly, more and more we’re watching our state Senate become a backstop to guard against some of the more dangerous whims of the legislation that we see coming out from the House.”
Senate Republicans, who hold a 26-11 advantage over Democrats in that chamber, haven’t said much about the idea of congressional redistricting since the governor’s comments over the summer.
“I’d like to see some data on the magnitude of people in the state of Florida who might be here illegally who have been part of the calculation on re-districting,” Pinellas County Republican state Sen. Nick DiCeglie told the Phoenix last month.
“I think that we should have redistricting based on United States citizens, and we’ll see how that plays out here, if possible. It’s always good to focus on U.S. citizens and see exactly what needs to be done to accomplish that.”
Senate President Ben Albritton hasn’t made any comments about redistricting, and no committee that would oversee the issue has been formed yet in that chamber.
Driskell said she has taken solace from the fact that several Republicans in Indiana have spoken critically of congressional redistricting in their state. However, after pressure from the White House, Indiana House Republicans Monday proposed a redrawing that would let their party control all nine House seats (Democrats hold two of the state’s nine seats).
The first congressional redistricting took place in Texas earlier this year. That came after Trump said during the summer that Republicans were “entitled to five more seats” in the Lone Star State.
A federal court blocked Texas last month from using its new map, ruling that it is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, and ordered the state to use its previous map in the 2026 election. The new map is now back in place, at least temporarily, after Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito granted the state’s request to pause that federal court’s ruling.
Tampa Bay-area Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor says Tallahassee Republicans should be focused on lowering Floridians’ property insurance and electricity bills, not redistricting. “I think it’s a waste of time and money,” she told the Phoenix last week.
Florida Republicans represent 20 of the state’s 28 congressional districts.
Ahead of the committee meeting Thursday, a group of voting and civil rights organizations calling themselves the “No Partisan Maps” coalition are scheduled to hold a protest in front of the Capitol. The Florida House Select Committee hearing on congressional redistricting will begin at 1:30 p.m.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_0003-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

Clark was a registered Democrat for years, but left because he believes he can “do the most good” with like-minded people in the Republican Party, according to his campaign website. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who has held the seat for eight years, said in early November that he would not seek reelection next year. In his announcement, Golden said he hoped his exit would clear the way for competitive primaries for both parties.
With Golden out of the running, there are currently three Democrats vying for the seat as well, including State Auditor Matt Dunlap, Louis Sigel, who formerly served as secretary for the Kennebec County Democratic Committee, and Jordan Wood, who switched from the race to unseat U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to the CD2 election after Golden’s announcement.
To qualify for the primaries, candidates for the U.S. House must gather between 1,000 and 1,250 signatures from registered voters by mid-March. Candidates can start circulating petitions after the new year.
Though the district has been held by a Democrat in recent years, 2nd District voters also backed President Donald Trump three times. 
In addition to fighting for free speech, excellence in education, secure borders, lower costs and smaller government, Clark described himself on his website as “pro-working class, pro-family, pro-opportunity, and very anti-authoritarian.”
With undiagnosed dyslexia and struggling grades, Clark said he dropped out during his sophomore year of high school and later enlisted in the military. 
He cites his difficulty in school as motivating his desire to see Maine and the nation receive top ranking for education. He would like to see more support for students to explore careers in the trades, as well as increased critical thinking, art and music education.
Campaign sweatshirts and other merchandise highlight the fact that Clark is “not a politician” while a page explaining his commitment to “unity, equality and fair opportunity” quotes philosophers including Frederick Douglass and Alexis de Toucqueville.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/547941085_10161606171392539_8864802727047476566_n-e1764612149676.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Franklin County Property Valuation Administrator photo)The Kentucky Democratic Party has sold its longtime headquarters near Interstate 64 and plans to move to a new office in downtown Frankfort. 
The state party, which has seen its power dwindle in recent decades, will move to an office on Ann Street Friday, Dec. 5, in hopes of being more accessible to lawmakers, advocates and reporters working at the state Capitol.
The Kentucky Democratic Party (KDP) finalized the sale of the building on Tuesday to a business, Means Drive of Nicholasville, for $540,000, according to Franklin County property records.
Democrats bought the site on Democrat Drive near I-64 in 1973 for $25,000. The building was named in honor of former Democratic U.S. Sen. Wendell H. Ford, who represented the state in Washington until 1999. He was governor at the time the party bought the property.
The Republican Party of Kentucky, which celebrated the grand opening of an expansion of its party headquarters in November, called the Democrats’ move “another sign of their continual decline.” Around the turn of the 21st century, Democrats began losing ground in Kentucky, as Republican nominees regularly won the state’s electoral votes in presidential elections and the congressional delegation became a majority of Republicans. The GOP eventually took an overwhelming majority of seats in the state House and Senate. 
“Since Governor Beshear took office Kentucky Republicans have flipped voter registration, expanded our supermajorities and now hold nearly every federal and constitutional office,” said RPK spokesman Adam Hope in a statement. “The Beshear playbook is simple. Ride Republican success while ignoring the collapse happening inside your own party.”
However, KDP said the Republicans should have bigger concerns than where the Democrats’ headquarters is. 
“The Republican Party of Kentucky should be more concerned about Kentuckians losing jobs, food and health care as a result of the GOP-backed federal budget than they are about KDP headquarters,” said KDP Executive Director Morgan Eaves. “But we haven’t seen a GOP press release on those issues in a long time.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kdphq-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 13:57:45.229773

The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown is causing heartache and consternation for thousands upon thousands of North Carolinians. What’s more it’s not just people lacking proper documentation who are being negatively impacted. As NC Newsline journalist Brandon Kingdollar recently reported, in many instances, it’s American citizens and lawful residents who are being wrongfully targeted and harmed, and recently, we caught up with Brandon to learn more. We also got a chance to ask him about another controversial federal law enforcement initiative – this one targeting a product that millions of Americans have grown used to being lawful.

Free.,Congress to probe U.S. strikes on boats in Caribbean,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-probe-us-strikes-boats-caribbean,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate and House Armed Services committees will open bipartisan inquiries into U.S. military strikes on suspected drug-running boats in the Caribbean Sea, with a focus on an alleged follow-on attack that The Washington Post reported killed two survivors of the initial operation.Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I., issued a joint statement Friday promising “vigorous oversight” of the killings.“The Committee is aware of recent news reports — and the Department of Defense’s initial response — regarding alleged follow-on strikes on suspected narcotics vessels in the SOUTHCOM (Southern Command) area of responsibility. The Committee has directed inquiries to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances,” Wicker and Reed said.Similarly, House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash., said in a joint statement Saturday that the panel “is committed to providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean.”“We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” according to the statement.The inquiries mark a rare bipartisan check on President Donald Trump’s administration since his second term began in January. With the exception of voting to release the federal case files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump eventually endorsed, Republicans have largely left Trump’s decisions and policies unchallenged.Follow-on attack reportedLawmakers’ attention was retrained on the already legally questionable U.S. operations targeting alleged narcotics boats after an investigative report published Friday by The Washington Post revealed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth gave verbal orders to kill everyone during a Sept. 2 operation —  the first of several U.S. boat strikes in the Caribbean Sea that have killed roughly 80.According to the report, two survivors clung to burning wreckage after an initial hit. Adm. Frank M. “Mitch” Bradley, who was commanding the attack from Fort Bragg in North Carolina, ordered a second, or follow-on, strike to fulfill Hegseth’s order and kill the remaining survivors. States Newsroom has not independently confirmed the details.Hegseth called the report “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory,” in a post on social media Friday.Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told CBS News’ “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” on Sunday the follow-on strike could rise “to the level of a war crime if it’s true.”""If that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DoD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance,"" Kaine said.A working group of former military lawyers issued a statement Friday urging Congress to investigate the Sept. 2 strike.“Since orders to kill survivors of an attack at sea are ‘patently illegal,’ anyone who issues or follows such orders can and should be prosecuted for war crimes, murder, or both,” according to the statement published by Just Security, a journal focused on national security published by the New York University School of Law Reiss Center on Law and Security.A bipartisan effort, led by Kaine, to stop Trump’s deadly strikes in the Caribbean narrowly failed in the Senate in early November.Trump echoes Hegseth denialTrump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday he “wouldn’t have wanted that” when asked about the alleged follow-on strike that killed the two survivors.“The first strike was very lethal. It was fine, and if there were two people around — but Pete (Hegseth) said that didn't happen,” Trump told reporters. “Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump continued in a back-and-forth with the press.Trump also said Saturday he was closing the airspace above Venezuela, but told a reporter who asked Sunday if the move previewed a U.S. airstrike of the country not to “read anything into it.”“To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY,” he wrote on his own social media platform just before 8 a.m. Eastern Saturday.Trump confirmed reports he spoke to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro late last month but would not reveal details of the conversation.The U.S. has been amassing Navy vessels and troops off the coast of Venezuela for months, including the recent addition in mid-November of the Navy’s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford.",,,,2025-12-01 13:57:45.229773

Everett Thomas Pierce passed away peacefully on November 28, 2025. Tom was born June 24,1947 to Yvette A. and Everett T. Pierce in Stamford, Connecticut where he was raised. After graduating from Saint Michael’s College in Vermont he returned to Connecticut to his first job in advertising in New York City during the MadMen days. Vermont had spoiled him so he returned to the Green Mountains to work with Fayston Company who owned and managed Glen Ellen ski area. In 1977 he partnered with Michael Kehoe to open a fine men’s clothing store on the corner of Church and College Street in the City of Burlington, where they had a partnership for 42 years. After Michael retired in 2020, Tom rebranded the business naming it MK Clothing, with partners Sadie and Hagen Peyser, who are long time friends.
Tom served on many boards over the years including the Associate Board of the University of Vermont Medical Center, Friends of the Vermont State House and UVM’s Fleming Museum of Art. He also served multiple positions in the Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Vermont through his 13th generation descent from his namesake Thomas Pierce of Charlestown, Massachusetts.
Tom served as the co-curator in 2001 of Vermont’s 19th century landscape artist Charles Louis Heyde, with an accompanying book, featuring the paintings that were highlighted  at the UVM Fleming Museum of Art.

Dick Harpootlian, seen during a South Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee meeting in Columbia, S.C. on Tuesday, March 15, 2022, is the author of a book about famous serial killer Pee Wee Gaskins. (Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — During a break in the 1983 trial that sent Donald “Pee Wee” Gaskins to death row, the serial killer called for prosecutor Dick Harpootlian.
“You know, you’re just like me,” Gaskins said.
“You like killing,” Gaskins added. When Harpootlian asked what he meant, Gaskins told him, “You like killing me.”
That interaction stuck with Harpootlian, a Columbia attorney and former state senator. He wanted for years to write a book about Gaskins’ life and the 13 people he confessed to killing during the 1970s but struggled with how to frame it. The moral question he faced over pursuing the death penalty became his angle, he said.
Gaskins “was pure evil, and he got in my head,” Harpootlian said. “The book is about how I got to where I got, how he got to where he got, and how you wrestle with that.”
Harpootlian’s book, “Dig Me A Grave,” comes out Dec. 16.
Harpootlian will launch the book that evening in a conversation with Dawn Staley, coach of the University of South Carolina’s women’s basketball team and a true crime fan, at Columbia’s 701 Whaley event space.
Soon after Gaskins was executed in 1991, a clerk asked Harpootlian if he wanted to keep any evidence from the case. Looking through photographs, records of Gaskins’ arrest and the 300-page written confession Gaskins gave in 1978, Harpootlian realized there was enough for a book, he said. He kept all of it.
“It was a treasure trove of files on Gaskins,” said Harpootlian, a Democrat later elected to Richland County Council and as 5th Circuit solicitor (chief prosecutor for Richland and Kershaw counties) before he became a defense attorney. In 2018, voters sent the former state Democratic Party chairman to the state Senate.
When the COVID-19 pandemic ended the legislative session early and suspended trials, Harpootlian decided to get serious about telling Gaskins’ story. An agent got him in touch with author and journalist Shaun Assael, whose most recent book explored the death of boxer Sonny Liston.
Together, Harpootlian and Assael combed through the old case files and interviewed police officers and other witnesses involved in Gaskins’ investigations and trials. Harpootlian wrote down what he could recall and checked his own memories against those of other people involved, he said.
“I think there’s less speculation in this book than any other true crime book I’ve ever read, because I was there,” Harpootlian said. “I prosecuted. I saw every document. We interviewed every witness. I was in the courtroom for six weeks.”
Harpootlian was even on a first-name basis with Gaskins, a first for the then-prosecutor. The killer could charm just about anyone, and on his first day in the courtroom, he greeted Harpootlian by name.
“From then on, it was Dick and Pee Wee,” Harpootlian said.
Preparing to prosecute Gaskins for the killing of fellow inmate Rudolph Tyner, Harpootlian learned all the brutal details of how Gaskins killed at least 13 people and raped several of them. Gaskins drowned, beat and shot his victims to death, including a 2-year-old and her pregnant mother.
Gaskins later claimed he killed dozens more, but investigators only definitively linked him to those 13 cases.
Although a jury recommended the death penalty during Gaskins’ first murder trial in 1976, after finding him guilty of one of the killings, the state Supreme Court later changed his sentence to life in prison, finding the state’s law about executions unconstitutional.
A year later, a second jury found Gaskins guilty of killing farmer Silas Yates, but because the state’s death penalty law was still considered unconstitutional, Gaskins received another life sentence. Facing a third murder trial, Gaskins pleaded guilty to the 13 killings investigators had linked to him in exchange for eight more life sentences.
By the time Harpootlian stepped in to prosecute the 1982 killing of Tyner, a U.S. Supreme Court decision reinstating the death penalty nationwide made it an option once again. Harpootlian just had to decide whether to try again for a death sentence or allow Gaskins to remain in prison for the rest of his life.
The decision weighed on Harpootlian. He personally opposed the death penalty, but as a prosecutor, he took an oath to uphold the law, he said.
He also had to weigh any decision he made in the context of his own political ambitions.
Harpootlian went to his father, a World War II bomber, for advice. When Harpootlian asked whether his father regretted his actions during the war, his dad responded that everything he did was in self-defense.
Considering Gaskins found a way to kill a man inside the state’s most secure prison facility, Harpootlian decided the same thinking applied in his decision. Executing Gaskins would prevent him from harming anyone else in a way prison walls couldn’t, he said.
“I think the death penalty is appropriate where it’s self-defense,” Harpootlian said. “And Gaskins is self-defense.”
That much was clear when Gaskins attempted to hire someone to kidnap Harpootlian’s then-4-year-old daughter ahead of his execution date, Harpootlian said. When the time came for Gaskins’ 1991 execution, Harpootlian decided not to attend, in part out of fear over leaving his family alone and in part because he didn’t want to watch a man die.
Death row inmate becomes 3rd in SC executed by firing squad

“Wanting to watch somebody die would be what Pee Wee would do,” Harpootlian said. “And I’m not him.”
Grisly descriptions of Gaskins’ death in the electric chair prompted Harpootlian to propose as a legislator giving death row inmates a firing squad option.
His proposal came during Senate floor debate on legislation reverting to electrocution as the state’s primary execution method, which was signed into law in May 2021. Since the state Supreme Court upheld that law last year, three inmates have chosen to die by firing squad.
Harpootlian again ended up in the national spotlight defending Alex Murdaugh, who was convicted in 2023 of killing his wife and son two years prior. Perhaps one day he’ll write a book about that saga, which captured the attention of millions of people, he said.
But Gaskins’ story felt too unique to ignore, he added.
“Gaskins is, thank god, one of a kind,” Harpootlian said. “He was the most evil man I’ve ever met, and when you spend time with and become on a first name basis with evil, it haunts you even after he’s dead.”

Iowa Board of Regents President Sherry Bates announced Monday in a news release she will resign from the governing board Dec. 4, the day after a meeting is scheduled to elect new leaders. President Pro Tem Greta Rouse also stated she will step down from the position but remain on the board as a member. Her term as regent expires in 2027.
Bates said in the release she’s been “fortunate enough to serve on the board for nearly 11 years,” during which she worked with “outstanding” regents and staff, both for the board and universities, to accomplish their duties.

“It’s time for me to step back, spend more time with my family, and allow the next generation of Regent leadership to continue our good work,” Bates said in the release. “Iowa, Iowa State and UNI are among the best public universities in the country, and I look forward to seeing them continue to grow and excel.”
She also thanked Gov. Kim Reynolds and former Gov. Terry Branstad, who appointed and reappointed her to the board during her service. Bates’ term was set to end April 30, 2029, the release stated.
Rouse, who first served on the board as a student regent from 2008-2012, was appointed by Reynolds to the board again in 2021. She stated in the release she wants to focus on her family and “still young” children, and being a leader on the board is an “additional time commitment.”
“Iowa’s universities inspire the next generation, drive our economy, advance research, and enrich communities across the state,” Rouse said in the release. “Stepping down from leadership will allow me to do that while continuing to support their important work.”
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, released a statement on the announcement from Bates and Rouse, saying the changes in leadership “presents an opportunity to chart a new path for the Iowa Board of Regents.”
Collins has been outspoken about decisions made by the board of regents as well as state universities, including when university employees came under fire for discussing circumventing diversity, equity and inclusion changes on campus and posting on social media about right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk after his death and when President Donald Trump announced a new higher education compact.
“For years now, lawmakers have called for a change in direction for not only our universities, but also the Board of Regents,” Collins said in his statement. “I look forward to working with the next board president to continue to reform Iowa’s higher education system.”

Oct. 18, 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)A key environmentally-focused political group in Maine is backing Hannah Pingree for governor. 
Maine Conservation Voters Action Fund announced its support for the Democrat at a news conference Monday in Portland. The political action committee picked Pingree for the June 9 primary from a crowded field of big name Democrats because of her work related to climate change and transitioning to clean energy. 
Though the organization works to elect “climate and environmental champions” to serve as state legislators and governor, this is the first time it has made an endorsement in a gubernatorial primary.
“Maine needs a governor who has the courage to stand up to President Trump, and the savvy to win when she does. We need a governor who can build lasting coalitions and bring people together, but who will never compromise on her values and will fight for Maine’s people and communities,” said Maureen Drouin, executive director of Maine Conservation Voters.
So far in the president’s second term, the Trump administration has enacted a sweeping agenda to roll back environmental regulations, including on coal-fired power plants, water pollution, vehicle emissions and more. The administration has also sought to downplay the impact of global warming, such as with an executive order to remove signs throughout the nation’s national parks that explained how climate change was contributing to changing landscapes and what steps visitors could take to reduce their carbon emissions.
In light of that federal posture, the group highlighted Pingree’s current and former work in Maine to protect natural resources and public health. The speakers at the news conference Monday specifically mentioned legislation she sponsored as a state representative in 2008 to reduce children’s exposure to concerning chemicals, as well as a 2007 bill she led to ban toxic chemical flame retardants.
Pingree’s more recent work as part of the administration of Gov. Janet Mills also helped win her the favor of Maine Conservation Voters. As co-chair of the Maine Climate Council, she helped develop the state’s climate action plan. Through that work, the state created a storm recovery fund and programs to protect working waterfronts and other critical infrastructure from climate catastrophes. 
Pingree, who said she was honored to earn this endorsement, said that she would continue to fight on behalf of Maine’s people and environment if elected governor. She noted that she’s spent most of her life living in the island town of North Haven, including the time she served in the Maine House “representing my neighbors who make a living on the ocean where a clean environment is tied to livelihoods and the future of our communities.”
From 2019 to earlier this year, Pingree served as director of Maine’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, where she worked to make the state more resilient against extreme weather and led initiatives to help people lower their energy costs and transition their homes from fossil fuels to heat pumps.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 17:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"With $10M CDC grant, New Haven County seeks to battle stigma of opioid misuse",Sujata Srinivasan | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/new-haven-opioid-use-disorder-cdc-grant/,A new campaign in New Haven County is seeking to increase the number of people seeking treatment for opioid misuse disorders.,"A new campaign in New Haven County is seeking to increase the number of people seeking treatment for opioid misuse disorders.
It’s called End Stigma CT and is backed by a $10 million federal grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Stigma can lead to social isolation and prevent people from seeking treatment for a substance use disorder, according to the 2024 Shatterproof Addiction Stigma Index (SASI).
Stigma can take many forms: ER staff showing a bias when assessing pain in patients with substance use disorders, or people with substance use disorders avoiding police in emergencies because they fear arrest.
And stigma is a reality playing out across the country, including New Haven County, said Maritza Bond, health commissioner for the city of New Haven.
“Last year we saw that one in five individuals, who needed treatment for a substance use disorder received it,” Bond said, citing national data. “We want to increase that number.”
The campaign’s theme “It Started With” seeks to educate the community about stigma’s impact on people seeking help and to build empathy around how drug use can start for many people.
The concept was created following research with people who shared their experiences with opioids after an injury, or to cope with emotional or mental trauma like losing a family member, a divorce, or post traumatic stress disorder.
“Research shows that stigma is one of the greatest obstacles people face when trying to seek help,” Austin Telfold, overdose prevention navigator, Naugatuck Valley Health District, said in a statement. “We want our community to understand that addiction is not a moral failure — it’s a health condition that deserves empathy, treatment, and hope.”
The grant money will be used to hire patient navigators to go into communities and talk about stigma.
In the Eastshore Health District, which includes Guilford, Madison, Branford, East Haven and North Branford, stigma could look like denying that substance use exists in wealthy communities, said Theresa Heier, a nurse with Eastshore.
But substance use is a problem in wealthier communities, too, she said.
“It’s happening mostly in the home,” she said. “It’s not exactly happening on the streets where they can see it.”
“Part of the stigma campaign, we go into the community and try to normalize that, yes, this is a chronic disorder, just like diabetes or heart disease or anything else,” Heier said.
The grant runs through 2028.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)President Donald Trump suffered another loss Monday in his ongoing fight to make his former personal lawyer the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, with a federal appellate panel upholding a lower court ruling that disqualified Alina Habba from the post.
U.S. Third Circuit Judge D. Michael Fisher, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, said Habba’s continued service in a job she first took in March violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and undercuts constitutional protections meant to ensure the three branches of government remain separate but equal.
Fisher barred Habba from the job, affirming U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann’s August ruling, which Brann had put on hold pending appeal. This is a fight the Trump administration has been waging elsewhere in the country, including Virginia and Nevada, so Monday’s precedential ruling promises far-ranging impact.
Fisher noted that the Senate did not act to confirm Habba within the 120 days the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act requires, triggering a provision in the 2007 law that authorizes federal judges to appoint an interim replacement if the clock runs out without Senate action.
When New Jersey’s federal judges appointed Desiree Leigh Grace in July instead of Habba, Trump administration officials fired her and resorted to a string of maneuvers to keep Habba in the job. Those maneuvers served to “sidestep” the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and statutory requirements reflecting Congress’s intent for someone with “a breadth of experience to properly lead the office,” Fisher wrote.
“It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,” Fisher wrote. “Its efforts to elevate its preferred candidate for U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Alina Habba, to the role of Acting U.S. Attorney demonstrate the difficulties it has faced — yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U.S. Attorney’s Office deserve some clarity and stability.”
Fisher’s ruling, which came after both sides argued the case in October in Philadelphia, did not answer the question of who is the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, with Habba now disqualified. Spokespeople in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s office and the Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment.
Others celebrated the decision.
Abbe David Lowell, Gerald Krovatin, and Norm Eisen, three of the attorneys who had challenged Habba’s authority, vowed to continue challenging “President Trump’s unlawful appointments of purported U.S. Attorneys wherever appropriate.”
“The court’s decision affirms that U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is unlawfully and invalidly serving as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey, marking the first time an appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions,” the attorneys wrote in a statement.
U.S. Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim, Democrats whose support the Trump administration would need to advance a U.S. attorney nominee for New Jersey, hailed Monday’s ruling as one that vindicates their concerns about the “extraordinary and unlawful steps taken by the Trump Administration to keep Habba in office without Senate confirmation.”
“The Court’s ruling underscores a simple but fundamental principle: U.S. Attorneys must be independent and installed consistent with the rule of law, not because of their political loyalty or through political maneuvering. The Trump Administration’s attempt to bypass clear legal requirements to install a loyalist undermined the legitimacy of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey and cast a shadow over the cases she oversaw,” they said in a joint statement.
The panel that issued Monday’s decision includes two Bush appointees — Fisher and Judge D. Brooks Smith, who are both senior judges. The third judge on the panel, L. Felipe Restrepo, is an Obama appointee.
Observers expect the case could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 16:46:09+00:00,CT Mirror,¿Por qué detuvieron las renovaciones de las escuelas públicas de Hartford?,Mariana Navarrete Villegas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/hartford-pausa-renovaciones-escuelas-publicas/,Las renovaciones de seis escuelas formaron parte de un esfuerzo para que los residentes de Hartford regresaran a estudiar al distrito.,"Read this story in English.
Cuando el alcalde de Hartford, Arunan Arulampalam, anunció en septiembre la pausa de las renovaciones financiadas por el estado de seis escuelas públicas, la decisión sorprendió a la Junta de Educación y al Comité de Construcción Escolar de Hartford.
La Junta y el Comité habían votado a favor junto con el Ayuntamiento, para que las renovaciones se llevaran a cabo en las escuelas primarias Moylan, Parkville Community, McDonough Middle, S.A.N.D, Maria C. Colon Sanchez Elementary y Batchelder.
Ya estaba aprobada la financiación estatal.
Las renovaciones escolares formaron parte de un esfuerzo para que los residentes de Hartford regresaran a estudiar al distrito. En los últimos cuatro años, aproximadamente 5.000 estudiantes se mudaron fuera de la ciudad. Muchos de los cuales se reubicaron en lugares como New Britain, East Hartford y Manchester, según un análisis de las tendencias de matriculación estudiantil realizado por Caitlin Richard, directora financiera de las Escuelas Públicas de Hartford, presentado en una reunión de la Junta de Educación en noviembre.
Esto es lo que sabemos sobre la pausa en las renovaciones de escuelas públicas.
¿Por qué las escuelas públicas de Hartford planearon renovaciones?
Los proyectos buscaban abordar problemas que llevan años arrastrándose en los edificios de las Escuelas Públicas de Hartford, como goteras en los techos y sistemas de climatización anticuados, e incorporar instalaciones de última generación. La presidenta de la Junta de Educación, Shonta Browdy, dijo que la falta de instalaciones de vanguardia aleja a los residentes de Hartford hacia distritos que sí las ofrecen.
Las renovaciones entonces, buscan abordar la baja matrícula actual en las escuelas públicas de Hartford.
¿Como es el proceso de construcción de escuelas y en qué momento se detuvo?
Es un proceso largo que involucra a múltiples actores interesados que proponen, supervisan y aprueban proyectos de renovación de la construcción de escuelas.
Primero, el distrito escolar identifica la necesidad de renovaciones. Consultores y otros profesionales pueden participar en el proceso de documentación, considerando la matrícula estudiantil, las necesidades del edificio y los programas académicos.
Luego, la Junta de Educación prepara las especificaciones educativas con los costos del proyecto y las cifras de matrícula para los próximos ocho años. Una vez que la ciudad las aprueba, la Junta y el Ayuntamiento están autorizados a presentar una solicitud de subvención al estado, y la Oficina de Subvenciones y Revisión de Construcción Escolar evalúa la propuesta.
Si la propuesta se aprueba, como fue el caso de las seis escuelas públicas de Hartford, el estado emite una carta de compromiso de subvención. El comité de construcción escolar de la ciudad contrata además a gerentes de programa y construcción, y a arquitectos.
Luego, antes de iniciar la licitación de las obras de construcción, que es autorizada por la oficina de construcción escolar del estado, se elaboran, revisan y aprueban los diseños. La construcción comienza entonces.
Los proyectos se suspendieron casi al final de este proceso. Las empresas constructoras ya presentaron sus ofertas y el Comité de Construcción Escolar de Hartford votó a favor de las propuestas de diseño para las escuelas.
A continuación, presentamos los nombres de las empresas constructoras seleccionadas, según la información proporcionada por Browdy:

S.A.N.D. tiene un contrato con Colliers;
Las escuelas primarias Sanchez y Batchelder con Arcadis y O&G;
McDonough Middle con PDS Engineering and Construction Inc.;
Parkville Community con 7 Summits Construction;
y la escuela primaria Moylan con Newfield Construction.

¿Qué dice el alcalde sobre su razonamiento para pausar las renovaciones de las escuelas?
Cristian Corza-Godinez, portavoz de la ciudad de Hartford, declaró por escrito que el ‘statu quo’ no beneficia a los estudiantes, por lo que el alcalde está trabajando en un plan de cinco años para convertir las escuelas en ‘centros de excelencia’. Añadió que esto requiere conversaciones alrededor de si la ciudad está agotando los recursos en las escuelas con baja matriculación.
Corza-Godinez sostuvo que, hasta que la ciudad tenga un plan para abordar este problema, pausar la construcción de las escuelas es la decisión responsable.
“Si usamos fondos estatales para llevar a cabo estos seis proyectos de construcción, las personas que pagan impuestos de Hartford quedarán obligados durante veinte años y tendrán que devolver ese dinero si alguna de esas seis escuelas toma un rumbo distinto en las próximas dos décadas”, dijo.
En la reunión del comité de construcción escolar del 20 de octubre, Lori Mizerak, asesora legal de la ciudad, declaró que envió un memorando el 17 de octubre sobre los planes de la ciudad para evaluar todas las escuelas de la ciudad que enfrentan problemas presupuestarios. El memorando no lo hicieron disponible al público.
¿Cuáles son los próximos pasos para estos proyectos?
Por el momento, las renovaciones están en pausa y no hay una fecha fija para la reanudación de la construcción.
Arulampalam aseguró que la ciudad desea reanudar la construcción lo antes posible y espera que todos los actores se reúnan para colaborar en un plan que ofrezca mejores resultados educativos a los estudiantes de Hartford, de modo que puedan ofrecer no solo edificios con mejor diseño, sino también una educación sustancialmente mejor.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7869-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 11:58:54.878487

(Submitted) TOPEKA — Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas and Topeka’s St. Francis hospital have failed to reach a contract agreement, leaving insurance customers out of network beginning Jan. 1 for one of Topeka’s major health care systems.
Officials with both organizations say discussions are ongoing. The current contract ends Dec. 31.
“We’re having productive talks,” said Matt All, president and CEO of BCBS of Kansas. “It’s a little complicated because they have an out-of-state owner, so we’re not just talking to people here on the ground.”
“I’m not in the business of making predictions, but our expectation is that we’ll work this out and that they’ll be in network,” he added.
Topeka’s St. Francis campus is owned by Ardent Health, which manages operations, and the University of Kansas Health System. Ardent is based in Brentwood, Tennessee.

People covered by BCBS of Kansas have been posting social media messages, upset about the possible loss of their doctors.
“I refuse to abandon my primary care provider whom I trust with my care, so Blue Cross Blue Shield just lost another customer,” said Topekan Carol Baldwin on her personal Facebook page.
In an emailed statement to Kansas Reflector, hospital officials said: “The University of Kansas Health System St. Francis Campus is committed to protecting access to high-quality care for our community. We have made repeated efforts to engage directly with senior decision-makers at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach a fair resolution.”
Rising costs in health care are causing the challenge in reaching agreement, both sides said. For All, the discussions are indicative of broader problems throughout the health care system.
“We are seeking an agreement that reimburses St. Francis Campus at rates consistent with rising costs due to inflation and supply chain pressures,” the hospital’s statement said. “Equitable reimbursement rates are critical to supporting the high-quality care that our patients deserve.”
All said BCBS, which is a mutual nonprofit that is created to benefit its members, must negotiate so that reimbursements to the hospital are reasonable and don’t translate into premiums that members can’t afford.
“For the whole 19 years I’ve been with Blue Cross, and basically our whole history, we’ve had every hospital in our service area in network, and we want St. Francis in network,” he said.
Changes needed
There are many good things about the country’s health care, All said, but the availability of resources isn’t evenly spread out.
“We have too many people that can’t afford coverage,” All said. “The big problem in American health care that’s existed for as long as any of us have been thinking about this is that it doesn’t control costs very well, and so there’s this steady rise in costs over the decades, and some decades are faster than others.”
For the years 2024 through 2033, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that national health expenditures will grow 5.8%.
“Across the industry, in every market, whether you’re talking about commercial plans, the public programs and so forth, costs are rising really quickly right now,” All said. “We’ve seen it in our plan and when you combine that with possibly losing some of the subsidies in the (Affordable Care Act) market, you’re going to have some consumers that are just going to be priced out of the market.”
“That should be unacceptable to us,” All added. “In 2025, in a nation as prosperous as ours, we should be able to make sure that everybody can afford good health care.”
The health care system needs a major overhaul, All said, but having what he called an “adult conversation” on the topic is difficult.
“We need to really talk about the root causes of higher costs and the toll that takes, but also the consequences of controlling costs, because there’s another side to this,” he said. “The fact that we’re able to have two beautiful hospitals in Topeka, two great hospitals in Wichita, a beautiful hospital in Lawrence, and you can actually go there and get care — that is partly because we fund our health care system really lavishly.”
But that system isn’t working if people don’t have access to it, All said.
“If we solve the cost problem, we can solve all of the other problems,” he said. “The other problems are just technical. At that point, we have to get the cost problem solved, and we just haven’t been willing to do it yet as a country.”
Health expenses
The Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that focuses on affordable health care, compared U.S. health care costs to those in 12 countries. It found the U.S. pays more for:

Insurance administrative costs, responsible for about 15% of the excess costs.
Administrative activities, 15% of excess.
Prescription drugs, 10% of excess.
Physician salaries, 10% of excess.
Registered nurse salaries, 5% of excess.
Investments in medical machinery and equipment, less than 5%. 

The U.S. industry is highly concentrated, All said, with about 20% of health care dollars spent on 1% of the population and more than half of health care dollars on about 5% of the population. Those are patients with chronic diseases, people with metastatic cancer, babies born prematurely and others, he said.
“In some ways that makes it easier to address because you’re talking about a smaller set of the population, but I think it actually makes it much harder to address because these are people who very much need care, and we want them to have the best care that’s available,” he said. “So how do you make that less expensive? That is the conundrum that we face in American health care.”
It’s important to make sure healthy people are covered by insurance, which was the point of the ACA mandate that required everyone to have insurance, All said. That mandate was struck down but the ACA covers about one in every six people under age 65, or about 44 million people, according to KFF, which tracks health policies. 
“If you only cover people who have the costliest care then, then they won’t be able to afford it at all. None of us could,” he said. 
All said it’s frustrating to hear people against ACA subsidies say that “most people don’t use the care anyway.”
“You would never have auto insurance, for example, where only people who get into wrecks pay their auto premium,” he said.
All said smaller towns, in particular, could be in jeopardy of losing access to local health care services with Medicaid cuts and the possibility of ACA subsidies not being renewed.
Many Kansas hospitals are in difficult financial condition with rising costs. The Kansas Hospital Association said non-reimbursed care costs continue to rise for community hospitals. In 2023, the amount was over $26 billion, and since 2015 non-reimbursed care has increased by 77%.
All said insurance companies have a responsibility to be stewards of the health care industry and work to make sure care is affordable and available.
“I think there’s a lot of criticism that’s fair of the insurance industry, but it’s not really the reason why health care costs keep going up,” All said. “It is really because we have decided that we’re going to have a system that is really rich for some people and not so rich for others and unavailable for others. Until we make a real commitment to universal coverage that’s affordable, we’re going to be in this fix.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TUKHS-St.-Francis-Campus-Entrance-A--1024x676.jpg,,,2025-12-01 11:58:54.878487

“Action must be taken immediately to protect consumers, combat illegal monopolies and ensure these corporations are not criminally profiting at the expense of the American people,” Trump said in a social media post.
On Nov. 7, the White House published four claims in support of the investigation. Investigate Midwest fact-checked those claims.
Claim: The Trump administration stated, “The ‘Big Four’ meat packers — JBS (Brazil), Cargill, Tyson Foods, and National Beef — currently dominate 85% of the U.S. beef processing market, up from just 36% in 1980.”
True. These four companies (Marfrig owns National Beef) control roughly 85% of the U.S. beef industry, including owning more than 70 meat brands like Hillshire Farm, Swift, Honeysuckle and Jimmy Dean, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Claim: In calling for a DOJ investigation, the Trump administration said: “For too long, a handful of giant meat packers have squeezed America’s cattle producers, shrunk herds, and jacked up prices at the grocery store.”
Partly true. There is evidence that the consolidation of meatpackers has led to a decrease in the price ranchers are paid for their cattle.
However, a USDA study found that consolidation contributed to lower production costs, which in turn led to lower costs at the grocery store.
“Lower production costs did translate into lower consumer prices, increased consumption, and higher prices for cattle and hogs,” according to a 2024 USDA report. “However, with fewer rivals because of increased concentration, most of the studies found packers were also able to exercise some market power and pay lower prices for cattle than they would have had they faced more competitors.”
It is true that beef prices have increased for consumers in recent years, and the margin between cattle prices and retail prices has widened (indicating packer margins have grown). But many economic observers note that price increases at the grocery store have been mostly influenced by factors such as labor, transportation and input costs.
Claim: The Trump administration said, “Industry consolidation has crushed competition and hammered cattle producers.”
True. Since the 1970s, the nation’s cattle supply has become increasingly consolidated by larger meatpacking companies. An often cited USDA report from 2000 first highlighted the rate of “four-firm control,” or the measure of the beef industry’s outputs controlled by its four largest producers, which was 25% in 1971.
By 1992, the rate had jumped to 71%, and today it hovers around 85%.
Large plants across the country account for the majority of all slaughter. Just 12 federally inspected plants produced slightly less than half of the country’s beef supply as of 2022, according to an Investigate Midwest data analysis.
The nation’s cattle ranchers have faced increased consolidation in modern times, leaving them with few options when selling their herds to slaughter, often only able to accept a single large meatpacker as their buyer in their region.
Claim: Finally, the Trump administration claimed that the monopolization of the meatpacking industry has led to the exploitation of American consumers, farmers, and ranchers.” The administration went on to state: “In fact, mounting evidence shows this monopoly power has slashed payments to ranchers, reduced herd sizes, driven up consumer prices, and threatened America’s food supply chain.”
Partly true. American consumers have seen increased costs in numerous pantry staples in recent years. This increase can be attributed to rising inflation, COVID-19 supply chain disruptions, disease outbreaks and price-gouging.
Monopoly power in meatpacking isn’t the sole cause of the nation’s historic low cattle inventory. This low can also be attributed to climate-change-fueled droughts disrupting cattle feed and replacement cycles in the industry.
Consolidated power in the meat industry has disrupted the nation’s food supply in recent years.
A cyberattack on U.S. JBS plants in May 2021 resulted in ripple effects of delayed production. A 2019 fire at a Tyson slaughter plant in Kansas resulted in a 27% drop in cattle traded on the market during the following week, as the plant remained closed, according to a USDA incident report.
A disruption at these pivotal points in the food supply, no matter the cause, has a cascading effect on the entire food supply chain, from ranchers to consumers.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana House Republicans released Monday a proposed redrawing of the state’s congressional maps aimed at producing a 9-0 Republican U.S. House delegation.
The proposed map splits strongly Democratic Indianapolis among four districts that all stretch far into rural, heavily Republican counties.
The map obliterates the current 7th District now held by Democratic Rep. André Carson. The new 7th District would span from the north side of Indianapolis to counties along the Ohio River near Cincinnati.
Draft_CD_2025_Counties__Townships
The Lake Michigan shoreline area that now makes up the 1st District held by Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan also is split up. Republicans propose a new 1st District taking in Democratic-friendly Lake County then heading southeast to take in the areas around the small cities of Logansport, Peru and Wabash.
Indiana House members are scheduled to meet Monday afternoon to start the process of considering the congressional redistricting that President Donald Trump has been demanding for months to improve the chances of Republicans keeping their slim majority in the U.S. House.
House Republicans will announce today who will carry the bill as well as information on public hearings. In 2021, lawmakers held 14 hearings around the state and in Indianapolis.
The state Senate, where several Republican senators have expressed opposition to the redistricting, is expected to meet next week.
Trump won each of the districts under the proposed map by at least 12 percentage points in the 2024 election, according to an analysis by Indianapolis City-County Councilor Nick Roberts, a Democrat.
Trump’s narrowest win was in the proposed 1st District, where Republican Gov. Mike Braun won by a 6 percentage point margin, according to Roberts.
