(Photo by Kate Brindley/New Hampshire Bulletin)Negotiators with the New Hampshire Senate agreed to accept a House proposal to add new documentation requirements to absentee voting Monday — against the wishes of disability rights advocates who say it would make it harder for people with disabilities to vote.
Under an amended version of Senate Bill 287, people seeking to vote absentee in New Hampshire would be required to either bring a photo ID into a clerk’s office, send in a photocopy of their ID, or send in a notarized signature in order to request their absentee ballot.
On Monday, the Senate’s negotiators agreed to accept the House’s version of the bill during a committee of conference. Now, the bill will go back to the full chamber for a final vote. If it’s approved, Gov. Kelly Ayotte will have the final say. She can sign it, veto it, or allow it to become law without her signature.
Democrats on the committee objected to the new requirement.
“I think it’s important to talk about the practical realities of what you guys are imposing,” Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, a Portsmouth Democrat, said during negotiations Monday. “This is again just further ways that we’re making it harder for people to vote.”
During a press conference last week, James Ziegra, senior staff attorney at the Disability Rights Center of New Hampshire, said the new requirement would be burdensome as it requires anyone unable to go to a clerk’s office in person to have access to a photocopier or accredited notary. Many people with disabilities are unable to drive themselves, he pointed out.
SB 287 was one of a pair of bills adding requirements to absentee voting. Senate Bill 218 goes even further and seeks to require absentee voters to submit hard-copy proof of their citizenship — such as a birth certificate or passport — when registering to vote in New Hampshire. This law would build upon a 2024 law that required in-person voters to do the same, though that law, which created the strictest standard in the U.S., has been challenged in court.
Rep. Ross Berry, a Weare Republican and the chairman of the House Election Law Committee, framed this in the context of his and his colleagues’ opposition to early and absentee voting.
“The House’s concern and the position of the House has always been that as much of Election Day should happen on Election Day as possible,” he said during negotiations Monday. “It should just be like that.”
Berry said the discrepancy between what is required of in-person and absentee voting “is something that the House is interested in closing up.”
Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican, decided the Senate wanted more time to deliberate, so he suggested the committee return to SB 218 Wednesday.
Disability rights advocates also oppose House Bill 613, which would allow towns and cities to not offer voting machines designed to be accessible for people with disabilities if no one requests it at least two months before the elections. HB 613 is also the subject of negotiations between the House and Senate this week.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/votingregbills-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-16 15:05:09.567724

Attorney Andrew Abood did not say what the misdemeanor was but did say that the plea did not involve a cooperation agreement with the Michigan Department of Attorney General.
Baxter was bound over to face trial last year on a felony perjury charge, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. Her trial was set to begin on June 23.
But a surprise entry in the Ingham Circuit Court register of actions for Baxter’s case on Monday was updated to include a plea hearing before Judge James Jamo. The hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m.
A message seeking comment from a department spokesperson was not returned at the time of publication.

Baxter was charged with perjury for her alleged part in the campaign finance scandal. 
The department and Attorney General Dana Nessel alleged that she and Heather Lombardini had illegally raised funds for Unlock Michigan, a campaign committee that aimed to repeal the gubernatorial emergency powers law used by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer during the worst days of the COVID pandemic. 
Nessel said Baxter misled state investigators while providing testimony under oath, which the attorney general noted was a serious crime.
Baxter was involved in fundraising efforts for Michigan! My Michigan!, which was tied to former Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake) and other Republican lawmakers. Meanwhile, Lombardini was the president of Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility and the treasurer of Michigan! My Michigan!
Lombardini’s case is pending a motion to quash her bind over to the circuit court for trial.
Shirkey and the various donors to Unlock Michigan, which were disclosed recently in open court during a June 4 hearing on Lombardini’s motion to quash, were not charged in the matter.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Three people — including an 8-month-old infant — were killed and two teenagers were injured in a shooting late Sunday night at WestFest, a carnival held every year in West Valley City. 
Officers arrested a 16-year-old boy in connection with the shooting, according to West Valley City Police Department spokesperson Roxeanne Vainuku. She told reporters he’s the “only suspect in this case” as police continue to investigate what happened. 
The suspect began firing shots after “two groups of people” seemed to have “some sort of verbal altercation,” Vainuku said. She noted two of the three dead — the 8-month-old infant and a 41-year-old woman — were bystanders “not connected to any of the people in either of the groups.” An 18-year-old man was also shot and killed, who “we believe is connected and was part of the opposing group that the suspect was in,” she said. 
It’s too early to say whether the shooting was related to gang violence, Vainuku said, as police are still investigating.

The shooting in West Valley City — Utah’s second-most-populated city, behind the state’s capital of Salt Lake City — comes on the heels of a deadly shooting that occurred during an otherwise peaceful “No Kings” protest in downtown Salt Lake City. 
Saturday, one man, 39-year-old bystander Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, was killed, after police say one of two armed men “possibly part of the event’s peacekeeping team” confronted another man, 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was carrying an AR-15 style rifle. One of the men, reportedly part of the event’s security team, fired three shots, grazing Gamboa but also hitting Ah Loo, who was marching with protesters. Ah Loo later died at the hospital, police said.

The dust was barely starting to settle from Saturday’s tragedy when the shooting at West Valley City broke out Sunday — capping off a chaotic and violent weekend in two separate, crowded public places in Utah. 
The shooting at WestFest occurred shortly after 9:20 p.m., Vainuku said, after officers who were working at the carnival spotted “two groups of people who seemed to be having some sort of a verbal altercation.” 
“The officers approached these two groups in order to kind of break things up and calm things down,” she said. As the officers neared, they saw the suspect pull out a gun and start firing it at the other group. 
She said one of the officers fired gunshots toward the suspect, but didn’t hit him or any of the victims. However, “they were able to very quickly take the suspect into custody.”
Of the five people who were hit, two were injured by gunshot wounds to their arms, according to West Valley City police. One was a 17-year-old girl; the other was a 15-year-old boy. It’s unclear whether those teens were connected to the groups involved. 
In the panic after the shots were fired, a pregnant woman was injured trying to climb a fence to get away, Vainuku said.
Several people witnessed the shooting, and police are interviewing them as part of their investigation, she said.
Vainuku called the shooting at the city’s annual festival “heartbreaking.” 
“WestFest is something that is a celebration of our community, a celebration of all of the things that make our community great, a celebration of the diversity and the fun and the good, hard-working people of our community,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking …  for all of us to see something like this happen as something that is just a real treasure, something we really enjoy in our community.”

State Street, the Salt Lake City Police Department confirmed Sunday.
Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, a Utah resident, was shot at the demonstration. Despite life-saving efforts from SWAT medics and Salt Lake City Fire, Ah Loo died at an area hospital.
As of Sunday morning there were still unreleased details about the incident as the investigation is ongoing, Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said in a news conference.
A chaotic scene ensued after two armed men in high visibility vests, who Redd described as “possibly part of the event’s peacekeeping team” saw 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa separating from the crowd, moving behind a wall, pulling out a rifle and starting to manipulate it.
“Gamboa was then confronted by these two men, witnesses say. Gamboa raised the weapon in a firing position and began running toward the crowd,” Redd said on Sunday. “One of the individuals fired three rounds, striking Gamboa, and tragically striking the man who later died.”
The preliminary police investigation found that the victim was not the intended target, “but rather an innocent bystander participating in the demonstration,” Redd said. Gamboa also sustained a minor gunshot wound in the confrontation.
As the scene unfolded, a bystander took a backpack from Gamboa that contained an AR-15 style rifle and a gas mask, Redd said.
Gamboa’s motivations for being at the protest are still unclear, and there is no indication that others were working with him, Redd said.
Detectives booked Gamboa into the Salt Lake County Metro Jail for investigation of murder, police said in a release.
Gamboa has no criminal history, police said. Jail documents state he is being held without bail.
Police had not taken any action against the two peacekeeping members as of Sunday, Redd said. The man who fired the shots is cooperating with police.
The scene was chaotic and unfolded very quickly, Redd said, but many people assisted the officers.
“The crowd actually pointed him out to law enforcement, and their actions were heroic,” Redd said.
In a Facebook post Sunday morning, Utah 50501 — the group that organized Saturday’s protest — said it is currently working with police.
“Our team was directly involved. We have been in direct contact with law enforcement,” the Facebook post read. “Some of you seem to think a keyboard and social media give you a free pass to be nasty and accusatory. Our teams just had to deal with something extremely traumatizing and when faced with personal risk to their own lives, chose to run towards the danger in order to serve this community.”
The group said it’s working to set up a vigil for the victim.
“We respectfully ask to refrain from speculation about the alleged shooter’s motives and identity — that information will come out soon enough. It is better to wait for the facts, even though it is difficult given the emotional and charged nature of this incident,” the group said in a separate Facebook post Sunday morning. “This was a horrific moment of violence in a historic day full of thousands of Utahns exercising their right to protest. Nothing will ever change the undeniable strength of our community.”

Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, were also shot and killed in a separate incident. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said during a press conference that the shooting ""appears to be a politically motivated assassination."" (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)The man accused of killing DFL House leader Melissa Hortman and her husband, and shooting DFL state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, went to the homes of two additional state lawmakers in the early hours of Saturday morning, federal officials said Monday. 
Vance Boelter, 57, is facing several state and federal charges for the murders of Melissa and Mark Hortman and the shootings of John and Yvette Hoffman, and related other crimes. The Hoffmans survived but remained hospitalized.
Boelter’s path took him, in total, to the homes of four state lawmakers in the northwest metro of the Twin Cities before he got in a shootout with police officers outside the Hortmans’ home in Brooklyn Park and fled the scene.
Boelter was captured Sunday evening by state and federal agents in a field about a mile from his home in Green Isle, about an hour west of the Twin Cities, following a 43-hour manhunt.
Boelter maintained notebooks with a list of Democratic elected officials, including Hortman and Hoffman, along with addresses and the names of abortion providers. He has been described by those who knew him as a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump, who was facing financial hardship after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Federal authorities say that after Boelter shot the Hoffmans, he drove to a home in Maple Grove belonging to a state representative. Boelter, dressed in a fake law enforcement uniform and wearing a mask, knocked on the door and said “This is the police. Open the door,” according to surveillance footage from the home referenced in federal charging documents. 
The representative and her family were not at home. No one answered the door. 
Authorities declined to name the representative who lived at the house. Maple Grove is split into two House districts — one represented by Republican Rep. Kristin Robbins, and the other by DFL Rep. Kristin Bahner.
As word spread about the shooting of the Hoffmans, a New Hope police officer drove to the local state senator’s house to check on the lawmaker. The New Hope police officer spotted what looked like a police SUV parked down the block from the senator’s home. Assuming it was another officer dispatched to provide protection, the New Hope officer pulled up next to the SUV.
Boelter was inside the vehicle, likely still wearing the silicone mask that he wore as he shot the Hoffmans, said Joe Thompson, acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota. As the New Hope officer attempted to speak with Boelter, Boelter stared straight ahead and didn’t respond. The officer then drove down the block to the senator’s house, and Boelter left.
New Hope is represented by DFL state Sen. Ann Rest, and in a statement Monday, she thanked law enforcement for saving her life.
“I have been made aware that the shooting suspect was parked near my home early Saturday morning. I am so grateful for the heroic work of the New Hope Police Department and its officers. Their quick action saved my life,” Rest said.
Boelter then drove to the Hortmans’ in Brooklyn Park, the federal charging documents allege. A notebook recovered from his home included notes about the Hortman family and home.
Brooklyn Park police, responding to the same call for protection following the Hoffmans’ shooting, arrived on the scene moments before Boelter fired his gun as he entered the home through the front door. Boelter escaped through the back of the house, and police officers found Melissa and Mark Hortman — and their dog — inside the home with fatal gunshot wounds.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219572717.jpg,,,2025-06-16 15:05:09.567724

(Courtesy of State Ethics Commission) A new lawsuit filed by the New Mexico Ethics Commission alleges the nonprofit New Mexico Safety over Profit failed to report at least $56,000 spent lobbying against medical malpractice reform before the legislative session.
The group’s executive director, Jon Lipschutz, manages Democratic gubernatorial candidate Sam Bregman’s campaign. Bregman, who also serves as the 2nd Judicial District attorney, could not be reached for comment Monday morning.
Lipschutz initially incorporated his organization last year under the name Fairness for New Mexico Patients, as Searchlight New Mexico reported earlier this year. New Mexico Safety Over Profit operates as a 501c(4) nonprofit, putting it under no federal legal obligations to disclose its donors, thus earning the moniker “dark money groups.”
That federal status, however, does not exempt the organization from the disclosure requirements of New Mexico’s Lobbyist Regulation Act or Campaign Reporting Act, the Ethics Commission noted in a news release announcing its June 10 civil complaint, which it filed in the state’s 2nd Judicial District.
The complaint stems from an advertising campaign by the group that lobbied against a medical malpractice reform bill during the last legislative session. Proponents, such as Think New Mexico, said capping attorney fees and ending lump-sum payouts, among other proposals, would help address the state’s physician shortage.
The State Ethics Commission noted that the nonprofit correctly reported other spending during the session but failed to “report the contributions, pledges to contribute, expenditures and commitments to expend for the advertising campaign,” in 2024 within 15 days after the end of the 2025 legislative session, violating state law. The complaint showed photos of advertisements purchased in the Albuquerque Journal and Santa Fe New Mexican in addition to $56,000 in ads on Facebook. The Ethics Commission requested a judge order New Mexico Safety over Profit to fully account for spending in 2024 — including releasing the name and occupation of donors on the campaign — and to pay $5,000 in penalties.
In a written statement provided to Source, Lipschutz characterized the lawsuit as a “distraction and troubling escalation,” and said his organization is “confident that we have complied with both the letter and the spirit of New Mexico’s campaign finance laws.”
And, he said: “At a time when out-of-state hospital corporations and insurance interests are spending heavily to influence healthcare policy behind closed doors, it’s telling that the Ethics Commission has chosen to single out the one organization fighting to protect patients.”
New Mexicans have the right to know who is funding lobbying campaigns, State Ethics Commission Executive Director Jeremy Farris said in a written statement Monday.
“This right is particularly important when the lobbying campaign concerns how New Mexico should understand and address its shortage of healthcare professionals,” Farris said. “NMSOP has publicly stated that transparency and accountability are core to its mission, yet it refuses to comply with basic disclosure obligations required by the Lobbyist Regulation Act. This lawsuit is about ensuring that all organizations advocating for legislative change follow the same legal standard.”

(LRC Public Information)A Louisville Democrat accused of inappropriate conduct toward women asked a court to intervene in a Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission complaint against him. A  judge denied the motion Monday, a day before the commission is scheduled to meet. 
Rep. Daniel Grossberg filed the lawsuit in Franklin Circuit Court on Friday asking that the commission be barred from proceeding further with its investigation. The representative’s 23-page complaint alleges “retaliatory and discriminatory actions” by the commission. 
Judge Thomas Wingate ruled Monday that Grossberg “failed to meet the standard for injunctive relief” and that the court would not “upend the status quo” of the commission’s proceedings. 
“What has been shared with the Court is that a complaint or complaints have been filed against (the) Plaintiff and the Commission has a meeting set for June 17, 2025, to determine whether there is reason to believe that (the) Plaintiff has committed a violation of the Kentucky Code of Legislative Ethics,” Wingate wrote. “Therefore, Court intervention to halt such (a) meeting and/or any ‘investigation’ would upend the status quo — which is for the Commission to follow the statutory procedure set forth in KRS 6.686.” 
Details of the complaint against Grossberg are not known because Kentucky law makes the ethics commission’s proceedings, including complaints and other records related to a preliminary inquiry, confidential until the commission makes a final determination.
The lawsuit names all members of the Legislative Ethics Commission and its executive director as defendants. 
Grossberg’s motion was heard Monday morning in Frankfort. 
Grossberg has been expelled from the House Democratic Caucus and faces calls from within his party to resign from the legislature following allegations against him for inappropriate behavior toward women, as reported by the Lexington Herald-Leader last year. House Democrats sought an investigation by the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission. 
Grossberg’s attorney is Thomas E. Clay of Prospect. 
According to the lawsuit, Grossberg says the caucus and community members “have engaged in a pattern of activities intended to destroy the reputation of the Plaintiff, his family, and his ability to freely represent his district.” Grossberg, who is Jewish, claims that he was targeted for introducing a House resolution to condemn Hamas for attacking Israel in October 2023.
Grossberg also says that he faced microaggressions as a Jewish lawmaker such as all food at a caucus retreat having pork in it without any vegetarian or kosher options as well as “pointed questions about celebrations of the Sabbath, Jewish bourbon in his office and his mezuzah.” 
Grossberg’s complaint claims that former House Democratic Caucus Chair Cherlynn Stevenson and former Democratic Whip Rachel Roberts sought a retaliatory investigation from the ethics commission into Grossberg. However, neither of them are named as defendants in the lawsuit. 
Stevenson is running for the U.S. House  in Central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District. A spokesperson for her campaign told the Kentucky Lantern Monday that she would not be “be distracted by a baseless lawsuit that is full of bogus claims and is in denial of Daniel Grossberg’s vile sexual misconduct” and is instead focusing on issues like protecting “access to health care for families across the commonwealth.” 
“He has an appalling and documented record of preying upon women — which is why Cherlynn voted to remove him from the caucus and leaders across the state demanded his immediate resignation,” the spokesperson said. 
Last year, the Herald-Leader reported three women who work in politics were asked about inappropriate text messages sent by the representative to them in a Legislative Research Commission investigation. Later, a Louisville strip club said it banned Grossberg for life after he inappropriately touched a dancer.
Grossberg continued to represent the 30th House District in the General Assembly earlier this year, though Kentucky Democratic Party Chair Colmon Elridge blasted Republican leaders in the legislature for assigning Grossberg to three House committees.
The state’s top Democrat, Gov. Andy Beshear, was also among those calling on Grossberg to resign. Speaking to reporters ahead of the party’s Forward Together Dinner in Owensboro Friday night, he said the representative “is not a victim” and should resign from office.
“Daniel Grossberg needs to work on himself and not work in Frankfort,” Beshear said. 
Grossberg has gained primary challengers for his legislative seat in next year’s election.

Assembly lawmakers discussed a bill that would require structural assessments for transportation projects near mines after I-80 sinkholes.,"Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris), pictured in 2022, represents the district where sinkholes caused by old mines prompted officials to close Interstate 80 for six months. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers are considering new requirements for roadway and other infrastructure projects near underground mines, hoping to prevent collapses like the sinkholes that have shuttered parts of Interstate 80 for more than six months.
A new bill, which the Assembly Transportation and Independent Authorities Committee discussed but did not vote on Monday, would require transportation agencies to conduct structural assessments on transportation projects near operating or abandoned mines.
“This is an issue that we have to continue to address. Let’s not just respond to the larger big potholes, which are sinkholes. Let us be able to predict them. Let us not just fix the damage, but let us prevent it,” Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris) told the committee.
The move comes more than half a year after the first in a series of sinkholes opened on Interstate 80 in Wharton last December, shuttering lanes on the highway and forcing traffic to redirect through local roads that could not bear the congestion. Wharton is in Dunn’s district.
The highway’s westbound lanes reopened on Saturday, and its three eastbound lanes are due to reopen on June 25.

“I’m the town next to Wharton where the holes were found. The impact really does stick. It was just traffic and just a very terrible time for literally thousands of people,” said Assemblyman Christian Barranco (R-Morris), who shares Dunn’s district. “I can tell you the relief is very real and very welcome.”
Lawmakers hope to prevent similar disruptions by requiring the Department of Labor’s mine safety section to determine whether proposed transportation projects are within close proximity of a mine and whether a structural assessment is needed to ensure safety.
The bill would require the transportation agency in charge of the project to perform the analysis, with post-construction monitoring for mines found to be at risk of collapses that could damage above-ground infrastructure.
That monitoring would include ground-penetrating radar scans and periodic elevation measurements to ensure no part of the roadway is falling through the ground. The bill authorizes the transportation commissioner to stop work on sites not in compliance.
The bill was sponsored by Assemblyman Clinton Calabrese (D-Bergen), who chairs the panel that heard testimony on it Monday. It has no Senate companion.
Some lawmakers expressed surprise at the Department of Labor’s role in the proposed regulatory scheme. Current New Jersey law on mine safety dates back more than 70 years, when iron and sulfur extraction were major state industries, and deal mostly with workplace safety within mines.
State records list nearly 600 abandoned mines, nearly all of which fall in the state’s northwest.
“This issue, in my opinion, should not be in the Department of Labor. It’s clearly not their wheelhouse. This to me seems to be an environmental protection issue, something like that, perhaps [the Department of Community Affairs] because of the impact it would have on applications before state agencies and local agencies,” said Assemblyman Greg McGuckin (R-Ocean).
Mining is less prevalent in the state’s economy today, and what remains has taken a different character. In 2019, state mines extracted $367 million in minerals, but virtually all of that value came from crushed stone, sand, or gravel, according to U.S. Geological Service data.
The decades-long mining decline presents lawmakers with another issue: The state hasn’t updated its mine maps in years and in places relies on contemporary maps that are more than a century old.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Department of Correctional Services on Monday named the three construction companies bidding to construct a new state prison close to Lincoln, all of which officials said would stay within proposed state appropriations.
The department said officials are reviewing bids for the proposed 1,512-bed facility to replace the aging Nebraska State Penitentiary. The bids, received through 2 p.m. on June 3, came from Clark Construction/MCL Construction (a joint venture), Hausmann Construction and Sampson Construction/Caddell Construction (a joint venture). Each bidder has at least some Nebraska ties.
Among them, Sampson built Correctional Services a reception and treatment center that opened in 2022, a 114,000-square-foot addition plus 3,200 square feet of renovations.

Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys said in a statement that “from day one,” the department’s engineering team had approached the new prison project “the Nebraska way,” focused on fiscal responsibility and building a facility to support the state’s needs.
“All of the bids received will keep this project within the proposed budget and the funding appropriated by the Legislature,” Jeffreys said. 
The department did not immediately release the bid estimates. Bids will be evaluated through mid-July, and when an “intent to award” a bid is signed, the bids will become public, according to NDCS.
The facility, once built, will be located north of Interstate 80, adjacent to North 70th Street, close to Lincoln.
‘I’ll believe it when I see it’
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who led legislative opposition to the new facility, said he would love to see the bid numbers, because he’s heard the new prison could cost more than the $350 million approved by lawmakers.

He’s one of a handful of lawmakers who have expressed worries that state prison costs could balloon, as correctional costs in other states have, too.
“I’ll believe it when I see it,” McKinney said Monday.
McKinney said he doesn’t think a new prison is needed, particularly considering the state’s budget woes and that many Nebraskans in state facilities are eligible for parole but haven’t been released.
A Nebraska Supreme Court decision in favor of the Legislature in April, against Attorney General Mike Hilgers, upheld expanded parole eligibility passed in 2023.
McKinney said Correctional Services administrators could repair and maintain the Nebraska State Penitentiary for less money.
“If they’re gonna say that we need a new prison, then they shouldn’t oppose demolishing the State Pen after it’s built,” McKinney said. “The fact they won’t proves to me a new prison is not needed.”
Second chance relief
There have been other recent efforts to help with prison reform and overcrowding, such as Legislative Bill 215 this year, which sought “second chance relief” for certain long-term inmates through an increased, collaborative chance for sentence commutation or parole. The Nebraska Board of Pardons — Hilgers, Gov. Jim Pillen and Secretary of State Bob Evnen — opposed it.

State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, who introduced LB 215 and selected it as his personal priority for 2025, had said he’d visited every adult correctional facility in Nebraska, some multiple times, and met Nebraskans serving life sentences who were model individuals and mentors to younger inmates. He said he’d be comfortable with many as a “next-door neighbor.”
Before joining the Legislature, Holdcroft said he would have thought, “You do the crime, you do the time,” but he said politicians need to be willing to hear both sides and be willing to move.
“After visiting with some of these lifers and breaking bread with them and talking to them, one-on-one as human beings, I truly believe that the sentences of many of these individuals should be given a second look,” Holdcroft said.
The measure, which advanced the first of three debates 25-14, could return in 2026.
‘Very pleasing news’
  State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said Jeffreys’ commitment was “wonderful,” citing the state’s closed-for-now budget shortfall.
“I was not sure how much we would have to fund in excess, but that’s very pleasing news. Glad to hear that,” Clements said. “I’m looking forward to the project moving forward.”
Clements said the facility is needed to provide more beds than the current prison, partly to ease overcrowding and partly to provide more space for needed programming for inmate rehabilitation and successful reentry. He said the new facility would also be more modern and more secure for staff.
Said Jeffreys: “We look forward to launching construction and appreciate all Nebraskans who have supported this rehabilitation-focused facility.”

Pittman is being targeted in political action committee social media ads. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — A political action committee targeted Leavenworth’s mayor on social media in May for her “liberal agenda,” accusing her of holding back progress in the northeast Kansas town. 
The Defend US PAC ran three advertisements in May on Instagram and Facebook that tagged Mayor Holly Pittman. One said Pittman’s agenda was to “waste taxpayer money, lose good-paying jobs and call it ‘progress.’” All three ads encouraged people to call Pittman. 
The ads did not directly mention the city’s disagreement with CoreCivic, a private prison planning to reopen as an ICE detention facility, but that is the most recent controversy that could affect community jobs.  
Leavenworth city officials went to court to force CoreCivic to follow its development process and apply for a special use permit before reopening. The prison closed in 2021. 
CoreCivic did not reply to a question about whether it was involved with running the advertisements. 
“I was disappointed to see this PAC targeting and spending money against me,” Pittman said. “As the mayor, I serve as one of five commissioners on the Leavenworth City Commission. Decisions are made collectively by the entire commission, not by me alone.” 
She said the ad misrepresents the process and ignores the “collaborative approach” taken in Leavenworth. 
Marina Pino, counsel at the elections and government program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the issue of PACs spending money at the state and local levels is “especially acute” right now. The Brennan Center has researched dark money funding and its effects on the political process.
Dark money is a term used to denote funds affecting politics that can’t be traced to specific donors.
“When you have these hidden funders of advertising, they often hold economic interests in the contests where these outcomes could have significant and immediate impact on their bottom lines,” Pino said. 
One concern about PAC donations is the way they may shift local elections. 
“Local elections and potentially local issues are low-information elections compared to national elections,” she said. “What that means is it may not take much advertising to sway voters.”
Facebook highlights the range of dollars to run an ad. For instance, one of the ads paid for by Defend US Inc. cost between $600 to $699. Defend US spent $2,900+ on the Pittman ads. 
“What they spent was a pretty insignificant amount of money in most terms,” Pino said. “When we did this report in 2016, we found that these dark money groups across several states were spending amounts in the low one hundred thousands, or even low ten thousands. For those groups, that’s a modest business expense, but it’s also a major hurdle for local candidates. They’re not spending that type of money on elections.”
Pino said the Brennan Center did a recent report looking at dark money spending in the 2024 elections. Although it didn’t consider local election spending, the two tend to trend the same way, she said. 
“We saw the dark money spending in the 2024 election break a serious record,” she said. “It was around $1.9 billion that was spent in the 2024 elections. That’s the money we can trace. It’s becoming increasingly more difficult to trace.”
Pino noted that dark money spending occurs in both Democratic and Republican political races and issues. 
A Defend US PAC financial report filed with the Federal Election Commission showed the organization collected $1.6 million in contributions from Jan. 1, 2023, through Dec. 31, 2024. Of that, $729,000 was from individuals and the remainder was from organizations, most of which were conservative PACs, such as the American Exceptionalism Institute.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Holly-Pittman-20250604_085106-1024x729.jpg,,,2025-06-16 14:05:59.766660

The Miss Delaware Scholarship Organization’s annual competition, held Saturday night at the Independence School, highlighted candidates from across the state, celebrating scholarship, service, talent, and style as they competed for state titles and the opportunity to advance to national competitions this fall.
Mack, who won the Miss Delaware title, stood out for her colorguard routine to “Uccen” by the Taalbi Brothers, her initiative promoting women in STEM called “Shoot for the Stars,” and her poised presence throughout the event. She earned $10,750 in scholarship funds and will represent Delaware at Miss America 2026 in September.
“Being named Miss Delaware is a dream come true,” said Mack. “I never in my wildest dreams imagined that I would have the opportunity to connect with so many incredible people and I am honored and excited to continue inspiring young women in STEM over the next year. I am incredibly grateful for each and every person who helped me make this dream a reality and can’t wait to start serving my home state.”
Martinenza earned the Teen crown following a performance titled “HERStory,” in which she spoke about her drive to support the fight against cancer. She also impressed judges during the interview segment and was recognized for her work with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. She received $2,800 in scholarship awards and will compete at Miss America’s Teen 2026.
“Winning Miss Delaware’s Teen is truly a dream come true. Every bit of hard work led to something unforgettable,” Martinenza said. “I’m especially excited to use this platform to spotlight the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society — bringing attention to a cause so close to my heart. I look forward to the year ahead and am so thankful for everyone who’s been part of my journey thus far.”
Other honors from the competition included:

Miss Delaware 2025 First Runner-Up: Rebecca Bristow
Miss Delaware’s Teen 2025 First Runner-Up: Adria Windish
Miss Delaware 2025 Second Runner-Up: Samantha Mason
Miss Delaware’s Teen 2025 Second Runner-Up: Tierra Shockley
Miss Delaware 2025 Third Runner-Up: Jaylynn Rogers
Miss Delaware’s Teen 2025 Third Runner-Up: Carly Favoroso

Both Mack and Martinenza will now begin a year of community engagement, school visits, and service work tied to their social impact platforms as they prepare for the national stage.
“The Miss Delaware Scholarship Competition is more than a crown — it’s a celebration of service, scholarship, and the extraordinary potential of young women across our state. We are proud to provide a platform that empowers them to lead, advocate, and inspire,” said Sue Kuhling, Executive Director and President of the Miss Delaware Scholarship Organization. 
“We are thrilled to welcome Avery and Hailey as our Miss Delaware’s Teen and Miss Delaware 2025. Their passion, poise, and commitment to service embody everything this organization stands for. I can’t wait to see where their year of impact and leadership takes them — it’s going to be something special.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Avery-Crowning-1-819x1024.jpeg,,,2025-06-16 14:05:59.766660

(Alaska DOT&PF photo)A stretch of the Dalton Highway near the Saginavirktok River was washed out by flood waters on Saturday, leading to an 80-foot-wide gap in the only road leading to Prudhoe Bay.
As a result, the highway is closed between Milepost 305 and 356. 
The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, which said the washout was due to a failed culvert, expects to reopen the road by Wednesday.
The North Slope experienced a cool spring followed by a stretch of warm weather that contributed to a rapid breakup on the Saginavirktok River and other bodies of water in the far north.
DOT said on Saturday that water was overtopping the road at another spot near the washout, there were places with shoulder damage, and at a site nearer Prudhoe Bay, water was being trapped against the raised roadbed due to a partially blocked culvert. 
This year’s flooding, while significant, is less than what occurred in 2015, when huge stretches of the highway were washed out, causing an 18-day halt to traffic.
Climate change and permafrost thawing are making the North Slope’s ground increasingly unstable and are contributing to chaotic river breakups across the state.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54591675574_8b44ee2064_o.jpg,,,2025-06-16 14:05:59.766660

(Getty Images)Five attorneys at risk of losing their jobs running local public defense offices accused State Public Defender Rémy Starns of discriminating against the women who have run those offices. 

The attorneys said Starns has targeted women for layoffs, having sought the termination of six of the 11 women who have led Louisiana’s local public defender offices over the past three years. 

The State Public Defender Oversight Board deferred a vote Monday on whether to affirm Starns’ decision to lay off the five attorneys, three of whom are women. A board committee is expected to meet Wednesday to further review Starns’ recommendation that the lawyers lose their jobs. 
Starns forcefully denied allegations that he has targeted women who report to him. 

“Those statements are false, and I believe they knew them to be false,” Starns said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The attorneys Starns wants to fire include Michelle AndrePont in Caddo Parish, Brett Brunson in Natchitoches Parish, Deirdre Fuller in Rapides Parish, Trisha Ward in Evangeline Parish and John Hogue, who works in Tensas, Madison and East Carroll parishes. 
The board’s decision to delay the vote came after testimony from the targeted attorneys accusing Starns of discrimination. 
“My termination is not just unwarranted, it’s retaliatory. …. It’s because I’m a woman,” AndrePont said. 
Brunson and Hogue, who are men, said Starns is attempting to force them out of their jobs because they have defended their women colleagues. 

“His targeting of women was unacceptable,” Brunson told the board. 

The five attorneys also said Starns was trying to remove them from their jobs because they had spoken out several times against Starns’ policies in legislative and state public defender board hearings over the past few years. 

Starns was first appointed state public defender in 2020 by former Gov. John Bel Edwards and rehired last year by Gov. Jeff Landry. 
Monday’s board meeting testimony is the latest installment in a months-long fight over whether Starns has the right to fire the five public attorneys. Their job contracts have not been renewed beyond July 1, when Starns said he planned to have interim public defender chiefs take over their duties. 

“Reject the fiction that these are routine contract renewals. They are not,” Hogue said.

Among the voting council members is James Moore, an addiction recovery advocate in Hattiesburg. He said his local lawmaker, Republican House Medicaid Chair Missy McGee, called him Wednesday and asked him, on behalf of Speaker of the House Jason White, to serve as a voting member of the council. 
Earlier that day, Mississippi Today published a story about how Moore and other parents who’ve lost their children to addiction were upset that local city and county governments were spending opioid settlement money on items not directly related to recovery and without their input. 
Moore said he is looking forward to hearing from others with expertise addressing addiction as a public health problem — like those who’ve struggled with and treated substance use disorder.
“I’ll be reaching out to those folks to try to give me direction, so that I can pass that on to the decision makers,” he said. 
The people tasked with appointing the advisors have submitted 13 of the 15 members who will vote on state opioid settlement grant proposals, and 21 out of 22 nonvoting seats, according to the Mississippi Attorney General’s office. 
State lawmakers passed Senate Bill 2767 in the spring, and Gov. Tate Reeves signed it into law April 10. The law calls for creation of an advisory council that would develop a grant application process to spend an estimated $259 million of national opioid settlement money the state has been receiving. The committee is asked to make recommendations of which grants to approve, and legislators can accept or reject those. 
The law instructed a variety of powerful Mississippians to appoint the council members by last Monday, 60 days after the bill was signed into law. Reeves, who did not respond to questions about the advisory committee, is responsible for assigning the last two unassigned voting members. State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney is supposed to nominate the last nonvoting council seat — a representative of the state’s private addiction treatment facilities.
Mississippi State Health Department spokesperson Greg Flynn said that Edney would send his nominee to the attorney general’s office last week, but the seat was unassigned as of Friday afternoon, according to the Attorney General’s office. 
Another member of the voting block, Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones, said he would like to see projects that prioritize addiction prevention education for the general public and overdose response tools for law enforcement officers, like the overdose-reversing drug naloxone. 
“This is something our communities are plagued with,” he said. “By having law enforcement personnel at the table, we have firsthand knowledge of the effects opioids have in the community.” 
As members of the advisory committee, Moore and Jones’ recommendations will still need legislative approval. Moore knows this, and he said people tend to listen to his ideas when he shares his family’s experiences. 
“I’m not speaking about statistics and numbers,” he said. “I’m speaking [as] an individual. I’m speaking by an empty chair at our table.” 
The law says the council’s first meeting must be held by July 9.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/03165931/3X0A2637.jpg,,,2025-06-16 14:05:59.766660

(Photo provided by U.S. Army National Guard/Sgt. 1st Class Brad Mincey)South Carolina Army and Air National Guard members can now apply for $12,000 in annual state aid to help pay for college.
Legislators, in the new budget year beginning July 1, more than doubled the annual allotment for what’s known as the South Carolina National Guard College Assistance Program.
“These enhancements clearly demonstrate the state’s appreciation for military service and will strengthen South Carolina’s future workforce,” said Jeff Perez, the head of the state higher education agency which administers the financial aid.
For the 2023-2024 school year, 910 guard members participated in the program and received $3.8 million in assistance, an average of $4,000 annually per student.
If those enrollment numbers remain steady, spending on the program could rise as high as $10.9 million for the 2025-2026 school year.
“This investment reaffirms South Carolina’s commitment to valuing service, believing in the potential of its Guardsmen, and supporting the futures of its Guard members,” Adjutant General Robin Stilwell said in a statement.
Funding is limited to $4,000 per semester, so students would need to enroll in fall, spring and summer classes to receive the full annual benefit.
Also. while the program has been around since 2007, its funding is not guaranteed year-to-year. And there is a lifetime cap on the amount of money each applicant receives: $25,000.
To be eligible, applicants must have completed basic training and be active members of the South Carolina Army or Air National Guard. The money can be used to help cover the cost of a certificate program through the state technical college system, courses associated with a registered apprenticeship program, an associates degree or a bachelor’s degree.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54575799228_e21e3a59a6_c.jpg,,,2025-06-16 14:05:59.766660

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Payday lending reform appears bound for passage in the Rhode Island General Assembly this year after more than a decade of failed attempts.
The Rhode Island House of Representatives was scheduled to vote Monday afternoon on legislation that would cap the annual percentage rate for short-term, small-dollar loans at 36% — compared with the up-to-260% APR that deferred deposit providers can charge now. Meanwhile, the Senate Committee on Commerce is poised to advance a similar proposal Tuesday, setting the stage for the bill’s forthcoming debut on the Senate floor: the first time in its 15-year history.
“I cannot tell you how happy I am to see this bill finally going to the floor,” Sen. Ana Quezada, a Providence Democrat and legislation sponsor, said in an interview Monday. “I couldn’t believe it when I saw it on the [legislative] calendar.”
Quezada continued, “This is a huge step for payday lending reform after all these years.”
It’s not a done deal yet — both chambers must still approve the legislation, along with a signature from Gov. Dan McKee, who supports it. But Quezada was confident that a majority of the upper chamber supported the repeal of predatory lending practices. And the House of Representatives already signaled strong support in a sweeping 70-2 vote for nearly identical legislation in 2023.
The perennial push to bring Rhode Island’s payday loan policy in line with 22 other states, and federal government, began in 2011 under former Democratic Rep. Frank Ferri, of Warwick, and Sen. Harold Metts, of Providence. 
But it has gained increasing attention and traction on Smith Hill in more recent years. McKee and the rest of the state’s general officeholders signed a petition urging lawmakers to approve the reform in the waning days of the 2024 session. 
The major barrier for at least the last eight years has been the late former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. Advocates pinpointed Ruggerio, who as Senate president decided what legislation advanced out of committee to the full chamber, as their biggest obstacle. Ruggerio died on April 21.
“I always felt under Senate President Ruggerio this bill would never see the light,” Quezada said.
Senate President Valarie Lawson, who succeeded Ruggerio in Senate leadership elections, supports the bill, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, said in an email Monday. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi also expressed support in a separate emailed statement.










I cannot tell you how happy I am to see this bill finally going to the floor.


– Sen. Ana Quezada, a Providence Democrat and legislation sponsor


The Senate leadership has changed, but criticism by institutions that offer speedy access to cash at triple-digit APR has not. 
William Murphy, the former House Speaker who now works as a lobbyist for Purpose Financial Inc., parent company of Advance America, reiterated the payday lending company’s opposition when asked for comment Monday.
“Passage of this legislation will cause Advance America’s employees to lose their jobs and health coverage that they and their families depend on,” Murphy said in an email. “The State will now have eight additional vacant storefronts. Importantly, thousands of Rhode Islanders will lose much needed immediate access to credit and the ability to make their own personal financial choice. There are no equal alternatives for people in Rhode Island.”
Alan Krinsky, research and fiscal policy director for the Economic Progress Institute, said the bill does not force any storefront or lending company to shut down.
“It simply requires them to play by the rules of any other lending institution,” Krinsky said in an interview.
Murphy has repeatedly said that Advance America only charges a 10% fee per transaction. Krinsky has disputed this claim.
“Their math is wrong on that,” Krinsky said, noting that a single interest rate is not the same as the annual interest rate.
Research by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that borrowers in need of quick access to cash take, on average, eight cycles to repay their original loan, compounding the interest rate with each cycle.
In 2022, the most recent data available, Rhode Island borrowers paid an estimated $2.8 million on interest and fees associated with payday loans, based on the $28.2 million of money borrowed across 80,650 loans, according to a January 2025 report by the Center for Responsible Lending.
Research by Pew and the Center for Responsible Lending also contradict opponents’ arguments that payday loans help people who lack access to traditional financial services. However, in states where payday loans aren’t available, borrowers have successfully turned to friends, negotiated with debtors or cut other costs. Annual percentage rate caps on short-term loans in other New England States have saved those residents an estimated $252.7 million a year.
Seeking compromise, lawmakers have agreed to push back the start date of the cap on payday loans. Original legislation called for the annual percentage rate cap to take effect immediately. But the amended version being voted on in the House Monday delays the start till Jan. 1, 2027. 
Rep. Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat and bill sponsor, said she pitched the later start date to give employees of payday lending operations time to find new jobs. 
Krinsky agreed that it “made sense” to give existing payday lenders time to “wind down operations,” if they choose not to continue offering loans at lower annual percentage rates.
Margaux Morisseau, co-chair of the Rhode Island Coalition for Payday Lending Reform, would have preferred an immediate start date.
“It’s not ideal because it leaves a whole ‘nother year for people to be taken advantage of,” she said.
But, she added, “In the sense of compromise, this was where we are most comfortable compromising.”
The Senate companion does not yet contain the later start date yet, though Quezada said she intends to advocate for the tweak prior to the committee’s vote Tuesday. If passed out of committee, the Senate companion could be taken up by the full chamber Wednesday, Paré said.

Kim Reynolds’ “healthier and cheaper” alternative to federal summer food assistance programs is again facing criticism that it is less convenient and covers fewer food-insecure Iowans than the national program and offers families fewer choices than initially promised.
Reynolds’ Healthy Kids Iowa was announced in May after the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the pilot program as an alternative to the federal Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer program. The federal program would have added $40 per month to a family’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program card for each school-age child during schools’ summer break that can be used at retailers across the state.
The Healthy Kids Iowa program was billed in the initial release as having “more than 500 access points statewide.” Currently, there are 254 access points for the governor’s program, where families can pick up pre-made boxes of food, valued at $40, to be prepared at home.  A spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services said the remaining access points are summer meal sites overseen by the Department of Education, where kids can eat a meal on site.
Meanwhile, there are over 2,900 retailers across Iowa that accept SNAP benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Advocates for food assistance say the state’s program falls far short of Summer EBT as a way to get help to families in need.
“Transportation barriers exist whether you’re two blocks away from a summer meal site or a Healthy Kids Iowa site or 20 miles,” said Luke Elzinga, board chair of Iowa Hunger Coalition. 
Additionally, in the May announcement, Iowans were told they could “choose their monthly items, respecting their preferences and cultural and dietary needs.” Elzinga says that this is something his team “hasn’t necessarily seen pan out.” However, certain locations, such as the HACAP food reservoir in Hiawatha, allow families to choose from three prepackaged “menus.” 
Reynolds said in an interview in late May with “Iowa Press,” the program cost the state around $9 million to administer. A more recent Facebook post from the governor’s office claims the new program cost the state $19,000 in administrative costs.
Iowa HHS contracted six Feeding America Food Banks to administer the new program throughout the state. These food banks are in charge of sourcing the food, finding distribution partners and determining areas of need throughout the state. 
“Well, it’s a heavy lift but we’re getting it done,” said Annette Hacker, vice president of Food Bank of Iowa. “It’s funding relief that was not available in our state the past two years, so obviously we support any effort that will get more food on the table for Iowa kids.”
Hacker said her team had “just a little over a month to prepare.” Preliminary talks with Iowa HHS on a plan for this program began in April with a revised plan being submitted on June 3. Some Healthy Kids Iowa sites began serving food the next day. Hacker said this was made possible by the commitment of 125 of the food bank’s 700 partners, which are acting as sites for the program. 
The food itself is chosen in accordance with the USDA “Thrifty Food Plan,” which focuses on foods that are “nutritious, broadly appeal to kids and/or are easy to prepare by kids and caregivers.” Eligible families are given one pre-made box of food per month, per child at one of 254 locations statewide.
Some examples of items the Food Bank of Iowa purchased are macaroni and cheese cups, pasta and sauce, 1% milk, fruit and vegetable cups, ground beef, fresh produce (including avocados, grapes, pears, clementines and apples), shredded cheese, fresh eggs, protein waffle/pancake mix, tortillas, deli meat, whole wheat crustless sandwiches made with a peanut butter alternative, and protein shakes. However, available foods vary at each site.
Despite an emphasis on fresh foods and produce, Hacker says there “shouldn’t be any concerns about perishability because everything is fresh, first run, good, nutritious food.” The team has deliberately chosen fresh foods with longer shelf life. Hacker also said Food Bank of Iowa “can stretch a dollar pretty far” because purchases are made in bulk. 
Food insecurity on the rise
“Food insecurity is at record levels and it has been climbing for the last three-plus years,” she said. “Ever since April 2022 when pandemic-era benefits were lifted, we’ve seen rising and record numbers every single month.”
According to Feeding America, about 385,130 people are facing hunger in Iowa — and of those, more than 120,000 are children. The Feeding America network distributed over 6 million meals last year. In comparison, SNAP provided nine times that amount. 
In Iowa, 40.7% of households receiving SNAP benefits have children. Additionally, USDA research suggests that summer EBT programs can decrease the number of kids with very low food security by one-third; increase the consumption of whole grains, dairy, fruits and vegetables; and decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption. 
Elzinga says the program, which would have cost the state $4.4 million, according to a post from Reynolds, has a 50% administrative cost share, meaning it would have cost the state $2.2 million to administer. Additionally, USDA has grant programs “could have halved the cost.” 
Fewer kids fed with state program
The Iowa Hunger Coalition submitted a sign-on letter protesting the governor’s decision not to participate in summer EBT in December 2024. Elzinga said Healthy Kids Iowa aims to assist about 65,000 kids throughout the state, just over a quarter of the estimated 245,000 kids who would have been assisted by summer EBT programs. Additionally, Elzinga notes that administering this program could have generated up to $45.4 million in state economic activity. 
“I don’t think cost was ever the barrier,” Elzinga said. “It seemed like the opposition to summer EBT was rooted in the fact that you weren’t allowed to ban certain food items from being purchased.”
Elzinga said the coalition was told by the governor’s office “there’s no evidence that (summer EBT) promotes healthy eating.” Since December 2023, when Reynolds originally opted out of participating, the USDA has allowed states to restrict certain food items. On Jan. 1, 2026, Iowa will restrict the usage of SNAP benefits in purchasing “all taxable food items as defined by the Iowa Department of Revenue except food producing plants and seeds for food producing plants.”
Elzinga said his team tried unsuccessfully to persuade the governor to put in place a similar restriction to allow for the implementation of summer EBT that would exclude sugary treats.
SNAP cuts raise concerns
Hacker said Food Bank of Iowa is “gravely concerned” about the proposed cuts to SNAP under the “big, beautiful bill” and says it will have “devastating impacts” on Iowa families. The expansive budget bill would cut upward of $220 billion from SNAP, the biggest cut in the history of the program.
She also notes state “cost-sharing” annually will cost Iowa another $40 million to administer food services. Elzinga also notes that cost-shifting could affect other programs through Iowa HHS, including Medicare and Medicaid, both of which will also see unprecedented cuts under this bill. 
“This is a massive, complicated, messy bill to understand but it will cut out 9.5 billion meals a year for people facing food insecurity,” she said. “If you look at all 200 Feeding America food banks, and all the partners, the pantries and agencies we support across the entire country, last year we distributed 6 billion meals. So how in the world could the charitable food system absorb 9.5 billion more meals a year?”

Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park as part of a larger plot to kill Democratic elected officials and other advocates of abortion rights.
Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
The arrest comes after a 43-hour manhunt — the largest in state history, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.
At the time of his arrest, Boelter was armed, but ultimately surrendered. Officers did not use any force, said Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger of the Minnesota State Patrol.
In the state’s new Emergency Operations Center in Blaine — which was paid for by legislation passed by Hortman’s DFL-controlled House in 2020 — Gov. Tim Walz thanked law enforcement and decried political violence and hateful rhetoric.
“This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country, and each and every one of us can do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than argue, debate an issue, shake hands, find common ground.”

Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats of violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. He survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. An unsealed criminal complaint indicates that the Hoffmans’ daughter called the police to report the shooting of her parents, the Associated Press reports.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the attacker in a fake law enforcement uniform shoot Mark Hortman through the open front door, according to the complaint. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a cop car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds.
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle. From there, teams from dozens of law enforcement agencies fanned out in search of Boelter.
Boelter was spotted in the area, and officers converged around him, Evans said. He declined to provide some details of the tactics used by law enforcement to capture Boelter.
Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.
“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation…those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.

Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Strib.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Times reported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On Sunday night as leaders spoke to the press, Boelter was being questioned by law enforcement, but officials declined to say where he was detained and which agency was questioning him.
On the steps of the State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.

The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.

Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.

Trump’s hopes for next year

The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Lisa Bowman, director of marketing and communications at the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Bowman wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” she wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”

For housing providers, uncertainty is growing

For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Hoosier housing advocates — who’ve long held that the state lacks enough affordable, stable and safe dwellings — asked Gov. Mike Braun to convene a dedicated commission in a Friday letter signed by nearly 700 supporters.
“Indiana is experiencing a crisis,” reads the document, which was led by community economic development group Prosperity Indiana.
“Despite incremental steps taken by state policymakers to address pieces of the crisis, there remains a dire need for leadership to coordinate among Indiana government branches, agencies, and stakeholders to resolve the dangers caused by this shortage and the difficulties of enforcing health and safety standards,” the request continues.
Advocates acknowledged recently implemented programs as bright spots, including a revolving loan fund to support pricey housing infrastructure build-outs and a massive regional economic development initiative.
  Gov. Mike Braun speaks to reporters at the Indiana Statehouse on Tuesday, June 3, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
But the crisis persists, the letter contends.
The state has only 38 affordable rental homes available for every 100 extremely low-income Hoosier households, according to a March analysis by Prosperity Indiana.
That’s a gap of nearly 140,000 units for the 220,000 households with incomes at or below the poverty level or 30% of their area’s median income. And about 75% of such households spend more than half of their limited incomes on housing, meaning they’re “severely” cost-burdened.
“Because of this shortage and rising costs, too many of the most vulnerable Hoosiers are thrown into housing instability,” the letter continues. “They must make do with inadequate housing that they cannot afford, subjecting themselves and their children to the risk of eviction and homelessness.”
More than 70,000 Indiana households have had an eviction filed against them in the past year alone, according to Eviction Lab. An additional 95,000 households — including about 115,000 children — are at risk of eviction, per the National Equity Atlas’ rent debt dashboard.
The letter went on to argue that housing instability forces Hoosiers into inferior units, which may expose occupants to poisonous lead, infectious disease, violence and more.
Related complications include Indiana’s “patchwork of codes for health and safety” in rental housing and the “difficulties in enforcing” them.
“There are widely diverging methods and standards for enforcement of local and state codes between Indiana’s 92 counties and additional cities, with many reporting apparent confusion and roadblocks when it comes to implementation at the local level,” the letter holds. “This is what allows for subpar housing to exist.”
It cites last year’s South Bend rental home fire as an example of the potentially deadly consequences. WNDU reported that the house failed a safety inspection for electrical problems just months before it caught fire and killed six children.
“We believe that Indiana would benefit from a comprehensive review and evaluation of its existing systems of code standards and enforcement to inform public policy and safeguard the health and safety of Hoosiers,” the letter concludes. “Doing so would improve the quality of available affordable housing and protect households of limited financial means. We also believe that Indiana would benefit from increased collaboration among Indiana government branches, agencies, and stakeholders to take additional steps to increase the supply of affordable housing.”

The Trout Fire and the Buck Fire north of Silver City have both burned more than 45,000 acres since starting a few days ago. (Photo courtesy Pinos Altos Volunteer Fire and Rescue.)Two wildfires in southwestern New Mexico that began less than a week ago have burned more than 70 square miles and were both 0% contained as of Monday morning, according to the latest updates.
The Trout Fire and the Buck Fire are both located north of Silver City and within a little more than 30 miles of each other. The Trout Fire, which began June 12, has burned more than 12,000 acres; the Buck Fire north of it, which began June 11, has burned about 34,000. 
More than 750 people are fighting both fires, including with helicopters and air tankers. 
Officials ordered evacuations for the Trout Fire in areas north and south of the blaze, with people in some other areas nearby ordered to prepare to leave quickly. An evacuation map can be found here. An evacuation shelter is available at the Convention Center in Silver City.
NM wildfire dispatch centers no longer face threat of closure, Heinrich says

No evacuations have been ordered for those in the area of the Buck Fire, though the Continental Divide Trail runs through both fire perimeters. As a result, Continental Divide Trail administrators have issued a “soft closure” along a 40-mile length of the trail area to discourage any CDT hikers from hiking through the area. 
According to the Continental Divide Trail Coalition, an “official closure” is forthcoming. 
The fires occur in a part of the state that forecasters have warned for months will see elevated wildfire risk this summer, thanks to high heat, extremely low snowpack and ongoing drought. 
The team leading firefighters responding to the Trout Fire reported that clouds moved into the area on Sunday afternoon, weather that helped moderate the wildfire spread. 
The Buck Fire’s remote terrain makes access difficult, though fire crews made progress overnight with the help of fire-fighting aircraft, according to the latest update. Fire officials have determined that lightning caused the Buck Fire.
The cause of the Trout Fire remains undetermined.
The Buck Fire stands as the biggest wildfire to burn in New Mexico this year, according to a Source review of the fire season. The Trout Fire is on its way to becoming the second-biggest. Until last week, the 16,000-acre Mogote Hill Fire near Wagon Mound had been the biggest of the year.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PhotoAndVid_20250612_CourtesyOfPAVFR_Trout000384_0812-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-16 13:10:51.680638

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Four new film productions are headed for Utah and will receive a tax credit under the state’s film incentive program, including a “Yellowstone” spinoff and a new season of “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch.”
That’s according to the Utah Film Commission, which made the announcement on Friday. The four productions will generate an estimated economic impact of about $57.4 million and more than 380 jobs, with filming set to take place in Salt Lake, Summit, Wasatch and Uintah counties.

The “Yellowstone” spinoff — titled “Y: Marshals” — is the latest addition to the popular series that drew millions of viewers and was partly filmed in Utah. But after filming three seasons in the Beehive State, the production packed up and relocated to Montana, where it was offered a better tax break. That loss contributed to lawmakers expanding the state’s film incentive for rural productions.
“Y: Marshals” will star Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton, continuing the arc of his “Yellowstone” character as a member of the U.S. Marshalls. Production will begin in Summit County this fall, and the show has a $52 million budget.
“Utah is such a draw for film and television because of its diverse landscapes, fantastic crews, and amazing, knowledgeable film office,” said Adam Morra, vice president of planning and finance for Paramount Global, in a statement. “There is no doubt, though, the film incentive is a vital and necessary part of the package.”
 History Channel’s ‘Skinwalker Ranch’ also receives Utah’s tax credit

The seventh season of “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch” will also receive a tax credit under the state’s rural film incentive program. Focused on the notorious Skinwalker Ranch in Uintah County, the History Channel show follows researchers who explore the ranch’s reported paranormal activity. It has a $3.2 million budget.
Filmed in Wasatch and Summit counties with a $1.8 million budget, “Keep Coming Back” is the third production to receive incentives under the state’s rural film program. It’s an independent film from director and producer Mark Rosman, who said the tax incentives, experienced film crews and proximity to Los Angeles made Utah a draw.
“When it came to picking a state to shoot the film, it was natural to look at Utah,” Rosman said in a statement.
And the new competition show “Freshman Inventors” will receive a rebate under the Utah Community Film Incentive Program. With plans to film in Salt Lake County with a $300,000 budget, the Netflix show highlights Gen Z inventors.
The Utah Motion Picture Incentive Program offers a refundable tax credit up to 25% for funds spent in the state, with different sums of money set aside for productions that meet certain criteria. The rural film incentive — which “Y: Marshals,” “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch” and “Keep Coming Back” qualified for — sets aside $12 million per year for projects that spend at least 75% of production days in a rural county.
The community film incentive program is a 20% post-performance cash rebate for projects that originate in Utah. It’s aimed at helping smaller productions with budgets between $100,000 to $500,000, and is meant to promote up-and-coming local filmmakers, according to Utah Film Studios.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Freedom’s Frontier, a coalition of more than 200 historically significant sites on both sides of the Kansas-Missouri border, will “cease to exist” if Congress approves proposed legislation to defund National Heritage Areas, the organization’s spokesman says.
Johnny Szlauderbach, director of communications and strategic projects at Freedom’s Frontier, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that “everything’s in a bit of a crisis state right now in terms of government funding.” Congress allocates about $500,000 annually to the organization, he said.
“If anybody really cares about preserving this history, about this region’s significance on a national level, and about building economic development in these small towns and helping these small sites thrive, I would encourage you to contact your representatives on Capitol Hill and tell them about how important Freedom’s Frontier’s continued existence is,” Szlauderbach said.


President Donald Trump’s administration has yet to release congressionally approved funding for National Heritage Areas, pending congressional action on proposed legislation to defund the program, which is administered through the National Park Service.
On Friday, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, a Missouri Democrat, sent a letter to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget urging the release of funds for Freedom’s Frontier and other National Heritage Areas.
“This delay in funding is causing significant strain on our NHAs — many of which rely on small staffs and robust volunteer networks,” they said in their letter.
The 62 National Heritage Areas are supported through public-private partnerships that require local matching funds. The areas recognize historic, cultural and natural resources, with an emphasis on preservation, recreation, tourism and educational projects.
Freedom’s Frontier, which unites more than 200 sites across 41 counties in eastern Kansas and western Missouri, preserves the story of the border war that preceded Kansas’ entry into the union, the enduring struggle for freedom and the settlement of the western frontier.
“This area is interesting in that it’s served as a kind of microcosm for concepts of freedom throughout American history,” Szlauderbach said, from the abolition of slavery to the fight for women’s suffrage, to the landmark legal battle that ended segregation in public schools.
“This is a testing ground. We serve to be stewards of that nationally significant story,” Szlauderbach said.
Freedom’s Frontier encompasses sites as large as the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri, or the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park in Topeka, and as small as the Little House on the Prairie Museum in Independence, Kansas.
The National Park Service board recently designated Quindaro Townsite in Kansas City, Kansas, as a National Historic Landmark, pending approval from U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.
Szlauderbach said Freedom’s Frontier also partners with volunteer-run “passion projects” like historical societies or the preservation of one-room schoolhouses in “very rural locations.” Freedom’s Frontier is in a unique position to connect those sites and can help with grant writing, he said.
“All we want to do is make sure that people understand that these stories are nationally significant,” Szlauderbach  said. “And beneath all of that, this program really, truly promotes economic development and tourism. If somebody goes and visits one of our partner sites, they have to stop at a local gas station along the way. They’re going to eat lunch at some local diner.
“We’re trying to build these small towns and bring money to rural communities. That’s fundamentally, in essence, what we do. And so it’s disappointing when people in Washington don’t necessarily appreciate that.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6130226-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-16 13:10:51.680638

His work revealed civil rights abuses in Louisiana and Mississippi. (Courtesy of David Ridgen)JACKSON, Miss. – America lost a gentle giant in journalism when Stanley Nelson, who investigated some of the nation’s most notorious racially motivated slayings in Mississippi and Louisiana, died unexpectedly last week. He was 69.
CBC reporter David Ridgen, an award-winning documentary filmmaker and podcast host, worked with the reporter for years. “Stanley Nelson is the best of us,” he said. “A doer. Not a reminiscer. A teller. Not someone to leave anyone behind. A brotherly guy who you’d trust anything to.”
In 2008, Ridgen and I joined forces with Nelson and fellow journalists John Fleming, Ben Greenberg, Pete Nicks, Robert Rosenthal, Hank Klibanoff, Ronnie Agnew, Melvin Claxton, Peter Klein and others to form the Civil Rights Cold Cases Project. Our dream was to create a documentary that would capture our continuing work on these cases.
The big picture documentary never happened, but many other projects emerged for radio, print and film. Nelson never missed a beat, writing hundreds of stories for the 5,000-circulation Concordia Sentinel, where he served as editor.
In 2012, he became a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his stories on the 1964 killing of Frank Morris in Ferriday, Louisiana, by Klansmen who belonged to the violent wing, the “Silver Dollar Group.”
Best-selling author Greg Iles depicted the journalist as the character Henry Sexton in his novel, “Natchez Burning.” Nelson chuckled to me about the portrayal, saying his alter ego lived a much more adventurous life: “He is a musician, has a girlfriend and is tech savvy — that’s something I don’t know a damn thing about.”
Iles said the most important writing he’s ever done “would not exist were it not for the inspiration and selfless collaboration of Stanley Nelson. I never knew another man who always did the right thing regardless of fear or favor, not motivated by hope for profit or fame. Stanley eventually gained a wide reputation for excellence, but not because he sought it. Because he earned it. And God knows the world is a better place because he lived and worked in it.”
First case: Frank Morris
On the last day of February in 2007, Nelson heard the name of Frank Morris for the first time. He learned that the Justice Department would be taking a second look at the 1964 killing of Morris.
That surprised Nelson because he thought he knew almost everything about this small town and had never heard the name.
He reached out to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which shared about 150 pages of redacted FBI reports on the Morris case, and he wrote his first article.
He didn’t see how he could advance the story anymore until he received a call from Morris’ granddaughter, Rosa Williams, and began to learn more about the man and the killing.
On a cold December morning in 1964, the 51-year-old Morris was asleep in the back of his shoe repair store when he heard glass breaking. He bolted to the front of the store and saw one man pouring gasoline and another holding a shotgun, who yelled, “Get back in there, n—–!”
By the time Morris escaped, his feet were bleeding, and nearly all his clothing had been burned from his body. He survived long enough to tell FBI agents that he didn’t know his attackers, but friends wondered if he had been afraid to say.

‘His curiosity never waned’
In 2011, Nelson reported that family members of Arthur Leonard Spencer said he had confessed to them years earlier, but Spencer denied that claim to Nelson. A federal grand jury met on the matter, but no one was ever arrested.
Klibanoff, who works with Emory University students on civil rights cold cases and hosts the Peabody-winning podcast “Buried Truths,” helped Nelson edit those stories. “We were going over them till 9, 10 or 11 at night, because we both had full-time jobs,” he recalled. “Stanley was busy covering police juries, the city council and other things during the day.”
Nelson remained rock solid in his reporting, Klibanoff said. “I admired him immensely, and his curiosity never waned.”
The journalist moved beyond the Morris killing to document other violence by the Silver Dollar Group, depicted as the “Double Eagles” in “Natchez Burning.” The group, which included some law enforcement officers, was suspected of planting bombs in the vehicles of two NAACP leaders in Natchez, George Metcalfe and Wharlest Jackson. Metcalfe was injured in the blast, and Jackson was killed.
Nelson also reported on possible involvement of the Silver Dollar Group in the 1964 disappearance of a 21-year-old Black man, Joseph Edwards. His white and green Buick was found abandoned near a local bowling alley in Vidalia, Louisiana.
Ridgen said Nelson has been telling him for years that he believed he had found where Edwards’ body was buried.
When Ridgen worked with Nelson, he would stay with him on his Cash Bayou farm near the Tensas River. At night, they would drink together, Nelson sipping a glass of Old Charter.
“I shared and pored over thousands of pages of FBI files with him over the years. Confronted Klansmen, and visited the families so awfully affected by them,” he said. “Stanley’s passion was writing and local reporting but also investigation and uncovering the history that surrounded him and that he grew up with.”
He collected old investigative documents, FBI interviews and local police reports. “Saw them as treasures that contained just the beginnings of the actual story,” Ridgen said. “He reported all the ends of the story, all the shades of gray. Always with an eye for the restorative power of the work.”
Ridgen believes that Nelson’s work, which includes two books on the Klan, should be required reading for Americans and the rest of the world. He “will be missed dearly by the state and country,” Ridgen said. “I wish we could travel those roads together forever.”
In 2009, the Louisiana State University Cold Case Project began helping Nelson with his research, and a decade later, Nelson began sharing tips and techniques with students on how he worked on these civil rights cases.
Christopher Drew leads LSU’s Manship School’s experiential journalism curriculum, which includes the project. Under Nelson’s tutelage, “our students proved that Robert Fuller, a businessman who later became a top Klan leader, killed four of his Black workers in 1960, not in self-defense, as the local authorities had allowed him to claim, but in an ambush following a dispute over back pay,” Drew said.
In 2022, a series by LSU students on the 1972 killings of two students at Southern University in Baton Rouge won a national award from Investigative Reporters and Editors as the best investigative series by students at a large university.
“Stanley was always low-key, humble and determined to hear people out –– the model of what a reporter should be,” Drew said. “But the students were always leaning forward in their seats when he talked about how he got old Klan leaders to talk. ‘Most of them (Klansmen) lived on dirt roads at dead ends,’ he’d say, ‘with barbed wire fences and signs on the gate saying, ‘No Trespassing’ and ‘Trespassers Will Be Shot.’ Sometimes he’d send them letters saying he’d be coming at a certain date and time to mitigate those odds.
“But his heroism did not just come at those moments. It was his courage, the students could see, to dig up the dark facts in these communities for the sake of justice–and to take personal risks to hear what the suspects and perpetrators had to say–that make him such an exceptional journalist.”
LSU students plan to continue Nelson’s work on the Edwards’ case with a forensics team, Drew said. “We know where Stanley thinks the body might be, and we will continue to pursue that story.”Many of the stories written by Nelson and LSU students can be found at lsucoldcaseproject.com.

Hughes Justice Complex in Trenton. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for the state to empanel a grand jury to investigate clergy sex abuse, ruling that lower courts wrongly sided with the Diocese of Camden in its years-long crusade to squash the state’s probe and prevent a presentment that didn’t even exist yet.
Chief Justice Stuart Rabner, writing for a unanimous court, said no case law or court rule authorizes a judge to prohibit or evaluate a hypothetical or potential presentment.
“We cannot predict what a grand jury may find,” Rabner wrote. “Investigations evolve based on the testimony the grand jury hears and the evidence it uncovers. The subject matter and details of a grand jury investigation cannot be frozen in advance.”
For the same reason, suppressing a potential presentment is “simply premature,” Rabner added.
“Without a report to review, it is likewise too early for a judge to decide whether to strike parts of a presentment,” he added.
Grand juries “voice the conscience of the community” by investigating public harms and proposing reforms in a presentment, with judges empowered to release the grand jury’s report to the public — or strike whatever they deem objectionable or withhold the report altogether from public disclosure, the ruling notes.
But “the power to suppress should be used ‘sparingly,’” Rabner wrote, citing court precedent.
The jurist also rejected the diocese’s argument, which trial and appellate judges agreed with, that a grand jury probe would be a waste of time and resources, if a judge ultimately suppresses a presentment.
“That is not a relevant factor under the case law,” Rabner wrote.
First Assistant Attorney General Lyndsay V. Ruotolo celebrated the ruling.
“We are grateful for the New Jersey Supreme Court’s decision this morning confirming what we have maintained throughout this lengthy court battle: that there was no basis to stop the State from pursuing a grand jury presentment on statewide sexual abuse by clergy and the conditions that allowed it to go unchecked for so long,” she said in a statement. “We remain as committed today as throughout these past seven years to doing all we can to support survivors and advance the healing they deserve.”
Grand jury proceedings are secret under court rules, so Ruotolo did not address how soon a grand jury might be empaneled. But a Pennsylvania grand jury that issued a presentment in 2018 on clergy abuse there spent two years investigating and coming up with its 887-page report.
A spokeswoman for the diocese did not immediately respond to a request for comment, although the diocese gave up its court fight last month — two months after a new bishop took over.
In a May statement to parishioners, Bishop Joseph A. Williams explained the diocese’s legal surrender this way: “There is no ‘us’ and ‘them’ in this difficult reckoning of our recent history. Survivors are baptized — and hurting — members of Christ’s body who need a Good Samaritan Church at their side.”
Mark Crawford heads the New Jersey chapter of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. He said he was elated by the ruling, which he noted would ensure needed scrutiny of both the Catholic church and other institutions.
“For years the church hid — went out of their way to hide — crimes that were committed against children. It’s been six-plus years, and I’m glad that the victims will finally have the ability to tell their stories before a grand jury and let them determine the level of accountability, where that fault lies,” Crawford said. “And the public has every right to know, because this institution — and any other, not just the church — that deals with the public should not be above the law or free from public accountability.”

Kennedy Jr. appears at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Jan. 29. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)A document the Department of Health and Human Services sent to lawmakers to support Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to change U.S. policy on covid vaccines cites scientific studies that are unpublished or under dispute and mischaracterizes others.
One health expert called the document “willful medical disinformation” about the safety of covid vaccines for children and pregnant women.
“It is so far out of left field that I find it insulting to our members of Congress that they would actually give them something like this. Congress members are relying on these agencies to provide them with valid information, and it’s just not there,” said Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine.
Kennedy, who was an anti-vaccine activist before taking a role in the Trump administration, announced May 27 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer recommend covid vaccines for pregnant women or healthy children, bypassing the agency’s formal process for adjusting its vaccine schedules for adults and kids. The announcement, made on the social platform X, has been met with outrage by many pediatricians and scientists.
The HHS document meant to support Kennedy’s decision, obtained by KFF Health News, was sent to members of Congress who questioned the science and process behind his move, according to one federal official who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
The document has not been posted on the HHS website, though it is the first detailed explanation of Kennedy’s announcement from the agency.
Titled “Covid Recommendation FAQ,” the document distorts some legitimate studies and cites others that are disputed and unpublished, medical experts say.
HHS director of communications Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News, “There is no distortion of the studies in this document. The underlying data speaks for itself, and it raises legitimate safety concerns. HHS will not ignore that evidence or downplay it. We will follow the data and the science.”
HHS did not respond to a request to name the author of the document.
One of the studies the HHS document cites is under investigation by its publisher regarding “potential issues with the research methodology and conclusions and author conflicts of interest,” according to a link on the study’s webpage.
“This is RFK Jr.’s playbook,” said Sean O’Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “Either cherry-pick from good science or take junk science to support his premise — this has been his playbook for 20 years.”
Another study cited in the document is a preprint that has not been peer-reviewed. Under the study’s title is an alert that “it reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.” Though the preprint was made available a year ago, it has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
The FAQ supporting Kennedy’s decision claims that “post-marketing studies” of covid vaccines have identified “serious adverse effects, such as an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis” — conditions in which the heart’s muscle or its covering, the pericardium, suffer inflammation.
False claims that the 2024 preprint showed myocarditis and pericarditis only in people who received a covid vaccine, and not in people infected with covid, circulated on social media. One of the study’s co-authors publicly rejected that idea, because the study did not compare outcomes between people who were vaccinated and those infected with the covid virus. The study also focused only on children and adolescents. The HHS document omitted numerous other peer-reviewed studies that have shown that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is greater after contracting covid for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated people than the risk of the same complications after vaccination alone.
O’Leary said that while some cases of myocarditis were reported in vaccinated adolescent boys and young men early in the covid pandemic, the rates declined after the two initial doses of covid vaccines were spaced further apart.
Now, adolescents and adults who have not been previously vaccinated receive only one shot, and myocarditis no longer shows up in the data, O’Leary said, referring to the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink. “There is no increased risk at this point that we can identify,” he said.
In two instances, the HHS memo makes claims that are actively refuted by the papers it cites to back them up. Both papers support the safety and effectiveness of covid vaccines for pregnant women.
The HHS document says that another paper it cites found “an increase in placental blood clotting in pregnant mothers who took the vaccine.” But the paper doesn’t contain any reference to placental blood clots or to pregnant women.
“I’ve now read it three times. And I cannot find that anywhere,” said Turrentine, the OB-GYN professor.
If he were grading the HHS document, “I would give this an ‘F,’” Turrentine said. “This is not supported by anything and it’s not using medical evidence.”
While members of Congress who are physicians should know to check references in the paper, they may not take the time to do so, said Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology who directs the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “They’re going to assume this is coming from a scientific agency. So they are being hoodwinked along with everyone else who has had access to this document,” Silverman said.
The offices of three Republicans in Congress who are medical doctors serving on House and Senate committees focused on health, including Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), did not respond to requests for comment about whether they received the memo. Emily Druckman, communications director for Rep. Kim Schrier (D-Wash.), a physician serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Schrier’s office did receive a copy of the document.
“The problem is a lot of legislators and even their staffers, they don’t have the expertise to be able to pick those references apart,” O’Leary said. “But this one — I’ve seen much better anti-vaccine propaganda than this, frankly.”
C.J. Young, deputy communications director for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Democratic staff members of the committee received the document from HHS. In the past, he said, similar documents would help clarify the justification and scope of an administration’s policy change and could be assumed to be scientifically accurate, Young said.
“This feels like it’s breaking new ground. I don’t think that we saw this level of sloppiness or inattention to detail or lack of consideration for scientific merit under the first Trump administration,” Young said.
On June 4, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Schrier introduced a bill that would require Kennedy to adopt official vaccine decisions from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. Young said the motivation behind the bill was Kennedy’s decision to change the covid vaccine schedule without the input of ACIP’s vaccine experts, who play a key role in setting CDC policies around vaccine schedules and access.
Kennedy announced June 9 on X that he would remove all 17 members of ACIP, citing alleged conflicts of interest he did not detail, and replace them. He announced eight replacements June 11, including people who had criticized vaccine mandates during the covid pandemic.

(Dan Reynolds Photography/Getty Images)Families in western North Carolina whose homes were damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Helene last fall can now apply to the state’s rebuilding and repair program.
Applications single-family homes under “Renew NC” opened Monday, Gov. Josh Stein announced, a major landmark in the months-long process to begin swinging hammers in the mountains.
“There is a lot of work to do, and the Renew NC Housing program is the next step in helping western North Carolinians recover,” Stein said in a statement. “If your home was damaged by Hurricane Helene, you may be eligible for assistance depending on your income, so I encourage you to apply today.”
Here’s what to know about the program. Click here to apply.
Do I qualify for Renew NC homebuilding repairs?
Renew NC applications will be evaluated based on several key factors:

Location. Those who live in counties designated as “most impacted and distressed” — which includes almost all western NC counties — will be prioritized.
Income. Households making below their area’s median income will take priority.
Needs. That means a household has anyone under 18 years old, over 62, a person with a disability, or a person who requires accessibility accommodations.
Status of repairs. Are repairs on your home complete, or still needed?

Processing will be split into four phases, according to the state. And each of those phases will be further split based on priority. Phase 1, for instance, will include households who make below 60% of their area’s median income, and whose repairs are not completed. And those with household needs will take priority. (See the chart below for full explanation of the four phases.)

How do I apply?
You can apply to Renew NC through an online portal, in person at one of three office locations in western North Carolina, through the Renew NC mobile app or by phone.
Click here to reach the online portal. Download the mobile app on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Reach a case manager at 1-888-791-0207.
And visit one of the offices at these locations (open 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. Mon-Sat):

Asheville: 128 Bingham Rd., Suite 875
Boone: 379 New Market Blvd., Suite 1
Marion: 364 US Highway 70

You’ll need to supply a series of documents when you apply:

Valid photo I.D. and proof of citizenship, or lawful permanent resident status.
Income documentation for all household members over 18 years old.
Proof of all insurance covering damaged property.
Proof of property ownership.
Proof of primary residence.
For households with children or a member with a disability: a form of I.D. for children; Social Security disability statement, letter from doctor or other documentation for person with disability.
Proof of damage and benefit information (insurance claim, FEMA award letter, SBA award letter, certification of damage, neighborhood-level media reports, documentation by disaster response or relief organizations).
Various certificates and authorizations.

You can check on the status of your completed application on Renew NC’s online portal.
How long do I have to apply?
State officials have said they intend to keep applications open for single-family housing through the end of the year.
I live in multi-family or workforce housing. Am I eligible?
Not yet. Applications are only open at the moment for single-family housing.
The state will have separate programs for multi-family and workforce housing applicants. Those will open “later this year,” according to state officials.
How is Renew NC being funded?
The homebuilding program is paid for with federal dollars. Those dollars come from a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development program, called “Community Development Block Grants.” The state has received $1.4 billion from HUD under that program.
Asheville, the largest city in the western region hit hard by Helene, will separately receive $225 million in federal money under the program. The city is set to open its own program for housing, sending grants for various rental, ownership and repair costs.
Who is running the program?
The program is being overseen at the highest level by the Division of Community Revitalization — a new sector of the state’s Department of Commerce.
But that division has hired a contractor to manage the day-to-day operations in western North Carolina.
Horne LLP, a Mississippi-based firm, was awarded the state contract to administer construction over the next three years (and potentially longer). You can read more about their bid and the state’s award here.
I have more questions about my application, eligibility or the program more generally.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature video)TOPEKA — A small percentage of funds stolen from Kansas’ unemployment system during the pandemic have been recovered, the state labor secretary says, but time is running out to find the rest.
The Kansas Department of Labor processed hundreds of millions of dollars in fraudulent unemployment payments during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of which came from state funds.
Amber Shultz, the state labor secretary, called it an “extremely stressful and unfortunate part of our agency’s history.”
She told legislators at a Jun. 10 hearing that the state has recovered about 2.4% of fraudulent funds, or $11 million.
The state labor department processed about $460 million in fraudulent payments during the pandemic, said Derek Helms, a department spokesman. An initial 2021 audit put the number at $700 million in processed fraudulent claims, which was deemed incorrect when the department refined the numbers, Helms said.
Of the $460 million lost, $292 million were from state funding, and the remaining $168 million were federal funds, he said.
The onus of recovering lost funds has fallen on banks and law enforcement. The labor department works with them but there are limits to its investigating power.
“The department can only prepare and recommend cases for prosecution,” Helms said. “Once we do that, we’re out of the mix.”
Sen. Rick Billinger, a Goodland Republican, wondered at a meeting of the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency why Kansas lost the money it did when other states had similar computer systems and didn’t lose nearly as much.
He pointed to Colorado, which had a similar computer system to Kansas and reportedly paid out around $73 million in fraudulent claims. He called it a “drop in the bucket” compared to Kansas’ total.
“That’s why this bothers me,” Billinger said.
The U.S. Department of Labor estimates it processed between $100 billion and $135 billion in fraudulent claims across the country. About 1.2% of that has been recovered
As the five-year statute of limitations on fraud prosecution looms, the possibility of fraudsters being held accountable wanes, but Shultz was realistic about federal lawmakers making a change. The U.S. House passed the Pandemic Unemployment Fraud Enforcement Act in March, which could extend the statute of limitations, with all four of Kansas’ House members voting in favor of the bill. It has stalled in the U.S. Senate, however.
Shultz said sophisticated international crime rings filed the majority of fraudulent claims, making investigations and prosecutions even more difficult.
Before the pandemic, she said Kansas saw little unemployment fraud. The unparalleled surge in unemployment claims during the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed the state’s 1970s-era system, leading to millions in lost payments.
“The scammers thought, ‘This is pretty good money,’ ” Shultz said. “And so what we started seeing is people either stealing identities, or they would hijack claims.”
Now, that fraud is once again “incredibly rare,” Helms said.
The department launched a long-awaited new system in November, which has seen early success. It has reduced claims processing times and the number of calls to the agency’s contact center, and it has increased people successfully filing claims online without staff assistance, according to agency data.

In a move to improve emergency preparedness and long-term recovery efforts, the Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) has released the state’s first Disaster Housing Strategy, a framework aimed at guiding housing recovery in the aftermath of natural and man-made disasters.
The strategy outlines a coordinated approach to ensure displaced residents have access to stable housing after emergencies. Developed with support from the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), the strategy reflects a broader state initiative launched in 2023 to enhance disaster preparedness by promoting partnerships, identifying resources, and fostering interagency collaboration.
RELATED STORY: Delaware Officials urge residents to prepare for 2025 hurricane season
“The Disaster Housing Strategy will improve the state’s ability to provide housing support for displaced residents by educating decision makers on the steps needed to address short- and long-term housing needs in the wake of a disaster, and by identifying partners, capacities, available resources, and capabilities before disaster strikes,” said DSHA Director Matthew J. Heckles.
The strategy details six core goals spanning interim housing deployment, housing reconstruction, and tailored support for vulnerable populations. It also clarifies the roles and responsibilities of government agencies, nonprofits, and community organizations during different phases of disaster housing recovery.
“The strategy is a framework to guide state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and community group leaders on coordinating effective housing recovery efforts if disaster strikes,” Heckles said. “With guidance from the Delaware Emergency Management Agency, it encourages decision makers to prepare for emergencies and ensures that displaced residents have an equitable path toward stable housing after a disaster and that aid is distributed fairly across the state.”
A central feature of the initiative is the Disaster Housing Task Force (DHTF), a multi-sector coalition of public, private, and nonprofit stakeholders. The task force was instrumental in developing the strategy and serves as a vehicle for collaboration, resource-sharing, and streamlined communication among disaster recovery partners.
To address specific aspects of housing recovery more effectively, DSHA plans to expand the task force by establishing subcommittees and recruiting new partners. State officials hope the strategy will evolve as a “living document,” shaped by ongoing engagement with community members and housing experts.
“We are proud of the collaboration and hard work that went into creating this strategy,” Heckles added. “It is a living document, and DSHA will continue to add to its repertoire of housing-related resources as it strengthens existing partnerships and creates new ones.”
Officials say the strategy is intended not only to raise awareness across Delaware, but also to inspire action and serve as a reference for other agencies working to enhance disaster resilience in their communities.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-16-at-11.44.48 AM-1-1024x416.png,,,2025-06-16 13:10:51.680638

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
 Trump’s hopes for next year

The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Lisa Bowman, director of marketing and communications at the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Bowman wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” she wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
 
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
 


For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is urging insurers to continue covering vaccinations during pregnancy in an open letter signed by 30 prominent professional health organizations.
Pregnant patients and their infants are vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. In the letter to payers and insurance companies released this week, ACOG stressed the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations and how they protect babies and pregnant people. It was signed by prominent professional groups including the American College of Physicians, Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Public Health Association.
The letter follows U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy children and healthy pregnant patients, sidestepping an established decision process by scientists. Kennedy, who has made false claims questioning vaccine safety, earlier this week fired all 17 experts on the federal vaccine advisory committee panel, replacing them with eight new members, four of whom have spoken out against vaccines.
The Trump administration’s moves have alarmed health experts, who worry about coverage and access to the shot amid the agency’s dismissal of science.

“We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” the letter reads. “Given the historic gaps in research, investment, and support for women’s health, it is essential that all aspects of obstetric and gynecologic care — including COVID-19 vaccination — be grounded in the best available scientific evidence.
Studies have shown babies born following a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have a higher risk of low birth weights, stillbirth and respiratory distress, and data demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
Pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are also at higher risk of complications such as blood clots, are more likely to be hospitalized in intensive care units or to need ventilators, and are at a higher risk of death, the letter notes.
Payers should make the vaccine available to “pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” the letter reads. Without insurance, a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 shot can cost roughly $140 for adults.
Following the recommendation rollback, public health officials in some states have emphasized their support of COVID-19 vaccines.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, for example, said it “continues to recommend the current COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older,” noting that newborns “depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection.” Wisconsin Medicaid will also continue to cover the shot, the department said in a media release.
Officials in Georgia also said they expect continued coverage of the shot.
In Washington, a spokesperson for the state health agency told local media that the department is advising pregnant people to speak with their provider “to determine if receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is best for them.”
During this year’s legislative sessions, at least seven states introduced legislation aiming to ban or limit mRNA vaccines. Instead of using a weakened or dead version of the actual virus to stimulate an immune response, mRNA vaccines use a genetic code created in a laboratory to tell the body’s cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology.
“The COVID vaccines were a remarkable scientific accomplishment, and they remain the best tool that we have to prevent severe outcomes associated with COVID infection,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, ACOG president, wrote in a statement. “Ob-gyns know that COVID infection during pregnancy can be incredibly dangerous for our pregnant patients — and we know that the vaccine can protect both them and their infants after birth.”
When patients are “forced to pay out of pocket, or to cover high cost sharing,” he wrote, “they are less likely to be able to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”

(Getty Images)As an organization dedicated to the long-term recovery of New Orleans’ Lower 9th Ward after 2005 hurricanes and levee breaches, and ensuring food security here post-COVID, I am concerned by Governor Jeff Landry’s recent request to the federal government to restrict what Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants can purchase with food assistance.
The Lower 9th Ward continues to be what is called a “food desert” lacking any large grocery stores, and with many of its lower income residents depending on the food they can purchase from ‘dollar’ and discount stores. While the well-meaning intention of Make America Healthy Again is to improve food choices, until the ability for lower income families to access healthy foods in this and other neighborhoods, limiting items which can be purchased by SNAP benefits is unrealistic and unfair.
Evidence shows that people receiving SNAP benefits use them to purchase food, which is their intent. Restrictions don’t get to the root causes of the biggest barriers to achieving a healthy diet, which is the cost and availability of healthy foods.
In Louisiana, where nearly one in five households struggles with food insecurity, we need policies that expand access to nutrition—not restrict it. Instead of adding surveillance and undermining the dignity and autonomy of SNAP program participants, we should be investing in nutrition education, making healthy food more affordable and accessible, and lifting barriers to economic stability.

John James.
Adams said in a campaign announcement that the nation is at a crossroads and Michigan’s working families were “tired of politicians in Washington playing games with their health care and threatening Social Security while doing nothing to ease the cost of groceries, housing and prescription drugs.”
“For too long, politicians have ignored the real causes of the cost-of-living crisis – listening to wealthy donors instead of the working families who made southeast Michigan into the ‘Arsenal of Democracy,’” Adams said in a statement. “It’s time that our district had a fighter in Congress again – someone working to lower costs, protect our health care, stand up for our right to organize, safeguard our veterans and their benefits, and make life just a little bit easier for Michiganders struggling to get by.”

James (R-Shelby Township) is currently a declared candidate for governor and said he will not be seeking reelection to his seat representing Michigan’s 10th Congressional District. That could change, however, if James decides to drop out of the Michigan Republican Party gubernatorial hunt and stay in the U.S. House of Representatives, which some have ribbed him about, including President Donald Trump.
Either way, a field of candidates on the Democratic side is stacking up with Adams’ addition.
“In the Army and the Navy, we didn’t fight over politics – we worked together to protect and defend the country we love,” Adams said in his campaign announcement. “I’ve dedicated my life to public service and worked to make our country safer and stronger. I took an oath to protect and defend our country and communities. Now, I’m running because Michiganders deserve a new generation of patriotic leadership that’s committed to delivering results for our families and fixing our broken political system.”
Aside from Adams, the list of Democrats also seeking the seat includes Pontiac Mayor and former state Rep. Tim Greimel, attorney Eric Chung, U.S. Army veteran Alex Hawkins, and former Macomb County special victims prosecutor Christina Hines.
No Republicans have declared their intention to seek James’ seat.

Gerrymandering: it refuses to go away.

One of the more remarkable facts about some of the policies that state and federal lawmakers adopt for public benefit programs these days is that they’re based not on facts or data, or the money and lives saved, but on gut feelings about the worthiness of the people who would be helped. Nowhere is this better evidenced than in the ongoing effort in Congress to mandate work requirements for low-income people enrolled in the Medicaid health insurance program.
The massive budget and tax bill passed by the U.S. House in late May would mandate just such a requirement – and this was in spite of mounds of research showing that work requirements are costly, ineffective, and in many instances, downright cruel. One expert who conducted that research is Sara Rosenbaum – she’s the Harold and Jane Hirsh Professor Emerita of Health Law and Policy at the George Washington University – and recently Newsline caught up with her to learn more.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-16 15:40:17+00:00,CT Mirror,Push to make more Connecticut police records secret falls short,Jim Haddadin | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/16/ct-police-records-secret-bill/,A bill would have prevented public disclosure of any complaint filed against a police or correction officer until it is fully investigated.,"For the second time, a proposal to make more police records secret under Connecticut’s public records law fell short in the legislature.
A bill aimed at strengthening police accountability contained a provision that alarmed some government transparency advocates because it would have prevented public disclosure of any complaint filed against a police or correction officer until it is fully investigated.
The bill passed unanimously in the Senate, but failed to advance in the House before the end of the legislative session on June 4.
It was among a handful of proposals to curb public access to government records that surfaced this year, but didn’t gain traction as lawmakers scrambled to pass a two-year budget and finish other business before a June 4 deadline.
The police accountability bill was crafted in the wake of a false traffic stop data probe of the Connecticut State Police. It makes intentionally entering false information into a law enforcement record a felony.
An audit by the Connecticut Racial Profiling Project raised concern about false or inaccurate racial profiling information provided by 130 current and former state troopers and constables.
An independent investigation later found the majority of the troopers are unlikely to have engaged in intentional misconduct, concluding that most of the inaccurate information was due to mistakes and technical errors.
However, the report also critiqued state police, finding the agency failed to respond effectively when it first learned in 2018 of a handful of troopers who intentionally falsified traffic stop data, or to investigate broader problems in its system.
As a result, Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic lawmakers pushed in 2024 to strengthen data reporting requirements for law enforcement. House Republicans amended their proposed bill to additionally create a new exemption to the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act. It would have barred the release of any formal complaint against a police or correction officer until it is “investigated and adjudicated by the proper legal authority.”
Representatives of the ACLU of Connecticut, the state Freedom of Information Commission and the CT Council on Freedom of Information opposed creating the new FOIA exemption, arguing it would have allowed agencies to indefinitely withhold records of misconduct.
However, the measure gained support from the Judiciary Committee, and from AFSCME Council 4, which represents corrections employees and most municipal police officers in Connecticut.
Brian Anderson, legislative and political associate director for the union, said in May the state has a strong system for investigating misconduct allegations.
“We have layer upon layer of examination of police officers to make sure they’re doing their job properly,” Anderson said.

Community groups and elected officials have been protesting the proposal for more than a year.
UI has been trying to finish a decade-long utilities upgrade project that stretches through some of southern Connecticut’s coastal communities. The utility company had initially proposed construction on the South side of the Metro-North train tracks. The council told them to use the North side instead.
Community members obtained a court order to halt the project. A Superior Court judge found that the Siting Council had approved a project that hadn’t been properly vetted.
UI had to re-file the project. It was rejected via straw vote on Thursday afternoon, with four votes against, two for and one abstaining. More than 400 people were watching the vote on Zoom.
Khristine Hall is a member of the council.
“I believe that, based on my reading of the record, the impacts on wetlands, the impacts on cultural resources, and the impacts on nearby residents are significant, and that there could be alternative approaches that would lessen those impacts,” Hall said.
Community members want UI to bury the power lines. The company said it would cost an additional $800 million, which ratepayers would bear.
“In both transmission and distribution projects, there are certainly times when we recommend an underground solution, but given the cost increases our customers bear for underground projects, we must offer substantial proof to regulators that an overhead solution is either not viable or would be more costly,” UI President Frank Reynolds said.
“In the case of Fairfield to Congress, we know there has been strong community advocacy for an underground design plan, but because we can achieve our reliability and resiliency objectives with a more affordable overhead route, we have always stood by our preferred alternative for the benefit of the customers we serve,” Reynolds continued.
Energy prices are a hot topic in Connecticut, which has some of the country’s highest power bills.
“With Connecticut’s high electricity rates continually in the news, it is frankly surprising to see so many elected officials and their constituents continue to push for a project design that would add half a billion dollars to Connecticut’s electric rates,” said Jim Cole, VP of Projects at Avangrid.
A formal vote on whether or not to deny the construction will come at a future Siting Council meeting.

New Castle County Executive Marcus Henry signed his first budget into law Thursday morning following unanimous approval by County Council the night before. The $454 million operating budget for Fiscal Year 2026 passed 13–0. 
“Thank you all for joining us today as I officially signed the FY 26 budget for New Castle County,” Henry said during a public signing ceremony.“When I proposed this budget back in April, we set out to accomplish a few clear goals: prioritize core county services, invest in our county facilities and workforce, ensure affordability for residents, and I am proud to say we delivered on that vision.”
The FY26 operating budget, totaling $371.25 million, is a 5.62% increase over the previous year. The capital budget, covering infrastructure and sewer projects, adds another $84.37 million.
Henry thanked members of County Council, particularly finance co-chairs John Cartier and George Smiley, along with Council President Monique Williams, for their support and collaboration.
 “Their thoughtful deliberation, collaborative spirit and commitment to our shared priorities made this budget possible,” he said.
The approved tax rate for unincorporated New Castle County properties will be $0.1575 per $100 of assessed value for residential and $0.2380 for non-residential properties. Rates for properties within municipalities will vary depending on the services received.

Henry acknowledged the challenges of finalizing a budget while managing reassessment and transitioning into office. 
“It’s tough for any administration transitioning into office to pull together a budget package,” he said. “But doing that while completing the first reassessment project in over 40 years presented unique challenges and I’m grateful to our partners on County Council for their help in tackling them.”
The budget aims to make visible improvements to parks, libraries, and community spaces, while also safeguarding essential operations.

John Hoffman and his wife were also shot and hospitalized in a separate incident. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said during a press conference that the shooting ""appears to be a politically motivated assassination."" (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Law enforcement officers on Sunday night arrested Vance Boelter, who is accused of assassinating Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park as part of a larger plot to kill Democratic elected officials and other advocates of abortion rights.
Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
The arrest comes after a 43-hour manhunt — the largest in state history, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.
At the time of his arrest, Boelter was armed, but ultimately surrendered. Officers did not use any force, said Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger of the Minnesota State Patrol.
In the state’s new Emergency Operations Center in Blaine — which was paid for by legislation passed by Hortman’s DFL-controlled House in 2020 — Gov. Tim Walz thanked law enforcement and decried political violence and hateful rhetoric.
“This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country, and each and every one of us can do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than argue, debate an issue, shake hands, find common ground.”
Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats of violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. He survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. An unsealed criminal complaint indicates that the Hoffmans’ daughter called the police to report the shooting of her parents, the Associated Press reports.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the attacker in a fake law enforcement uniform shoot Mark Hortman through the open front door, according to the complaint. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a cop car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds.
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle. From there, teams from dozens of law enforcement agencies fanned out in search of Boelter.
Boelter was spotted in the area, and officers converged around him, Evans said. He declined to provide some details of the tactics used by law enforcement to capture Boelter.

Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.
“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation…those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.
Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Strib.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Times reported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On Sunday night as leaders spoke to the press, Boelter was being questioned by law enforcement, but officials declined to say where he was detained and which agency was questioning him.
On the steps of the State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, did not answer questions from members of a Senate ethics committee on May 7, 2024. Her attorney, Bruce Ringstrom Jr., said Mitchell was pleading the Fifth Amendment. Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.The felony burglary trial of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, has been delayed after the assassination of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and the attempted assassination of Mitchell’s colleague, Sen. John Hoffman.
The long-awaited trial was scheduled to begin Monday in Detroit Lakes with jury selection, but Mitchell’s defense asked the court for a delay because of Saturday’s shootings. Hortman and her husband were shot and killed; Hoffman and his wife were shot and are recovering from multiple gunshot wounds.
In a court filing, Mitchell’s defense asked for the trial to be delayed “out of reverence for Saturday’s unspeakable tragedy” and “to allow the partisan political temperature in Minnesota time to cool down.” The prosecution did not object to the delay “given the unprecedented circumstances,” according to the filing.
Judge Michael Fritz in a virtual hearing Monday said Saturday’s shooting could affect Mitchell’s right to a fair trial, and the court has security concerns given the shooting.
The judge did not set a new trial date Monday.
Mitchell was arrested on April 22, 2024, in Detroit Lakes after police allegedly found her in her stepmother’s basement around 4:45 a.m. She told police that she was attempting to retrieve some of her late father’s possessions, including his ashes, according to the amended criminal complaint.
Mitchell’s arrest set off a firestorm in the Minnesota Capitol, particularly in the Senate where Democrats hold a one-seat majority in the 34-33 chamber. Mitchell’s own vote has been the tie-breaker for multiple Democratic-Farmer-Labor-backed bills, especially last year. Senate Republicans multiple times since her arrest have tried to oust her and prevent her from casting her crucial vote.
The first-term senator has resisted calls to resign from her own party, including then-DFL Party Chair Ken Martin and Gov. Tim Walz. Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy expelled Mitchell from caucus meetings and stripped her of her committee assignments.
Last year, Mitchell didn’t speak on the Senate floor after her arrest and has largely kept a low profile until this year. The Woodbury senator has been speaking up on the floor about various bills, and lately she’s been posting her way through the charges, sharing photos of herself with constituents and students on her government social media accounts.
In a Facebook statement shortly after her arrest, Mitchell denied stealing anything and said she drove to her stepmother’s Detroit Lakes home because she was concerned about the cognitive state of her stepmother, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.
“Unfortunately, I startled this close relative, exacerbating paranoia, and I was accused of stealing, which I absolutely deny,” Mitchell said in a Facebook statement.
Bruce Ringstrom Jr, Mitchell’s defense attorney, in a statement to the Reformer last week said the senator is confident that jurors will find reasonable doubt in the case against Mitchell. 
“Senator Mitchell is confident that taking this case to trial is the correct decision. She understands that juries sometimes make decisions inconsistent with the evidence but is prepared to take that risk. Senator Mitchell believes that if the jury holds the state to its burden of proof that she will be found not guilty,” Ringstrom said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/P1195958-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-16 11:10:32.945601

Twisted Irons Craft Brewing Company will be honored with the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition’s (DBCC) 2025 Shining Light Award for its outstanding support and advocacy in the fight against breast cancer.
The award will be presented at a special celebration on Wednesday, August 6, 2025, at The Waterfall in Claymont.
The Shining Light Awards, presented annually by DBCC, recognize individuals and organizations in the Greater Delaware region who demonstrate exceptional commitment to advancing breast cancer awareness, support, and innovation.
“The Shining Light Awards are about honoring those who go above and beyond to uplift the breast cancer community,” said Francesca Vogel, DBCC’s CEO. “Twisted Irons exemplifies the spirit of generosity and compassion that drives our mission forward.”
Twisted Irons, founded in 2020 by Matt Found and Dave Markle, has been a steadfast partner to DBCC despite launching during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Middletown-based brewery quickly distinguished itself through a unique blend of philanthropy and community engagement, particularly around breast cancer causes.

One of the brewery’s signature initiatives is the creation of Pinipple NEIPA, a craft beer brewed in honor of breast cancer patients and survivors.
For every pint sold, $1 is donated to DBCC to support programs and services for individuals affected by the disease.
Twisted Irons exemplifies the spirit of generosity and compassion that drives the DBCC mission forward, going above and beyond to uplift the breast cancer community not just through fundraising, but through heartfelt involvement and community leadership, the coalition stated.
In addition to financial contributions, the brewery actively participates in DBCC’s signature events, including sponsoring the annual Lights of Life Gala.
Lori Found, Matt’s wife, has served for years on the gala’s décor committee, volunteering time and resources to help bring the event to life.
The brewery has also hosted meetings and volunteer events for DBCC, providing space and hands-on support to help advance the coalition’s mission.
Staff members frequently volunteer at both DBCC-sponsored and community-based fundraisers, and the brewery has become a launching point for several grassroots events—including the Kickoff to Summer 5K and the Drive Out Cancer golf tournament—organized by patrons inspired by Twisted Irons’ advocacy.
DBCC estimates that 1,210 Delawareans will receive a breast cancer diagnosis in 2025.
With that in mind, Vogel said the coalition’s work—and the role of committed partners like Twisted Irons—remains essential.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-16-at-10.37.30-AM.png,,,2025-06-16 11:10:32.945601

Since 2020, 36 states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery department. In rural counties, the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, less prenatal care and higher rates of babies being born too early. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
Labor and delivery closures drive South Dakota to a maternal care ‘precipice’

“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.
Births are expensive
The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.










You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services.


– Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform


“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
Ripple effects
Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
State action
Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
Rural patients face tough choices when their hospitals stop delivering babies

As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature video)TOPEKA — A small percentage of funds stolen from Kansas’ unemployment system during the pandemic have been recovered, the state labor secretary says, but time is running out to find the rest.
The Kansas Department of Labor processed hundreds of millions of dollars in fraudulent unemployment payments during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of which came from state funds.
Amber Shultz, the state labor secretary, called it an “extremely stressful and unfortunate part of our agency’s history.”
She told legislators at a Jun. 10 hearing that the state has recovered about 2.4% of fraudulent funds, or $11 million. 
The state labor department processed about $460 million in fraudulent payments during the pandemic, said Derek Helms, a department spokesman. An initial 2021 audit put the number at $700 million in processed fraudulent claims, which was deemed incorrect when the department refined the numbers, Helms said.
Of the $460 million lost, $292 million were from state funding, and the remaining $168 million were federal funds, he said.
The onus of recovering lost funds has fallen on banks and law enforcement. The labor department works with them but there are limits to its investigating power.
“The department can only prepare and recommend cases for prosecution,” Helms said. “Once we do that, we’re out of the mix.”
Sen. Rick Billinger, a Goodland Republican, wondered at a meeting of the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency why Kansas lost the money it did when other states had similar computer systems and didn’t lose nearly as much.
He pointed to Colorado, which had a similar computer system to Kansas and reportedly paid out around $73 million in fraudulent claims. He called it a “drop in the bucket” compared to Kansas’ total.
“That’s why this bothers me,” Billinger said.
The U.S. Department of Labor estimates it processed between $100 billion and $135 billion in fraudulent claims across the country. About 1.2% of that has been recovered
As the five-year statute of limitations on fraud prosecution looms, the possibility of fraudsters being held accountable wanes, but Shultz was realistic about federal lawmakers making a change. The U.S. House passed the Pandemic Unemployment Fraud Enforcement Act in March, which could extend the statute of limitations, with all four of Kansas’ House members voting in favor of the bill. It has stalled in the U.S. Senate, however.
Shultz said sophisticated international crime rings filed the majority of fraudulent claims, making investigations and prosecutions even more difficult.
Before the pandemic, she said Kansas saw little unemployment fraud. The unparalleled surge in unemployment claims during the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed the state’s 1970s-era system, leading to millions in lost payments.
“The scammers thought, ‘This is pretty good money,’ ” Shultz said. “And so what we started seeing is people either stealing identities, or they would hijack claims.”
Now, that fraud is once again “incredibly rare,” Helms said.
The department launched a long-awaited new system in November, which has seen early success. It has reduced claims processing times and the number of calls to the agency’s contact center, and it has increased people successfully filing claims online without staff assistance, according to agency data.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250910_shultz-1024x529.png,,,2025-06-16 10:03:40.955648

Ann Kelley, R-Lamar speaks at a House Children and Family committee hearing on foster kids' benefits Jan. 22, 2025 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Missouri high school graduates may soon be able to attend career-certificate programs for free after state lawmakers passed a bill creating a reimbursement process for career and technical education.
The legislation now awaits Gov. Mike Kehoe’s signature or veto.
“This will increase (the workforce) astronomically,” said state Rep. Ann Kelley, a Republican from Lamar. “And it’s great for the kids who are in those career tech programs. It gives them another avenue to make themselves better.”
Kelley, who filed the bill in the House, told The Independent that she got the idea for the legislation after talking to a student. He was eligible for the state’s A+ Program, which pays for two years of public community college, and he wanted to use the funds to train for his commercial driver’s license.
But his goal of operating a dump truck business was derailed when he realized that the state’s program wouldn’t cover the type of education he needed.
So Kelley proposed a new program — one with eligibility requirements mirroring the A+ Program but to fund career-certificate programs.
To qualify, students will need to graduate high school with at least a 2.5 GPA, at least 95% attendance rate, 50 hours of unpaid tutoring and achieve proficiency in the Algebra I end-of-course exam. The Missouri Senate added another path to eligibility, opening the door to students with high school career-tech certificates.
“Currently a student who wants to obtain a certificate or license right out of high school… must pay for these out of pocket because the courses are too short to qualify for the A+ reimbursement program and are not Pell eligible,” Kelley said in a committee hearing in February. “These students are typically ones who are not interested in going to a two-year or four-year school.”

Some students use the state’s Fast Track Workforce Incentive Grant to pay for training and licensing, but the program requires participants to be at least 25 years old. Some students take jobs outside their career path to pass the time and avoid shelling out thousands for their certificate, Kelley said, but this legislation seeks to “fill the gap.”
To pay for the grants, the bill sets up a fund managed by the State Treasurer’s Office. Funding would have to be appropriated annually by the state’s general assembly, though the fund would also be open for donations.
The state estimates a cost of up to $3.3 mil in 2028, according to a fiscal note.
Kelley is “positive” that Kehoe will sign the bill given his vocal support for career-tech initiatives.
In his inaugural State of the State speech in January, Kehoe placed an emphasis on career and technical education and called for a work group to bolster CTE programs.
The legislation has also generated support from advocacy groups. In committee, lobbyists from the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Missouri National Education Association spoke in favor of the idea.
“Skilled technical talent is a major asset to Missouri employers across all industries,” the chamber of commerce’s lobbyist Cade Tremain said in a hearing in February.
The legislation received wide support, drawing just two “no” votes in the House and one in the Senate. It ultimately passed as part of a large higher education package with bipartisan support.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/012225-0903-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-16 10:03:40.955648

Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
The arrest comes after a 43-hour manhunt — the largest in state history, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.
At the time of his arrest, Boelter was armed, but ultimately surrendered. Officers did not use any force, said Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger of the Minnesota State Patrol.
In the state’s new Emergency Operations Center in Blaine — which was paid for by legislation passed by Hortman’s DFL-controlled House in 2020 — Gov. Tim Walz thanked law enforcement and decried political violence and hateful rhetoric.
“This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country, and each and every one of us can do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than argue, debate an issue, shake hands, find common ground.”
Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.

The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats of violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. He survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. An unsealed criminal complaint indicates that the Hoffmans’ daughter called the police to report the shooting of her parents, the Associated Press reports.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the attacker in a fake law enforcement uniform shoot Mark Hortman through the open front door, according to the complaint. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a cop car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds.
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle. From there, teams from dozens of law enforcement agencies fanned out in search of Boelter.
Boelter was spotted in the area, and officers converged around him, Evans said. He declined to provide some details of the tactics used by law enforcement to capture Boelter.
Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.
“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation…those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.
Minnesota House Democratic leader dead after targeted shooting; Democratic senator also shot

Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Strib.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Times reported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On Sunday night as leaders spoke to the press, Boelter was being questioned by law enforcement, but officials declined to say where he was detained and which agency was questioning him.
On the steps of the State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

Robert Kennedy Sr. will join the “Daddy’s Daughters” panel on June 26 in Jackson. It’s the first event of a weeklong series aimed at honoring the slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
Kerry Kennedy, president of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation, will join Ambassador Attallah Shabazz, Bettie Dahmer and Reena Evers-Everette “in a rare and deeply personal dialogue about growing up as daughters of men whose lives were taken in the fight for justice,” organizers said. “Together, they will honor the legacies of Malcolm X, Vernon Dahmer, Medgar Evers, and Senator Robert F. Kennedy—fathers whose leadership and sacrifice shaped history and whose personal love shaped their daughters’ resolve.”

Kennedy called it “a distinct honor” to join these women “whose strength and grace have been forged through profound loss and enduring love, on this panel. Our fathers dedicated their lives to the cause of justice, but they also gave us something even more powerful: the courage to carry forward their hopes and dreams.”
The session, which will anchor the opening night of the “Medgar Evers at 100 Centennial Weekend,” will take place from 6 to 9 p.m. at the Jackson Convention Complex, located at 105 E. Pascagoula St. in Jackson.
The three-day event is honoring the 100th birthday of the legendary civil rights leader, who was assassinated in Jackson in 1963. Shabazz’s father, Malcolm X, was assassinated in Harlem in 1965. A year later, Dahmer’s father, Vernon Sr., died defending his family from a Ku Klux Klan firebombing near Hattiesburg. In 1968, Kennedy was assassinated moments after winning the Democratic Presidential primary in California.
Evers-Everette, executive director of the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Institute, called the conversation “a tribute to Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Vernon Dahmer, and Medgar Evers— not just as giants in the fight for justice, but as devoted fathers who poured love into our lives. We come together not only to remember, but to continue their unfinished work.”

John Hoffman and his wife were also shot and hospitalized in a separate incident. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said during a press conference that the shooting ""appears to be a politically motivated assassination."" (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Law enforcement officers on Sunday night arrested Vance Boelter, who is accused of assassinating Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park as part of a larger plot to kill Democratic elected officials and other advocates of abortion rights.
Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
The arrest comes after a 43-hour manhunt — the largest in state history, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.
At the time of his arrest, Boelter was armed, but ultimately surrendered. Officers did not use any force, said Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger of the Minnesota State Patrol.
In the state’s new Emergency Operations Center in Blaine — which was paid for by legislation passed by Hortman’s DFL-controlled House in 2020 — Gov. Tim Walz thanked law enforcement and decried political violence and hateful rhetoric.
“This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country, and each and every one of us can do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than argue, debate an issue, shake hands, find common ground.”

Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threatsof violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. He survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. An unsealed criminal complaint indicates that the Hoffmans’ daughter called the police to report the shooting of her parents, the Associated Press reports.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the attacker in a fake law enforcement uniform shoot Mark Hortman through the open front door, according to the complaint. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a cop car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds.
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle. From there, teams from dozens of law enforcement agencies fanned out in search of Boelter.
Boelter was spotted in the area, and officers converged around him, Evans said. He declined to provide some details of the tactics used by law enforcement to capture Boelter.
Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.
“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation…those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.

Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Strib.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Timesreported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On Sunday night as leaders spoke to the press, Boelter was being questioned by law enforcement, but officials declined to say where he was detained and which agency was questioning him.
On the steps of the State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

Cabot, Vermont
Details of services
A Celebration of Life will be held on Saturday, July, 12, 2025 at 11:00 a.m. at Neighbors In Action, 3339 Main St. Cabot, VT 05647.
If desired, donations in Paul’s name can be made to the Central Vermont Home Health and Hospice, 600 Granger Rd, Barre, VT 05641.

Paul P. Lesperance, 87, of Cabot, Vermont, went to be with his Lord on June 8, 2025. He passed at home with his loving family and dog Nami by his side. Paul is the beloved husband of Betty Lesperance.
Paul was born on October 9, 1937, in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. He grew up in Blackstone, Massachusetts. The youngest of 11 children, he was the son of the late Ovila and Mary (Reilly) Lesperance.
He was the loving father of Jimmy W. Lesperance and partner Tiffany, Cheryl A. Michon,  Dianna L. LeBlanc and husband Todd, Lizz Lesperance, Cheryl A. Sylvain and husband, Mike.
He was preceded in death by his son Timothy P. Lesperance and his daughter Nancy M. Lesperance.
Paul was the proud grandfather of Katelyn M. LeBlanc, Andrew M. LeBlanc and wife Gina, Shannon Sweeney and Paula Sweeney and the great grandfather of Amelia LeBlanc.
Paul was the brother of the late Anna Lavallee,  Mary Robinson, Melvina Goulet, Louise  Shields,  Joseph, Bobby, Christopher, Leo, Peter, and Louis Lesperance. Paul has many nieces and nephews and he loved them all.
Paul ran heavy equipment for Walnut Farms Construction. He then ran his own excavating business before becoming a crane operator for General Dynamics at the Quincy shipyard.
Paul moved to Cabot, Vermont in 1981. He and his family successfully created Brookside Statuary and Gift Shop where they produced and sold concrete lawn ornaments. Paul and Betty were founding members of the Ornamental Concrete Producers Association. He also drove school bus for the Cabot School District for sports and field trips.
Family was of the utmost importance to Paul. He enjoyed family gatherings which included lots of music and singing. There were many sing alongs to classic country music which was his favorite. He loved dancing with Betty around the house whether there was music playing or not. Paul also enjoyed fishing, cross country skiing, and watching westerns on tv.
Paul, Betty and Lizz loved Arizona. They spent many winters in Benson, where they became a part of the community and grew to love the desert as much as the Green Mountains. He especially loved his home in Cabot, where he spent over 40 years enjoying the many moods of Molly’s Pond and the wildlife around it.
Paul was very much a people person and had a great sense of humor, always making people laugh and bringing joy to those around him. He was dearly loved and let those around him know without a doubt they were loved as well.
The family would like to thank Ruth and Glen Goodrich and the Cabot Ambulance Service for their friendship and support during this time.
Thank you to the entire staff at Plainfield Health Center for your excellent care over the years, and to the entire staff at Central Vermont Medical Center.
A special thank you to his hospice team, Alex, Amanda, Bonnie, Donna, Elliot and Jamie, as well as friend and hospice volunteer Matt Nally. They showed such love and care to Paul and his family.

Robyn Niayuq Burke, D-Utqiagvik, speaks during a House floor session. (Courtesy of Robyn Burke's office) Eleven newly elected legislators joined the 60 members of the Alaska State Legislature this year in Juneau: 10 of 40 in the House and one of 20 in the Senate. New members came from across the state, from the Arctic to Southeast Alaska, and a variety of backgrounds and experiences in education, business, journalism, engineering, nonprofit leadership and local public office. 
Both the House and Senate had majority caucuses held by multipartisan coalitions of Republicans and Democrats, as well as independents in the House. Education funding took top priority, with the Legislature passing a historic override of Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s second veto to raise per-student school aid. The Alaska Permanent Fund dividend was set at an inflation-adjusted historic low, at $1,000 per eligible Alaskan, amid declining state revenues. And the Legislature negotiated to produce a balanced, yet pared-down budget with modest if any increases in public services,  in 120 days.  
Six of the 11 members took time, some as they were packing up their offices in the Capitol in late May, to sit down for interviews to reflect on the session. 
Rep. Robyn Niayuq Burke, Utqiagvik Democrat, House District 40
Robyn Niayuq Burke represents communities across the North Slope and Northwest Arctic regions. “It went pretty well,” she said of her first session. “This job is very relational. And a person might vote a certain way, but I really appreciate all of the friendships and relationships that I’ve been able to make while being here.”

Burke said she was inspired to run for the House after watching last year’s Legislature fail to override the governor’s veto of an education funding increase. 
“That was my call to action,” she said, citing her experience as a former school board president. “I went down very much looking forward to being a part of a bipartisan coalition, working across lines.” 
She said she was glad to be part of the veto override this year. 
“Seven hundred dollars was a compromise,” she said of the per-student education funding increase. “I know that’s not enough for many districts who are facing challenges: I know that. There’s an over $10 million deficit in the Northwest Arctic Borough School District, and throughout rural Alaska there’s a challenge with schools closing.” 
Even before Dunleavy reduced the school funding by $50.6 million through a separate, line-item budget veto, Burke said education will be an ongoing issue for the Legislature. “I think we have more catching up to do. So I would like to see further increases, but I know that we’ve got some challenging years ahead of us,” she said. 
Representing Alaska’s northernmost district, and the furthest from Juneau, sometimes making the multiflight journey in one weekend, was not without its challenges for Burke, as a mother of two. “It was difficult personally, like personally uprooting my life, being down there for five months was difficult for me and my family,” she said. “But doing the work, getting into it … it was really great. I really enjoy the work.”
Burke co-chaired the House Resources Committee. She was also a member of four other committees, including tribal affairs and labor and commerce, and said her focus was also on elections and public safety issues. She sponsored a bill that passed to expand funding for Mt. Edgecumbe High School, the state-run boarding school: “On the very last day, I had a bill pass the House and the Senate, and so I feel really grateful for that,” she said. The bill is awaiting transmittal to the governor, for him to decide whether to sign or veto it, or let it become law without his signature.

“For policy, we teed up a lot of the things that are really important to us, and I know that we will get straight to work on them, to get them across the finish line in, starting in January,” Burke said. “There also might be this perception that just because two legislators might fall on different sides of the aisle politically, then they can’t get along, but I get along with, I would say, almost all of my colleagues on the floor, and I’m really grateful for that.”
Rep. Ted Eischeid, Anchorage Democrat, House District 22
Ted Eischeid represents North Anchorage, including North Muldoon. “I was a teacher for 25 years, and the thing that surprised me was that every week was like the first week of school. It didn’t slow down,” he said. “One of the takeaways I have is how hard the work is. You know, I don’t think I realized how hard it was. It’s grinding and it’s hard being down here away from your family … It was hard work; it was good work. And I’m really happy I was here, for my district.”

Eischeid served on nine House committees, including education, transportation, judiciary, several subcommittees and as chair of the military and veterans affairs committee.
“I was one of the key races that flipped,” he said, referring to his election helping to secure the multipartisan majority in the House. “And I think we showed up for Alaskans in a big way, especially for things like education, which was my district’s No. 1 priority, from all my door knocks.”
Eischeid grew emotional reflecting on the session, and especially the testimony from school groups on the need for education funding. 
“It’s hard for a lot of educators, for a lot of districts, for students,” he said. “So that’s the part that you know, if I had less empathy, it might be easier for me. So we can just leave it at that.”
He said he supported the greater funding increase for schools in House Bill 69, of a $1,000 per student increase to the funding formula, that Dunleavy vetoed. “It was right on the money. It would make up for inflationary increases,” since the last major increase, he said. 
However, he was satisfied with the lower funding amount that did pass: “Politics is the art of the possible, you know, so I’m happy with education. It’s incremental, though, and that work is not done.”
“Unfortunately, education has been politicized,” he added. “But if you strip away the politics of it, our schools are important, our kids are important, and there’s a path forward. But it takes people setting politics aside. We need good schools, and we need to fund good schools.” 
He said he’s looking forward to continuing work on education and transportation issues, a state retirement benefit system, and a long-term sustainable fiscal plan, including a stable Permanent Fund dividend. “When you cut the PFD, it affects the poorest Alaskans the most. It’s not fair.” he said. 
Policy: A/B                  Politics: B/C                               Personal Grade: Incomplete
“​​One of the really important things I’m happy about is we didn’t fight culture wars,” Eischeid said, and that after door knocking during his campaign, his constituents made it clear that was not a priority. “Democracy is a messy business. It’s slow, it’s iterative, it’s not perfect. But, you know, we ask these 60 individuals, 40 in the House, 20 in the Senate, to give up a part of their life to serve their districts down here. And there’s some neat things that happen.”
Asked to grade his experience in the session, “For myself, I’d say incomplete,” he said. “Let people judge in two years.”
Rep. Carolyn Hall, Anchorage Democrat, House District 16
Carolyn Hall represents West Anchorage, including the Turnagain, Spenard and portions of the Sand Lake neighborhoods. “It’s been a fantastic experience. I feel really good about public service and serving Alaskans and serving my district,” she said. Looking ahead, she said she would, “hopefully, just be as constructive as possible and productive as possible. Yeah, I’m not like a flame thrower, I’m not an ideologue.”

She said education funding was the top priority of her office and her constituents, as the Anchorage School District faces a major budget shortfall and cuts. 
“They want their kids’ schools to be funded. They want them to be adequately funded. They want their kids to have a solid, strong quality education, with small class sizes and extracurriculars and just overall, just having a healthy education,” she said. “And what my constituents tell me is that they’re willing to sacrifice their dividends in order to have funding available in order to achieve that kind of education system.”
In May, the school district just voted to close Lake Hood Elementary School in Hall’s district. She said her constituents would support new state revenues and restructuring of the Permanent Fund dividend formula to provide more funding to schools. 
“So they tell me that they want taxes, if that’s what it means. They tell me that they want either a really small dividend or to get rid of the dividend if it means that their kids are going to have the education that they want them to have, and if they’re going to be able to get their roads plowed or to have, you know, just adequately funded public services,” Hall said.
Hall served on nine committees, including public safety and resources, and co-chaired the labor and commerce committee. She said in the interim between sessions, she’s particularly interested in continuing work on the state retirement system, updating the unemployment insurance program, and expanding paid parental leave. 
She said during the legislative session, she was a “team player” as part of the majority caucus and voted with the group’s priorities. “I grew up playing sports. I played Division II softball in college — like, I understand how teams are supposed to function, and we performed, I think, very well, very, very well as a team, when it came to our 21-person majority coalition.”
Policy: A/B                      Politics: A/B                      Personal Grade: Declined to say
“This isn’t politics. This is public service,” she said. “That sounds probably naive of me to say, but I believe it. Politics will always make its way into the conversation, of course, but that’s not where I’m coming from. I’m coming from a lens of service.”
Hall declined to give herself a grade for the session. “I am my own worst critic, so I don’t know that I want to give myself a grade,” she said. “All I’ll say is that I consider myself to be a lifelong learner. I love learning, and I plan on spending a lot of time in the interim just working on improving myself and improving my knowledge base so that I can come back here and do a better job.”
Rep. Ky Holland, Anchorage independent, House District 9 
Ky Holland represents South Anchorage, from the Hillside neighborhood southeast to Girdwood and Whittier. “As a first-term legislator, my focus was on trying to learn how the processes worked and how the job of a representative, you know, could contribute to the purpose of the Legislature,” he said. 
He said his focus was school funding, developing the state’s defined benefit retirement system, and “a reasonable budget that we could afford.” He said the bipartisan majority caucus has made progress on many of those issues. “I think we’ve worked together pretty well. And obviously there’s still some loose ends with many of those things … but I think we made a lot of progress.”

On education funding, Holland described it as a “compromise” and criticized the state for not increasing funding to schools at the rate of inflation like some other departments. “Increases in the Department of Corrections or Administration, or any other departments that got regular increases without anyone being concerned, that was just expected,” he said. “But education somehow was supposed to be able to continue on a starvation diet?”
Holland said he supports new state revenue measures, and expanding the state budget and possibilities for investment. 
“It simply puts us into a situation where it’s just a game of winners and losers, because we’re playing a zero-sum game, and if one pot (of funding) gets a little bit more money, then it has to be taken out of another place. And, you know, looking at childhood education and early childhood support, versus the school system, versus corrections, we were just in a terrible position. And of course, that also led to a trade-off of not having any significant money for capital projects,” he said, like energy projects and transportation improvements.
Holland said Dunleavy’s focus on education policy changes over funding was “simply a way to dodge dealing with the money issue,” and felt unnecessary. 
“To think that somehow we’re magically going to come up with the Herculean effort that it takes to create a strong, viable, sustainable charter school like Aquarian or Rilkle Schule that the governor has pointed to, is a complete fantasy, and I think it was largely a distraction,” he said. “Because as long as we can go back and argue about policy, we were really slowing down the discussion about what funding we are going to put into the schools.”
Holland served on 10 committees, including state affairs and the joint armed services committee, and co-chaired the energy committee. He said he sees his role as a legislator as his full-time job for the next two years.

“We had to work with essentially no money, you know, a really constrained budget. And we came up with a balanced budget that’s got a little bit of reserve in it,” Holland said. “There were some responsible decisions to work with what we had to make it work.”
Holland said he learned a lot in his first session, and feels committed to the role. “There’s a lot of things I got done. I got nine bills introduced, and made some really good progress I’m proud of there. Got some things, though, that I didn’t get done.” 
Rep. Bill Elam, Kenai Republican, House District 8
Elam represents the north and eastern parts of the Kenai Peninsula, from Seward and parts of Soldotna to Nikiski. He was a member of the Republican-led minority caucus, and served on six committees, including resources, fisheries and education. He said that process was similar to his experience on the Kenai Borough Assembly. But negotiations across chambers and partisan lines were new. 
“So much of the work is done outside of committee, in meetings with your other legislators,” he said. “When you get to the point where you’re working with the other body or trying to get support from all of the 60 members, or at least enough of them — so that’s where it starts turning into more of a bigger spider web.”

Elam said he feels his district understands the fiscally conservative approach and the Legislature’s bare-bones budget this year. “My district really likes it when we live within our means. We have a balanced budget. If we have to do cuts, they understand,” he said. “But, it’s prioritizing those things that are that are important, right? So, if we cut to the point where we don’t have any troopers, then we’re going to have some problems. If we cut to the point where roads aren’t getting plowed, we’re going to have some problems.”
The Kenai Peninsula Borough School is facing a budget deficit, and even before the line-item veto, 116 teacher and staff positions were set to be cut. Elam pointed to declining enrollment as a continuing issue.
 “The real problem that we’re having is enrollment,” he said. “Probably we’re going to have to close some schools or consolidate some areas. So doing that in a way that is strategic. Nobody wants their school closed. I don’t want my school closed. But we also have to have a conversation of, like, if the building’s empty, does it make sense to have just a few kids in a big building?”
He voted yes on the historic May 20 vote to override Dunleavy’s veto of the funding, and said that was his toughest vote of the session. “As a Republican with a Republican governor, that was not an easy decision,” he said. “It was the right decision, because we cannot keep putting money, hundreds of millions of dollars, into areas where there’s no accountability.”
Elam said he wants to continue working on education policy to improve outcomes, as well as financial strategies for schools and their facilities, and some cost-cutting to the Department of Corrections.

“The decorum and the people getting along was good. We had a good process and procedure,” he said. “When it comes to the policy that came out, we really didn’t do much. We did a lot of resolutions. … I bet we’re probably down in that B area, and I’m just an optimist and not wanting to give us an F.”
Elam gave his own session a “B.” “I didn’t have real high expectations of getting a ton of things accomplished. You know, you’re in the minority, first session, my job here is to really learn a lot and try to build a team. And I felt like I did a pretty good job at that. There’s always room for improvement,” he said. 
Rep. Jeremy Bynum, Ketchikan Republican, House District 1
Jeremy Bynum represents the southernmost region of Alaska across island communities from Metlakatla and Prince of Wales to Ketchikan and Wrangell. “When you’re running for the seat, you have a lot of ideas about how the policy process works, how people are working in the building, but it’s not that way. So that was a bit of a learning experience,” he said, and described jam-packed days, particularly as a new member of the powerful House Finance Committee.

“It’s very busy from day one,” he said. “I was on six subcommittees, and so that was a lot of work, to just be doing all that. And then early session, you have all the fly-ins with people coming here to advocate for different issues. And your calendar can be packed. I get up every day at about 5:30 a.m., to try to catch up on some email, trying to figure out what my day is going to look like … but then it’s off running busy all day.”
Bynum said there were many challenges working on the House’s proposed budget, and he worked to represent his district’s interests, particularly the Alaska Marine Highway System, as well as housing and fisheries issues. 
“The challenging part wasn’t for me, it wasn’t about ‘cut, cut, cut.’ It was about, let’s prioritize where we’re going to put our money. And I guess it’s kind of, maybe it’s the same thing, but my perspective is just a little different,” he said. “So you find yourself with…somebody that you aren’t politically aligned with, but you have common goals. So that was a good reward for me.”
Bynum said as a member of the Republican minority, the negotiations around education funding were tough, and balancing the needs of schools, the state’s finances and policy priorities sought by the governor. He supported an end to one-time funding and increases through the base student allocation. “This uncertainty is one of the bigger problems. The level of funding is a problem, but the uncertainty is even worse,” he said. 
He said passing House Bill 57 felt like a bipartisan effort. “I felt like it was a massive win, it was a massive win for Alaska. It wasn’t, ‘Oh, the Democrats won,’ or ‘Oh, the Republicans won.’ That was a win for everybody. And you know, I recognize it wouldn’t have happened without the Republicans supporting it, working with the majority,” he said. “It wouldn’t have happened.”
Policy: D                            Politics: B+                                       Personal Grade: B
“Some of the process of how we got through our budget process was very painful. Not the people, but just the situation. I give that a D, the defined benefits bill, I give it a D-minus. We didn’t pass a whole lot of other things,” he said, with the exception of the education funding bill.
“Some of our new freshmen legislators are fantastic, top-notch, smart people,” he added. “And some of the people that have been here for a long time are too. I mean, not taking that away from them, but that was unexpected for me, we had so many just really sharp people.”
Rep. Jubilee Underwood, R-Wasilla, House District 27, said she was not available for an interview but sent an op-ed which reflects on her first session, published in the Anchorage Daily News. She criticized in-fighting among Republicans, who had a minority caucus in the House, and called for embracing debate and differences among the conservatives. “The infighting within the conservative ranks is more than just a distraction; it’s a self-inflicted wound that cripples our ability to advance our principles,” she wrote. “While the left maintains a disciplined front, coalescing around shared goals despite internal disagreements, conservatives splinter into factions; each claiming to be the ‘true’ champion of the movement. From primary purges to social media slandering, we’ve become experts at devouring our own.”
Reps. Nellie Jimmie, D-Toksook Bay; Rebecca Schwanke, R-Glennallen; and Elexie Moore, R-Wasilla; and Sen. Rob Yundt, R-Wasilla, did not respond to several requests for interviews.

A list of “sanctuary” jurisdictions accused of failing to cooperate with immigration arrests, including the state of Colorado, was taken down after protests about its accuracy. (Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A list of 14 states, 298 counties and 200 cities deemed immigration sanctuaries by the Trump administration has disappeared from a government website but continues to hang over the heads of officials who face threats of losing federal funding.
“We were placed on a list with many other sheriffs across the nation for no clear reason and no clear cause,” said Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County, North Carolina, a heavily Democratic county that nevertheless complies with a new state law requiring cooperation with immigration arrests.
“The list is gone. Am I satisfied that it was rectified? Yes. Am I satisfied that it’s over? No,” Blackwood said.
The list went up May 29. It called out the “cities, counties, and states that are deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.” The White House had already threatened “suspension or termination” of federal funds to them.
Along with counties and cities, the list named the whole states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia as “state sanctuary” areas.










We were placed on a list with many other sheriffs across the nation for no clear reason and no clear cause.


– Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County, N.C.


There was immediate reaction from some areas, not only Democratic states and counties with court-tested legal policies of declining cooperation with deportation, but also conservative areas mystified by their inclusion.
“We figure it must be some kind of mix-up. We certainly support our fellow law enforcement agencies,” said James Davel, administrative coordinator for Shawano County, Wisconsin, which was included despite no apparent immigration sanctuary policy. The county voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 by more than 67%.
One possible explanation: The county board passed a resolution in 2021 declaring Shawano a “Second Amendment Sanctuary County” as a sign of “vigorous support of the peoples’ Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.”
The list disappeared from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website in a matter of days, after the National Sheriffs’ Association complained that many counties were erroneously included.
“It was quite the debacle,” said sheriffs’ association spokesperson Patrick Royal. “We are working with the administration to resolve as much as we can.”
But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a television appearance that the list would come back and was largely accurate.
“That list is absolutely continuing to be used and it is going to be identifying those cities and those jurisdictions that aren’t honoring law and justice,” Noem said in a Fox News interview June 1.
Courts have so far upheld local laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration arrests. California won a lawsuit on the issue in 2017 under the first Trump administration, and the same federal judge issued an injunction saying federal funds couldn’t be withheld on the basis of immigration cooperation during a new trial on the issue.
The national sheriffs’ association president, Sheriff Kieran Donahue of Canyon County, Idaho, said in a May 31 statement that the list “was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation.” He said it was “an unfortunate and unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement.” Canyon County was not on the list, though the city of Boise was.
The pushback from sheriffs was a sign of how seriously flawed the list was, said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
“The real problem is, how are they defining sanctuary?” Putzel-Kavanaugh said. “To have pushback from an association that is typically quite supportive of this administration and their agenda points to problems with definition.”
Watauga County, North Carolina, was on the list when it first appeared May 29 but came off before it was taken down. The county’s congressional representative, Republican Virginia Foxx, said in a Facebook post that she intervened.
In the post, Foxx called it “a mistake … made during the Biden administration that resulted in Watauga County being listed incorrectly as a sanctuary county.” She also said that “Watauga County is no longer listed” after she “contacted DHS.”
Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group favoring less immigration, said her list of sanctuary jurisdictions included Watauga based on a June 2024 report from U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement listing it as among hundreds of others as “non-cooperative institutions.”
Vaughan said data she requested from ICE shows some counties in North Carolina were still not complying with all detainers this year through early February, but Watauga is not one of them.
“They should probably come off the list,” she said. “None of those sheriffs has contacted me about reviewing their policies or taking them off the map. I would be happy to do so, and have done so frequently with sheriffs in other states.”
Sheriff Len Hagaman of Watauga County told Stateline via email that he had contacted federal immigration officials and confirmed that his county, which voted Democratic for president last year by a 52% to 46% margin, had a solid record of cooperating with immigration arrests.
Hagaman alluded to an April Facebook post by U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, calling out Watauga and eight other North Carolina counties as immigration sanctuaries.
“For several weeks now, I, along with other North Carolina sheriffs have had to endure gross and inaccurate misinformation regarding false allegations,” Hagaman wrote.

A week after President Donald Trump sent the military to Los Angeles, tens of thousands of Californians took to the streets Saturday to protest his policies on his birthday.
Known as No Kings Day, the rallies took place in the northern part of the state including Shasta County, as well as Sacramento, the Bay Area, the Central Valley, the Inland Empire and across Southern California, including San Diego and Orange counties. 
In San Francisco, protestors of all ages — some with young kids or dogs in tow — chanted “ICE out of our streets” and “sanctuary for us all,” as they marched nearly two miles from Dolores Park to City Hall. They waved California, Pride, Mexico and U.S. flags and carried anti-Trump signs, many of which denounced the administration’s immigration raids and the deployment of federal troops in L.A.
Many of the state’s Democratic officials appealed for calm: Both Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass urged demonstrators to “rise above” and “refuse” chaos, respectively, while California Attorney General Rob Bonta asked people to protest “peacefully, safely, and lawfully.”
But in L.A., protestors and law enforcement clashed, according to CalMatters’ Sergio Olmos and Mikhail Zinshteyn. After issuing a dispersal order, local police in the early evening began to fire less-lethal munitions, flash bangs and tear gas canisters at crowds in downtown. U.S. Marines armed with live munitions also faced demonstrators while protecting federal buildings, and federal troops were reported tackling at least one protester to the ground.
The majority of the protests in California and nationwide were peaceful, however. The vibe in San Francisco was energetic and cheerful among the presence of police officers, though some demonstrators grew somber when asked why they attended the rally.

Mike Kaiser, San Francisco resident: “Every day there’s new outrages with Trump, with ICE. … I feel that we’re very close to the end of democracy in the United States and that deserves a very big response.”

As National Guard soldiers remain in L.A. following a ruling by a federal appeals court, life for residents and communities located near the city’s government center continue to be disrupted, writes CalMatters’ Joe Garcia. 
Since last week, locals have been under an 8 p.m. curfew, and some businesses report recurring vandalism and plummeting sales. While the sounds of helicopters flying at all hours induce anxiety for some residents, others say the presence of federal troops make the situation “worse for us.” Read more here.

Let’s dive into some immigration news:

Divulging Medi-Cal info: On Friday Newsom blasted the federal administration after reports emerged that the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services gave personal information, including immigration status, to deportation officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The data transfer includes information about California Medi-Cal patients. The program allows immigrants without legal status to enroll in state-supported health insurance. The move to share private enrollee information reverses a longstanding federal policy. Read more from CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.


Hospitals on high alert: Fears about possible immigration sweeps at California hospitals and health clinics have patients who are immigrants canceling their medical appointments. Staff working at an L.A.-area clinic system said armed officers last week tried to enter a parking lot where doctors and nurses were treating patients in a mobile health clinic. Though the agents eventually left after being refused entrance, the encounter rattled patients and staff. Read more from CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.


Leading L.A. border patrol: In January U.S. Border Patrol agents in California conducted a controversial immigration raid in Kern County, where a lawsuit alleges that Border Patrol unlawfully targeted “people of color who appeared to be farm workers.” In the months following the sweep, the career of the man who led the operation, Sergeant Gregory Bovino, appears to have taken off within the Trump administration. He is now in charge of border protection operations in L.A., and appeared alongside the Secretary of Homeland Security during a press conference last week. Read more from CalMatters’ reporters.




A state budget banking on hope

On Friday the Legislature passed a state budget agreement to close a $12 billion shortfall, reports CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff. The $325 billion spending plan rejects many of the social services cuts Newsom included in his updated budget proposal. Negotiations will continue, however, as both the Legislature and the governor must approve the budget by the start of California’s fiscal year on July 1. 
Other budget takeaways:

Homelessness funding: Both Newsom and the Legislature propose gutting California’s main source of homelessness funding, which has grown to $1 billion last year. Without that money, local government leaders and homelessness service providers argue that some shelters and housing programs would likely close, and the limited progress they have made toward tackling homelessness will be reduced. Read more from CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall.


Cuts to Medi-Cal: For unauthorized immigrants enrolled in Medi-Cal, the Legislature’s budget plan is a mixed bag. It rejects Newsom’s proposal to cancel home care for immigrants, and lowers from $100 to $30 the monthly premium the governor proposed for immigrants. But the plan also wants to expand Newsom’s proposal to block adults without permanent legal status from enrolling in Medi-Cal to the broader category of non-citizens with “unsatisfactory immigration status,” which includes some legal permanent residents. Read more from CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.


Legal aid services: The budget plan also prohibits $40 million in state funds to go towards the legal defense of immigrants convicted of any felony. The proposal follows repeated criticism from Republican legislators who argue that the state needs to do more to address voters’ concerns about crime. But legal experts and advocates say that the rule change would harm low-income families, and that felony crimes aren’t always violent, such as shoplifting or writing a bad check.

Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, a Utah resident, was shot at the demonstration. Despite life-saving efforts from SWAT medics and Salt Lake City Fire, Ah Loo died at an area hospital.
As of Sunday morning there were still unreleased details about the incident as the investigation is ongoing, Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said in a news conference.
A chaotic scene ensued after two armed men in high visibility vests, who Redd described as “possibly part of the event’s peacekeeping team” saw 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa separating from the crowd, moving behind a wall, pulling out a rifle and starting to manipulate it.
“Gamboa was then confronted by these two men, witnesses say. Gamboa raised the weapon in a firing position and began running toward the crowd,” Redd said on Sunday. “One of the individuals fired three rounds, striking Gamboa, and tragically striking the man who later died.”
 Victim was not intended target of shooting at Utah protest, police say

The preliminary police investigation found that the victim was not the intended target, “but rather an innocent bystander participating in the demonstration,” Redd said. Gamboa also sustained a minor gunshot wound in the confrontation.

As the scene unfolded, a bystander took a backpack from Gamboa that contained an AR-15 style rifle and a gas mask, Redd said.
Gamboa’s motivations for being at the protest are still unclear, and there is no indication that others were working with him, Redd said.
Detectives booked Gamboa into the Salt Lake County Metro Jail for investigation of murder, police said in a release.
Gamboa has no criminal history, police said. Jail documents state he is being held without bail.
Police had not taken any action against the two peacekeeping members as of Sunday, Redd said. The man who fired the shots is cooperating with police.

The scene was chaotic and unfolded very quickly, Redd said, but many people assisted the officers.
“The crowd actually pointed him out to law enforcement, and their actions were heroic,” Redd said.
In a Facebook post Sunday morning, Utah 50501 — the group that organized Saturday’s protest — said it is working with police.
“Our team was directly involved. We have been in direct contact with law enforcement,” the Facebook post read. “Some of you seem to think a keyboard and social media give you a free pass to be nasty and accusatory. Our teams just had to deal with something extremely traumatizing and when faced with personal risk to their own lives, chose to run towards the danger in order to serve this community.”
The group said it’s working to set up a vigil for the victim.
“We respectfully ask to refrain from speculation about the alleged shooter’s motives and identity — that information will come out soon enough. It is better to wait for the facts, even though it is difficult given the emotional and charged nature of this incident,” the group said in a separate Facebook post Sunday morning. “This was a horrific moment of violence in a historic day full of thousands of Utahns exercising their right to protest. Nothing will ever change the undeniable strength of our community.”

 ‘A heartbreaking situation’

Before the news of Ah Loo’s death went public, Salt Lake City Democrats Rep. Jen Dailey-Provost and Sen. Jen Plumb, who represent downtown communities in the Legislature, issued a statement expressing “distress, dismay and sorrow” about the Saturday shooting in Salt Lake City and the assassination of the Minnesota House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman.
The Democrats said that these are “stark examples of the current crisis of our nation’s integrity.”
“As many have stated, violence has no place here,” the lawmakers wrote in a joint statement. “We would argue more strongly, however, that every elected official must actively partake in changing the horrific rhetoric and divisiveness that drives public discourse in our society today; rhetoric that is supported and perpetuated by many in our state and nation’s top leadership positions.”
Simple remarks, the lawmakers said, will not suffice as a response.
Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, extended condolences to Ah Loo’s family in a social media post, describing the incident as “a heartbreaking situation.”
“My thoughts are with everyone affected,” Adams wrote. “I also want to express my gratitude to all the security officers whose quick response helped prevent a mass casualty. In difficult moments like this, we must come together with shared compassion and a commitment to unity.”

This is how Dan Masson Bergstrom Noel described himself to his palliative care doctors on February 20, 2025. To Dan, being a Vermonter meant working for the things you have. Born October 29, 1974, to Nicole and Francis Noel, Dan grew up eating from the garden they planted and heating the house with wood they cut, split, and stacked. From his father, Dan learned skills to repair his own house. From his mother, he learned to cook, can vegetables, and hem his own pants.
The cul de sac in Shelburne, Vermont, where Dan and his sister Amy grew up was populated with boys his age. In summer they played kick the can and ghost in the graveyard. In winter they’d sled down the cemetery hill and try not to get caught by the groundskeeper. These boys became like brothers—lifelong friends—and every year since college they went on fishing trips around the world.
Dan attended Keene State College in New Hampshire because it had a good teaching program. His desire to be a teacher stemmed from dissatisfaction with his own teachers—he thought he could do their job better. He student-taught third grade, but his first teaching job was with at-risk highschoolers—kids so delinquent they weren’t allowed on campus. On his way to school, he would wake the kids up and get them out of bed. The job was emotionally taxing, but it affirmed he could make a difference.
I am a Vermonter meant when Dan wasn’t in Vermont, he looked for a place like Vermont. Dan moved to Telluride in 1999 after finding it on a road trip. The quaint main street reminded him of his home state. This is where he met his wife, also a teacher, Nicki Bergstrom Noel. The two were married in 2002 at Alta Lakes in the depths of winter. Being a Vermonter, inclement weather was no cause for concern—their families were snowcatted in for an intimate ceremony outside.
In 2005, Dan and Nicki moved to Vermont and bought an 1875 house in Bristol with horsehair plaster walls, knob-and-tube electric, and a tacked-on kitchen. They gutted and refinished every part of that house. Dan did all the wiring. He redid the bathrooms and the tiling. He installed new maple flooring. There was no handyman job Dan couldn’t do.
Robinson Elementary, just down the road from Bristol, is where, at age 30, Dan became principal for a rural K-6 school with 200 kids. Though he was the school’s youngest employee, the loving and committed staff trusted him to improve the school … and he did. Being a Vermonter meant he had an intense sense of community responsibility. He believed you’re beholden to the people to the people around you. If they ask for help, you help them—in fact, you look for ways to help. For instance, rather than hiring a roofing company to replace the roof of the school, he had the community come do the work together. The moms and dads created a chain to pass things to the one guy on the roof who knew how to do it.

I am a Vermonter meant family is everything. There was nothing more important to Dan than his two daughters Cordelia Rose Noel (born 2008) and Hazel Hettie Noel (born 2010). Dan was pleased they were born in Vermont—after all, you have to be born in Vermont to be a Vermonter. Though Dan was a great teacher and a great handyman, he was an off-the-charts father. He knew just how to love his girls every single moment of every single day. Dancing with them. Singing with them. Helping them with their work. He had a clear sense of right and wrong and set boundaries for the girls that helped instill their sense of self.
The most un-Vermontery thing Dan did was move with his family to St. Kitts. Vermonters don’t tend to leave, but feeling overcommitted at the school, Dan thought moving abroad was the best chance to specialize in his family. In 2012, the foursome moved to the hottest little piece of dirt in the Caribbean. Nicki recalls, “Because there is nothing there, we had to make our own fun as a family for two years. Going to the beach and making forts. Teaching the girls to swim and snorkel. Biking on the golf course cart paths. Dan built furniture out of palettes. He made himself lobster traps. We didn’t have a boat, he would swim the lobster trap out. He built a swing set for the girls in our back yard which was a feat given that supplies are really hard to obtain there. Dan wanted us to be tight. And those two years assured that that was true.”
Choosing to live out West again in 2014 was another un-Vermonter thing to do, but Dan did it for Nicki. He became a Vermonter in Telluride. He was ever-frustrated and thwarted because he couldn’t grow anything. On the other hand, he thrived on flyfishing. Loving the water. Loving the woods. Being peaceful outside. Knowing how to be a steward of the land.
Dan had boundless energy for doing unusual things—especially when it came to teaching and making school fun. Telluride Public School families will remember how he taught math with Matchbox cars and Pokémon scavenger hunts on the mountain. Star Wars nights. Crazy parodies. The Math Olympics. Making pies on Pi Day. Dan would say, “I am giving you brownies,” but they were brown construction paper Es. Once, as a prank, he convinced most of the Intermediate School they had to retake the state’s standardized test, CMAS.
He will be remembered for creating The Miner School—a Telluride High School program that matches high school students with mentors in the community working with doctors, bakers, electricians, auto mechanics, outdoor guides, and more. He knew if kids could be motivated to learn outside the classroom, that would help with the times they had to sit at a desk.
Music was an important part of his life. He loved going to festivals and concerts. He taught himself to play guitar and loved singing with friends and his daughters. Playing and singing became especially important toward the end of his life when he was less able to leave the house.
It was very Vermonter-y the way Dan fought cancer with everything he had. He endured more than twenty rounds of chemo. His two surgeries drastically changed his life. “But being with us, that mattered to him more than anything,” says Nicki, “and he was going to do whatever it took. There was bravery inherent in every choice he made. He fought cancer for me, Delia, and Hazel. And gave up his fight bravely, too.” Dan died in his home on April 13, 2025, surrounded by his family, being sung to by his girls.

Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
The arrest comes after a 43-hour manhunt — the largest in state history, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.
At the time of his arrest, Boelter was armed, but ultimately surrendered. Officers did not use any force, said Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger of the Minnesota State Patrol.

 Boelter’s potential targets included abortion providers, other Democrats

In the state’s new Emergency Operations Center in Blaine — which was paid for by legislation passed by Hortman’s DFL-controlled House in 2020 — Gov. Tim Walz thanked law enforcement and decried political violence and hateful rhetoric.
“This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country, and each and every one of us can do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than argue, debate an issue, shake hands, find common ground.”

Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats of violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. He survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. An unsealed criminal complaint indicates that the Hoffmans’ daughter called the police to report the shooting of her parents, the Associated Press reports.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the attacker in a fake law enforcement uniform shoot Mark Hortman through the open front door, according to the complaint. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a police car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds.
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
 Police raid suspect’s Minneapolis home

On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle. From there, teams from dozens of law enforcement agencies fanned out in search of Boelter.
Boelter was spotted in the area, and officers converged around him, Evans said. He declined to provide some details of the tactics used by law enforcement to capture Boelter.
Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.
“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation … those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.
 Details on Boelter’s religious, political leanings emerge online

Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Strib.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Times reported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said the Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On Sunday night as leaders spoke to the press, Boelter was being questioned by law enforcement, but officials declined to say where he was detained and which agency was questioning him.
On the steps of the Minnesota State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

,California,2025-06-16 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Homelessness is top of mind for many Californians. Why does the proposed budget eliminate funding for it?,Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/06/california-homelessness-funding-budget/,California’s main source of homelessness funding would drop from $1 billion last year to $0 this year in the proposed state budget.,"In summary
California’s main source of homelessness funding would drop from $1 billion last year to $0 this year in the proposed state budget.


State leaders have been talking a lot lately about cleaning up California’s homeless encampments and moving people indoors. But the tentative budget they’ve drawn up for the upcoming year has many asking: With what money?
Both Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature have proposed gutting the state’s main source of homelessness funding in the 2025-26 budget, sending a wave of panic through the cities, counties and service providers that have been relying on that money for years. Now, those critics warn that thousands of Californians could end up back on the streets, undoing the tenuous progress the state has made in addressing the problem.
“It’s extremely frustrating,” said San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, whose city had been receiving about $30 million a year from that pot of homelessness funding — enough to pay for about 1,000 interim housing placements. “Residents of California tell us consistently that ending unsheltered homelessness is one of their very top priorities…So the idea that the state can’t make a substantial, consistent investment in residents’ top priority makes me question whether or not they’re really listening to the people of California.”
The Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention program has doled out funds for cities and counties to spend on everything from temporary shelter to services to permanent housing since its creation six years ago. It started with $650 million in the 2019-20 budget, and has since grown to $1 billion last year. 
Since 2023, the program has provided housing for more than 57,000 Californians, according to the Bring California Home Coalition, made up of affordable housing providers, advocates for homeless individuals and government staff. 
But with the state facing an expected deficit of $12 billion this year, those funds ended up on the chopping block. The 2025-26 budget proposed by the Legislature June 9 allocates $0. Lawmakers passed a placeholder Friday, but the budget still has to undergo additional negotiations between Newsom and lawmakers before it becomes final. Even so, the governor already has indicated he’s fine with stripping homelessness funding.
At the same time, California could soon also be reeling from federal cuts. President Donald Trump’s proposed budget would reduce funding to the Housing and Urban Development department by 44%, slashing the rental subsidies and federal homelessness funding that flows to California.
Newsom has, in a sense, been preparing cities and counties for a blow to state funds. He has for years resisted calls to make homelessness money permanent, instead preferring to dole it out year by year in a one-time grant — making it easier to cut in a tough budget year. 
Despite ramping up spending on the issue to unprecedented levels after taking office (last year the Legislative Analyst’s Office found the administration had spent $24 billion on housing and homelessness), the governor changed his tune in recent months. His message now is more along the lines of: I’ve done my part, now cities need to step up and take care of the crisis on their streets. 
Newsom recently suggested cities do that by passing ordinances banning encampments.
“I’m not interested anymore, period full stop, in funding failure,” Newsom said last month,  a refrain he’s been repeating often. 
But the cities and service providers that rely on those funds say it appears he’s no longer interested in funding success, either: While California’s homeless population remains the biggest in the nation — with more than 187,000 people sleeping on the street and in shelters — it increased just 3% last year, compared to a nationwide increase of about 18%.
Critics worry gutting funding will erode that modicum of progress.
“Simply put, this choice will lead to more people moving onto California’s streets and fewer avenues off the streets,” the Bring California Home Coalition said in a statement.
In San Jose, the state homelessness funding has been crucial in the city’s push to move people out of encampments and into temporary placements in tiny homes and converted motels. Like other cities, San Jose still is waiting to receive its homelessness allocation from the last budget. But once that money is spent, probably by next summer, San Jose will feel the hit, Mahan said. When that happens, the city probably won’t have to close existing programs, because it’s lucky enough to have other funding sources, he said. But it won’t be able to build new units, effectively stalling the city’s plan to get everyone off its streets.
Mahan and other California mayors have for months been urging state leaders to reconsider ever since Newsom’s initial January budget proposal zeroed out the homelessness funds.
Instead, the Legislature suggested adding $500 million back into the state homeless funding program — but not until in the 2026-27 fiscal year. That would be a 50% reduction from last year’s allocation. And there’s no guarantee that money will come through at all. In addition, lawmakers proposed reducing another, smaller homelessness program — which provides money to cities specifically for cleaning up encampments and moving occupants indoors — by $100 million.
It’s not all bad news, pointed out Ben Metcalf, managing director of UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation. The Legislature’s budget includes $500 million in low-income housing tax credits to fund the construction of new affordable housing, and $120 million for the Multifamily Housing Program, which provides loans for low-income housing. 
But the Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention program may have been politically easier to gut, Metcalf said. That program doesn’t benefit from deep-pocketed lobbyists defending it in Sacramento. 
And because of the complex, intractable nature of the homelessness crisis, the money hasn’t produced the kind of tangible, grand-slam results voters want to see on their streets. Instead, homelessness remains a persistent problem, and encampments still dot California’s cities.
But without that money, some shelters and housing programs are likely to close, Metcalf said. Others could simply become less effective. The state program provided funding for the types of counseling, case workers and other services that help people transition from shelters into permanent housing, he said. Without that extra help, people often languish in shelters.
“So what you end up with, probably, is more Band-Aids,” Metcalf said, “or patchworks of systems that are providing some modest amount of (improvement in) the quality of life but not really helping transition people permanently out of homelessness.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/080924_SF-Sweep_MO_CM_31.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-16 09:01:51.046691
,California,2025-06-16 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Financial aid fraud is on the rise in California. How federal officials plan to crack down,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/06/financial-aid-california/,"The U.S. Department of Education will begin more rigorous screening of financial aid applicants, citing instances of fraud at California’s community colleges.","In summary
The U.S. Department of Education will begin more rigorous screening of financial aid applicants, citing instances of fraud at California’s community colleges.


Faced with growing reports of fraud, the U.S. Department of Education will make it harder for certain students to access financial aid, including some who could see delays of weeks or even months before cash is disbursed.
This month the department announced it would begin a new “screening process” for all financial aid applicants starting this fall. While that process is developed, the department will require colleges to do additional vetting of applicants this summer, which will place more of a burden on California’s community colleges. 
Unlike four-year universities, such as the University of California system, the state’s community colleges are designed to accept everyone, and they use a simple application process. But as classes moved online during the COVID-19 pandemic, fraud rings increasingly exploited that process by posing as students to steal financial aid.  
Kevin Harral, financial aid director at Las Positas College in Livermore, said he’s already “bracing for what’s to come.” He said the education department could force his team to spend hours of additional work double-checking students’ identification this summer. While those students wait for verification, they may see long delays before they can access their financial aid.  
Some students may decide to forego financial aid altogether, Harral said. “There’s some people who may not have the documents, may not have the ID, but there’s also the students where this is another barrier, maybe a psychological barrier, particularly if they have undocumented parents.”
In April, CalMatters reported that financial aid fraud was growing and that fake students stole more than $10 million in federal aid and more than $3 million in state aid from California’s community colleges in the prior 12 months — more than twice as much as the year before that. 
In response to CalMatters’ reporting, college officials and federal and state lawmakers sprang into action this spring. 
Anyone with a high school diploma or equivalent — and some without that — can apply to community college and enroll in classes, at which point they are eligible to receive federal Pell grants if they meet the income requirements. These grants, sometimes up to nearly $7,400 a year, cover tuition first, but for low-income students at a community college, whose tuition is free, the money goes directly into their pockets, covering other expenses, such as rent or food. 
For scammers — who pretend to be low-income community college students — that’s a gold mine.  
Many college officials are optimistic that by the fall, the education department’s new screening process, likely fraud-detection software, could stem the onslaught of financial aid abuse in California, which has burdened administrators and shut real students out of classes they need to graduate. The education department has said it will focus on screening first-time applicants but has not provided more details, such as what software it will use.
The California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office, which oversees the state’s 116 community colleges, has said that fraud represents less than 1% of the billions in federal and state financial aid that go to its students each year. Asked by CalMatters about the education department’s new identity screening, Melissa Villarin, a spokesperson for the office, said she’s “waiting for more information.” 
‘I’ll believe it when I see it.’
The federal aid application process, known as the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, already has a number of ways to vet students. It requires applicants to submit their Social Security number, date of birth, and details about their income, which are verified by the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. Scammers get through that process by submitting personal information they have stolen from other people.
A small subset of applicants are also required to prove their identity, either because they are randomly selected or because their applications are suspicious. Those applicants have to submit a notarized document or show up to the college’s aid office with an ID in hand. 
“The fraudsters, they won’t show up,” said Harral, leaving the legitimate students with the burden to verify themselves.
Under the new policy many more students will need to prove their identity this summer by presenting identification to their college. Starting in the fall, the new screening process will ultimately minimize the amount of work that colleges have to do, according to the department’s announcement.
“Do we support this or do we have concerns? Yes and yes,” said Karen McCarthy, vice president of public policy for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. She said she supports the federal government “taking on a stronger role in fraud detection” but is worried that the new policy will mean more work for college aid officers this summer.
For Harral, and many other financial aid directors, any changes to the federal financial aid system are nerve-wracking. In 2023 the education department created a new version of the FAFSA, which it was supposed to release on its usual October date. But it delayed the release until the end of December, sending students scrambling to submit their applications before the deadline. A glitch also prevented thousands of California students whose parents don’t have Social Security numbers from initially applying. The FAFSA was delayed once again this year to avoid “the kind of system errors that can derail millions of students,” according to a statement by the department. 
Harral said he’s worried that the new screening process won’t be ready this fall, forcing his staff to continue verifying many students’ identities manually.
“The recent track record of our education department is them not delivering things on schedule,” said Harral. “I’ll believe it when I see it.”
Has fraud really gone ‘unaddressed’?
While California’s colleges control which students they accept, they rely on the U.S. Education Department to help determine who is eligible for financial aid. Even California’s state financial aid program, Cal Grant, vets applicants using FAFSA. However, the Trump administration has cut staffing at the education department, hindering its ability to administer aid and investigate abuses. 
In April, Republican Congress members wrote to U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, citing CalMatters’ reporting and asking for a federal investigation of the financial aid process for California’s community colleges. The Congress members accused the community college system of allowing fraud “to go unaddressed.”
The U.S. Education Department referred to the Republicans’ letter when justifying its new screening policy. 
California’s community colleges have acknowledged the financial aid problem and spent roughly $150 million since 2021 boosting their fraud prevention and cybersecurity. Last month, the board of governors for California’s community college system agreed that it will eventually require all applicants to verify their identities. 
The board also considered charging an application fee, which could disincentivize fraud rings from submitting hundreds of fake applications at a time. Students opposed that policy, saying the harm outweighs the benefit, and the board delayed a decision on the matter.  
Speaking about the new screening policy, Daisy Gonzales, the executive director of the California Student Aid Commission, which oversees the Cal Grant program, said she’s concerned that eliminating fraud might complicate the financial aid process for students. “Over-compensating for the actions of bad actors cannot be solved by penalizing low-income students who rely on financial aid to pursue higher education.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/083023_Laney-College_SN_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-16 09:01:51.046691

Portsmouth, New Hampshire
Died June 6, 2025
Montpelier, Vermont
Details of services
A memorial service will be held at Vermont College Alumnx Hall, 45 College Street, Montpelier, VT at 1 p.m. on Sunday, June 29, 2025.

Jean Olson, beloved wife, mother, and friend, passed away from advanced ovarian cancer on June 6, 2025, three years after diagnosis. She felt fortunate to pass at home with her loving family and close friends by her side.
Born in 1948 to Marguerite and John Remington, Jean grew up in Vermont at a time and place that offered her a childhood full of opportunities. The first few years were marked by tumult as Jean and her sister were sent to live with family in New Hampshire while their mother spent two years recovering from tuberculosis in a sanitarium. The family was reunited in 1954 and moved to Woodstock, Vermont, where her parents bought a 1791 farmhouse on Prosper Road. The local farmers cautioned them against buying a 100-acre property with no running water, electricity, central heating, or indoor plumbing. But Marguerite had a vision for her family and home and carried it out. Her talent to realize the potential in the overlooked was a gift she passed on to her daughter. Jean would later harness this gift in service to her community throughout her life.
The 50s and early 60s were a magical time to be a child on a farm in Woodstock. Jean and her two sisters spent their days playing outdoors, riding, swimming, skiing, and skating. One of Jean’s favorite memories included getting her library card at the Norman Williams Library by standing on a stool to sign the big book of members. Another favorite memory was of her mother lightly penciling the names of the piano keys on the old grand piano (a relic left on the farmhouse from the Civil War as it was too large to move) so Jean could read and play. She subsequently took up the guitar, which led to a lifetime of playing music with others, including 20 years in a flute trio and later singing with Bob Kinzel and Leigh Seddon, The Barn Band, into her last months.
Education was central to Jean’s life. Her parents encouraged her to go to college at a time when it was not expected for women. She attended Skidmore and then Johnson State College where she graduated with a BA in music. In mid-life Jean returned to education, earning her master’s degree in education from Norwich University at Vermont College and a doctorate in education from University of Vermont.
Jean met her beloved husband, George Olson, at Johnson State and they were married in July 1969. They lived in Montpelier for a year before George was drafted during the Vietnam War, which sent them to basic training in Baltimore and then to Vietnamese Language School in El Paso. Jean felt fortunate that George’s deployment orders were changed from Vietnam to Europe as the war was winding down. The couple left Texas for Dusseldorf, Germany where Jean worked with the British Army in the transport unit for displaced persons from WWII. Her two main tasks were making tea and delivering mail around the compound twice a day. The initial interview consisted of two questions: Can you type? Yes. Can you make tea? No, I don’t drink tea and don’t like tea. They hired her regardless and then enjoyed plenty of jokes about the sad quality of her tea.
Upon release from military service, Jean and George settled back in Vermont. They were blessed with two beautiful daughters—Emilia in 1979 and Sarah in 1981. One of the big family adventures was the year spent in the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus in 1990 when her daughters were just 9 and 11. George had a Fulbright to teach at a Turkish high school and Jean taught English to Turkish college students. The family faced enormous challenges in Cyprus, and yet, when they were encouraged to return to Vermont as the Gulf War began, they agreed they had worked hard to build a life in an unknown place and decided to stay. They finished the Fulbright year and also took the opportunity to travel to Egypt, Israel, and Italy.
Jean was a treasured member of the Montpelier community. Over the years she volunteered with the Barre Opera House, OUR House, the Kellogg Hubbard Library, the Montpelier Foundation, was elected to the Montpelier City Council and the Montpelier Senior Activity Center Advisory Council. She worked on the Enhanced 911 project and in retirement for the House Clerk’s Office at the State House. Her fundraising work allowed Woodbury College to relocate to a much larger location, currently the CCV location in Montpelier.
Her twenty years of teaching elementary and adult learners while volunteering on local boards prepared Jean for the culmination of her professional life when she became Executive Director of the Governor’s Institutes of Vermont in 1994. In her 16 years at the helm, Jean transformed the organization from one on the brink of bankruptcy to a thriving institution. She moved the GIV office into her home to control costs and expanded the number of institutes through savvy fundraising. Jean believed in the transformative power of opportunity and loved to see more and more students attend the institutes each summer, which she described as “magic” while others viewed it as a testament to her dedication. Today, GIV offers summer programs to high school students ranging from the arts and science to civic engagement and international issues.
Montpelier has lost a visionary force and Jean will be greatly missed not only by family but by her treasured community. Resilience, optimism and a self-proclaimed “sturdiness” were just some of Jean’s faithful traits throughout her life. These guideposts, along with her love for her family and dearest friends, and a lifelong appreciation for her life in Vermont, sustained her to the end.Jean and her family want to thank her caregivers, all of whom offered compassion alongside their professional expertise: Dr. Gamal and Georgia Eltabbakh, staff at CVMC especially Katie Hall, Dr. Rachel Gaidys, the Hematology and Radiation teams, and Bayada Hospice especially Nurse Kat Placek.
Jean was predeceased by her parents and her younger sister, Diane (Remington) Starr. She leaves behind her loving husband, George Olson, her cherished daughters and their spouses Emilia Olson (Jacob Rogen) and Sarah Olson (Josh Rudman), her younger sister Mary Gulbrandsen (David Gulbrandsen), along with her niece Justina Starr (Kay, Zac, Aziza and Musa Kasanga), nephew Isaac Starr (Megan Lizotte), and many other dear relatives and friends.
A memorial service will be held at Vermont College Alumnx Hall, 45 College Street, Montpelier, VT at 1 p.m. on Sunday, June 29, 2025.
Memorial contributions may be made to: The Jean Olson Fund at The Governor’s Institutes of Vermont at https://giv.org/.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Law enforcement officers on Sunday night arrested Vance Boelter, who is accused of assassinating Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park as part of a larger plot to kill Democratic elected officials and other advocates of abortion rights.
Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
The arrest comes after a 43-hour manhunt — the largest in state history, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.
At the time of his arrest, Boelter was armed, but ultimately surrendered. Officers did not use any force, said Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger of the Minnesota State Patrol.
In the state’s new Emergency Operations Center in Blaine — which was paid for by legislation passed by Hortman’s DFL-controlled House in 2020 — Gov. Tim Walz thanked law enforcement and decried political violence and hateful rhetoric.
“This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country, and each and every one of us can do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than argue, debate an issue, shake hands, find common ground.”

Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats of violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. He survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. An unsealed criminal complaint indicates that the Hoffmans’ daughter called the police to report the shooting of her parents, the Associated Press reports.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the attacker in a fake law enforcement uniform shoot Mark Hortman through the open front door, according to the complaint. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a cop car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds.
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle. From there, teams from dozens of law enforcement agencies fanned out in search of Boelter.
Boelter was spotted in the area, and officers converged around him, Evans said. He declined to provide some details of the tactics used by law enforcement to capture Boelter.
Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.
“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation…those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.

Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Strib.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Times reported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On Sunday night as leaders spoke to the press, Boelter was being questioned by law enforcement, but officials declined to say where he was detained and which agency was questioning him.
On the steps of the State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's pick for health secretary, appears at his nomination hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Jan. 29, 2025. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed every member of an independent panel key to vaccine policy and access in America and announced eight new names, many of whom have been skeptical of vaccines.
The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), which works under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was recently made up of people with extensive experience in public health, infectious diseases and immunizations. For more than half a century, the panel of experts has used evidence-based data to help evaluate the safety of vaccines that are administered to people — and their guidance is used by insurance companies to determine coverage.
Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, claimed the move was aimed at addressing conflicts of interest, though the panel had operated under a comprehensive conflict of interest policy. The unprecedented shakeup could change what vaccines are readily available in the future, including whether they are covered by insurance. Without insurance, some vaccines — including those for COVID-19, HPV and measles, mumps and rubella — could cost people hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket.
It’s not clear if Kennedy will appoint more members. Here’s what to know about his picks:
Dr. Joseph R. Hibbeln
Who is he? A nutritional scientist who has worked as a psychiatrist and professor. His experience on nutritional neurosciences includes a stint as acting chief within the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. In 2018, Hibbeln co-authored research that tested whether a person’s fish consumption during the first half of pregnancy is associated with autism.
Vaccine experience: Hibbeln has no professional background in vaccines.
Dr. Martin Kulldorff
Who is he? A biostatistician and epidemiologist who is a former professor of medicine at Harvard University.
Vaccine experience: Kulldorf has served on a vaccine safety subgroup within ACIP and was a member of an FDA drug safety and risk management advisory committee. He is known for researching the development of vaccine safety surveillance and the monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks.
Kulldorf has been highly skeptical of COVID-19 vaccines and related government policies and mandates. In 2024, he said he lost jobs at Harvard and Mass General Brigham because he criticized policies that mandated COVID-19 vaccination.
In late 2020, he co-authored the Great Barrington Declaration, which proposed reaching herd immunity for COVID-19 through “natural” infection instead of public health restrictions. He co-wrote the declaration with Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, who was critical of COVID-19 restrictions and is now director of the National Institutes of Health. Kulldorf has aligned publicly with Kennedy on changing the process for vaccine trials.
Retsef Levi
Who is he? A professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. According to his university biography, his research includes examining data models and tools used in health care management. Levi has described his work as using data and analytics to assess and manage risk in health systems.
Vaccine experience: Levi has no professional background in vaccines.
He has challenged the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and its impact on young people. In May, Levi expressed ongoing skepticism of the safety of administering COVID-19 vaccines to pregnant people, despite evidence of its benefits.
Dr. Robert W. Malone
Who is he? A medical doctor and infectious disease researcher who has gained national attention within right-wing media for his criticism of COVID-19 vaccines.
Vaccine experience: After the news of his addition to the panel, Malone shared a biography that asserts years of experience in developing and testing vaccines.
But Malone has spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. He has claimed credit for inventing mRNA vaccines that have been critical to the fast development of COVID-19 vaccines — an assertion that has been challenged — while also questioning their safety. Malone said in April that the second child who died of measles this year had actually died from other complications, a claim that went against public health officials’ statements.
Dr. Cody Meissner
Who is he? A professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth University, Meissner served on the committee between 2008 and 2012. Since 2018, he has served on another committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration on vaccines.
Vaccine experience: Meissner has in the past defended vaccines, writing in a 2022 article for the New England Journal of Medicine that “widespread understanding and acceptance of vaccines will be an integral aspect” of limiting the harm of future pandemics.
He also helped craft vaccine schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics, and in 2017 was named the Massachusetts recipient of the CDC Childhood Immunization Award.
Recently, Meissner endorsed a move by the CDC to stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant people. Those changes were criticized by many major medical groups, including the American College for Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.
In August 2021, he expressed opposition to requiring that children wear a mask to prevent the spread of COVID, arguing that kids suffered negative consequences and that the availability of vaccines for adults undermined the need for children to mask. He has also opposed vaccine mandates and signed onto the Great Barrington Declaration.
Dr. James Pagano
Who is he? An emergency room doctor from Los Angeles
Vaccine experience: Pagano does not appear to have any research or work experience related to vaccines readily available.
Vicky Pebsworth, OP, Ph.D., RN
Who is she? A California-based regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses and board member of the National Vaccine Information Center, an anti-vax organization that many doctors and public health researchers say is a leading source of vaccine misinformation.
Vaccine experience: Pebsworth has argued that vaccines cause chronic illnesses and disabilities in children, a false talking point frequently used by vaccine opponents. She has also done work questioning the safety of the HPV vaccine, which Kennedy also opposes. The uptake of the HPV vaccine has contributed to substantial decreases in cervical cancer.
Dr. Michael A. Ross
Who is he? A Virginia-based OB-GYN and medical technology executive, working currently as interim chief medical officer at a startup trying to use artificial intelligence to deliver medicines. His Linkedin also lists him as a board member for LarreaRx, a supplement company.
Vaccine experience: Ross does not appear to have any research or work experience related to vaccines readily available.

Alabama Power is attempting to purchase a natural gas plant in Autauga County, citing a potential power reserve deficit in coming years, but renewable energy advocates have objected to rate increases that would accompany it. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Renewable energy advocates want the Alabama Public Service Commission to prevent Alabama Power from purchasing an Autauga County natural gas plant and raising customer rates to pay for it.
The utility said in a filing in October that it wants to acquire the Lindsay Hill plant in Billingsley, expected to provide 900 megawatts of electricity, to address an expected shortfall of energy by 2029.
“The proposed acquisition of Lindsay Hill represents a unique and cost-effective opportunity for the company and its customers,” said Christopher J. Habig, manager of resource planning for Alabama Power in a transcript of his testimony that was included in the October filing. “The economics alone are quite favorable, and there are additional benefits expected to develop as the company explores opportunities for efficiencies and synergies with central Alabama.”

To finance the cost of the purchase, Alabama Power proposes to increase the monthly utility bill for its residential customers by $3.32, according to the filing. Alabama Power customers absorbed other rate increases after the utility purchased natural gas resources in 2020 and 2022. Those acquisitions increased utility bills by a combined $5 each month. If the proposed acquisition is approved, the increased would would increase utility rates by $8 per month or $96 annually.
“Our proposed acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Facility highlights our commitment to deliver dependable energy to our customers during peak usage times,” a spokesperson with Alabama Power said in a statement last week. “We respect the Public Service Commission’s certification process and believe the information provided demonstrates how and why the generation facility will benefit our customers.”
The utility said last year it expected the acquisition to raise monthly rates by $3.80. But in filings last month, both Alabama Power and opponents of the move said the cost would be $3.32 a month.
Renewable energy advocates such as Energy Alabama and the Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution (GASP) have intervened to prevent the transaction, claiming it is not in the best interest of Alabama residents.
“Basically, it just means that people are paying for a power plant that they do not need,” said Daniel Tait, executive director for Energy Alabama, an organization that advocates for renewable energy. “Your monthly bill goes up a little bit. And Alabama Power makes more money, and you are not really getting any benefit from that.”
The utility said in its filing last fall that it had about 108 megawatts of reserve electricity for the winter months and will reach its peak excess electricity capacity in 2026 at 650 megawatts.
However, it said its reserves for the winter will steadily decline, going to 390 megawatts in 2027 and diminishing even further to 150 megawatts in 2028 as its analysts expect increased demand across three of its customer segments: residential, commercial and industrial.
Several data centers are planned to be built in Alabama during the next several years, according to Fred Clark, president and CEO of the Alabama Municipal Electric Authority, in an interview in October. That will increase the demand for electricity in Alabama, reducing the company’s reserves.
Two new data centers are expected to come online in the next few years, which Alabama Power said increases the load on the system in its filing with the Alabama Public Service Commission.
Alabama Power estimates that by 2029 it will have a net deficit for winter electricity capacity of 1,179 megawatts, a number it expects to grow to nearly 2,500 megawatts in 2035.
Energy Alabama and GASP argued in a proposed order that Alabama Power overestimated the future demand from data centers and that in seeking new sources of energy, the utility excluded potential resources of energy that are more climate friendly.
According to the proposed order submitted by attorneys from the Southern Environmental Law Center, the organization representing both Energy Alabama and GASP, the company has regularly overestimated the demand forecasted with its industrial companies to account for projects that expand their sites as well as maintain and modernize them. The filing cited an analysis by James Wilson, an energy economist.
“The industrial sales forecast was well above actual sales in ten of the past twelve years (2012-2023), including each of the past five years (2019-2023),” the proposed order from Energy Alabama and GASP states.
The actual figures from Alabama Power that experts for Energy Alabama and GASP used for analysis were redacted from publicly available legal documents because Alabama Power said they are trade secrets that could not be disclosed.
“This over-forecasting may be due to how the company prepares its forecasts for the industrial sectors, which is through customer surveys that collect ‘specific information about its customers’ anticipated facility expansions, long-term maintenance and modernization plans, and other activities impactful to load,’” the proposed order from Energy Alabama and GASP. “This approach may capture customers’ possible expansions but is less likely to capture contractions or efficiency improvements.”
The SELC also expressed skepticism about the demand from data centers, arguing the increased demand for power does not happen immediately and is highly uncertain.
“Technology companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta are considering multiple locations for data centers but may only build a subset of the contemplated data centers,” the proposed order states. “In addition, they may only load the data centers with servers and chips on a delayed schedule due to the huge investment required to fill the data center with the servers and chips that bring it to full capacity and the likelihood that chips will be increasingly scarce and expensive as the demand for data centers increases.”
The renewable energy groups also argue Alabama Power “ explicitly excluded solar and storage resources” in a 2023 Capacity RFP, which allows groups to submit bids to Alabama Power and provide the company with power to meet the needs of its customers, arguing that the power source was “reliable, dispatchable and available year-round.”
Alabama Power challenged Wilson’s estimates in a response to Energy Alabama and GASP.
“The predicate for Mr. Wilson’s alternative industrial demand forecast (the 550 MW reduction through 2029) is the historical annual variance in energy sales from the Company’s industrial class,” the company’s proposed orders states. “While at any point in time there may be some correlation between a loss of energy sales and peak demand, Mr. Wilson made no effort to determine whether or to what extent that correlation exists.”
Alabama Power also said in the filing that the projection regarding electricity use for data centers was based on data taken from a data center that is currently operating.
The company also said it had to exclude solar power and energy storage from consideration in the procurement process because it did not have the operational experience to oversee that particular source, which is required by the Alabama Public Service Commission.
The company added that the Lindsay Hill power generating station “is the least-cost option among the potentially viable alternatives available to the Company, as reflected in proposals and self-build projects responsive to the 2023 Capacity RFP.”
Energy Alabama and GASP, however, want to intervene and stop the purchase of the natural gas power plant because of the increased cost burden it will have for Alabama Power customers.
“Alabama Power customers bear the risks associated with the Company’s proposal. Additionally, the proposal will add to the bill increases associated with recent gas additions by the Company,” the proposed order states.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Alabama-Power-logo-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-16 08:02:52.713286

“The way we treat the elderly in our community says something about the values that we espouse. The world we live in today was built by those who are now some of the most vulnerable in our society, we owe it to them to offer respect, care, and justice when they have been made victims of abuse, exploitation, or neglect,” Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said in a recent news release. 
This week, on Wednesday, Salt Lake County senior centers will host Elder Abuse Awareness events for Elder Abuse Awareness Month in June. The county’s Aging and Adult Services website offers information on where to find its senior centers. 
“Prosecution is only part of the solution,” Gill added. “We need families, neighbors, and care providers to help prevent abuse before it starts. Our seniors deserve to live with dignity and safety, not fear and isolation.”

Elder abuse affects 1 in 10 older adults, but often goes unreported, according to Gill’s office. The National Council on Aging points to one study, which estimated that only 1 in 24 cases of abuse are reported to authorities. 
Salt Lake County records also indicate cases of elder abuse or neglect have ticked up in recent years. In 2023, county prosecutors filed 23 charges alleging intentional abuse or neglect of a vulnerable adult in 2023. That’s compared to 37 in 2024, according to the Salt Lake District Attorney’s Office. 
From 2023 to 2025, Gill’s office has filed 25 charges for second-degree felony aggravated abuse of a vulnerable adult, plus 12 second-degree felony financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult charges. There were also 60 charges of class A misdemeanor intentional abuse or neglect of a vulnerable adult filed in the same time period. 
County officials also urged Utahns to recognize signs of possible abuse, neglect or exploitation. Red flags include:

Unexplained bruises or welts
Multiple bruises in various states of healing
Unexplained fractures and abrasions
If a person becomes withdrawn, passive or fearful
Reports or suspicions of sexual abuse
Dehydration
Missing glasses, dentures or other aides if usually worn
Malnourishment
Inappropriate or soiled clothing
Over or under medicated
Deserted, abandoned, left unattended or socially isolated 
Missing possessions
Forced to sell their house, change their will, or sign over control of finances
Overcharged for home repairs
Inadequate living environment
Unable to afford food, clothing, or social activities

“Ending elder abuse starts with awareness — and with connection. By reaching out, listening, and standing together, we can protect our older adults and ensure no one faces aging alone or in silence,” said Afton January, Salt Lake County Aging and Adult Services Communications manager.
Visiting a local senior center is also a “powerful way to stay connected and engaged,” county officials said. “These centers provide social support, nutrition, activities, and wellness resources that help protect against isolation and neglect. You can also be sure you are checking on them regularly, not just over an audio phone call, but through physical visits or video phone calls so you can see them and perhaps notice any signs of abuse or neglect.”
Gill’s office also reminded that Utah is a “mandatory reporter state.” That means if any person who has reason to believe a vulnerable adult is being abused, neglected or exploited, they must immediately notify Adult Protective Services or the nearest law enforcement office. 
For emergencies, call 911. You can also report suspected abuse directly to Utah’s vulnerable adult abuse hotline, which is 800-371-7897, or on the Utah Department of Health and Human Services’ website.

(Getty Images)Adverse childhood experiences in childhood and their lasting consequences cost Kentucky nearly $300 million a year, a new report says.
Kentucky Youth Advocates and Bloom Kentucky, a KYA initiative focused on reducing childhood adversity, on Monday released an analysis, called “The Economic Impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences in Kentucky” that shows health care costs and loss of workforce participation as a result of childhood trauma comes with a $295 million annual price tag. 
  Dr. Shannon Moody, Kentucky Youth Advocates’ Chief Officer of Strategic Initiatives.
The analysis is based on Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data from 2015–20. At that time, 62% of Kentucky adults said they’d had at least one adverse childhood experience or ACE  and 19% reported four or more. 
ACEs are traumas or stressors in a person’s life before their 18th birthday. They include, but are not limited to, parental divorce, abuse, parental incarceration, substance use issues in the home and more. The more ACEs a person has, the more likely they are to have poor health, lower education and economic hardships. 
When these stressors become chronic, it “has an impact on our physiology,” explained Shannon Moody, Kentucky Youth Advocates’ chief officer of strategic initiatives. 
The more ACEs a person has, the more likely they are to turn to unhealthy practices like smoking, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ACEs survivors also tend to report poorer mental health, may be unemployed and are more likely to have chronic health issues like diabetes and cancer, according to the CDC. 
“The ways that our body absorbs stress or deals with stress has an impact on our physiology as well as on our mental health,” Moody said. “When that stress goes unaddressed in our bodies, it starts to take a toll on how our bodies’ function.” 
The result is sicker people who may not be able to work and contribute to the economy. 
“If we don’t invest in making sure that kids can overcome the adversity that they are (facing) — or maybe prevent it if it is preventable — we’re going to end up absorbing the costs through our state budget,” Moody said. 
  People with at least one ACE are more likely to be unable to work or be out of work. (Screenshot)
What’s in the report? 
According to Monday’s analysis: 

The most common type of ACEs in Kentucky is divorce with 32% of adults reporting they lived through their parents splitting when they were children. A close second, 31% of adults reported there were substance abuse issues in their childhood home. 
ACEs cost Kentucky — both in medical spending and in lost income when people cannot work — nearly $300 million each year. Among these, smoking costs more than $107 million each year in lost wages. 
Depression costs the state the most in treatment expenses at $728,000 annually. 
Kentucky has higher expenses per person in treating ACEs than most of its neighboring states. 
People with at least one ACE are more likely to be unable to work or be out of work. 
Non-white Kentuckians are more likely to have experienced ACEs than their white counterparts. Multiracial Kentuckians have the highest rates of ACEs. 

  ACEs cost Kentucky — both in medical spending and in lost income when people cannot work — nearly $300 million each year. Among these, smoking costs more than $107 million each year in lost wages. (Screenshot)
“Given how common ACEs are in Kentucky, organizations, agencies and decisionmakers must take trauma into account when working to strengthen communities,” the report says.  “Understanding the widespread impact of trauma begins with learning both its effects and the potential pathways to healing.” 
That includes creating better access to quality child care, Moody said, and creating a state child tax credit. Combating poverty, which affects 20% of Kentucky’s children and for many means they don’t have reliable sources of nutritious food, is key as well. 
She also stressed the importance of positive childhood experiences (PCEs), which can balance children’s adverse experiences. PCEs can include feeling supported by friends, having adults who care, the ability to talk with family members about feelings and more.  
“Even if a child is experiencing adversity, even if they have an ACE score of 7, or they have had just a really tough environment in which they were raised, we can counterbalance those adversities with positive childhood experiences,” Moody said. 
  Kentucky has higher expenses per person in treating ACEs than most of its neighboring states. (Screenshot)
Why now? 
The report is coming out now, Moody said, because work on the 2026 state budget is beginning and because proposed federal funding cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP put people at risk of more instability and more adverse childhood experiences. 
The report is a call to action, she said, to invest in child wellbeing and prevent ACEs. 
“We need to get an understanding among all of our decision makers as far as what the implications of childhood adversity mean for our bottom line,” Moody said, “and for the investments that they’re making right now on behalf of kids.”

The results are so obvious even those who struggle to read can see them: Nearly 6 in 10 third graders scored below grade level on California’s reading tests during most of the last decade. That includes about three quarters of lower-income Black or Latino students. 
Meanwhile, a decades-long conflict raged among California educators and equity advocates about how to teach reading. Simply put, they battled over phonics, the 17th-century system of sounding out letters and words. The reading technique fell out of favor in most American schools in the 1980s, but now it’s experiencing a comeback.
Parents, advocates and educators have been urging the state to return to teaching phonics to all kids, as a foundation for reading. Some brought up racial equity issues that seemed to pit one under-served group of children against another.
Groups supporting Black students, such as the state’s NAACP chapter, urged a switch to phonics. But other groups supporting English learners and bilingual students wanted to keep the state’s current, flexible instruction system, which features other disciplines that also help kids pick up English. 
The result: inertia and stagnant test scores. California ranked 40th last year in fourth grade reading on national tests. For Black fourth-graders, California tied for last place with only 7% proficient, and for Latino students it tied for 24th place with 19% proficient.
This isn’t just an academic problem. Kids who don’t read by fourth grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school. We know what follows.
When the California Assembly passed a bill last week adopting the so-called “science of reading,” a literacy approach that emphasizes phonics, it was a sign of progress. More than 40 states have taken similar measures, but California was one of the last holdouts. Now it’s up to  Gov. Gavin Newsom.
It shouldn’t have taken so long.
Until now, most of California’s districts used one of a handful of reading instructional systems. Mostly they encouraged students to recognize words via memorization, or guess words based on the context of a sentence or the pictures illustrating the text.
That works for some young readers, but for many others the system hid their struggles. Youngsters could look like they were learning to read, even though they weren’t. In later grades, when there are no pictures or too many unfamiliar words to memorize, these readers would falter, and their reading troubles would hinder learning in other academic subjects. 
This is California’s reading crisis. But even with this new bill, the state is not moving far enough, fast enough.
The bill advances phonics and other skills like comprehension and reading fluency, but its adoption is only voluntary. The state would only be encouraging school districts and teachers to revamp their reading instruction, not mandating it.
That was the compromise needed to pass the measure, bill proponents said. Two similar attempts to make it mandatory failed in prior sessions, after opposition from teachers unions and some education groups. 
‘This is a civil rights issue that demands urgent action and collective action.’Marshall Tuck, CEO of EdVoice
That’s where the risk lies. Without a mandate that lays down deadlines, it’s hard to predict how widespread the science of reading will be and how quickly it could take hold. 
Louisiana and Mississippi, two states not usually known as academic frontrunners, experienced meteoric rises in reading test scores a few years after adopting similar literacy systems. Mississippi moved from 49th in the nation in fourth-grade reading in 2013 to ninth in 2024. Louisiana jumped from last place in 2019 to 16th last year. 
Both states made their science of reading training mandatory and required districts to adopt the related instructional materials. 
California is trying to entice districts with funding. Newsom has budgeted $200 million to pay for teacher training, as part of several literacy initiatives he touted during a recent press conference. The Assembly just passed a budget proposal that includes the funding.

“It’s not just rhetoric; there’s $200 million to reinforce that cause,” Newsom said.
Also part of those plans, all of California’s youngest elementary students will be screened for reading issues starting this fall, and Newsom vowed to spend $500 million to send literacy coaches and specialists to hundreds of schools around the state.
This certainly sounds good, but as always, the follow-through will determine whether it’s politicking or progress. 
Districts will need more support, because many may not be ready to make a switch. Schools will have to foot the bill for new books and teaching materials. Many districts don’t have that kind of money. Some are tackling their own budget deficits and making sacrifices, including laying off teachers.
This is going to take a great commitment. The least-resourced districts will need state help affording it. And the state should do some of the work early by vetting the growing list of reading programs being offered to districts, so millions more dollars aren’t wasted on curricula and materials that don’t move reading scores.
Some school districts have already started transitioning to a more phonics-friendly curriculum, including Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles Unified. 
Antoine Taylor, a literacy coordinator for Los Angeles Unified School District, offered a glance at how the science of reading could look in schools. Out of about 20 students in his classes, half are at different stages of learning to speak English. He estimates he’s spent about 30 minutes daily working in small groups, much of it on phonics, spelling and learning words. 
He said he has folded it into daily reading sessions, but he also continues practicing other skills, such as reading aloud, asking students questions about texts, and getting bilingual students to speak and demonstrate comprehension.
Other teachers, when they get exposed to phonics, will embrace it too, he predicts — as long as they get the training and the books and supplies they need.  
“Most of the teachers in the district are aware of the science of reading,” said Taylor, who has taught 28 years. “Most teachers want their students to do better.”
California’s schools have their work cut out for them, educating about 3 million students from low-income families and 1.1 million English learners. 
Phonics proponents are optimistic California’s teachers will be receptive, though it’ll still be years before we see any changes, at least in test scores.
As Marshall Tuck, CEO of EdVoice, recently put it: “We have one of the greatest gaps between high-income kids and low-income kids of any state in the country. This is a civil rights issue that demands urgent action and collective action.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/120924_RalphHawleyHeadStart_FM_CM_20.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-16 08:02:52.713286

CalMatters’ third Emmy award honored accountability journalism that, as one reporter described, “I could not have done” without Digital Democracy.


CalMatters’ Digital Democracy collaboration with CBS-TV has been honored with an Emmy award from the Northern California chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.
The video piece, “Using new AI, grieving moms discover California lawmakers killed popular fentanyl bill by *not* ​voting” told the story of how moms advocating for fentanyl legislation were upset to learn through Digital Democracy that their bills died when legislators declined to vote.
The broadcast followed a CalMatters’ story, “Power is never having to say ‘no.’ How California Democrats kill bills without voting against them” co-authored by CBS correspondent Julie Watts and CalMatters reporter Ryan Sabalow. The story used data from Digital Democracy to show that instead of directly voting against a bill, Democrats often killed bills by declining to vote.
Launched in 2024, Digital Democracy is CalMatters’ unprecedented, custom-built AI tool that tracks every word spoken in public hearings, every dollar donated to politicians, every bill introduced, every vote cast and more.
The CalMatters and CBS entry won in the politics and government news category, which also honored a KCRA 3 entry. The award recognizes CBS correspondent Julie Watts and producer Dennis Lopez along with CalMatters reporters Sameea Kamal and Ryan Sabalow. Foaad Khosmood, a computer science professor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and an architect of Digital Democracy, was also recognized.
“First of all, Digital Democracy has transformed the way I do my job … everyone in this room should be using it,” Watts said when accepting the award next to Dave Lesher, CalMatters’ co-founder, senior editor and leader of Digital Democracy. “This is one of many accountability stories that I did this year that I could not have done without this incredible tool that Dave Lesher is responsible for and I could not have done this and several other stories without these incredible women.”

Stokely Carmichael, one of the original Freedom Riders and a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, called for “Black Power” at a rally in Greenwood, Mississippi. 
He was taking part in the James Meredith “March Against Fear,” when he and others set up tents on the grounds of a public school. When local white officials confronted him, saying they didn’t have permission to do so, Carmichael and two other leaders continued to pitch tents. 
Authorities arrested the trio. Several hours after being released from jail, Carmichael addressed the crowd, saying, “We been saying freedom for six years, and we ain’t got nothin’. What we got to start saying now is Black Power! We want Black Power!” The phrase echoed through the crowd, and the slogan spread rapidly across the nation, a movement that promoted Black identity, pride and self-determination. 
A year earlier, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization in Alabama had used the slogan, “Black Power for the People.” Author Richard Wright had used the phrase more than a decade before that. Carmichael became the voice of this new movement, featured in a New York Times story headlined, “Black Power Prophet,” and the FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover soon targeted him and others in the movement through COINTELPRO.
SNCC soon gave way to the Black Panthers. In 1968, Carmichael married Miriam Makeba, a beloved singer from South Africa known as “Mama Africa,” who was exiled from her homeland because the apartheid governor saw her as a threat. They left for Guinea the next year. Carmichael, also known as Kwame Ture, lived the rest of his life in Africa, continuing to speak out and fight for change before dying of prostate cancer in 1998.

His Senate career is almost all cable news hits, conspiracy thinking and attacks on transgender youth. His platform is the same reward-the-wealthy, punish-the-marginalized, Trump-is-all pitch we’ve heard from state Republicans for a decade.
Call me naive, but Alabama needs something more than this. We deserve officials whose priorities are public matters and not the private goals of the state’s many wealthy cliques. A gubernatorial campaign that could be waged in its entirety from a beach house won’t provide any of that.
So who’s going to challenge him?

Believe it or not, the GOP primary has a not-Tuberville path. The senator’s strength — high name recognition — is also his weakness. People know who Tuberville is, for better and worse. It’s not hard to envision a Republican challenger who can give the GOP base what it wants and promise to remember what triangles are.
But the existence of a path doesn’t mean that someone will walk it. The Alabama Republican Party is hierarchical and demands deference from its members. Tuberville can raise money, and the state GOP organization in the past has removed primary challengers from the ballot on thin pretexts. After Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth bowed out last month, it’s hard to see any other Republican jumping into the race.
That leaves us the Alabama Democratic Party. Which is a shaky vessel for political opposition.
The party has almost no presence outside the major cities and the Black Belt, and its leadership seems content with that fact.
Straight-ticket voting also means that millions of voters in November 2026 will mark the Republican box on their ballots without knowing or caring about the names annexed to that capital R. Get the party to nominate Cthulu; get Cthulu in a race against Atticus Finch, and odds are Alabamians will send a malevolent octopus god to Montgomery.
Democrats have a lot of challenges. But that makes finding a strong candidate for governor imperative. Because the party’s survival is at stake.
Let’s go back to our last gubernatorial contest. If you’re a voter who despises professional politicians, the 2022 Democratic field should have been your dream campaign. Only one candidate, Sen. Malika Sanders-Fortier of Selma, had ever held public office.
But you also got to see what happens when a nonpolitician leads a political ticket. Gubernatorial nominee Yolanda Flowers was a first-time candidate, and it showed. In a year when the Dobbs decision turned out huge numbers of Democrats, Flowers failed to convey a clear position on abortion. Her fundraising was so poor that the Libertarian nominee for governor pulled in more direct contributions.
Predictably, Flowers got wiped out by Gov. Kay Ivey. Less expected was the undertow of that defeat.
With no statewide candidate spending money on radio or TV ads, many Democratic voters missed the election. And for the first time in decades, several contests in majority-Black seats became competitive.
Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, a 30-year veteran of the House, barely squeaked past a Republican opponent in his Black Belt district. Three other Black Democrats pulled in less than 60% of the vote, a dangerous number in what on paper are safe seats.
That’s not an experience Alabama Democrats can afford to repeat in 2026. The party’s choice for governor may not win. But the office is prestigious, and campaigns for it affect downballot races. That’s why you need an established name on the top: it raises the profile of every other campaign. If the Democrats don’t find a strong candidate, they’re going to find themselves fighting to protect what they already have.
So who could provide that top-of-the-ticket stability? Former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones? Former Alabama Chief Justice Sue Bell Cobb? Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox? Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin? Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed? Charles Barkley? (Maybe it’s Will Boyd, a declared Democratic gubernatorial candidate, but he’s struggled to raise money in his previous contests.)
“None of the above” is possible. Maybe probable. It’s a lot to ask someone to sacrifice time and energy for a political campaign certain to end in grief.
But strange as it is to say, there’s something bigger than the outcome in the next election. It’s the danger of the Alabama Democratic Party going extinct.
If they sleepwalk through yet another statewide election in 2026, it’s very likely the Democrats will have fewer seats in the Legislature in 2027. And every time the party’s position on the state level retreats, it becomes weaker locally.
The Democrats have to show their voters they’re willing to give Alabamians unhappy with GOP hegemony a voice, at every level of government. If they can’t do that, there’s little reason for their voters to support what candidates they have.
So, Democrats, find someone willing to lead your next campaign. Because challenging Tuberville is not a question of win-or-lose. It’s live or die.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Alabama-delegation-DNC-Aug-20-2024-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-16 08:02:52.713286

The Alabama Commission on Higher Education adopted rules for a law enforcement scholarship, one of Treadaway's bills, even though the bill did not pass.(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The legislation didn’t pass this year. But the rules are in place if it does. 
The Alabama Commission on Higher Education (ACHE) Friday adopted preliminary regulations for a scholarship program for children and spouses of law enforcement officers, despite the bill failing to pass the Legislature this spring. 
HB 188, sponsored by Rep. Alan Treadaway, R-Morris, would have created the scholarship fund through the Education Trust Fund (ETF). The legislation would have given qualifying students up to $3,000 per semester. The commission Friday voted unanimously for full-time students at four-year colleges and universities to receive $3,000 per semester and $1,500 a semester for those enrolled full time at two-year colleges. 
The bill passed the House unanimously on Feb. 18, and got approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee on Feb. 26. But the bill was never voted on by the full Senate. Treadaway said in an interview Friday that he will prefile an identical bill for the 2026 Legislative Session.
“It appears that they have a lot of confidence that the bill’s going to pass if they went ahead and already established rules for this type of legislation,” Treadaway said.  “It got caught up in a weeklong filibuster in the last week of the session, so it just ran out of time like many other bills did.” 
Executive Director Jim Purcell said that the commission adopted the rules so that the program could start as soon as the bill is signed into law. 
“A lot of people really anticipated that they would be successful, and I think it was at the cusp of being one of the things that was approved in the Legislature,” he said. “There is strong support for this.”
Takena Jones, the grants & scholarships associate at ACHE, said that the scholarship would be prorated for students who are not enrolled full time.
Under Treadaway’s 2025 bill, students eligible for the scholarship must be natural or adopted children 27 years of age or younger, or spouses, current or surviving, of qualifying officers. The student must be an Alabama resident for at least 2 years; must not be eligible for other police survivors’ educational assistance; and must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). In order to maintain the scholarship, students must maintain full-time Alabama residency; meet Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards; and complete their degree within 66 months.
Qualifying officers are those who are certified by the Alabama Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission; employed full time for at least seven years at one agency, or at least 20 years in the state of Alabama; and have not been terminated for disciplinary reasons, Jones said.
Stephanie Dolan, the governmental relations coordinator at ACHE, said the Legislature appropriated $8 million for the law enforcement scholarship program, even though the bill did not pass. According to the bill, the scholarship program would be capped at $10 million.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Allen-Treadaway-May-8-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-16 08:02:52.713286

Joe Lombardo this year once again vetoed several bills backed by housing advocacy and legal aid groups who said the proposals were needed to reform the eviction process, bolster tenant protections, and prevent people from being pushed into homelessness.
And to the surprise of some advocates, Lombardo also signed two tenant bills organizers pushed, including legislation that brings modest transparency to rental applications. 
“I would say 2025 was another brutal session for basic tenant rights,” said Jonathan Norman, the statewide advocacy, outreach and policy director for the Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers.  
From reforming Nevada’s quick eviction process to holding landlords accountable for facility maintenance to reforming tenant-hostile eviction record laws, “I think the governor chose landlords,” Norman said. 
Nevada, like most of the country, lacks enough affordable housing. Compared to many other states, it also lacks tenant protections, a statutory condition that exacerbates  eviction rates and homelessness. 
An estimated 10,100 Nevadans experienced homelessness in 2024, a 17% annual increase, according to data released in December by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  
Lawmakers this session passed several policies to aid the development and construction of more housing.
Lombardo, who before the session named housing as one of his top priorities, pushed legislation to allocate $133 million into housing development for “attainable housing,” which legislators approved. 
But housing advocates and legal aid groups have long asked lawmakers to not just focus on development and redirect attention to policies that needlessly burdens tenants in housing Nevada already has.
“I don’t think we are going to solve our housing issue if we only say this is just about building, building, building,” Norman said.
Nevada’s Legislature is one of four that meets only every other year, meaning organizers will have to wait another two years before they can again advocate for change.
“The biennial nature of our state’s legislature makes the stakes feel exponentially higher than they already are,” said Ben Iness, the coalition manager with the Nevada Housing Justice Alliance. “It’s a long time to hold your breath and wait. It’s even longer for impacted communities and folks living in unstable housing and on the brink of becoming unsheltered or living in inhabitable conditions to continue to ride it out.”
“The veto messages don’t acknowledge that.”
‘The conversation shifted’
Democratic lawmakers sought to revive proposals that Lombardo vetoed in the 2023 session, arguing that just because their bills died didn’t mean the problems did.
One of those bills crossed the finish line this time. Democratic Assemblymember Venicia Considine’s Assembly Bill 121 re-upped 2023 proposals that required landlords to more thoroughly detail  actual costs to rental applicants, and a way to pay rent online without paying extra fees.
The legislation also prohibits collecting application fees to obtain a credit report or run a background check for a minor who resides in the house. 
Lombardo signed AB 121 last week. 
The difference this year, Norman said, was that since 2023  lawsuits against landlords and the Federal Trade Commission actions have highlighted the practice of property management companies, including some operating in Nevada, of charging junk fees.
“The conversation shifted,” he said. “People started recognizing that basic honesty is something we should force landlords to abide by. The fact we have to force them to is disheartening.”
Other measures that returned weren’t as lucky. 
Assembly Bill 280, which would have limited landlords from raising rents more than 5% on tenants 62 years or older, and Assembly Bill 283, which flipped Nevada’s summary eviction process to align with the rest of the country by requiring landlords be the first to file with courts first, were among those brought back.
AB 280 also required landlords to refund application fees if they don’t screen a tenant who applied for the unit.
“The rent control provisions in AB 280, though well-intentioned, are likely to undermine housing affordability over time,” Lombardo wrote in a June 2 veto message. “Although AB 280 targets a specific population group, its implementation could trigger ripple effects that disrupt the rental market as a whole.”
In his veto message for AB 283, Lombardo called the attempt to reform the eviction process lopsided and argued it would place a heavy strain on the courts.  
“By shifting procedural burdens onto property owners, it risks punishing those owners and may inadvertently encourage tenants to be less accountable to the terms of their lease agreements,” Lombardo wrote.
Reacting to the reasoning in Lombardo’s statement, Norman reiterated what eviction process reform advocates in Nevada have noted for decades: the burden to file an eviction case rests with landlords, not tenants,  in every state except Nevada.  
While frustrated by Lombardo’s vetoes, organizers and legal groups were relieved he did approve Assembly Bill 475, which allocated additional funding to Clark County, the City of Reno and the Nevada Rural Housing Authority for rental assistance used in eviction diversion programs. 
Counties had warned state lawmakers the allotted funds approved in 2023, along with remaining dollars allocated from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, were running dry. 
Clark County will get $15 million, the city will receive $5.2 million and the Rural Housing Authority will receive $750,000 to provide tenants at risk of eviction assistance with the passage of AB 475. 
Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal also revived 2023 efforts vetoed by Lombardo to rein in corporate landlords restricting corporate investors from purchasing more than 100 units per year.
Lombardo didn’t need to veto that bill. Instead, he killed Senate Bill 391 behind the scenes by asking the Republican caucus to vote against it, according to Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen, who supported the legislation.
“For the first time this session, I have actually been asked by the executive branch to support a caucus ‘no’ position, which I have agreed to do,” Hansen said in a floor speech, adding he was doing so “very reluctantly.”  
Habitability reform, eviction sealing fail
Lawmakers brought forward several bills to address the legal process tenants can take when they are forced to live in substandard conditions. 
Assembly Bill 211, which allows a third party to take over the property until the repairs are made and living conditions improved, was the only piece of legislation Lombardo approved.
Legal groups had recounted stories to state lawmakers this session of clients waiting weeks, if not months, to have life sustaining repairs made, including air conditioning promptly fixed in the dead heat of the Las Vegas Summer.
Iness said the Housing Justice Alliance was working with a couple whose refrigerator broke last year and it wasn’t fixed for five months.
“They would reach out to the property manager who would kick the can down the road,” he said. 
Some tenants withhold rent and then face an eviction. During the court hearing, Norman said people try to bring up habituality issues as a defense but the current legal process doesn’t shield them from an eviction. 
Assembly Bill 223 sought to revise the court process when a tenant has an unresponsive landlord who doesn’t quickly address needed repairs. 
Legislators also approved Assembly Bill 201, that sought to expand automatic sealing of eviction records.  
Lombardo vetoed both bills.
AB 233 “needlessly disrupts a well-established balance in Nevada law which provides adequate tenant protections while also ensuring lessors maintain safe, quality housing,” Lombardo wrote in his June 2 veto message.
None of the provisions of the AB 223 should be considered controversial, Iness said. 
“To veto it or come out in a statement saying you’re opposed says these conditions are fine and this is acceptable,” Iness said. The veto shows people “don’t mind tenants living in squalor with no remedy.”
Lombardo called AB 201 a “ heavy-handed attempt at addressing a delicate issue that erodes judicial discretion related to eviction case file sealing almost entirely.”
‘Narrowly focused’
Lombardo’s housing bill, Assembly Bill 540, establishes a Nevada Attainable Housing Fund and Council and directs $133 million to develop housing.
“I am proud of the meaningful progress we made this session – particularly in the areas of education and housing,” Lombardo said in a statement Friday about the session. “Working together, we’ve taken important steps to expand educational opportunity, begin restoring accountability in our public schools, and make housing more attainable for working families across our state.”
Other bills to enacted in the name of promoting more housing development included:

Assembly Bill 241, which requires counties to speed up the process to rezone land currently designated commercial use into residential or mixed use. 
Senate Bill 28, legislation being brought by the City of Las Vegas, creates “tax increment areas” in which a portion of future property tax revenue would be used to pay interest on bonds used to finance  affordable housing development as well as public transit.
Assembly Bill 366 appropriates $25 million from the state general fund to support housing initiatives throughout the state. The Nevada Housing Division would determine the projects eligible to receive those dollars.  

Housing organizers agreed the state needs to build more affordable housing throughout the state. 
Iness reiterated that only homing in on development is “so narrowly focused,” especially if building new affordable units could take up to a decade.
It was counterproductive for the governor to focus on building more housing, “but then protect no other part of the access to that housing … the corporate cannibalism of our neighborhoods or entire communities, or the power imbalance between tenant and landlords,” Iness said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/EvictionCourt_RC_103123_007-1024x697.jpg,,,2025-06-16 08:02:52.713286

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Minnesota law enforcement officers on Sunday night arrested Vance Boelter, who is accused of assassinating Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park as part of a larger plot to kill Democratic elected officials and other advocates of abortion rights.
Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
The arrest comes after a 43-hour manhunt — the largest in state history, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.
At the time of his arrest, Boelter was armed, but ultimately surrendered. Officers did not use any force, said Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger of the Minnesota State Patrol.
In the state’s new Emergency Operations Center in Blaine — which was paid for by legislation passed by Hortman’s DFL-controlled House in 2020 — Gov. Tim Walz thanked law enforcement and decried political violence and hateful rhetoric.
“This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country, and each and every one of us can do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than argue, debate an issue, shake hands, find common ground.”

Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats of violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. He survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. An unsealed criminal complaint indicates that the Hoffmans’ daughter called the police to report the shooting of her parents, the Associated Press reports.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the attacker in a fake law enforcement uniform shoot Mark Hortman through the open front door, according to the complaint. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a cop car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds.
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle. From there, teams from dozens of law enforcement agencies fanned out in search of Boelter.
Boelter was spotted in the area, and officers converged around him, Evans said. He declined to provide some details of the tactics used by law enforcement to capture Boelter.
Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.
“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation…those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.

Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Strib.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Times reported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On Sunday night as leaders spoke to the press, Boelter was being questioned by law enforcement, but officials declined to say where he was detained and which agency was questioning him.
On the steps of the State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

Mike Cernovich, another right-wing influencer who has 1.4 million followers on X, took Rugg’s post and amped it up, but in the “just asking questions” style of many conspiracy theories:
“Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”
They were deeply ignorant about the MinnesotaCare issue.
Walz and Hortman — who was instrumental in passing legislation allowing undocumented people to sign up for MinnesotaCare as speaker of the House in 2023 — negotiated a compromise with Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature to end eligibility for adults, but keep it for children. They did so to win necessary Republican support in the 67-67 House to pass a state budget. Without it, state government would have shut down on July 1.
Both Hortman and Walz signed the compromise agreement in mid-May. This week, Hortman spoke tearfully about how difficult the vote was for her, but she was bound to vote yes on the issue because of the prior agreement.
The “theory” of Hortman’s killing was further undercut by the vote of Democratic Sen. John Hoffman — who was also targeted by the suspect — against rolling back MinnesotaCare for undocumented Minnesotans.
Rugg and Cernovich’s posts were shared widely and just the start of the disinformation.
Once law enforcement sources began revealing a suspect, right-wing influencers ran with an insignificant detail: That Vance Luther Boelter was a “Walz appointee.”
Like many states, but even more so here, Minnesota is home to hundreds of nonpartisan and bipartisan boards and commissions, which are composed of thousands of people who typically win the appointment by simply volunteering. There are currently 342 open positions on Minnesota boards and commissions. Boelter was appointed to the Workforce Development Council by Walz’s predecessor Gov. Mark Dayton and reappointed by Walz.
It was the equivalent of calling a Sunday school volunteer an “appointee of the bishop.”
No matter, the Murdoch media machine, specifically the New York Post, had their headline: “Former appointee of Tim Walz sought….”
Cernovich had his greasy foil hot dog wrapper and began constructing a hat:
“The Vice President candidate for the Democrat party is directly connected to a domestic terrorist, that is confirmed, the only question is whether Tim Walz himself ordered the political hit against a rival who voted against Walz’s plan to give free healthcare to illegals.”
Walz had no such plan. He had signed an agreement to end eligibility for undocumented adults.
Joey Mannarino, who has more than 600,000 followers on X, was more crass:
“Rumor has it she was preparing to switch parties. The Democrats are VIOLENT SCUM.”
It was a ridiculous “rumor.” One of the last photos of Hortman alive was an image of her at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor’s big annual fundraising event, the Humphrey-Mondale dinner, which took place just hours before her assassination.
No matter, Cernovich wanted his new friends in federal law enforcement to act:
“The FBI must take Tim Walz into custody immediately.”
Finally, fresh off his humiliating defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump, world’s richest man Elon Musk quote-tweeted someone again falsely alleging Hortman was killed by “the left”  and added:
“The far left is murderously violent.” 
The suspect’s “hit list,” according to an official who has seen the list, comprised Minnesotans who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. CNN reported that it also included several abortion clinics, which doesn’t sound like the work of “the left.”
Right-wing influencers marred Hortman’s death and smeared Walz on a pile of lies.
In a different, saner world, they would be humiliated and slink away. But the smart money is that during the next moment of national crisis and mourning, they will again lie for profit.

Here's a look at some of them.,"Over six dozen Connecticut laws, including the state’s next budget and bond package, will wholly or partially take effect on July 1.
Connecticut laws are passed by the General Assembly during the legislative session each year — this year’s ran from Jan. 8 to June 4 — or in a special session. They typically take effect on Jan. 1, July 1 or Oct. 1.
Here’s a look at some of the dozens of laws that will be implemented next month.
New biennial state budget
Contingent on Gov. Ned Lamont’s signature, Connecticut’s next biennial state budget will take effect at the beginning of the state’s next fiscal year, which is July 1.
The budget prioritizes children, would boost funds for nonprofit social service agencies two years from now, and would increase taxes on corporations. It also dramatically scales back a pledged boost to health care providers who treat the poor and relies on accounting maneuvers to comply with the state’s constitutional spending cap.
Lamont praised the bill upon its passage.
In odd-numbered years, the General Assembly passes a budget for the next two fiscal years. In even-numbered years, legislators can choose to adjust it.
$9.7B bond package
Also pending Lamont’s signature, a $9.7B bond package to finance school construction, transportation upgrades and other capital projects for the next two fiscal years will take effect on July 1.
The borrowing plan would expand non-education aid for cities and towns, increase affordable housing and combat homelessness, bolster security at places of worship and support construction and renovation of child care facilities.
It recommends new capital investments in higher education — including $5 million to advance the planned renovation of Gampel Pavilion at the University of Connecticut — and a new $60 million program to help K-12 school districts fund small-scale renovation projects.
Education requirements in public schools 
Beginning in the 2025-26 school year, Connecticut public schools will be required to add two units to their social studies curriculum: Asian American and Pacific Islander history and civics and media literacy.
The AAPI studies provision, part of a bill that lawmakers passed in 2022, requires schools to teach the history of Asian American and Pacific Islanders in the state, region and country, including the contributions of AAPI individuals and communities to the United States’ arts, sciences, government, economy and civil rights advancements.
A separate law that passed in 2023 requires the civics and media literacy lessons. Civics is defined in the bill as “the study of the rights and obligations of citizens” and media literacy will cover the role of all forms of media in society and how to use, evaluate and analyze the media that a person consumes or creates.
Absentee ballot drop box recordings
As of July 1, municipalities are required to have implemented video recording technology, complete with date and time evidence, at each of their absentee ballot drop boxes. They will be required to start recording the boxes on the first day absentee ballots are issued for an election or primary and continue recording until the town clerk retrieves the last ballots.
The law also requires that the recordings be made available to the public as soon as possible — and no later than five days after the town clerk’s last ballot retrieval — and that they keep the recordings for at least a year.
Legislators approved that requirement in the wake of an absentee ballot abuse scandal in Bridgeport, where a court ordered a re-do of the city’s 2023 Democratic primary after a video surfaced of Democratic Town Committee vice chairwoman Wanda Geter-Pataky appearing to place multiple absentee ballots into a Bridgeport absentee ballot drop box.
Five people, including Geter-Pataky and three Bridgeport council members, have been charged with election-related crimes as part of a sprawling investigation into that primary.
Limits on library e-book contracts
This year, lawmakers gave full passage to a bill designed to address the high costs libraries incur when buying electronic and audiobooks by banning them from entering into contracts with e-book publishers that contain terms that some lawmakers call restrictive.
E-book contracts for libraries often come with terms that mean the library has to re-purchase the book after it’s been borrowed 26 times or every couple of years, whichever comes first. The law prohibits libraries from contracting with publishers that place simultaneous restrictions on the loan period of an e-book and the number of times people can borrow it.
Though the law takes effect on July 1, it will only be implemented if one or more states with a total or combined population of 7 million enact similar laws, and mandates that the state librarian check quarterly whether any other states have passed a similar law.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0224_SR_HouseVote_051-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-16 08:02:52.713286

( Getty images)For nearly a decade, I worked at the FBI investigating organized financial crime. I watched cyber scams evolve from crude “Nigerian prince” emails into something far more sinister—industrial-scale criminal networks that the Federal Trade Commission reports cost Americans more than $12.5 billion last year alone.
Today, sophisticated criminal networks operate in places like Myanmar and Cambodia, beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement. The scammers, often victims themselves, are trafficked, exploited and forced by their criminal bosses to operate 24/7 “scam centers” to siphon funds from unsuspecting Americans. It’s the criminal equivalent of a corporate production line, except instead of building a product they are stealing money.
Today’s scammers rely on sophisticated scripts and psychological tactics to manipulate victims’ trust. Take “romance” scams, for instance, where fraudsters find victims on social media, build fake relationships, and then, after a few days or weeks, convince the victim to transfer them money due to a fake urgent emergency.

The criminal playbook keeps expanding. Retirement accounts, crypto investments, credit cards, gift cards, peer-to-peer payment apps — anywhere and any way that money can be transferred has been infiltrated. The criminal networks adapt faster than our defenses, targeting vulnerable Americans with ruthless precision.
But here’s the thing: While the fraud landscape continues to transform, the U.S. government’s strategies to combat fraud remain stuck in the past.
Congress has started to recognize the severity of the threat, but their response remains inadequate. Last year’s narrow legislation on payment platforms addressed just one small piece of an expanding criminal ecosystem. We need comprehensive legislative strategies, not a fragmented approach that criminals can easily circumvent.
Now that Maryland has a former state’s attorney — Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D) — representing us in Congress, I’m hoping she can help shift the focus toward more robust solutions. Here are three places to start:
First, we need to make significant investments in specialized law enforcement units dedicated to investigating these crimes. From my time at the FBI to today, one thing holds true – we are outmatched in terms of resources. Criminal networks number in the thousands and work around the clock, while our criminal justice system is inundated with victim reports and exhaustively overburdened. Invest in more investigators and equip them with the industry’s latest cyber and intelligence tools to give them a much-needed edge.
Second, we need to address the scattered approach across multiple agencies that’s causing inefficiencies. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) offers a solid foundation, but we should empower it to work seamlessly with other agencies and provide enough funding to meet today’s needs. This would help them triage the wave of complaints more effectively, support victims, and keep Americans informed about the latest cyber scams.
And third, we need to confront these threats at their source. The United States must leverage diplomatic pressure, intelligence capabilities and international partnerships to dismantle overseas criminal networks. We’ve successfully deployed these tools against terrorist financing and money laundering operations.  There’s no reason we can’t use the same playbook against the predatory networks that target American citizens.
These fraud networks now rival drug cartels in profitability while operating with considerably less risk. Until we pursue them with the same rigor we bring to other forms of organized crime, they will continue stealing billions from vulnerable American citizens. The $12.5 billion figure cited above represents countless personal tragedies: seniors who lost their retirement savings, small business owners who couldn’t meet payroll, and families whose financial security crumbled overnight. The tens of thousands of Americans who have been victimized deserve a better approach.
The expertise exists within our government to tackle this problem effectively. What’s missing is adequate funding and political will. It’s time for Congress to act against one of the biggest threats facing American consumers today.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/computer-1024x668.jpeg,,,2025-06-16 08:02:52.713286

What the Community Housing Infrastructure Program does is remove one of the biggest, most immediate roadblocks: infrastructure costs. And that’s a breakthrough.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Maura Collins and Jason Pidgeon: CHIP is a Game Changer.","This commentary is by Lets Build Homes board members Maura Collins and Jason Pidgeon. Collins is executive director of the Vermont Housing Finance Agency. Pigeon is VP of mortgage banking and consumer credit at Northfield Saving Bank.


Vermont just took a bold, historic step toward solving one of the most urgent issues facing our state: the lack of affordable and attainable homes for Vermonters of all income levels and backgrounds.
With the passage of the Community Housing Infrastructure Program, or CHIP, during the 2025 legislative session, the state now has a powerful new tool to help communities unlock housing development that has, for too long, remained stuck on paper. As leaders in housing finance and banking, and as board members of Let’s Build Homes, we have a clear message: This is a game changer. 
We hear it constantly from nonprofit developers, private builders and community leaders across the state. Even with viable sites, designed thoughtful projects and a waiting list of buyers and tenants the numbers don’t work. Why? Because of infrastructure.
The cost of roads, sewer lines, water systems and stormwater controls can sink a project before the first shovel hits the ground. In many Vermont communities, particularly in smaller or rural towns, the financial burden of building or upgrading this infrastructure is simply too high for developers, or municipalities, to absorb. The math doesn’t pencil out. And when the math doesn’t work, the homes don’t get built.
CHIP fixes that.
The program allows communities to use future property tax revenue generated by new development to finance the upfront cost of the infrastructure those developments need. It’s smart, targeted tax increment financing. It means that towns don’t have to choose between keeping taxes stable and making long-term investments in housing. And it means developers can finally say yes to projects that have been on hold for years.
This isn’t speculative. It’s backed by real projections: up to $200 million a year in CHIP-supported financing, for 10 years, means up to $2 billion in public infrastructure investment statewide. If fully utilized, CHIP could help Vermont build 40,000 new homes in the next decade, assuming an average of $45,000 in infrastructure funds per home. It also has the potential to generate up to $660 million in new Education Fund revenue by 2060, according to the state’s Joint Fiscal Office.
Just as importantly, CHIP is available to every Vermont municipality, no matter its size or zoning structure. Whether it’s a small rural town trying to build homes adjacent to their village or a growing community planning dense infill near its downtown, CHIP levels the playing field and gives every community a path to housing growth.
The passage of CHIP would not have been possible without the leadership and momentum generated by Let’s Build Homes, a brand-new coalition of more than 200 businesses and organizations and over 500 individual Vermonters. The coalition captured the moment, ran with the ball and scored, bringing unprecedented energy and coordination to the effort to make meaningful housing policy a top priority in Montpelier.
We also commend the Legislature and the Scott administration for building CHIP with simplicity in mind. The program’s design is streamlined, and while important decisions still lie ahead in the rulemaking process, the commitment to clarity and access is evident. VHFA, Northfield Savings Bank and lenders across the state stand ready to support communities and developers in navigating this new opportunity.
Let’s be clear: CHIP won’t solve every problem. Zoning reform, workforce challenges, material costs and permitting challenges all remain significant hurdles. But what CHIP does is remove one of the biggest, most immediate roadblocks: infrastructure costs. And that’s a breakthrough.
As housing finance professionals, we know that timing, cost and predictability are everything when it comes to getting projects financed and built. CHIP changes the equation. It helps projects pencil. It helps Vermont build.
To the bill sponsors, legislative leaders, organizational partners and all those who made this moment possible — thank you. Vermont has a proud tradition of tackling big challenges with creativity and resolve. With CHIP, we’ve proven once again that bold solutions are possible when we work together.

Philanthropy can’t fill this drastic funding gap.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rob Riley and Maura Adams: Rural places need federal partnership .","This commentary is by Rob Riley and Maura Adams. Riley is president and Adams is director of community investment for the Northern Forest Center, a nonprofit investment and innovation partner dedicated to revitalizing Northern Forest communities in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York.


The Northern Forest Center partners with rural communities to create places where people can thrive, and where the forested landscape provides rich opportunities for recreation, economic vitality and ecological stewardship. For more than 25 years we have worked with local, state and federal partners across all political parties to invest in the region’s people and its future. And when it comes to advocacy and public policy, we prefer to talk about what we are for, rather than what we are against.  
Today, however, we feel compelled to raise our voice against budget and program cuts by the current federal administration that are gutting essential resources for rural communities. Our position is driven not by politics, but by data and people from across the region we serve. 
In April, we informally surveyed 150 nonprofit organizations and municipalities across the Northern Forest region of Northern Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York to learn how they were being impacted by recent changes in federal policies. Sixty percent of the 79 respondents reported that they rely on federal funding for at least 20% of their annual budget. 
The survey gave us a direct view into a rural-specific sample that revealed the significance of canceled contracts, eliminated grant programs and fewer federal staff. These 79 respondents alone reported a loss of at least $18.1 million in canceled or frozen grants or funds no longer available, citing 20 federal agency programs.  
The cuts are putting nonprofit services at risk nationwide. In the Northern Forest region, cuts affect a wide range of projects that had been designed to revitalize communities – 200 units of housing in a single small town, conservation easements, community facility repairs, trail construction, water systems, food pantry provisions, downtown tree planting, sewer system upgrades, regional promotion, culverts for flood mitigation. The list goes on, well beyond the organizations in the Northern Forest Center’s direct sphere.  
In addition, organizations and municipalities have been thrown into uncertainty, losing their ability to plan, hire staff and launch or deepen programs. More than 20 respondents expect that they will need to decrease programming and staff this year. Also evident in responses is the toll on people’s psyches — respondents said the situation is “creating a sense of unease, which saps energy and morale,” and that staff feel rampant “uncertainty and chaos.”  
These draconian cuts were not necessary. Having managed dozens of federal grants ourselves, we’re well aware that government regulations and processes can feel onerous and inefficient. A thoughtful, wholesale review of agencies, programs and systems could reveal many opportunities for improvement.
But indiscriminate slashing of staff and programs is only going to worsen economic prospects, setting back the positive momentum many rural places have begun to experience since the pandemic. Reform can be valuable; destruction for its own sake is simply violence.  
Ninety-two percent of affected respondents said they would need more non-federal grants and donations to make up for federal support. But philanthropy can’t fill this drastic funding gap. Rural places need game-changing investments in order to secure a diverse and robust economic future, and the federal government is a crucial partner in delivering them.  
The Northern Forest Center will remain a steadfast partner to rural communities and to federal agency staff who deliver programs and funding across multiple administrations.  We call on the current administration to reconsider its slashing of rural funding programs and the federal staff who deliver them — and ask the members of the region’s congressional delegation to be vocal and active in defending these resources.

Enlarging the board is intended to help it hear more cases. In recent years, the number of people seeking and getting hearings has increased, but because the board consists of only five volunteer members and only meets four times a year, it limits the number of cases it can review. 
“Because of that, we’ve seen people waiting multiple years now to get a hearing,” said Jennie Pasquarella, legal director at the Seattle Clemency Project.
The process used to only take a couple of months, Pasquarella said.
Rep. Roger Goodman, D-Kirkland, who sponsored House Bill 1131, said the bill is “part of our effort to create more mechanisms for mid-sentence review and possible release or commutation.”
Members of the clemency and pardons board are appointed by the governor. They review applications and hold hearings on cases. But it is the governor who ultimately decides who is granted clemency or a pardon. 
Clemency can involve reducing a sentence for a criminal conviction, also known as a commutation. A pardon absolves a person of guilt for a crime and can restore certain rights and privileges lost due to the conviction. 
The new law will expand the board to ten members. It also requires board members to represent different backgrounds, including an incarcerated individual, a representative of a faith-based organization, a federally recognized tribe member, and a member from a crime victim organization. 
Board members will also be allowed to receive pay of up to $100 a day. 
“We want people who have had different perspectives in the system to offer sort of a more balanced view,” Goodman said. 
The bill also contained a controversial provision to allow the board to consider expediting a petition if the person has a pending deportation order or deportation proceeding. Originally, this provision was a separate bill sponsored by Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Tukwila. 
When Hasegawa’s bill came to the House Community Safety Committee, which Goodman chairs, he said he didn’t move it forward because he didn’t know whether the bill would have the votes to pass. Hasegawa then approached him and asked him to include it in his bill. Goodman told him he would do so if Hasegawa could gain full approval from the Senate. 
Goodman emphasized that there is no requirement in the law for the board to expedite cases for immigrants facing deportation, only to consider doing so.
Gov. Bob Ferguson issued a partial veto of the bill, removing a section that would not allow it to go into effect if funding wasn’t provided. The Legislature previously allocated $416,000 for the expansion in the current budget, but no funding for a related staff position at the governor’s office.  
“I intend to seek the necessary funding to support the work contemplated by this legislation in the next budget,” Ferguson wrote in his veto letter.

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Having lost control of the Legislature and confronting a looming budget deficit, Democrats were forced to abandon plans to advance pro-worker legislation and instead defend their gains from the historic 2023 legislative session.
Progressive Democrats were largely successful, resisting cuts to the paid family leave program, the earned sick time law and unemployment benefits for hourly school workers. The notable exception: MinnesotaCare will be repealed for undocumented adults at the end of the year, which was a key priority for Republicans.
“We had real success in defending the gains that we made a couple of years ago, but I do remain frustrated that I spent a lot of my energy defending progress that shouldn’t need to be defended,” said Senate Labor Committee Chair Jen McEwen, DFL-Duluth. “And I was defending it a lot of the time from DFL colleagues.”
Democrats introduced some labor-backed bills, laying out their agenda should they win back state government: a higher minimum wage, pay raises for teachers, staffing ratios for nurses and a path for Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize. None gained traction.
Here’s what passed this year — and some of what didn’t.
Tweaks to paid family leave and earned sick time
The Legislature made changes so small to the state’s paid family leave program and its earned sick time mandate that most workers and employers may never notice them.
Republicans and some moderate Senate Democrats hoped to carve out small businesses and farms as well as reduce the number of paid family and medical leave weeks available in a year, but they were unable to win over any House Democrats. The paid family leave program will launch Jan. 1, while the earned sick time mandate has been in effect since 2024.
The maximum payroll tax cap for the paid family leave program will be reduced from 1.2% to 1.1%. But that’s moot, for now, because the program is slated to start next year with a payroll tax of .88%, with employers paying at least half.
The most significant change to the earned sick time law is that an employer may require that an employee provide documentation — such as a doctor’s note — showing their earned sick or safe leave is covered after two days, down from three days.
Stricter rules on work breaks
The jobs and labor bill strengthens workers’ rights to take breaks, entitling them to paid 15 minute breaks — or more if needed to use the nearest restroom — within each four hours worked and an unpaid meal break of at least 30 minutes if working six or more hours. Previously the law entitled workers to “sufficient time to eat” in an eight hour shift. Workers may voluntarily waive their right to breaks.
Employers who violate the new rules, which take effect Jan. 1, may be required to pay back workers for double the time of the break missed. For example, if an employee wasn’t able to take a 30 minute meal break, the employer would have to pay them an hour’s wages.
The Department of Labor and Industry may levy additional penalties for willful and repeated violations.
Blanket ban on noncompete agreements holds
Democrats successfully beat back an attack on the state’s ban on noncompete agreements, one of their signature pro-worker victories in the 2023 session, with Republicans dropping demands for carve-outs for highly paid workers and those with access to confidential and proprietary information.
It was a top priority for Minnesota’s largest companies, whose lobbyists argued the ban jeopardizes their right to protect valuable scientific discoveries and trade secrets. Democrats rejected that argument, saying the push to revive noncompete agreements was more about stifling competition and suppressing wages than guarding trade secrets, which are protected under other laws.
Unemployment benefits for miners and hourly school workers

Some 630 idled workers at two northern Minnesota mines will be eligible for a full year of unemployment benefits — twice the typical amount — under a provision in the jobs and workforce budget bill.
Extending benefits for miners, which is estimated to cost $15 million, had unanimous support from both Democrats and Republicans. At the same time, Republicans aimed to repeal all unemployment benefits from hourly school workers such as bus drivers, cafeteria workers and teachers’ aides.
That push failed, and the Legislature appropriated an additional $100 million to cover the cost for school districts, in part by canceling some of the funding for a proposed train line between Minneapolis and Duluth.
In 2023, Minnesota became the first state to allow hourly school workers to claim unemployment benefits, which have long been available to workers in other seasonal industries like construction and landscaping.
The benefits provide a valuable safety net for workers making around $17 an hour on average, but school districts complain it makes it harder to fill part-time summer positions and argue the benefits will steal precious resources from classrooms if they’re forced to shoulder the cost.
School districts haven’t yet paid anything for the benefits since the Legislature appropriated $135 million in 2023 to cover its costs. That funding was expected to run dry this summer, leaving school districts on the hook to cover the difference.
In order to pass a compromise education budget with Republicans, House Democratic leaders initially agreed to repeal the benefits in 2029 but that deal was rejected by rank-and-file members.
$700 million infrastructure package
Trade unions celebrated the Legislature passing a $700 million infrastructure package, which will create thousands of well-paid jobs for their members fixing roads, upgrading water treatment plants and renovating government buildings.
High interest rates, President Trump’s trade war and federal funding cuts have soured the economic outlook for construction jobs, which made passage of the infrastructure bill all the more crucial this year.
“This bonding bill isn’t just about concrete and steel – it’s about creating family-supporting careers that allow our members to put food on the table, protect their health care, and secure their pensions,” Joel Smith, president and business manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, said in a statement.
The package is much smaller than in recent years. Lawmakers passed a $2.6 billion infrastructure package in 2023 and a $1.9 billion bonding bill in 2020.
The biggest line items include $176 million to the Minnesota Public Facilities Agency to build, upgrade and repair municipal water treatment plants; $84 million to Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system, mostly for asset preservation; and $80 million to the Minnesota Department of Transportation, largely for road and bridge repairs.
Tax breaks for large data centers
Extending tax breaks for large data centers was the second highest priority for trade unions behind a bonding bill — one large data center can cost upwards of $1 billion to build and create hundreds of construction jobs.
Trade unions and business leaders warned that large tech companies like Meta and Amazon would pass over Minnesota for its neighbors, which offer more generous tax subsidies.
The tax exemptions are costly and growing, however, which vexed progressive lawmakers as well as public unions. They argued the state shouldn’t cut taxes for some of the most profitable — and anti-union — companies in the world, while also making budget cuts elsewhere.
The Legislature voted to extend data centers’ tax exemption for purchases of computers, servers, software and cooling and energy equipment to 35 years with a sunset date of 2042. This means that a data center that makes its first purchase in 2042 could continue claiming the exemption until 2077. But lawmakers repealed a tax break on electricity, which will bring in an estimated $140 million over the next four years.
Raises for nursing home workers

Thousands of nursing home workers across Minnesota will see significant pay increases on Jan. 1 under the human services budget bill, which funds raises passed by the state’s new Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board.
Beginning in 2026, certified nursing assistants will earn at least $22.50 an hour, trained medication aides at least $24.50 an hour and licensed practical nurses at least $27 an hour. All other nursing home workers will earn at least $19 an hour. The minimum wages would increase $1.50 per hour across job titles on Jan. 1, 2027.
The minimum rates will raise pay $2 an hour on average for workers earning less than the minimum, according to a fiscal analysis by the Department of Human Services. Labor advocates say the raises will help increase retention and reward workers for caring for the state’s sick and elderly.
The Legislature funded the raises while also having to make future cuts to nursing homes given a looming budget deficit.
Pension boosts for teachers, police and firefighters
Lawmakers directed $80 million to pensions for Minnesota teachers, police and firefighters. The bill, which passed with bipartisan support and was signed by the governor, increases cost-of-living adjustments for police and firefighters and reduces the penalties for teachers who retire before 65 years old.
Teachers hired before July 1, 1989, can retire with full pension benefits when their age and years of service equal 90 (called the “Rule of 90”). Teachers hired after that date have faced steep penalties for retiring before 65 years old. The new law doesn’t restore the Rule of 90 to those teachers, but it does get them close, by lowering the age at which a teacher is eligible for the enhanced early retirement reduction from 62 to 60.
“This ongoing investment will establish a career rule that compares well to the old ‘Rule of 90’ and will go a long way toward easing the teacher shortage that has spread to nearly 90% of school districts in Minnesota,” then-Education Minnesota President Denise Specht said in a statement in May.
New scuba requirements for underwater weed management

(Catherine Davis/Senate Media Services)
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill in May creating new safety standards for workers who use scuba equipment to remove underwater weeds from lakes, following the deaths of two young and inexperienced divers.
Brady Aune and Joe Anderson died two years apart in remarkably similar accidents that their parents blame on the carelessness of their employers. Neither man was certified in scuba diving. In fact, neither had been scuba diving before they were handed oxygen tanks and weighted belts and sent to pull out weeds in deep murky water with little to no supervision.
The law, which had Democratic and Republican authors, requires workers who use scuba equipment to have an open water scuba diver certificate, or more advanced certificate, from a nationally recognized agency. It also imposes safety regulations on companies that employ the divers.
Misclassification fraud impact report
The state will investigate how misclassification fraud affects workers, government programs and tax collections, under a provision in the jobs and labor bill. Misclassification occurs when an employer treats a worker as an independent contractor rather than an employee, robbing them of benefits like overtime pay and workers’ compensation while shorting the state of payroll taxes.
About 316,000 private-sector workers in Minnesota — or 9.4% of workers — may be misclassified as independent contractors, according to an analysis by the union-backed think tank North Star Policy Action.
Based on that analysis, the group estimates workers lost between $2.9 billion and $6.2 billion in 2019 because of payroll fraud, while state government lost between $506 million and $1.3 billion in tax revenue.
Misclassification is poorly policed, according to a recent report by the state Office of the Legislative Auditor, but the extent to which employers commit payroll fraud is hard to measure. The estimate by the North Star Policy Action is likely an undercount.
The first report — to be conducted in coordination between the Department of Labor and Industry, the Department of Employment and Economic Development and the Department of Revenue — is due in January 2027, with additional reports to be completed every six years, contingent upon funding.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-28-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-16 07:06:26.395991

All of these disasters had Hoosiers on the ground rescuing victims as part of Indiana Task Force One, a highly trained team of first responders and one of 28 federal squads across the country. 
But President Donald Trump’s proposal to close the Federal Emergency Management Agency and shift rescue and recovery responses to the states puts Task Force One in a precarious position. 
The decision is just one of several that has fueled funding uncertainty for universities, state and local programs, watershed projects and environmental needs around the state.

“We’re not even sure — will FEMA be dissolved? Will FEMA be reorganized where this program will stay under FEMA? Will we go to a different federal agency? There’s a lot of questions that, quite frankly, we can’t answer right now,” said Thomas Neal, Task Force One’s division chief. 
Generally speaking, the city of Indianapolis covers the expenses of Task Force One with the promise that FEMA will reimburse the entity for qualifying expenses, such as payroll, during search and rescue missions. Daily expenses are covered by a $1.3 million FEMA readiness grant and funding from the city. 
But Indiana, as a state, doesn’t spend any money on the program — and the General Assembly has rejected multiple attempts to add a budget line item. Indiana’s sole contribution was the $150,000 it spent — with $150,000 from Indianapolis and $300,000 from FEMA — to start Task Force One in 1992. 
Sen. J.D. Ford offered a budget amendment to allocate $1.5 million for Task Force One and won over six Republicans earlier this year, but failed to get enough support from the Republican supermajority. The Indianapolis Democrat said he was disappointed by the result. 
“In my mind, these are first responders who are actually doing a service to our state and we’re not giving them a nickel,” said Ford. 
 More about Task Force One

FEMA requires that Neal maintain at least 210 people on a rotating schedule who are ready to deploy at a moment’s notice. Two-thirds of the unit is made up of firefighters with 380 hours of training in specialized rescue techniques for floods, structural collapses and more. 
The other members are physicians, structural engineers, canine handlers, logistics operatives and even licensed CDL drivers who transport equipment like rescue boats, ready-to-eat meals, water tanks and dry suits. 
Neal, the division chief, has been part of the team since 1994. The team has only three full-time members, including himself, and a few part-time employees. With the additional state funding, Neal said the team would have made its part-time logistics position into a full-time effort — an important role during the busiest part of the year: hurricane season, which started on June 1.
He estimated that Task Force One had maybe 70 total deployments in the history of the program, but “since 2016, it’s pretty much been nonstop.” 
“We’ve had multiple deployments every single year. Sometimes we don’t even hardly get back and get the equipment cleaned up and we’re being pushed out the door again,” Neal said. 
 Indiana dependency on federal funding

An analysis from the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute found that total federal funding flowing into Indiana is $177 billion — equivalent to more than $25,000 for each Hoosier resident. 
Indiana is the third most reliant state on federal cash – behind Louisiana and Mississippi according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
The federal agency that spends the most in Indiana is the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, totaling $126 billion. Next is Social Security with $32 billion.
In terms of where the money goes in Indiana the top two categories are Medicare and individuals — accounting for $160 billion. The state comes in third at $7.5 billion. Other categories include $1.2 billion for public higher education; $1.1 billion to nonprofits and $558 million for city governments.
Story continues after analysis. 
IFPI FFY 2024 Indiana Federal Funding Analysis
This funding uncertainty complicated the state’s efforts to draft a two-year budget for the 2025 legislative session, especially after a dismal revenue forecast predicted the state would take in $2 billion less than expected over the biennium.
The governor’s office remains optimistic about Indiana’s ability to weather any funding uncertainty, however.
“Because of Gov. (Mike) Braun’s direction to do more with less, our state is in a great position to handle any reductions in federal spending. For years, the Biden administration grew our national debt and threw federal dollars around with few guardrails. States now need to demonstrate responsibility and manage their budgets well, and Indiana is leading the way,” said Press Secretary Griffin Reid. 
Ford, on the other hand, tied the state’s budget woes to the actions of Trump and Congress.
“We had to trim the state budget because of the instability that Washington (D.C.) was creating for states and for us,” said Ford. “I think not only of first responders, but I think business owners, our farmers and everyday Americans and Hoosiers want stability and it’s just not what we’re getting.”
The federal funding uncertainty may have only just begun. Here’s three examples of cuts so far: 
 The Department of Energy Industrial Demonstration Program

In May, the U.S. Department of Energy terminated 24 projects worth more than $3.7 billion with the Office of Clean Energy Demonstration. The initiative was designed to modernize U.S. industrial facilities and incentivize clean manufacturing. U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright alleged the projects “failed to advance energy needs of American people … and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”
This cut impacted two Indiana projects working to decarbonize their facilities. 
In 2024, Heidelberg Materials North American was selected to receive $500 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy for a major carbon reduction project at a cement plant in Mitchell. 
Former Gov. Eric Holcomb at the ribbon cutting ceremony for the plant called the award “the most sustainable operation in the history of the world in terms of building cement.” 
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}}))}();
Ash Lauth, a senior campaign strategist with nonprofit advocacy group Industrious Labs, said the Mitchell Plant was a one-of-its-kind carbon cement facility and was expected to offer around 1,000 construction jobs. 
“If I was living around that plant, I would be gutted right now,” Lauth said. “This is real people, real money, I hope Indiana senators think about this and that Indiana voters care about it.” 
Lauth said Heidelberg has already sunk a lot of money into the project and hopes that they go through the appeals process. She said that the cut is just another setback but not a “nail in the coffin.”
“Killing these projects means more emission, more pollution, more people getting sick,” She said. “Now we are handing over a competitive environment to countries around the world and leaving the U.S. behind. That is cause for sorrow.” 
Kraft-Heinz facility in Kendallville also received a $170 million federal grant to install an industrial heat pump — which was part of a plan for up to 11 facilities across the country. 
According to Lauth, the Kraft-Heinz grant would have created an estimated 500 construction jobs. By upgrading the plant with energy efficient manufacturing equipment, the facility sought to eliminate a major source of air pollution and provide cleaner air to nearby residents. 
 Hits for farmers

In February, the Allen County Soil and Water Conservation District was still waiting on $400,000 in federal reimbursements — funds that were supposed to arrive in January but weren’t fully released until mid-April. During that time, the district had already spent nearly $300,000 on programs, salaries, education efforts and water quality monitoring, expecting federal reimbursement. 
Instead, the funding freeze — and federal court holdup — left the district in turmoil. The delay not only hurt operations but forced Director Dr. Julie Davis Good to make difficult decisions, she said. 
One Watershed Project Manager, who led much of the field and on-site conservation work, was terminated. Another was hired in December but could not begin until early June due to prolonged federal clearance. At one point, the nine-member team was down to just three full-time employees. 
Where do federal funding cuts leave Indiana?

“Farmers are the ones hurt,” Good said. “Obviously our office is in turmoil but farmers can’t get anything that we promised them.” 
The situation escalated in March, when the Indiana Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts announced a pause in programs and staff due to a lack of previously promised federal funding. Like many districts, Allen County operates by spending grant money upfront and then billing the federal government for reimbursement. 
Without staff and program funding, the district lost the ability to deliver soil testing, water quality monitoring and farm support. 
Now, the organization hopes to mitigate funding uncertainty with support from local corporations, foundations and sponsors. Good said the grant is still tied up in the courts, jeopardizing new innovative conservation projects they had planned. 
“Growing up I was told, ‘who controls your food controls you,’” Good said. “We are unable to produce our own food because now we are controlled by them … that is not the American way” 
 Cuts to higher education

Universities and colleges have also taken a hit, particularly research grants from the National Institutes of Health. Trump has also targeted specific higher education institutions in blue states like California and Maine as well as elite universities like Harvard.
Indiana University didn’t respond to a request for comment about funding uncertainty, but is one of 60 universities being investigated by the Trump administration for antisemitism. In 2024, it received just over 70% of its research funding from the federal government, or more than $552 million, mostly dedicated to its medical school.
Another cut impacts the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program, which studies treatments for mild traumatic brain injuries. The IU School of Medicine received $715,000 from that fund in 2023.
Other grants, including those distributed by NIH, are currently being litigated. Indiana received $407 million from NIH in 2024. 
Purdue University’s LASER PULSE program — which helps the federal government research international development — has been frozen. The school had a dedicated page documenting such cuts and other funding uncertainty.

Patrick Coolican,,,,,https://floridaphoenix.com/2025/06/16/a-democratic-legislator-was-assassinated-right-wing-influencers-coughed-out-disinformation/,"Just hours after Minnesotans learned that Democratic House leader Melissa Hortman had been assassinated, right-wing influencer Collin Rugg, who has 1.8 million followers on X, posted a “report” that hinted that she’d been killed because of a recent vote on ending undocumented adults’ ability to enroll in MinnesotaCare, a subsidized health insurance for the w[...]","Conceptual illustration of a young woman's profile with a snake as a tongue depicting harsh speech or lies.Just hours after Minnesotans learned that Democratic House leader Melissa Hortman had been assassinated, right-wing influencer Collin Rugg, who has 1.8 million followers on X, posted a “report” that hinted that she’d been killed because of a recent vote on ending undocumented adults’ ability to enroll in MinnesotaCare, a subsidized health insurance for the working poor.
Mike Cernovich, another right-wing influencer who has 1.4 million followers on X, took Rugg’s post and amped it up, but in the “just asking questions” style of many conspiracy theories:
“Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”
They were deeply ignorant about the MinnesotaCare issue.
Walz and Hortman — who was instrumental in passing legislation allowing undocumented people to sign up for MinnesotaCare as speaker of the House in 2023 — negotiated a compromise with Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature to end eligibility for adults, but keep it for children. They did so to win necessary Republican support in the 67-67 House to pass a state budget. Without it, state government would have shut down on July 1.
Both Hortman and Walz signed the compromise agreement in mid-May. This week, Hortman spoke tearfully about how difficult the vote was for her, but she was bound to vote yes on the issue because of the prior agreement.
The “theory” of Hortman’s killing was further undercut by the vote of Democratic Sen. John Hoffman — who was also targeted by the suspect — against rolling back MinnesotaCare for undocumented Minnesotans.
Rugg and Cernovich’s posts were shared widely and just the start of the disinformation.
Once law enforcement sources began revealing a suspect, right-wing influencers ran with an insignificant detail: That Vance Luther Boelter was a “Walz appointee.”
Like many states, but even more so here, Minnesota is home to hundreds of nonpartisan and bipartisan boards and commissions, which are composed of thousands of people who typically win the appointment by simply volunteering. There are 342 open positions on Minnesota boards and commissions. Boelter was appointed to the Workforce Development Council by Walz’s predecessor Gov. Mark Dayton and reappointed by Walz.
It was the equivalent of calling a Sunday school volunteer an “appointee of the bishop.”
No matter, the Murdoch media machine, specifically the New York Post, had their headline: “Former appointee of Tim Walz sought….”
Cernovich had his greasy foil hot dog wrapper and began constructing a hat:
“The Vice President candidate for the Democrat party is directly connected to a domestic terrorist, that is confirmed, the only question is whether Tim Walz himself ordered the political hit against a rival who voted against Walz’s plan to give free healthcare to illegals.”
Walz had no such plan. He had signed an agreement to end eligibility for undocumented adults.
Joey Mannarino, who has more than 600,000 followers on X, was more crass:
“Rumor has it she was preparing to switch parties. The Democrats are VIOLENT SCUM.”
It was a ridiculous “rumor.” One of the last photos of Hortman alive was an image of her at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor’s big annual fundraising event, the Humphrey-Mondale dinner, which took place just hours before her assassination.
No matter, Cernovich wanted his new friends in federal law enforcement to act:
“The FBI must take Tim Walz into custody immediately.”
Finally, fresh off his humiliating defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump, world’s richest man Elon Musk quote-tweeted someone again falsely alleging Hortman was killed by “the left”  and added:
“The far left is murderously violent.” 
The suspect’s “hit list,” according to an official who has seen the list, comprised Minnesotans who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. CNN reported that it also included several abortion clinics, which doesn’t sound like the work of “the left.”
Right-wing influencers marred Hortman’s death and smeared Walz on a pile of lies.
In a different, saner world, they would be humiliated and slink away. But the smart money is that during the next moment of national crisis and mourning, they will again lie for profit.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Michigan lawmakers are reacting with a mix of sadness, anger and dismay following Saturday’s assasination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband in their home, and the wounding of another lawmaker and his wife.
Vance Luther Boelter, 57, was taken into custody Sunday after authorities named him as a suspect in the killing of Minnesota House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who died Saturday morning after she and her husband were shot and killed in their home in Brooklyn Park, a Minneapolis suburb. 
Boelter is also suspected in the wounding of Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, who were also shot multiple times earlier Friday evening in their home in nearby Champlin.
Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Michigan Gov. Grethen Whitmer, who was the target of a kidnapping and murder plot in 2020, expressed concern for what she called “yet another horrific act” in a continuing cycle of political violence in America. 
“We must call out this violence, no matter who it’s aimed at or where it originates. The loss of State Rep. Hortman and her husband is a tragedy, and we are pulling for the recovery of Sen. Hoffman and his wife. This must stop,” Whitmer posted.
Similar sentiments were expressed by fellow Democrats, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.
“This is a devastating attack on public servants, public service, and our shared values as Americans. We cannot tolerate political violence anywhere in this country and it must be met with the strongest, universal condemnation everywhere and every time,” Nessel said in a press release.
Nessel said her office remains in continuous contact with Michigan State Police and other authorities to assess any potential threats in Michigan. 
“At this time, my department is not aware of any emergent danger in our state related to these shootings. Nonetheless, my office will be in contact with legislative and elected leaders as we navigate this heartbreaking news,” Nessel said. 
Benson, who is also a candidate for governor, posted to social media that those who choose to be public officials, as Hortman and Hoffman did, should not have to fear for their life by simply doing their job. 
“Yet that is what this era of violent rhetoric and threats is producing. The targeted assassinations and assaults in Minnesota are gutting and horrifying. We cannot accept this violence as normal and we all must work to turn down the hate and division that led to these tragedies,” Benson said. 
Also condemning the violent acts was Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), a candidate for governor as well.
“I’m disgusted and heartbroken by the news out of Minneapolis. In this country we settle our political differences at the ballot box, not with violence,” Nesbitt posted on Saturday morning.
Less than two hours later, however, Nesbitt was condemning a display on the Michigan Capitol steps that was posted of the “No Kings” protests taking place across the state and nation in opposition to President Donald Trump’s administration.
“Democrats are displaying a light up ‘86/47’ sign on the steps of the Michigan Capitol for their “No Kings” protest,” Nesbitt posted. “Calling for the President to be assassinated from the steps of our Capitol is grotesque. This is why Democrats lost Michigan.”

— Senator Aric Nesbitt (@SenAricNesbitt) June 14, 2025

State Rep. Jaime Thompson (R-Brownstown) posted a similar sentiment.
86, which is slang for getting rid of something, has been interpreted by MAGA supporters as calling for the assassination of Trump when combined with the number 47, as he is the 47th President. But as The Guardian reported in May, when former FBI Director James Comey was criticized for mentioning the phrase, the Merriam-Webster dictionary declined to endorse that meaning “due to its relative recency and sparseness of use.”
Whitmer was also criticized for using the phrase in 2020, when an “86 45” pin was visible in the background during a virtual appearance on “Meet the Press”. At the time, Trump was the 45th President.
Conspiracy and rhetoric
Also posting about the assassination, although not expressing any condolences or regret, was state Rep. Matt Maddock (R-Milford) who instead leaned into right-wing influencers that have pushed out disinformation about what may have led to the incident.
“The Minnesota Legislature is tied. Hortman was the only House Democrat and Murphy was 1 of 4 Democrat Senators that voted with Republicans Monday to end healthcare for illegals,” Maddock posted.
Undercutting that conspiracy theory was the fact that Hoffman — who was also targeted by the suspect — had voted against rolling back MinnesotaCare for undocumented Minnesotans. 
Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel, who spoke with the Michigan Advance Saturday afternoon, recalled Horton’s commitment to serving the people of her state.
“I met her once before. She was one of the leaders of the Minnesota Values Project and they fought to rebuild the party there, but more importantly build a real progressive movement to make people’s lives better in Minnesota. She was a hell of a public servant, so this is really…it’s just so sad that she would be targeted like this,” Hertel said.
Hertel said the entire incident was “deeply terrifying” for people, but pointed to the rhetoric coming from the White House as of being of particular concern.
“I think we all have to be careful with the way we talk about others. The President likes to stoke the other side of the aisle as the enemy. I see opposition. I disagree with everything they’re doing but there’s a level that you don’t get to and I think when you start demonizing people, this is what happens,” Hertel said.

Measles outbreaks starting in May have grown to 34 cases in North Dakota, giving the state the highest rate in the country, followed by New Mexico and Texas. (Photo courtesy of Visit Fargo-Moorhead)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”
In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
 Outbreak moves north

In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”
Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
 ‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas

According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 13, there are 1,197 confirmed cases affecting 34 states. Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 21 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to reflect new measles statistics released June 13.

Lawmakers want to know why.,"A billboard in Trenton targets absenteeism in schools in the capital city. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey legislators will consider legislation Monday that would establish a statewide task force focused on reducing chronic absenteeism in schools. 
The bill comes as schools across the nation grapple with the lingering effects of the pandemic, which disrupted learning and worsened absenteeism. 
Fifteen percent of students statewide were chronically absent from Garden State schools during the 2023-24 academic year, state data shows. While that’s down from 18% in 2021-22, the state’s chronic absenteeism rate before the pandemic was 10.6% in 2018-19, according to the bill.
Absenteeism is considered chronic when students miss 10% or more of school days in the 180-day academic year. Chronically absent students tend to have more reading difficulties, lower academic achievement, and higher dropout rates.
Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds-Jackson (D-Mercer) is the bill’s prime sponsor and chairs the Assembly education committee, the panel set to mull the measure.
“As a state, we need to have a broad conversation about the reasons behind chronic absenteeism and what can be done to make sure students get the education they need to succeed,” Reynolds-Jackson told the New Jersey Monitor in a statement. “This bill is an important step in bringing the necessary stakeholders to the table to address this critical issue.”
Several marginalized groups have higher rates of chronic absenteeism in New Jersey, including students who are Black or Hispanic, nonbinary, struggling with homelessness, in foster care, or low-income, according to state data. Homeless students were the most disproportionately impacted, with 41% chronically absent in 2023-24, the data shows.
The task force would study root causes of chronic absenteeism, examine the role of mental health and school climate, research best practices elsewhere, and recommend ways to promote family engagement, according to the bill. A report would be due to the governor and legislature six months after the task force convenes.
The Senate unanimously passed the bill earlier this month.

(Getty Images)Senate Enrolled Act 1 (SEA 1) of the 2025 session is the most significant change in local government finance since implementation of the 2008 circuit breaker tax credits.
It will have many long-term policy ramifications on property tax collection, economic development and local government service delivery, most likely creating a realignment of service delivery. However, local income tax changes will be one of the first new policies to have an impact.     
Lower property taxes may come at the expense of higher individual income taxes. SEA 1 offers more options for counties, and some cities and towns, to adopt income taxes to fund local services. People tend to complain less about income taxes because they pay the tax a little at a time through every paycheck. However, from that perspective, it makes them less transparent.  
One of the reasons property taxes are so criticized is because they are paid twice per year.  I suspect if sales tax were collected twice per year for individuals rather than paying at the time of sale, the sales tax would have equal complaints as property taxes. Income taxes are more reflective of a person’s ability to pay and they align closer with the current economic situation. 
Indiana House Republicans OK massive local property, income tax plan that Democrats dub a ‘scam’

From another perspective, the revised local income tax system is more transparent about which unit is establishing the income tax rate and who receives the revenue. More units will have to vote for their income tax rate. For some communities, reliance on income taxes will prove to be less stable as one employer or even one income tax filer may create a substantial reduction in income tax collections.   
The implementation of the property tax circuit breaker credits in 2008 was a legislative reaction to dramatic increases in assessments on homes as the state finished the transition from a cost-based assessed value system to a market-based assessed value system. In 2008, much of the reduction in property taxes was offset with state sales tax. 
Nearly every substantial change to the property tax system has been the result of abnormal increases in the value of houses. If home values had trended at their historic levels from 2020-2024, substantial property tax changes would probably never have been enacted during the 2025 session.  
SEA 1 was also a legislative reaction to dramatic increases in assessments on homes; however, this time the assessed value increases were the result of the historic increased values in the housing market. It is true these values are unrealized gains, but they are gains in property wealth. The assessment and property tax standard set forth by court cases and adopted as policy is an assessment system based upon an objective measure of property wealth.
For local units of government, the offset of revenue reductions on the property tax side for all classes of property; homes, farmland and business personal property taxes will not be solely offset by efficiencies. Such substantial long-term reductions in property tax collections may result in increased individual income taxes. Since most businesses do not pay the local income tax, their property tax cut may be offset by individual income tax increases. It is often claimed businesses simply pass their taxes on to their customers. That may or may not be true, but if it is true, their customers are paying the tax, not all individuals in the county.

For instance, if a boat manufacturer passes the expense of their business personal property tax on to their customers, then the people who purchase boats are paying the expense of the business personal property tax for that company. If reductions to business personal property are offset with local individual income taxes, then every income earner in the county is paying higher taxes to make-up the reduction in the business personal property tax cut for the boat manufacturer.  
Consequently, this may result in the overall tax burden for some individuals being more than their reduction in property taxes.  Also, under SEA 1, non-resident property owners see tax reductions while resident income earners may experience individual income tax increases. Consider a community with “vacation” secondary homes on a lake.  The owners of “vacation” secondary homes do not pay the local income tax but they may receive a property tax cut under SEA 1. 
Relying more on local income taxes to fund local services may be more acceptable to the public than property taxes, but relying on income taxes may come at the expense of overall higher taxes for some individuals.

Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican, speaks during House debate on Feb. 11 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Missouri advocates scored a victory during this year’s legislative session with the elimination of non-disclosure agreements in child sex abuse cases. But the internal politics of the Capitol spelled doom for another high-profile bill seeking to extend the time victims have to file lawsuits. 
It was the third year in a row that legislation to extend the civil statute of limitations for victims of childhood sexual abuse advanced but failed to pass. Proponents blame powerful industry lobbyists and internal politicking for killing a proposal that for years has garnered bipartisan support.  
“I’ve never received a ‘no’ vote on that legislation ever,” said state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican from Branson and the bill’s House sponsor. “So you would think it would just make it straight through the House of Representatives, the Senate and go to the governor’s desk.”
State Sen. Brad Hudson, a Cape Fair Republican who also sponsored the proposal, said he’ll fight for the bill again next year.
“I firmly believe that if we don’t do something about our laws in Missouri,” he said, “we are going to become a sanctuary state for pedophiles.”
 Rep. Brad Hudson, a Republican from Cape Fair (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Victims currently only have until age 31 to file suit, which advocates argue is not long enough, especially because of the often-delayed nature of disclosure. Missouri is one of 18 states where the statute of limitations is set at an age under 35, and dozens of states in recent years have moved to extend or eliminate the statute of limitations for these cases.
​​Seitz pointed to opposition from insurance lobbyists, who argued giving victims more time to sue would increase their liability, and tort reform advocates who oppose expanding the ability to file lawsuits. Seitz’s bill expanding the statute of limitations for childhood abuse claims was eventually added as an amendment to a controversial bill narrowing the statute of limitations on personal injury claims.
“In the Missouri Capitol, there’s a power structure,” Seitz said. “At the top are the lobby groups. Secondarily, the bureaucrats. Thirdly, the leadership of either party. Fourth, the House and Senate. And fifth, the janitor. And that’s the difficulty with getting common sense legislation through, is, does it have lobby backing? Is there lobby money behind it? Is there opposition from a lobby group?”
Seitz believes his bill was added to the more controversial tort reform legislation as leverage to get that measure out of the House, calling it a “political football.”
At the time, lawmakers acknowledged the dynamic. 
“The problem I have with this is the amendment is so good,” said state Rep. David Tyson Smith, a Democrat from Columbia, when Seitz’s bill was added as an amendment in February to the tort reform bill, which was sponsored by Republican state Rep. Matthew Overcast from Ava. “I may have to vote ‘present’ on this because of the great amendment that’s on this. And I know that, probably, there’s a strategy behind that.”
A spokesperson for the Missouri Insurance Coalition said by email that the organization “worked constructively with Representative Seitz to incorporate clarifying language” after concerns were raised in the debate over Overcast’s bill about whether the childhood statute of limitations could be unintentionally affected. 
A spokesperson for the American Tort Reform Association said the group opposed the original legislation because it would’ve retroactively allowed people to file lawsuits that are currently too old to bring under existing law. The group dropped its opposition when that provision was dropped. The negotiated language also would have only raised the statute of limitations by ten years rather than eliminating it entirely. 
Overcast, who sponsored the personal injury statute of limitations bill, declined to answer questions about how his proposal and Seitz’s came to be linked. 
“Rep. Seitz and I agree on many issues, especially when it comes to protecting survivors and ensuring justice,” he said in an email. 
The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry testified against the bill in a Senate committee hearing. A spokesperson declined to comment. 
Seitz said he hopes next year the bill can advance as a standalone measure.
“We’re going to push this forward next year. I want it running as a single issue bill,” he said. “I don’t want it to be a political football to pass someone else’s legislation.” 
Seitz has said the bill was inspired in part by abuse that took place at the Branson-based Kanakuk Kamps.
Kanakuk director Pete Newman pleaded guilty in 2010 to seven counts of sexual abuse, and the prosecutor said Newman’s victim count might be in the hundreds. 
Newman is currently serving two life sentences plus 30 years in prison. 
Kanakuk leadership maintains that they had no advanced knowledge of his behavior, and Newman was a “master of deception.” 
Elizabeth Phillips has been traveling from Texas to advocate for an extension of the childhood sex abuse statute of limitations, along with the bill to void NDAs.
Phillips’ brother, Trey Carlock, reached a settlement with Kanakuk after being abused by Newman, and died by suicide at age 29.
She said she was glad the bill got a Senate hearing this year which felt like “momentum like never before” — but she’ll be traveling back again next year.
“Missouri will have to ultimately decide, and the legislature will ultimately have to decide,” she said, “do they stand with liable institutions who are responsible for the abuse of children, or have been negligent in those cases, or do they want to stand the survivors and get these predators out of their state?”

In March, President Trump signed an executive order under the guise of “restoring truth and sanity to American history by revitalizing key cultural institutions and reversing the spread of divisive ideology.”
In fact, the very opposite is true.
Instead, the executive order is an attempt to erase the factual experiences, treatment and contributions of Blacks, women and others by removing documents and other evidence from the nation’s museums and institutions.
Also, it’s purpose is to revive and glorify military leaders that led the fight to continue the oppression and disenfranchisement of Blacks.
This week as we celebrate Juneteenth  — a federal holiday commemorating the emancipation of Blacks from slavery — it is a good time to reflect on what the removal, and now the impending restoration, of Confederate monuments will or will not mean for our everyday lives.
The removal of some of the Confederate monuments in recent years has not made a difference in making things better:
In closing the great racial divide that is on display all across America. Bigotry, racism, prejudices, disenfranchisement of groups of people based strictly on skin color and economic station in life are still an ugly part of America.
In changing how Blacks are perceived and denied in the workplace.
In stopping how Blacks are treated by police and the criminal justice system, being stopped more often than whites with or without a legitimate reason, and receiving longer and harsher sentences and judgements than whites for the same or lesser offenses. This is commonplace in towns and cities across America.
In eliminating the perpetual education achievement gap where Black children are still locked in poorer inferior schools, where in racially integrated schools they are disciplined and expelled at much higher rates than white children for the same behavior and infractions.
More importantly, removal of Confederate monuments has not erased the ugly history of America they represent.
The bane of racist evilness that still remains is seen in the resurgence and boldness of white supremacy and blatant expressions of racial hatred.
So, what is the priority and purpose of the resurgence to recognize, honor and regale us in such an ugly and destructive time in American history by our president and his administration?
With an administration where so much of what is done with “made for TV” drama and flair, renaming and restoring visible symbols of an inglorious past under the guise of American gallantry is one more act taking center stage.
Displaying and honoring the vestiges of that period in public squares and other public spaces of southern cities, towns and state capitals only serve to make a statement that this part of American history is laudable and something to be proud of.
Proud of the horrible deeds of those men, and the lasting destructive attitudes, laws, and practices that resulted from them.
The resulting Civil War threatened the very existence of this country. What is the purpose of waving the confederate flag instead of or alongside the American flag?
It is long past time that America’s confederate history takes it rightful place within the walls of a national museum or several museums.
The long-standing and appropriate practice has been that American history is preserved in national and local museums where it is accessible to anyone who would like to revisit our past, visit it for the first time, or learn anew the real facts.
The Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest museum, educational and research complex, opened the National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2016. It is being targeted by the Trump administration.
Confederate statutes of generals, documents and other memorabilia belong in museums and designated parks to remind all Americans of a period in this nation’s history that was detrimental, inhumane, ugly and which should never be repeated.
Those reminders need not be destroyed or revered.
As the executive order to purge the collections and displays of historical accounts housed in some of our great museums and institutions is being caried out, will these reminders be recast, white-washed and honored?
The goal should not be to destroy history, but to learn from it.
Isn’t it enough to have lingering vestiges of racial conflict, inequality and oppression prevalent today and still affecting the quality of everyday lives?
It is progress to acknowledge that any period of human enslavement, oppression, servitude, and persecution in a country’s history is, indeed, a shameful and inglorious one.
To deny, disown or ignore it is not only crippling, but defeating.
There is a lot to be concerned about when it comes to these insidious efforts to rewrite the history of America.
We need to make concerted efforts to preserve the facts, major periods and their impact, and to make that information available to future generations.
Future generations need to know the complete American history — the good, the bad, to build a promising future.
Sadly, many American who regale in those times and symbols will likely continue to do so in their hearts and minds.
It begs the question why would any decent, compassionate, ethical, if not God-fearing, person want to honor and revel in such a time with visible, larger than life, reminders.
Only facing this scourge, confronting it, and actively taking the necessary steps to make things better will have lasting meaning.
Sadly, even then, there will be those who will stay stuck in the false sense of racial superiority that is merely a relic of America’s past.
Yes, Confederate flags and monuments are historical relics that too many are trying to preserve not because of their place in America’s history, but in an attempt to determine America’s future.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Law enforcement officers on Sunday night arrested Vance Boelter, who is accused of assassinating Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park as part of a larger plot to kill Democratic elected officials and other advocates of abortion rights.
Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
The arrest comes after a 43-hour manhunt — the largest in state history, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.
At the time of his arrest, Boelter was armed, but ultimately surrendered. Officers did not use any force, said Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger of the Minnesota State Patrol.
In the state’s new Emergency Operations Center in Blaine — which was paid for by legislation passed by Hortman’s DFL-controlled House in 2020 — Gov. Tim Walz thanked law enforcement and decried political violence and hateful rhetoric.
“This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country, and each and every one of us can do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than argue, debate an issue, shake hands, find common ground.”

Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats of violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. He survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. An unsealed criminal complaint indicates that the Hoffmans’ daughter called the police to report the shooting of her parents, the Associated Press reports.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the attacker in a fake law enforcement uniform shoot Mark Hortman through the open front door, according to the complaint. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a cop car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds.
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle. From there, teams from dozens of law enforcement agencies fanned out in search of Boelter.
Boelter was spotted in the area, and officers converged around him, Evans said. He declined to provide some details of the tactics used by law enforcement to capture Boelter.
Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.
“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation…those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.

Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Star Tribune.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Times reported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On Sunday night as leaders spoke to the press, Boelter was being questioned by law enforcement, but officials declined to say where he was detained and which agency was questioning him.
On the steps of the State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

Tim Walz said Sunday that law enforcement agencies had apprehended Vance Boelter, 57, accused of assassinating former Minnesota Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, as well as wounding Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette in two separate attacks on Saturday night as part of a larger plot to kill Democratic elected officials and advocates of abortion rights.

Law enforcement officers on Sunday night arrested Vance Boelter, who is accused of assassinating Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park as part of a larger plot to kill Democratic elected officials and other advocates of abortion rights.
Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
The arrest comes after a 43-hour manhunt — the largest in state history, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.

At the time of his arrest, Boelter was armed, but ultimately surrendered. Officers did not use any force, said Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger of the Minnesota State Patrol.
In the state’s new Emergency Operations Center in Blaine — which was paid for by legislation passed by Hortman’s DFL-controlled House in 2020 — Gov. Tim Walz thanked law enforcement and decried political violence and hateful rhetoric.
“This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country, and each and every one of us can do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than argue, debate an issue, shake hands, find common ground.”

Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats of violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. He survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. An unsealed criminal complaint indicates that the Hoffmans’ daughter called the police to report the shooting of her parents, the Associated Press reports.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the attacker in a fake law enforcement uniform shoot Mark Hortman through the open front door, according to the complaint. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a cop car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds.
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle. From there, teams from dozens of law enforcement agencies fanned out in search of Boelter.
Boelter was spotted in the area, and officers converged around him, Evans said. He declined to provide some details of the tactics used by law enforcement to capture Boelter.
Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.
“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation…those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.

Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Strib.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Times reported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On Sunday night as leaders spoke to the press, Boelter was being questioned by law enforcement, but officials declined to say where he was detained and which agency was questioning him.
On the steps of the State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

Delegates elected  Devin Remiker as chair, a senior advisor to the party who was endorsed by outgoing party chair Ben Wikler. In sessions throughout the weekend state Democrats considered what needs to change for the party to succeed and speakers talked about what Democrats would do if they won a trifecta in state government. 
Remiker chosen in three-way race 
The state party elected Remiker over Joe Zepecki and William Garcia in the race for chair Sunday afternoon. The party used ranked choice voting to choose the winner after  delegates watched a video on how the process worked on Saturday evening.Voting took place the next day. 
Remiker received 485 votes, including 437 first choice votes and 48 second choice votes, putting him over the other candidates. Zepecki, a communications professional, received 415 votes, including 330 first choice and 85 second choice votes and Garcia, chair of the La Crosse County party, received 139 first choice votes, resulting in his elimination in the first round.
“We’ve got a lot of work to do,” Remiker told the convention after he won. “And I want to figure out how we can all work together to best support Democrats in every corner of this state.” 
Remiker, a 32-year-old New Rivers native, will succeed Chair Ben Wikler, who has led the party since 2019 and decided not to run for another term. He most recently served as a senior advisor for the state party, though he’s been involved with the party in various capacities, including as executive director for a time, since 2018. 
Remiker said he was glad that the party was unifying around  a vision to build on what works, which will allow the party to “hit the gas” into 2026 when elections for the state Supreme Court, governor, Congress and the state Legislature take place.

“There is one thing that we can do, and it is elect Democrats at all levels to send a message to Donald Trump and Republicans in this state that we will not stand for their divide and conquer politics any longer. We will win big,” Remiker said. “We are just 18 months away from a trifecta and 18 months away from history. Let’s hit the gas, and when we win, it won’t be an accident. It will be because we put in the work.”
The chair campaign over the weekend 
The candidates for chair spent the weekend working to make their case for the position, including addressing the convention in speeches Saturday evening. During his speech, Remiker said questions about whether Democrats are fighting back and why the party is broken don’t apply in Wisconsin. 
“In Wisconsin, the Democratic party works,” Remiker told the convention. “We don’t need to fix what isn’t broken. We need to build on what works and, folks, we know what works. Success isn’t an accident: year-round organizing, showing up everywhere, fighting tooth and nail in every election — spring, fall, special — taking nothing for granted. Now is not the time to reset. Now is the time to double down.”
Remiker had the support of out-going chair Wikler, who spoke on his behalf as well. During his campaign he also garnered the support of U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore and the Democratic leaders of the state Senate and Assembly.
“It was Devin who made the plan to fight back when Elon Musk came to town. It was Devin who figured out how to make it backfire,” Wikler told the convention on Saturday evening. “He’s brilliant. He’s an organizer. He’s kind. He gets rural. He gets grassroots, and he knows how to fight in a moment when we need a fighter.”
Remiker told reporters Sunday afternoon that he would have won the election even without Wikler’s support. 
“Even prior to that, I had tons of endorsement and public support from around the state from elected officials, party leadership,” Remiker said. “It was just a little added boost as we had it into the final shot.” 
Garcia had made his case to the convention that the party would win a trifecta in 2026 and he would help do that by strengthening the county parties and ensuring they have the tools, resources, information, and training they need to succeed. 
“County parties need the support to welcome new members and organize new voters to the Democratic side,” Garcia said. “Building local parties means talking to voters everywhere and winning votes everywhere… The path to victory is making our community stronger.” 
Garcia also emphasized that he would reach out to young people, a message that resonated with some.
Jasmine Puls, a senior at UW-Green Bay, said Garcia became her top pick because of that. She said he appeared to be meeting with everyone during his Saturday evening event and told her that he would be willing to visit her campus. Each candidate had a “hospitality suite” after the close of business on Saturday where they could speak with delegates. 
Puls said Garcia felt “like he’s the more personal choice, especially for youth voters,” Puls said. She also noted that Remiker’s event felt a little “show-outy.”
“There was like prime rib and everything was like extreme, and we were getting free cups, free drinks, free everything,” Puls said. “It was huge, but it felt like a show and it just didn’t seem real and authentic.”
Asked about how much he spent on his campaign and about the food served at his campaign events, which also included escargot, Remiker said he “spent enough to win” and said the food was part of Wisconsin tradition.
“I was delighted to have a Wisconsin supper club theme at my hospitality suite last night. We did have prime rib, but it was a Saturday night, and that’s a Saturday night special here in Wisconsin,” Remiker said. “I had a ton of fun. It was a great campaign. I’m really proud of the campaign.”

Zepecki, meanwhile, ran a campaign that focused on helping make changes to the party that could help seal gaps he identified as a problem.  As he spoke to the convention, he said Wikler has done a great job strengthening the party, but Trump and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson’s election victories in Wisconsin are proof the party has work to do.
Brenda Vinall-Mogel, a member of the Burnett County party, told the Examiner that Zepecki showing up in her county helped make him her top choice for chair. Zepecki told the convention on Saturday that he traveled 5,000 miles across Wisconsin to listen to people and to make the case for his candidacy.  “We should actually be out in the bars, talking to the people, getting to know them,” Vinall-Mogel said, “asking questions going to the farm days, whatever, and talking to people there and find what their questions are. We need to do a lot of listening.” 
Remiker said that he will help the party work to improve its communications as chair. He said the party specifically needs to be clear that it represents the working class and is working to defend people’s rights and freedoms as well as democracy. 
“We’re going to repeat it in as many mediums as we can and get more messengers that are able to carry that message. The information age kind of divides people’s attention into different groups, into different buckets and niche interests,” Remiker said, adding that Democrats need to work on “connecting the dots about how politics impacts nearly everything in everyone’s lives.”
Wikler preparing to depart as chair
Wikler received major props for his work from elected officials and other Democrats throughout his last convention as chair. Under his leadership, Wisconsin Democrats have won 13 of the last 16 statewide elections under his leadership, flipped the ideological balance of the state Supreme Court and won back seats in the state Legislature after new, fair maps were implemented in 2024. 
“Ben Wikler — what an incredible run!” U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan said. “It is great to be here at the convention of the strongest state political party in the United States of America. Thank you Ben for everything you’ve done.” 
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said Ben has been an “extraordinary leader of this party” and added that she wouldn’t have secured another term in office without the work of him and the party. 
As he opened the convention, Wikler celebrated the “No Kings” protests across the country on Saturday ahead of the convention. Thousands of Wisconsinites and millions of Americans protested against Trump, Wikler noted,  adding that they pushed back against a president who thinks “he is above the law, who arrests judges, including in Wisconsin and members of Congress, including U.S, Senators, who sends Marines into U.S cities, who wants to rip health care from millions of people to hand tens of billions or billions of dollars to his royal courtiers, a man who doesn’t see himself as an elected official, but as a king.” 
Wikler said the party convention is a time for Democrats to reconnect, choose new leaders and train each other for the work ahead, saying that “activism and courage” and “willingness to stand up for what is right” is how he knows the country will survive Trump’s presidency. 
“We will get past these years under a would-be Mad King and tin-pot dictator held in check by Democratic values that President [George] Washington sowed into the fabric of our government,” Wikler said. “The Trump administration will end one day.”
Wikler told the convention during a conversation with Baldwin that he plans to go on vacation with his family after his term ends and is working on developing a pitch for a book that may look at the lessons that can be learned from Wisconsin. He also reassured the room that this won’t be the end of his political involvement. 
“I want to stay involved in the fight,” Wikler said. “We’ll see what that will look like.”
In accordance with the state party’s constitution, the outgoing state party chair remains on the governing body for an additional year.
Wikler told reporters that he “absolutely” wants to help support Remiker and the party in its work to win a trifecta. The last time Wisconsin Democrats held a trifecta was from 2009 to 2010.
“There’s an enormous opportunity for a breakthrough in our state over this next 18 months,” Wikler said. “At the same time, I want to take time with my family, and I’m working on a book proposal… then I’ll figure out how I can be useful.” 
Party members say they’d support Evers running again 
One of Democrats’ goals for 2026 is to maintain control of the governor’s mansion in Wisconsin. 
Gov. Tony Evers is still weighing whether he’ll run for a third term in office, but party members appeared supportive of a third run. 
When Evers addressed the convention, he highlighted the work that he’s done over the last several years and emphasized that the work towards winning in the future has to start immediately.
“Everyone stopped calling me two-term or three-term Tony, and now they just call me 400-year Tony,” he said, referencing his partial veto of the last state budget in 2023 that extended a school revenue increase for 400 years. The State Supreme Court recently ruled the veto was constitutional to the anger of Republicans.
  “Everyone stopped calling me two term or three-term Tony, and now they just call me 400-year Tony,” Evers said at the convention. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)
The crowd broke out into chants of “Tony, Tony, Tony.” 
Evers also chastised the Trump administration and Republicans for being “at work to obliterate our constitutional checks and balances,” and noted that Republicans fired thousands of federal employees and are trying to cut Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.
But he said that Democrats are “raising hell too.” 
“When the Trump Administration tried to gut billions of dollars of federal funding that Congress approved and Wisconsin was counting on for our schools’ health care infrastructure, we sued,” Evers said. “When they tried to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, leaving them and their families in a lurch, we sued them. When they tried to gut AmeriCorps, which would affect the services and communities [in] more than half of Wisconsin’s 72 counties, we sued.” 
Evers’ AmeriCorps lawsuit is part of what makes Puls of UW-Green Bay supportive of a third campaign.
“I really hope that he actually makes some changes, especially because I just lost my job from the AmeriCorps funding cuts,” Puls said. “He promised to help with that and fix things, so I’m really — I’m hoping for the best. I’m hoping that he stays true to his word.” 
Margetta Souder of the Eau Claire County Democratic Party also said Evers needs to run again. 
“[Evers is] one of the better governors we’ve ever had, and I think he’s effective if he’s allowed to do what he does best,” Souder said, adding that flipping the Legislature would help him get things done. “If I were him, I would be depressed because of how much harder he has to work in order to get anything done,” Souder said. “He needs support.” 
Mark Unak, an economist and member of the Milwaukee County Democratic Party, said he also wants Evers to run again, and appreciates that he is a “straight-shooter.” 
“His hands are tied with the Legislature, but what he has done has been good,” Unak said. “He comes out of the education department. He knows what the numbers look like. He knows what the demographics look like, so I think he’s a realist.” 
When it comes to other names that have been thrown around, Unak said he wasn’t sure there was a candidate who could fill Evers’ shoes. 
“No offense to [Lt. Gov.] Sara [Rodriguez] and no offense to [AG] Josh Kaul. I don’t think either of them are strong enough to win as governor,” Unak said. 
Sam Laude, a UW-Green Bay student, said some people have been discussing the issue of Evers’ age. He is 73 and would be 75 at the start of a third term if he were to run and win. He said Democrats have had a trend of older candidates and said former President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 campaign too late. However, he said Evers is still extremely popular and would likely win another term.
“As long as he maintains that energy, he can absolutely go for it,” Laude said. Watching Evers at the convention, he said he  “definitely still had the energy,” adding that he had hundreds of conversations with people waiting in line to talk to him at an ice cream event Saturday evening. “I think he’s still got it and I hope that continues in the future.”
Laude said that if Evers decided not to run, he would want Wikler to run for governor. 
“He deserves a break. Let him hang out with his family this summer, but we do need a presence like Ben Wikler,” Laude said, adding that he has built bridges in the party and thinks his background, including his background as a student at Harvard, would serve him well.
“He’s plenty smart for the position — would be probably more qualified than most Republican governors to be blunt — and does genuinely care about all these big issues that are impacting Wisconsin,” Laude said. “He would support education, health care access, all those things.”
“I’m on Team Tony for a third term,” U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan wrote on social media ahead of the convention. “There is truly no one more quintessentially WI than [Evers]. Bring on the Addam’s Family island of misfit candidates in the GOP. Evers wins because he’s the best for WI.”

Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) told the Examiner that she would support Evers’ decision either way, though she said she would love to see him run. She declined to comment on who she would want to run if Evers decides otherwise, but said there are some “really strong people who are kind of waiting in the wings if he doesn’t want to.” 
“We haven’t seen a Democrat with this high of ratings in a long time. I think he is beloved when he goes out into my district — everybody is so happy to see him. I would love it if he ran for a third term. I also understand if he’s, like, well, you know, I’ve had quite a few years in public service. It’s time to go on,” Emerson said. “The important thing to me is that we get this trifecta next year.”
During his speech, Evers said Republicans “better start getting used to Democrats being in power in the state,” noting that 2026 will be the first time that every member of the Legislature will have had to run under the fair maps he signed into law in 2024.
“With a Democratic trifecta, Wisconsin could expand Badger Care, pass paid family leave, get contaminants out of our water and get our kids and schools the resources they need, and yes, we could finally legalize marijuana,” Evers said to the cheers and whistles from the convention. 
Evers said Democrats need to begin building the foundation to win elections now. 
“We have to win… we’re going to fight like hell to make sure we do because the stakes could not be higher or not,” he said.
Lawmakers eye majorities
A Democratic trifecta would also rely on the party holding the line and making gains in the state Assembly, where Democrats are five seats away from a majority, and in the state Senate, where they are two seats from a majority.
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) appeared confident that Democrats can win the Senate in 2026. Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) did not speak at the convention.
“We will get it done,” Hesselbein said.

Hesselbein said Republicans have been holding the state back from progressing, calling attention to Wisconsin Republicans’ support of enforcing a criminal 1849 law to ban abortion and and their gutting of Evers’ state budget, removing items that would have invested in child care programs, school meals for all and tax exemptions for diapers and over-the-counter medications. 
“When we’re in the majority in the state Senate — and it will happen soon — here’s what the budget will look like. We will put our kids first by finally fully funding our K-12 education… We will make historic investments in the UW and the university system, and we will stop meddling in the colleges and universities. We will make sure that the rich pay their fair share taxes,” Hesselbein said. “That’s just the budget.” 
Hesselbein said Democrats would also work to ensure women have reproductive rights and pass paid medical and family leave. 
Emerson said she thinks the prospect for a majority looks “really, really good for next year.” 
“I’m a perpetual optimist when it comes to elections, though I’ve had my heart broken many times, but I really do think it is within our grasp.” 
Emerson said Democrats could see a boost with Trump in office.
“I think we are gonna see a lot of people who are either only Trump voters and will not come out for a non-Trump election or they’re people who are seeing what’s happening not only in their community but across the country and across the world because of Trump and are saying, ‘nope, not anymore, we’re not going to put up with it,’” Emerson said. 
Emerson said that Democrats are working to actively recruit candidates to run and are focused on holding Republicans accountable and encouraging constituents to do the same. She noted that Democrats have been holding town halls, including in Republican represented areas, as well as working to communicate with people about what is going on in the state Legislature.
Emerson said she has a “whole spreadsheet” of priorities if Democrats win the majorities. She said Democrats are prepared to be  in the majority and are using the current session as a “dress rehearsal” even as they play defense against Republicans. 
“There’s so many [Assembly Bill] ideas out there. For me, I think it really does need to be codify Roe into law,” Emerson said, adding that while there is a lot of chatter about economic policy, the decision on whether someone has a child is an economic decision. “If you’re not in charge of your own body, you really have no freedom at all.” 
Party members respond to attacks on Minnesota lawmakers 
The convention took place right after the apparently politically-motivated assasination of Minnesota Democratic House leader Melissa Hortman and her husband by a man impersonating a police officer. Minnesota Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times prior to Hortman.
The party worked to increase the level of security at the convention after the news broke. 
As Wikler called the convention into order, he said the party was meeting in a time of “shock and grief.” 
“I conveyed our support to leaders in Minnesota for swift justice and for this horror to end now and today, amidst the fear and grief, I want to reaffirm our appreciation, our gratitude for all those who have the courage to serve in public office,” Wikler said.
While talking about the attack, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin mentioned the arrest of her colleague U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla of California, saying both incidents represent attempts to silence people. 
“We will not be silenced,” Baldwin said. “Let’s keep that in our heart, in our minds, in our prayers and let’s carry on in their memories. 
State Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, Hesselbein, and Neubauer released a joint statement about the attacks on Saturday. 
“No one should ever fear for their lives because of their service to their community. Political violence accomplishes nothing, and is never the answer,” the lawmakers stated. “We hope that the assailant is apprehended swiftly.”
During her speech at the convention, Hesselbein said the country and Wisconsin must “resolve political differences with conversation and debate — not at the point of a gun and not with violence.”
Hesselbein said her “heart breaks” for Minnesota colleagues and their families, noting that she is in consistent contact with colleagues all over the county, especially in the Midwest.
“We’re a close-knit community, and we’re trying to keep track and to keep each other safe,” Hesselbein said. “All of us in the Wisconsin Legislature will do what we can to help Minnesota, to help them heal and to prevent this from ever happening again and to continue to seek a safe and respectful world.”
Emerson said the attacks made the convention feel different this year. 
“Any time somebody is targeted for the job that they hold, we’ve failed as a society,” Emerson said. “I was really devastated to see that happen, just like it was really devastating to see the assassination attempt on President Trump last summer, too. None of this should happen and it shouldn’t be a partisan thing.” 
“How do we work really, really hard for our values, while not ostracizing other people, and I think it’s a fine line to walk, but it’s really important. We can argue vehemently about the policies that separate us and the approaches that separate us,” Emerson said. “But in the end, I really, truly, believe that all 99 Assembly people and all 33 Senators are doing what they do because they think that their approach makes Wisconsin a better place.”

Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark at their home in Brooklyn Park as part of a larger plot to kill Democratic elected officials and other advocates of abortion rights.
Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
The arrest comes after a 43-hour manhunt — the largest in state history, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.
At the time of his arrest, Boelter was armed, but ultimately surrendered. Officers did not use any force, said Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger of the Minnesota State Patrol.
In the state’s new Emergency Operations Center in Blaine — which was paid for by legislation passed by Hortman’s DFL-controlled House in 2020 — Gov. Tim Walz thanked law enforcement and decried political violence and hateful rhetoric.
“This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country, and each and every one of us can do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than argue, debate an issue, shake hands, find common ground.”

Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats of violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. He survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. An unsealed criminal complaint indicates that the Hoffmans’ daughter called the police to report the shooting of her parents, the Associated Press reports.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the attacker in a fake law enforcement uniform shoot Mark Hortman through the open front door, according to the complaint. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a cop car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds. [Editor’s note: Click here to learn more about Melissa Hortman and here to learn about her husband, Raleigh native Mark Nortman.]
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle. From there, teams from dozens of law enforcement agencies fanned out in search of Boelter.
Boelter was spotted in the area, and officers converged around him, Evans said. He declined to provide some details of the tactics used by law enforcement to capture Boelter.
Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.

“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation…those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.
Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Strib.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Times reported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On Sunday night as leaders spoke to the press, Boelter was being questioned by law enforcement, but officials declined to say where he was detained and which agency was questioning him.
On the steps of the State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

Elizabeth Caruso of Caratunk speaks at a press briefing sponsored by the Republican party in the State House in Augusta to support proposed bills that would restrict transgender rights on May 8, 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)After hours of debate, both chambers of the Maine Legislature took initial votes to reject most attempts to restrict the rights of transgender students to use bathrooms, locker rooms, names and pronouns aligning with their gender identity. 
But one bill that prohibits trans girls from playing on girls teams narrowly passed the House of Representatives on Friday.
That means most protections for trans students — including preserving gender identity as a protected class in state law —are expected to remain intact. Of eight total anti-trans bills, five were rejected by both chambers as of Friday evening. Those bills included broad restrictions, including what school facilities students could use, what names and pronouns they can go by at school and whether gender identity should remain a protected class under the Maine Human Rights Act. 
But late Friday the majority of House lawmakers, including a handful of Democratic state representatives, backed LD 233, which would ban trans girls from girls sports. That bill, introduced by Rep. Richard Campbell (R-Orrington), was the only trans athlete bill this session that did not also propose restrictions on bathrooms and locker rooms.
Maine’s protections allowing trans girls to compete in girls’ sports has put Maine in the national spotlight, since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. The U.S. Department of Justice is currently suing the state over what it says are violations of Title IX, which protects against discrimination in schools. 
‘This is about more than sports’: The real stakes for trans athletes

During floor debates, lawmakers pointed to that federal scrutiny, with those in support of the bills questioning whether the state’s inclusive policies were fair to all students and, in particular, cisgender girls. Many argued that these bills were not intended to punish trans students, but to bring fairness to athletics and preserve girls’ spaces. 
Critics of the bills reiterated the harms caused by excluding or marginalizing trans youth, particularly when depriving them of opportunities to participate on team and other affirming spaces, when they are already more likely than their cis peers to face bullying and exclusion. Some lawmakers also pointed out the increased scrutiny of all girls, cis and trans, that the bills invite.
One of three trans athlete bills approved by the House
After receiving notice that Maine was in violation of the Trump administration’s interpretation of federal law for allowing trans girls to play on girls’ sports teams in March, the Maine Attorney General’s Office pushed back, though flagged two bills — LD 233 and LD 868 — which the federal government said it would pay attention to. 
Four Democrats voted in favor of LD 233: Reps. Stephan Bunker of Farmington, Wayne Farrin of Jefferson, Dani O’Halloran of Brewer and David Rollins of Augusta. O’Halloran and Farrin both said they were concerned about fairness in high school sports, citing unfair advantages they believe trans girls have over their cis teammates. 
“To be clear, I have no tolerance for bullying and hate or exposing children to public ridicule and harm. Every child deserves to be supported and respected,” O’Halloran said. “But we also need to recognize that allowing trans athletes on all girls sports teams gives trans athletes an advantage that they would not otherwise have. And to me, this is not fair.”
Farrin said Maine should evaluate whether trans girls can play on girls teams on a case-by-case basis, which was the policy of the Maine Principals Association before gender identity was explicitly added as a protected class under the Maine Human Rights Act in 2021. Between 2013 and 2021, there were 56 such hearings, including four with trans girls, according to public testimony the association submitted in 2023. All 56 cases were deemed fair and safe.
“With respect to transgender girls participating in Maine sports, there is nothing new to see here,” said Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, who during the public hearing heard more than 12 hours of testimony, overwhelmingly in support of trans inclusion. 
Citing the Maine Principals Association policy, she said, “This has been the express practice in our state for many years, and I would further submit that it appeared for a long time to proceed without any real discord.”
The other measure the Trump administration is keeping its eye on, LD 868, would also ban trans girls from school girls restrooms and changing rooms. That bill was narrowly rejected by the House with a 72-71 vote. 
Both measures will go before the Senate this week. 
An additional bill (LD 1134) that combined restrictions on trans athletes with use of school facilities was rejected by the Senate on Thursday, with the House following suit on Friday with a 73-72 vote.
“Here we are debating a piece of legislation that would empower adults to scrutinize, interrogate and exclude young women from their own school community simply for being who they are,” said Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) during floor discussion on LD 1134.
 “Trans girls are not a threat to high school sports. They’re not a threat to anyone. There are children who want to play, who want to compete, who want to be part of a team.”
Transgender teens and allies crowd State House to fight anti-trans bills

Bills proposing broader restrictions in schools now dead
Both the Maine House and Senate rejected another bill, LD 1704, that specifically bans school districts from adopting policies that allow students to use bathrooms aligned with their gender identity. House Minority Leader Katrina Smith (R-Palermo), who sponsored the bill, spoke in favor of several of the proposed restrictions, saying they would protect cisgender girls. 
“We cannot sacrifice the many for the few who are struggling with identity,” she said about the need for LD 1704, which was rejected in the House by a 74-74 vote and in the Senate 20-12.
The question of bathroom use has been settled law in Maine since at least 2014, Kuhn said, pointing to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court decision in Doe v. Clenchy, which ruled that an Orono school violated the Maine Human Rights Act when it did not allow a trans girl to use a bathroom consistent with her gender identity. 
“I would also add that data show that in fact it is transgender people who are more in danger in bathrooms and locker rooms, not their cisgendered peers,” Kuhn added. “This bill seeks to impose restrictions that are in conflict with an inclusive school environment, in violation of current law and will undoubtedly subject Maine to costly litigation.”
Another similar bill, LD 1337, was rejected by the House and has not yet been considered by the Senate. 
Legislation that would impose limits on what names and pronouns students could use in school also failed both chambers on Friday. Rep. Sheila Lyman (R-Livermore Falls), who sponsored the measure, said LD 1002 was about parental rights. 
“This bill keeps parents informed. This is about trust, transparency and parental rights,” she said. “It does not target or exclude anyone.” 
The measure was rejected by House with a 76-71 vote, and in the Senate 20-12.
Maine Human Right Act, gender affirming care remain intact
A proposal (LD 1432) to remove gender identity as a protected class in the Maine Human Rights Act was defeated by the largest margin of all the anti-trans measures in the House, with 81 representatives voting in favor of preserving the status and 65 opposed. A handful of Republicans voted against the bill, including Reps. Nathan Carlow of Buxton, Robert Foley of Wells, and Kenneth Fredette of Newport.
Rep. Matt Moonen (D-Portland) called the proposal a “wild, extreme overreach.”
“I urge people, even if they have points of genuine disagreement on the issue of sports, to recognize this bill for how bad it is and how horrifying it would be to go back to legalizing employment discrimination and housing discrimination and on and on,” he said. A similar measure was signed into law in Iowa in February.
Legislation rolling back protections for young people to seek gender-affirming care was also rejected by the House on Friday with a 75-72 vote after the Senate turned it down the previous night.  
LD 380 would no longer allow minors that are at least 16 years old to consent to gender-affirming care, which can include a wide range of services, including hormone therapy and counseling.
Republicans in favor of the bill argued that 16- and 17-year-olds are too young to make decisions about transitioning. 
“All I’ve heard from the other side is that minors’ brains are not developed enough for gun ownership, not for marriage, and not for a punishment that should fit their crime,” Smith said. “But we come back to this issue that says 16- and 17-year-olds should be able to choose — without parental approval — hormone replacement therapy.”
Kuhn responded that while it is “best when young people are able to confer with adults in their life about important health care decisions,” she noted that “for some people, that is not a safe thing to do, and in fact, can result in abuse, neglect, even being forced into homelessness.”
“It was for this very small group of young people that this law sought to provide a pathway for help, because for these kids, gender affirming care can literally be life saving, and the repeal of this law would put those kids at risk,” Kuhn added.

[…]","U.S. Senator James Lankford speaks at a remembrance ceremony on April 19 on the 30th anniversary of the Murrah Building bombing in Oklahoma City. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)It’s become clear that Oklahoma’s U.S. Sen. James Lankford has apparently taken one too many sips of the spiked, D.C.-flavored Kool-Aid.
He’s either become so addicted to the ambrosia served by the Washington elites, or he’s been spending too much time cocooned in our nation’s capital to be in touch with what’s happening at home.
Because it’s clear there’s a disconnect between the Republican Medicaid propaganda he’s been spouting and the stark reality of Oklahoma’s insurance and health care systems.
Earlier this month, Lankford conducted a CNBC interview where he decided to bring up congressional Republicans’ planned changes to Medicaid that, as he put it, “everyone is going crazy over.”
Lankford was referring to the U.S. House of Representatives’ budget bill that institutes complex work reporting requirements for lower-income individuals who received health insurance coverage as part of our state’s expansion of Medicaid coverage. Oklahomans voted in 2020 to expand access to the insurance program, which relies on federal-state matching dollars, to provide health care coverage to Oklahomans ages 19 to 64 who made less than $17,800 a year as an individual, or families of four who make less than $36,600 a year.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this new work requirement would affect 18.5 million adults nationally.
The measure also allows states to implement more stringent work requirements and verification checks and disenroll people who don’t comply.
Lankford, who makes an annual salary of $174,000 and receives access to a nice package of federal health benefits, of course, couldn’t resist showing how tone deaf he is to the Oklahomans back home who are struggling to make ends meet or can’t afford health insurance.
He told CNBC that it’s “just a work requirement.”
“People are screaming and saying, ‘Hey it’s kicking people off Medicaid.’ It’s not kicking people off Medicaid, it’s transitioning from Medicaid to employer provided health care,” Lankford said. “So yes, we’ve got 10 million people that are not going to be on Medicaid, but then they are going to be on employer provided health care. We think that’s a better option for the taxpayer, and quite frankly, for their families as well.”
Lankford conveniently forgot to mention that slightly less than half of Oklahoma private sector businesses offered health insurance to their employees in 2023, according to an analysis by KFF, which provides nonpartisan health policy research. The 2023 number, the most recent available, does not factor in government-provided insurance or unincorporated private businesses whose owners report their income as part of their personal taxes. 
But that still leaves half of Oklahoma employers that don’t offer that insurance.
So where does Lankford expect those people to get their employer-provided insurance? Surely, he’s not suggesting that employees flee their current jobs and hold out for jobs that provide it.
A party that champions limited government isn’t planning to force private employers to begin offering it or to boost salaries to ensure increased uptake, is it? Is he offering to share his federal health package with the masses?
After long resisting calls to expand Medicaid, our state found itself with some of the worst health outcomes in the nation, thanks in part to hundreds of thousands of Oklahomans who made too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to afford private insurance.
Voters’ decision to expand Medicaid to include our working poor was a move to change our health care outcomes ranking for the better.
A little more than a year after expanding Medicaid access, over 280,000 Oklahomans had signed up.
Prior to Medicaid expansion, Oklahoma’s uninsured rate reached about 14.4%. That rate dropped to 11.4% in 2023. Still, Oklahoma ranked 48th in its number of insured. Massachusetts, which has the lowest rate, had just 2.6% of residents uninsured.
Out of 77 Oklahoma counties, 75 are classified as health professional shortage areas. Those are areas where there are at least 3,500 patients for every provider. Our state ranks 48th for physician supply, 46th for primary care physician access, and 47th for general surgeons, according to the Cicero Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute.
So I’m not 100% sure why Lankford would want Oklahoma’s uninsured rates to get even worse. Because they will worsen.
Adding work requirements probably will remove people from the federal Medicaid expansion roles, but at what cost to our state?
So, yeah, everyone “going crazy over” Congress’ proposed work requirements can read the writing on the wall.
Perhaps Congress should fix the underlying issues that are plaguing our health care system before promoting policies designed to increase our nation’s uninsured rates. 
If we can fix the health care system, perhaps then we’ll all benefit from lower costs and maybe fewer people will need to utilize a government program.

State lawmakers will also consider repealing a controversial coal carbon capture mandate, citing costs to ratepayers.
The post Trump cancels $49M Wyoming coal carbon capture project appeared first on WyoFile .","Both the Trump administration and Wyoming lawmakers appear to be losing enthusiasm for advancing research and seeding commercial-scale carbon capture at existing coal-fired power plants — a key component of Gov. Mark Gordon’s coal-inclusive “decarbonizing” energy strategy.
The U.S. Department of Energy in May cancelled some $3.7 billion in federal grants to support “clean energy” demonstration projects across the nation, including $49 million for a “large-scale” carbon capture pilot project at the Dry Fork Station coal-fired power plant north of Gillette.

Gordon has hailed the mandate, also known as “Low-Carbon Energy Standards,” as an important tool in his “best-of-all-of-the-above” energy strategy, as well as his “Decarbonizing the West” initiative, which touts the importance of keeping coal-burning power plants open by retrofitting them with carbon capture technologies. 
But the state law doesn’t appear likely to produce a carbon capture retrofit anytime soon, Wyoming lawmakers noted, though ratepayers in the state have already paid millions of dollars to support technical feasibility studies imposed by the mandate.

“It just reminds me of the expression, ‘Look what we’ve done to ourselves,'” said Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp, who sponsored a bill earlier this year to repeal the mandate. The measure failed. 
“I have a concern,” Knapp added, “that we’re continuing to implement something that does nothing but increase the rates of our ratepayers, No. 1, and drives up the price of coal-fired power, which then does lead to [shifting from coal to new power source investments] such as nuclear or wind and solar.”
Electric utilities Black Hills Energy and Rocky Mountain Power, the only two Wyoming coal plant operators subject to the mandate, have indicated it could cost between $500 million and $1 billion to retrofit just one of several coal units subject to the state law. Wyoming ratepayers would be on the hook to cover those costs, according to the utilities and state officials.
The utilities have collected about $5 million from Wyoming ratepayers to comply with the law, according to the Wyoming Office of Consumer Advocate. And that’s just for coal carbon capture feasibility studies, without the promise of an actual retrofit. Of the $5 million, the consumer advocate is asking state regulators to order Rocky Mountain Power to refund $3.7 million to its customers.
If not in Wyoming, then where?
TDA Research, which saw its $49 million federal grant cancelled last month, has tested its “membrane and solid sorbent” carbon capture technology since 2022 at the Wyoming Integrated Test Center, co-located at Dry Fork Station.
The company proposes to tap into the plant’s “flue gas,” or smokestack, to scrub carbon dioxide, potentially capturing about 90% of the gas that would otherwise stream into the atmosphere, according to a TDA description of the project. The hope is to demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology that so far has eluded coal power plant operators.

The Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations awarded $49 million to support the project in August, and TDA announced it would begin construction of the facility in 2027.
TDA did not respond to WyoFile’s inquiries about the project’s future.
The pilot project was perhaps among the most promising for existing coal plants because it would be attached to Dry Fork Station — one of the nation’s newest coal plants designed to potentially incorporate post-combustion carbon capture systems, said University of Wyoming Associate Professor of Economics Rob Godby.
“Dry Fork has been identified in different studies as the lowest-cost plant in the country to attempt this technology,” Godby told WyoFile. “If it won’t work here, where will it work?”
Regardless of the fate of TDA’s project, several more carbon capture research and commercialization efforts are ongoing at Dry Fork and the Integrated Test Center, said Christine Reed, outreach director for the University of Wyoming’s School of Energy Resources, which oversees the test center.
“It is unfortunate that the TDA pilot project was cancelled, but there is still ample opportunity for carbon capture technologies to continue testing at the ITC,” Reed told WyoFile via email. “The [Integrated Test Center] plays an important role in allowing companies to scale up their projects, and there is still potential for others to utilize the facility for testing in the future.”

Gordon said the culmination of public and private research partners at the Wyoming test center have successfully brought down the cost of the technology’s commercial-scale implementation. He noted that Kawasaki Heavy Industries successfully tested another coal carbon capture technology at the Integrated Test Center, which is now being deployed at a coal plant in Japan.
“Both Taiwan and Japan, while they both think they’re going to have about 20% of their portfolio made up of coal, they’re still committed to being able to get carbon credits and being carbon neutral by 2050,” Gordon told WyoFile. “The reason why Japan, and the reason why Taiwan are so interested in coming to Wyoming is because of our decarbonizing efforts. They see that as a way they can meet their climate goals. We’re just trying to make ourselves more relevant in the marketplace.”
Shifting political attitudes
While the Trump administration and GOP-supermajority Wyoming Legislature desperately want to “save coal,” their preferred strategy appears to diverge from a market-based approach championed by. Gordon.
Regardless of federal policies that seesaw between presidential administrations, markets demand energy that emits less greenhouse gas, Gordon has said. Scrubbing carbon from coal, according to the governor, is vital to keeping it in the nation’s energy mix — whether his constituents embrace the need to address human-caused climate change or not.
“We were trying to extend the life of coal, and we may be shortening it because we put this [mandate] out there and we’re forcing our utilities into a corner.”Rep. Scott Heiner
“It is important that we acknowledge that, if the concern is about CO2 emissions in our atmosphere, then our focus must be on CO2 more broadly, not just curtailing the use of fossil fuels,” Gordon wrote in the introduction of his Western Governors’ Association Decarbonizing the West report last year.
Though Gordon has cheered the Trump administration’s promise to “reinvigorate” U.S. coal and its strategy to slash federal regulations, it’s still a question whether the White House will embrace his message that commercializing coal carbon capture is a vital tool in making coal more “marketable” to states and customers with low-carbon energy standards. The Department of Energy cited economic savings “in the best interest of the American people” when it announced cancelling the $3.7 billion carbon capture effort established under the Biden administration. The two dozen projects, including the one at Dry Fork, “did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to sustain DOE’s investment,” the agency stated.
Yet, Wyoming’s years of leadership in advancing coal carbon capture technology have helped bring down the cost of commercializing it, Gordon said.

“Wyoming wanted to provide the laboratory to be able to test these theories and, at the same time, to make sure that our [coal] production stays here,” Gordon told WyoFile. 
Though the 2020 Wyoming Legislature established the HB 200 coal carbon capture mandate, several lawmakers — particularly those in the Freedom Caucus — have been building a case to repeal it in recent years. In addition to Knapp’s failed House Bill 209, “Carbon capture mandate-repeal,” Torrington Sen. Cheri Steinmetz also introduced a measure earlier this year. Senate File 92, “Make carbon dioxide great again-no net zero,” would not only have repealed the mandate, but it would have done so with the declaration that carbon dioxide emissions from coal are beneficial to the environment.
“We’re almost back to 15 years ago when the argument [was] that carbon capture is a waste of money, especially if you don’t believe climate change is occurring,” UW’s Godby said. “It took so long for the state to get over that hurdle to say, ‘Even though I don’t think climate change is necessarily being caused by human action, the markets do, and that’s why we should invest in this and try to preserve our coal assets.'”
The push to repeal Wyoming’s coal carbon capture mandate, Gordon said, mostly comes from the Freedom Caucus. “They’re trying to set it up as an us-against-them kind of effort,” Gordon said. “I don’t know if they’re purposely mischaracterizing or they’re trying to stir up something.”
But the point of the mandate, Gordon added, is to tell coal plant operators in Wyoming, “before you go and unilaterally shut down a coal plant, you’ve got to look at this, because that technology is coming along.”
Though the premise of advancing coal carbon capture has always been more of a long-term preservation strategy for the industry, some Wyoming lawmakers find it difficult to continue to justify passing the costs on to ratepayers and their constituents — particularly since some coal units in Wyoming have been converted to natural gas rather than being slated for a carbon capture retrofit.
“Maybe, because this is an additional expense on our coal-fired power plants, this is having unintended consequences [of] driving our power plants to be converted from coal to natural gas,” Green River Republican Rep. Scott Heiner said, noting recent coal-to-natural gas conversions. “We were trying to extend the life of coal, and we may be shortening it because we put this [mandate] out there and we’re forcing our utilities into a corner.”
The Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee will discuss draft legislation to repeal the mandate when it meets July 29-30 in Casper.

Lou Ann Linehan and Rob Clements in unveiling a proposal to reduce local property taxes over three years. July 18, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen isn’t wavering from his goal to secure more property tax relief for Nebraskans, and he’s not significantly modifying his strategy of pushing for a broadened sales tax to pay for it after a similar approach failed a third straight time.
Pillen said he will keep the conversation alive for state government to take on the annual operational funding of all of Nebraska’s 245 public school districts, but not to run them. Local school boards would retain property tax authority for bonds and construction projects, for example, a route that Pillen said would require decreased state spending on other budget priorities and a broadened sales tax base.
“We’re going to be bold and courageous and work hard to get 33 votes to get there,” Pillen said in a post-session interview with the Nebraska Examiner, noting the legislative threshold needed to overcome an anticipated filibuster.

The governor’s approach mirrors the shift the Legislature approved in 2023 that moved community colleges largely off the property tax rolls and onto income and sales taxes. The move led to a property tax decrease of $6 million last year after two years of nearly $300 million annual increases. Local governments annually collect about $5.3 billion in property taxes.
All property taxes are locally assessed and collected, and the state has created tax credits to offset those costs, which were greatly expanded in 2020.
Freshman State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, a rural Republican, has argued the tax credits are “feeding the demon” of increased local spending over time and taking away accountability from local taxing authorities. She previously served as a Cherry County commissioner.
Sales tax expansion stalls
This April, Pillen pledged to keep property taxes flat after this year’s special session, saying the work would be done, “not a shadow of a doubt.” But he fell at least $100 million short of what it would have taken to accomplish that goal in the face of a major projected budget deficit.
This spring was the third time a sales tax push had failed in the most recent legislative sessions. All three times, a handful of Republicans joined most Democrats to oppose the changes.
In spring 2024, lawmakers abandoned an initial across-the-board sales tax rate increase and then withdrew a push to apply sales taxes to some currently tax-exempt goods or services.
In summer 2024, lawmakers came back for a rare special session dedicated to property tax relief but didn’t repeal a single sales tax exemption in the face of opposition.
In spring 2025, lawmakers found too little support for removing a single sales tax exemption.
Sales tax, tobacco tax push doom Nebraska’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ for property tax relief

That means property taxes will increase when assessed this December, Pillen acknowledged.
Services currently exempt from sales taxes that have been considered for taxing include lobbying, marketing, dating services, swimming pool cleaning or maintenance and limousine services.
One silver lining for property taxpayers this session was the formation of a School Financing Review Commission for long-term school funding reform, which could lead to future reform proposals.
‘Eyeball-to-eyeball conversations’
While lawmakers have the ultimate say on new legislation, Pillen has made property taxes a defining issue of his tenure. He’s taken his pitch to Nebraska communities and has been blunt.
“If you don’t want to call, then don’t b— to me next year about it. If you don’t want to help, s—, I can’t do it all myself. I need everybody’s help. If you don’t want to call senators, then don’t b— to me next year. I’m working day and night,” Pillen said at a town hall in Fremont last June.
In mid-2024, Pillen hosted 26 property tax community forums from Scottsbluff to Auburn. He also organized a group of 17 lawmakers for an informal working group on property taxes, more than one-third of the Legislature.

State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who also faces reelection in 2026, is continuing efforts to lower school property taxes. She led the new school finance commission at Pillen’s request.
Hughes plans to introduce new legislation next year related to school property tax levies.
Pillen told the Examiner that broadening the sales tax base can be the right approach. He points to South Dakota as a model, which has a broad tax base, much lower property taxes and no income taxes. He joked that Mount Rushmore isn’t printing that tax revenue.
While opponents view the sales tax push as a “tax shift,” Pillen argues the true shift has been the lost sales tax revenue making its way to property taxes — what he calls “foolery.”
So what will change in Pillen’s approach? More one-on-one conversations with lawmakers.
“We are going to sit down, have eyeball-to-eyeball conversations, and if I’m wrong, somebody’s gotta convince me, and I gotta do a better job,” Pillen said.
‘We don’t play politics’
Among the first steps of those conversations is defining what a “tax cut” is, Pillen said, because a fix must come now, not in “X years.”
“We’re not going to give up until we do,” Pillen said.

As Pillen eyes reelection for another four-year term in 2026, he says that his goal for Nebraska by 2030 is to put the state in a strong position, with property taxes fixed. He says he’ll remain focused on his four tenets, “kids, taxes, agriculture and values,” which he said with a laugh: “I’m not smart enough to create new.”
“There’s a lot of work around those four that continue on,” Pillen said, asking who could have thought an issue to tackle this year would be curbing all-day cellphone use by Nebraska’s K-12 students.
Pillen’s 2026 reelection message: “We’ve done what we said we’d do.”
“We’re not afraid to stand up and [say], ‘Hey, we’ve got to talk about God, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.’ It’s important that we protect blue. It’s important we talk about our Second Amendment rights,” Pillen said.
Pillen said he’s also not afraid to admit mistakes, such as first rejecting a pandemic-era expanded summer food aid program for children in late 2023 that he later accepted in spring 2024.
Pillen said he and his team are “just getting started.”
“We don’t play politics,” Pillen said. “We do what we believe is right, and that’s what Nebraska wants.”

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Mitch Carmichael, the former secretary of economic development in West Virginia, is spearheading a new ad campaign urging President Donald Trump to preserve energy tax credits that he says are vital to creating jobs and growing business in West Virginia.
The clean energy tax credits in question were enacted by Congress under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The U.S. House of Representatives voted last month, while considering the massive government spending bill, to cut them. West Virginia Republican Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore both voted in support of the bill.
The budget bill is now being considered by the U.S. Senate, where the energy tax credits have been central to conversations and debate. If the bill in its current form is passed, billions of dollars in incentives for clean energy and alternative energy projects in communities across the country would come to an end, potentially taking thousands of jobs along with them.
Carmichael is working on the new campaign as the executive director of Built For America, a group recently formed specifically to advocate for and protect the energy tax credits. He said the organization decided to target Trump with its message instead of Congress because he is “certain” that the president will understand where the group is coming from.
“We believe that Donald Trump will do the right thing and will see the commonsense here,” Carmichael said. “These tax incentives represent basically the quintessential American Dream: Companies and individuals doing something well, investing in communities, and being rewarded for that. We believe that he will agree.”
Environmentally focused advocacy groups have been sounding the alarms regarding potential cuts to the tax credits for months, warning that — if they end — businesses, communities, consumers and the environment will be worse off.
“We’re not coming at this from a climate ideology,” Carmichael said. “We are focusing on how these tax credits are job makers, they’re essential to growing the manufacturing industry [in places like West Virginia] and they’re based on real, actualized outcomes — not politics.”
The credits at risk give companies incentives to either start new projects based around clean energy or convert current energy sources into clean energy, like solar, wind, geothermal and more. They also provide direct benefits to consumers through credits for buying electric vehicles or installing solar panels on a home.
Carmichael said in West Virginia these credits have already been instrumental in recruiting investments from companies for large manufacturing projects. Specifically, he pointed to the Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company project in Ravenswood, where a solar microgrid is powering the manufacturing of titanium products, and the Form Energy’s iron air battery manufacturing site in Weirton.
The Berkshire Hathaway project represented a $500 million investment in the Jackson County town. In Weirton, 300 people are currently employed at the Form Factory 1. 
“Those investments happened in large part because of these tax credits,” Carmichael said. “We need more companies like this and we need more projects like this. These incentives help us make that happen.”
Carmichael, who also served as the state Senate president from 2017-2021, was clear that the point of these projects is not to “put coal [or natural gas] out of business.” Instead, he said, the investments allow the state to diversify its economy by exploring and inviting in industries previously not here.
And those industries, Carmichael said, create jobs — something he knows firsthand is difficult to do in the state.
In one of his first acts as governor in January, Patrick Morrisey announced his plans for a “Backyard Brawl” to make West Virginia economically and financially competitive with surrounding states. Though that plan so far has largely included cutting taxes and “red tape” in the hopes of incentivizing businesses to locate in West Virginia, Morrisey said in January that energy infrastructure will be core to the initiative.
This legislative session, a critical piece of legislation was passed to introduce a new industry — data centers — into the state.
House Bill 2014 created a certified microgrid program within West Virginia state code. Under the law, data centers will be allowed to form microgrids to generate their own power instead of hooking up to already existing utilities. Initially, the bill required that the microgrids be powered through renewable energy. But a change to the bill during session opened that up to any form of energy, including coal and natural gas.
The bill — and the new tax structure created within it for the distribution of taxes collected on such sites — have been somewhat controversial. Residents in places like Tucker County, where a natural gas-powered data center is proposed, are upset that the legislation allows private companies to completely disregard local zoning ordinances, robbing them of any chance they’d have to protect their community from the worst consequences of industrial sites.
But Carmichael said he was excited to see what’s accomplished under the law. He said opportunities to grow the state’s economic resources is a good thing, and the tax credits would help to incentivize such growth.
“We all know what can be possible in West Virginia,” Carmichael said. “These tax credits make it so these large companies have more of a reason to look to us when they’re trying to grow their businesses. That’s what we need here.”

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


Those classes range from a lesson on indigenous foods in the Americas, a self-portrait project inspired by Frida Kahlo — the “queen of the selfie” — and a workshop about the Chicano social justice movement in Denver. It’s the type of instruction that teachers might not have the time, materials or expertise to give their students.
“It creates a sense of belonging for most of the Latino students, but also for those who are not, it brings a piece of cultural understanding,” Claudia Moran, the museum’s executive director, said. “It can open that communication when there is a cultural disconnection.”
The curriculum of these cultural workshops, Moran said, needs to be updated to better reflect current state education standards and community needs. The museum explored funding options to hire an educational consultant over the last four years, and was finally awarded a $59,000 grant from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services last year.
But now that work is in jeopardy after actions from President Donald Trump to shutter IMLS, threatening the federal funding museums and libraries often rely on to advance their operations and research.

Congress created IMLS in 1996 and it has been reauthorized by every president since then, including Trump during his first term.
Trump then issued an executive order in March that essentially dismantled IMLS, along with six other entities, including the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Minority Business Development Agency and the United States Agency for Global Media. The order justified the attempted dissolution as a “reduction in the elements of the Federal bureaucracy that the President has determined are unnecessary” and was directed by the formerly Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
After the order, the entire IMLS staff was placed on leave.
But in early May, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction on the order — as part of a lawsuit Colorado joined — and instructed IMLS to restore staff and grants across the country. That has generally been happening, according to a May 20 status report from the administration.
The result is that for many museum grant recipients, including Museo, they were notified of their grant termination in March and then advised of the preliminary injunction and reinstatement in May. Theoretically, they should be able to pull down reimbursement funds from their grant, but the situation has created a sense of uncertainty.
“We’re in a little bit of a tricky situation where I’m not quite sure how much we can actually do without the confidence that we would be reimbursed for the work,” said Jennifer Neale, the director of research and conservation at the Denver Botanic Gardens.
Institutions across Colorado were awarded about $4.3 million in IMLS grants, most of which require matching funds from the museum or library, for the current fiscal year. That ranges from about $3.2 million to the Colorado Department of Education to increase access to library services in the state to about $23,000 to the Broomfield Veterans Museum to create a new digital display about local veterans. It includes $25,000 for the Western Museum of Mining and Industry to design a new exhibit about non-white miners, about $250,000 for the Denver Art Museum to study and implement accessibility prototypes, and over $330,000 for History Colorado to expand its digitized, online collections for students.

The grants often target projects that are difficult to fund, Neale said. A nearly $250,000 grant at the Botanic Gardens, for example, is intended to advance a conservation effort for alpine ecosystems in North America. The money was meant to help the garden purchase a seed X-ray machine, hire developers for an online database and pay for seed collection in often-remote parts of the alpine ecosystem.
“At the Botanic Gardens, our mission is to connect people with plants. And we do that, broadly, by trying to help understand the biodiversity around us and how to conserve it and preserve it,” Neale said. “It might not have a super obvious economic value, there is economic value to it in terms of, you know, providing people with mental health, and obviously there’s the whole thing of we don’t know where our next medicines or foods are going to come from.”
The garden bought the X-ray to examine its own alpine seeds and has a software developer under contract, but Neale said she is anxious moving forward with the project knowing that the entire endeavor could get terminated. The garden is holding off on its original plan to contract with partner gardens to conduct seed collections this summer.
“It doesn’t leave just us in limbo, but it leaves all of them in limbo because they’d originally been planning on doing these collections and receiving the funding for it, and then it got terminated,” she said. “In the botanic garden community, people have a pretty low risk tolerance, because we’re not dealing with really large budgets where we can just cover several thousand dollars if federal money doesn’t come through to pay for it.”

At the Museum of Art Fort Collins, Executive Director Lisa Hatchadoorian said she worked to draw down most of a $55,000 grant ahead of the start of the new presidential administration. That money was slated for a staff member and physical upgrades to the MoA For All space, which is meant to host classes, field trips and camps. The program also allows free admission for college students, children, SNAP recipients and military personnel.
“When I saw what was happening in the beginning of 2025, I put in the payment request for the bulk of it — the fixtures and the furniture — which came out to about $15,000. We basically got that with the skin of our teeth, because I thought ‘We need to get this in before the inauguration, just in case things start to turn south,’” she said.
There’s about $6,500 left in the grant, Hatchadoordian said.
“We’re trying to fundraise in other ways to make up the difference. There’s not much else we could do. We had to either make it up or we cut,” she said. “If funding dries up, whether that’s through IMLS or other sources, then the program would cease to exist, and that would not be beneficial to the community.”
Museum leaders are looking to other funding sources, including donors and additional grants from private organizations. But the dissolution of IMLS, as well as funding cuts to agencies like the National Endowment for the Arts, could result in a large uptick of museums competing for the same amount of private funding.
Chelsea Pennington Hahn, the director of the Lafayette History Museum, said IMLS grants allow small museums to take “big steps towards best practices” in preserving history. A $47,000 grant in 2023, which she said was about two-thirds of the museum’s annual budget, allowed it to hire a collections manager to take a professional inventory of the museum’s artifacts and pay a handful of interns.
The museum had $300 left in that grant when Pennington Hahn received the IMLS termination notice, but she sees the threat of federal funding cuts as a danger to the health of small, community-based museums.
“These small museums that do really important work of preserving the stories of the small towns and cities that make up Colorado and the American West,” she said. “Without the grants, we will still exist. We will still keep doing our best, but those grant programs allow us to make major strides towards growing and getting better for the community.”

It took eight years of planning and fundraising to save the slowly deteriorating, 112-year-old hospital, the first privately owned hospital opened on a reservation and one that was founded by the first Native American woman to earn a medical degree, La Flesche Picotte.
The structure will serve as a medical clinic for the reservation, an incubator for entrepreneurs and other community improvements, a museum honoring the doctor’s amazing life, as well as a possible inspiration for Omaha girls to seek careers in medicine, said Gary Bowen, the project manager and a member of the Picotte Center Board of Directors.
“This is something the Native people can be proud of,” Bowen said. “It can give people some hope that something good can happen here.”
“Get ready for something special,” said Elizabeth Lovejoy Brown, executive director of the Center.
La Flesche Picotte’s story was vividly retold in the 2016 Joe Starita book, “A Warrior of the People: how Susan La Flesche overcame racial and gender inequality to become America’s first Indian doctor.” The book served as a spark to seek renovation of the then-mostly vacant hospital that overlooks Walthill.
Inspired by need
“Dr. Susan,” as she is called, was inspired to seek a medical degree after watching a sick Indian woman die because a local white doctor refused to provide care.
She earned her medical degree at the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1889. After marrying, she established a private practice in Bancroft before arranging funding to open a three-story hospital in Walthill to serve the Omaha Reservation.
Using horse and buggy for home visits, Dr. La Flesche Picotte treated hundreds of patients across the reservation, as well as at the hospital.
“She is a true Nebraska hero and a remarkable role model for all physicians, exemplifying selfless care for her patients,” said Dr. Britt Thedinger, a Picotte Center board member and past president of the Nebraska Medical Association.

Members of the Medical Association raised more than $600,000 toward renovation of the hospital. Major grants came from USDA Rural Development, the Sherwood Foundation and the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community. More than 400 donors, including the Omaha Tribe, contributed to the project, Bowen said.
“We are immensely grateful for the generous contributions of time and donations that have brought this vision to life,” Brown said. “I would like to say wóngíthe wíbthahan (‘I thank you all’).”
The structure had fallen into disrepair and was mostly vacant when a five-phase renovation project — described as “renovate as you go” by Bowen — was launched.
Extensive renovations
Judi gaiashkibos, the long-time executive director of the Nebraska Commission on Indian Affairs, brought together a new board of directors. The first step was replacing a leaky roof, then the exterior was restored.
Lead paint and asbestos was removed, new utility lines established and modern heating and air conditioning systems installed. Renovation of the building’s interior followed, which included patching the lath-and-plaster walls and ceilings, installing an elevator and restoring wooden doors and trim. Work extended over the past 16 months, Bowen said.
One more phase remains — to establish a “healing garden” of native plants and a drum circle for Omaha ceremonies behind the hospital — that will cost another $1 million, he said.
The building was almost too far gone for renovation when the project began, according to Bowen.

It had been named as one of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the country by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which he said spoke to its dire condition.
“It was stripped down to the bone,” Bowen said.
It is one of only 22 National Historic Landmarks in the state of Nebraska, getting that recognition in 2018.
The first floor will house a medical clinic, staffed by the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the Munroe Meyer Institute.
The second story includes community meeting rooms, a gift shop, exhibits on Dr. La Flesche Picotte’s life and work and displays about the Omaha Tribe’s history and beliefs.
There’s also a restored screened-in porch, complete with rocking chairs, where tuberculosis patients once sought fresh air and comfort for the then-incurable disease.
Community spaces
Rooms on the third floor — former nurses quarters for the hospital — will include a maker’s space for Native crafters and will be made available for local startups and entrepreneurs, Bowen said, as part of the center’s mission to inspire economic development.
A sneak peak event, for 200 donors and dignitaries including Gov. Jim Pillen, was held Saturday, with the building opening to the public next week. After the June 22 grand opening, the center will be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday.
Bowen said there are future plans to establish scholarships for Native girls seeking careers in health care and to purchase and renovate Dr. La Flesche Picotte’s former home in Walthill.
“This is an example of people coming together and recognizing significant people in Nebraska history and our nation’s history,” he said. “We also hope that young Omaha girls will be inspired by what Dr. Susan did.”

Bill Lee during a 2022 campaign event. (Photo: John Partipilo)Twenty-five years ago — in what could easily be described as another life — I was a youth minister in a Southern Baptist church. I knew every verse to cherry-pick to support my personal views on anything from abortion to same-sex marriage. 
That year, in the first presidential election in which I was allowed to vote, I voted for George W. Bush because…well, abortion and stuff. Four years later, I was completely out of the SBC and voted for John Kerry. 
What changed?
After the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, a proliferation of politics began to swirl from the pulpit at my church, a toxic mix of ideology and scripture. Until then, whatever naive political beliefs I had sprang from MY belief system. As misguided as it was, that system was my own, for better or worse — not something dictated to me verbatim from a lectern.
One Sunday, my pastor referenced Fox News to buttress a point about a specific social issue, and a line was drawn. The “compassionate conservatism” espoused by the Bush presidency had started to curdle. Something was spoiled. Fundamental Christianity had been weaponized, and I wanted no part of it.
Comparatively speaking, those were the good ol’ days.
Since Gov. Bill Lee was elected in 2018, he has consistently spoken of how his personal faith influences his decision-making. He has proudly made a grandstanding show of signing performative bills into law that reinforce his idea of Christianity (see the Adult Entertainment Act of 2023 and the Heartbeat Bill of 2020) while simultaneously discriminating against same-sex couples (see SB 1304 of 2020) and preventing LGBTQ+ children from being fostered by families if the families so choose in the Tennessee Foster and Adoptive Parent Protection Act of 2024. 
Recently, Lee may have committed his most damnable offense — a Faustian promise to support President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented migrants by creating a Centralized Immigration Enforcement Division and vowing to be “supportive of his (Trump’s) strategies moving forward.”
Tennessee ‘human smuggling’ bill heads to governor’s desk

Did Lee envision a racial profiling dragnet in South Nashville when he made that promise? 
In early May, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, along with assistance from the Tennessee Highway Patrol, made traffic stops in an area of Nashville that is heavily populated with immigrants. Witnesses observed vehicles being stopped and people being detained. When the dust settled, nearly 200 suspected migrants without permanent legal status had been arrested. 
Mothers. Fathers. Children. Did all 200 people have violent criminal records? Was each person arrested a legitimate threat to their community? Anyone with common sense knows the answers to those questions.
When Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell denounced the ICE raids, GOP lawmakers at the state and federal levels attacked. House Republicans in Washington announced a federal investigation of O’Connell; Sen. Marsha Blackburn implored the Department of Justice to look into the matter. Based on O’Connell’s remarks, border czar Tom Homan threatened more raids. 
As he is prone to do, Lee remained silent, complicit in the chaos. 
After the Covenant School mass shooting tragedy three years ago, Lee called a special legislative session to address the lax firearm regulations in the state. It was one of the few times Lee has even slightly pushed against his supermajority of political bullies. Nothing happened other than Lee slinking from the public spotlight, muting himself out of righteous self-preservation. 
U.S. border czar: Nashville mayor, a critic of immigration sweeps, now faces investigation

I’ve met Lee twice. He spoke with students, genuinely listened to their ideas and posed for pictures. In my very limited time with him, I came away believing he truly cares for people on a personal level. People I have spoken with who know him say he’s a good man and I don’t doubt that. 
But when you hitch your political wagon to a brand of Christianity that has been bastardized by a powerful group of people hellbent on power, your personal witness automatically falters. When you pledge blind loyalty to a man like Trump and set up systems within your state that allow innocent children to be hurt, people to be discriminated against and families torn apart, it might be time to stop leaning so heavily on Christian rhetoric to advance your political causes. 
Recently, I’ve dipped my toe back into a faith community. Testing the waters, you could say. Ironically, most of my core beliefs about politics and humanity were formed by my time in church, by the actual teachings of Jesus Christ. He had strong thoughts about powerful political structures like the one we have in Tennessee. He also had very specific language about the way we should treat vulnerable people in society, specifically foreigners.
“For I was hungry and you put me in jail, I was thirsty and you confiscated my water,
I was a stranger and you arrested me…Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.”
Wait. Sorry. That must have come from the Trump translation, not the King James Version.
Faith in anything is an extremely personal matter to be respected, but when that faith is used as a manipulative weapon to further a political agenda, it becomes blasphemous. 
Our leaders should act more like O’Connell and less like Lee, placing humanity above legalistic righteousness.

(Contributed photo)Daniela Helfenstein as a teenager would go to protests of Venezuelan authoritarian leader Hugo Chavez. 
Now she is a U.S. citizen, raising a family in Fargo, but she said she has some of the same feelings she had in Venezuela. 
“I feel like I am living this twice,” Helfenstein said. “To relive an oppression, it’s just a scary feeling.” 
Helfenstein came to the United States in 2014 and attended Minnesota State University Moorhead. 
She married an American and became a U.S. citizen at a naturalization ceremony in Fargo in 2023.
But she still has fears for other Venezuelan family and friends and even for herself under the Donald Trump administration’s determination to deport immigrants, especially those from Venezuela. 
The White House says that Venezuelan gang members are “preying on American citizens.” It is attempting to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelans. 
The Trump administration’s efforts to use that law has fueled multiple court cases, 
A federal judge on June 4 ordered the Trump administration to allow Venezuelan men sent to El Salvador under that law to have their cases heard in court. 
Helfenstein said a lack of due process is not just an issue for Venezuelans. 
“Everybody should feel apprehensive,” she said. 
Helfenstein said there are likely gang members and criminals from Venezuela who are in the United States, but not in the numbers asserted by the Trump administration. 
She said most Venezuelans would be like her father, who came across the U.S.-Mexican border seeking asylum from the authoritarian regime now headed by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Her father is living in Florida as are some other family members. 
Helfenstein’s best friend from Venezuela was lucky enough that, through a lottery system, she was granted a green card allowing her to live in the United States. The green card will eventually need to be renewed.










It is not normal for people who are not criminals to be afraid of the police.

She and her family are living in Fargo, too, but without the assurances of having U.S. citizenship, fear they could be deported, according to Helfenstein. 
Daniela Helfenstein’s husband is Colin Helfenstein, who said this is not the kind of America that legal immigrants should expect.
Even with his wife having become a U.S. citizen, Colin Helfenstein said there are concerns about deportation.  
“Having citizenship is definitely somewhat reassuring, but it’s still no guarantee,” he said.  
The Trump administration also has tried to remove temporary legal status for some immigrants. 
In another case, a federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from invalidating the temporary legal status of 5,000 Venezuelans. An appeal of that case is pending.

Leah Hargrove works with immigrants at Bismarck Global Neighbors, helping them with issues such as housing, employment and transportation to integrate into the community. 
“My hope would be to see the federal government honor the commitment it made to these individuals,” Hargove said of immigrants with temporary legal status. 
Bismarck Global Neighbors had a Spanish language information session in April, with participants including Venezuelans and some people who drove more than an hour to learn about their rights. 
“I see a lot of people who are nervous,” Hargrove said, even if they are in the U.S. legally. 
She said the overwhelming number of immigrants in North Dakota are here legally, though for some that status is temporary. 
She said her group’s workload has shifted from assisting people who are new to the United States to people who are moving to the Bismarck area from places such as Chicago and Miami to help fill jobs in education and health care. 
“So it might shift a little bit who we’re serving. Maybe we’ll serve fewer refugees and more nurses, but we’re not any less busy at my office, that’s for sure,” Hargrove said.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The loss of federal tax credits for rooftop solar could wreck the business that Allan O’Shea has built in Michigan. O’Shea, who runs his company along with his wife and sons, has been selling solar panels since the 1990s.
He’s witnessed the growing popularity of rooftop solar in the state, which accounted for 19 percent of the state’s total solar power in 2023. Across the nation, residential solar has continually set records for new installations, growing every year for the past five years.
Progress for solar in the United States was kicked into high gear by record-high tax credits for renewable energy, implemented in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Now, the federal budget reconciliation bill, officially titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” threatens to halt that progress.
In its current draft form, the bill proposes ending the residential clean energy tax credit, which allows residents to get 30 percent off the cost of new clean energy projects, like solar panels, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage. It would also end a 30 percent tax credit for companies that lease solar panels to homes and businesses. The bill has already left the House, where it passed by one vote, and is currently being debated in the Senate.
I’m focusing on Michigan because it’s a place that has stood out for the pace of growth in its renewable energy economy.
Since 2022, new clean energy projects there have garnered $27.84 billion in investments and created 26,352 jobs. There have been more new clean energy projects launched in Michigan than any other state, according to a report from Climate Power. Nearly 40 percent of those are in Republican-held congressional districts.
Losing federal solar credits “would devastate the solar industry” in Michigan, said O’Shea, the president of CBS Solar. When we talked on the phone this week, he was in the middle of sending letters to his representatives in Congress, asking them to oppose the federal cuts. “Lynda and I and our 25 employees plead with you to leave the solar tax credits intact,” he wrote (Lynda is his wife). “The effort by the House to balance the budget on the backs of more than 3,000 Michigan solar employees is ill advised and wrong.”
For customers looking to save money on their energy bills, the federal clean energy tax credit has been a key incentive bringing them to CBS Solar. O’Shea said losing the clean energy tax credit would double the amount of time it will take his customers to recoup the costs of installing solar panels, from around 10 years to 20.

It could also make it difficult, or even impossible, for his business to continue. Part of what would make it so challenging is how quickly the change would happen; cuts would go into effect immediately after the bill passes. On the other hand, the 30 percent tax credit for commercial and utility-scale projects is set to stay in place until 2029.
If residential solar tax credits were reduced over the same timeline, O’Shea said it would give his business and other small solar companies a better chance of surviving.
“You’re just talking about pulling the rug out from the solar residential industry,” he said. That will have a direct impact on how many people he can employ. “These are good jobs created for many people that don’t have a college degree. They’re paying their taxes, they’re hard working Americans all over rural America. It would be really a shame to have that loss.”
A majority of job losses from losing the clean energy tax credit will be in states won by President Trump in 2024, according to an analysis by the Solar Energy Industry Association. SEIA calculates that removing solar tax incentives would result in 330,000 jobs lost across the country, 331 factories closed or cancelled and nearly $300 billion in local investments erased.
Policy changes since Trump’s election have already brought challenges to the solar industry. In 2024, more than 100 solar contractors went bankrupt. On June 6, Solar Mosaic, a California-based company that offers loans for solar projects, filed for bankruptcy. Just a few days later, Sunnova Energy, a leading U.S. residential solar installer, followed suit.
O’Shea is getting questions from customers, asking: “Is this really going to happen? Can you fit me in before the end of the year? Why is this happening?”
Under the bill’s current language, if they are able to start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage and are online by 2028, they’ll still qualify for credits. But O’Shea expects that such a short timeframe will make it hard in particular for churches, schools and nonprofits to get organized in time. “There’s a whole lot of good people out there who are going to lose the opportunity,” he said.
While these cuts would certainly make renewables more expensive, “it’s also very likely that things the Trump administration are doing will make non-renewable power generation more expensive too,” said Douglas Jester, managing partner at 5 Lakes Energy, where he advises clean energy trade associations.

Tariffs on imported parts for natural gas plants, for example, could raise energy prices. “I do think we’ll still see growth in solar in Michigan, but it might not grow as fast,” he said.
For now, O’Shea and his staff are waiting to see what will happen—whether the Senate will support his company’s interests or not, and if they’ll be able to adjust enough to make it through.
“I have two sons in the business,” he said. “I wanted to leave them something, but I can’t be sure of that anymore.”

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:
Fate of Energy Tax Credits Falls to Republican Senators: Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits that would benefit Republican districts will disappear if the Senate passes the bill in its current form. Multiple Republican senators have said they want major changes to the bill, while others have vowed to vote against it if any clean energy subsidies are preserved, as Arianna Skibell reports for Politico. The Senate can only afford to lose three votes.
Sunnova and Mosaic Bankruptcies Are Part of a Bigger Story of Challenges for Rooftop Solar: Federal cuts to clean energy tax credits are only the latest threat to residential solar companies. High interest rates, plus policy changes in California—the country’s largest rooftop solar market—have all made operations much more expensive in recent years. But Sunnova and Mosaic also made poor business decisions, taking on serious debt that made them particularly vulnerable to collapse, reports Jeff St. John for Canary Media. Experts say it’s still too early to say what these bankruptcies mean for the industry at large.
Developer Seeks to Cancel New Jersey Offshore Wind Project, Citing Political Opposition: Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind had planned to build a 1.5-gigawatt offshore wind project that would have powered 700,000 New Jersey homes. Now, the company wants to terminate the project, reports Amanda Oglesby for Asbury Park Press. In January, President Trump halted all wind projects. Soon after, the EPA pulled an air permit granted to Atlantic Shores in 2024, forcing the company to end contracts and cancel planned investments.
Illinois Hopes to Continue Solar Boom Despite Federal Headwinds: Illinois is one of the largest markets in the U.S. for new solar installations. Environmental advocates are confident that solar will continue to grow in the state, even with federal tax credit cuts, reports Douglas J. Guth for Inside Climate News. The state shored up its solar market largely through legislation passed in 2016 and 2021 that created incentives for solar vendors and discounts for income-eligible residents who want rooftop solar, and added a monthly charge on electricity bills that funds renewable energy projects.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/825e59_d7a79c5d435c4049a2bbb3c48a439cbbmv2_d_4000_3000_s_4_2-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-16 07:06:26.395991

The Mountain Pine School District board approved the restrictions at the same time that children’s access to LGBTQ+ content in school and public libraries became a hot-button issue throughout Arkansas, and the board’s decision spawned a new state law that will go into effect in August.
The nine restricted titles, all aimed at students between 2nd and 5th grade, are only available to Mountain Pine Elementary School students whose parents or guardians provide written permission. Arnold and Mary Stone, whose child was in fourth grade at the time, petitioned the Garland County school on March 27, 2023 to remove three books they found objectionable from the library. 
The five-member school board unanimously voted three days later to “pull any books that deal in sexual orientation, sexual lifestyle or gender preference from the general shelves in the Elementary library,” according to board meeting minutes.

March 30 Board Minutes 
This “temporary decree will be in effect until a new policy is approved by the school board,” according to the minutes.
As of Friday, the three challenged books, as well as six others, are still filed as “Restricted: Parent Note Required” in Mountain Pine Elementary’s online library catalog.
The Mountain Pine district has two schools and 585 students, according to the Arkansas Department of Education website.
Cedarville precedent not a concern
In 2003, a federal court decided the Cedarville School District violated the First Amendment by requiring signed permission slips from parents to allow their children to read the Harry Potter books.
This was not a concern for state Rep. Richard McGrew, a Hot Springs Republican who represents Mountain Pine, when he drafted and presented Act 917 of 2025 in the Legislature, he said Friday.
Act 917 requires public elementary schools to “store non-age-appropriate sexual content, including without limitation a book or other resource that is located in the library media center that is available to the public, in a locked compartment within a designated area.”
Students would only be able to access these materials with parental permission, and McGrew told the House Education Committee in March that this policy arose from a situation in his district.
“In some aspects, it makes it easier if a parent wants their child to learn about something that, quite frankly, I wouldn’t want my child to learn about,” McGrew said.
He also said the “designated area” required in the law can be anywhere in the school building, not specifically in the library.
The law defines “non-age-appropriate sexual content” as “any materials that include explicit instruction, promotion, or advocacy of sexual ideology, behaviors, or orientations that are not developmentally appropriate for kindergarten through grade five (K-5) students.”

Stone challenge forms 
The librarian’s response
The books the Stones challenged in Mountain Pine do not depict sexual activity, elementary school librarian Jennifer Wendell wrote in her response to the challenges, obtained via an Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request.
“The content within these books consists of nothing more ‘sexual’ than talking about crushes and chaste kisses,” Wendell wrote.
All school libraries are required to have library content challenge policies in order to be accredited by the state Department of Education. McGrew said Act 917 does not change that.
Instead, Act 917 requires schools to issue a warning to a teacher or media specialist who “knowingly failed to comply with” the law upon the first alleged violation. The second offense would lead to a formal complaint to the Professional Licensure Standards Board, which has the authority to suspend education licenses.
Upon the third offense, the licensure board would be required to revoke the educator’s license. Legislative Democrats expressed opposition to this aspect of the bill, and Rep. Steve Magie of Conway was the only Democrat in either chamber to vote for it.
Act 917 passed the majority-Republican Legislature with 75 of 100 House members’ support and 28 of 35 senators’ support. The law initially failed to pass the Senate, garnering only 16 senators’ support.
Sen. Matt McKee, R-Pearcy, was the law’s Senate sponsor and also represents Mountain Pine.
 Other legislation

In their book challenge forms to Mountain Pine Elementary, the Stones cited a proposed state policy: Senate Bill 81, which Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed into law as Act 372 of 2023 the day after the Mountain Pine school board’s vote to restrict certain books.
Federal judge declares sections of Arkansas’ library obscenity law unconstitutional

A federal judge in 2024 blocked the section of Act 372 that would have allowed criminal liability for school and public librarians for disseminating materials some consider “obscenity.” The state is appealing the injunction, which also prevented city and county elected officials from having the final say over whether to relocate challenged public library materials on the basis of “appropriateness.”
Act 372 gives school boards the authority to relocate challenged school library books. This section was not challenged in court, but Wendell pointed out in her response to the Stones that it was not state law at the time.
The Stones’ challenge forms also cited the LEARNS Act of 2023, a wide-ranging education law that includes a ban on teaching of “sexually explicit materials,” gender identity or sexual orientation in classrooms before 5th grade.
LEARNS did not go into effect until three months after the Stones submitted their book challenges, and the books in question were never used in classroom instruction, Wendell said.
“As these challenged books deal with relevant and timely topics in ways that independent reviewers and I deemed age-appropriate/developmentally appropriate, I felt they were beneficial additions to our school collection,” Wendell wrote. “…Removing these books based on the personal belief that homosexuality is not developmentally appropriate for children to be exposed to is a violation of our students’ First Amendment rights and opens our district to potential legal issues and lawsuits.”
Wendell’s response is dated March 31, 2023, the day after the school board voted to approve the book restrictions.

Mountain Pine Elementary Book Challenge 
Mountain Pine School District Superintendent Tish Knowles said Friday that some parents in the district have expressed appreciation for the restrictions and that she has not heard any concerns about potential First Amendment violations. Knowles was not yet the district’s superintendent in March 2023.
The Arkansas Association of Educational Administrators did not respond to requests last week for comment on Act 917. McGrew told his fellow lawmakers the organization worked with him on the legislation’s language. Knowles said no one at the Mountain Pine School District helped write the law.
McGrew emphasized that the sequestered books would not be removed from school premises. Act 372 did not pass the House Judiciary Committee in 2023 until it had been amended to say library materials would be relocated to an area inaccessible to minors, not removed from the school or public library entirely, if elected officials find them to be “obscene.”
The law provides libraries no guidance on creating an area that minors cannot access, and it does not limit challenges based on “appropriateness” for minors, U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks wrote in his ruling against the challenged portions of Act 372.
Brooks also wrote that the law “could allow “the views of a vocal few [to] dictate what is generally available to the public” and “decide on any basis they choose” whether to relocate or remove a book.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Books-behind-bars-Getty-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-16 07:06:26.395991

Editor’s note: This story includes images of skeletal human remains found by volunteers in the desert. 
SANTA TERESA, New Mexico — On a hot morning in September, after hours of trekking through the Chihuahuan desert, Abbey Carpenter and her partner James Holeman spotted a pile of scattered bones. 
Near a yucca plant, a human jawbone lay partially buried in the sand. Around it were vertebrae, femurs and ribs. Next to the bones, they saw a woman’s purple underwear with two tiny hearts on the corner and a Salvadoran passport.
The bones were among six sets of human remains they found that month. 
Carpenter and Holeman founded a volunteer group in 2020 called Battalion Search and Rescue to search for migrant bodies in this patch of desert just west of El Paso. They took photos and recorded the coordinates on their cell phone. They tied a pink ribbon to a nearby branch. 
Later, they mailed the passport to the Salvadoran consulate and reported the body to the Doña Ana County Sheriff’s Office in New Mexico — even though the sheriff sometimes doesn’t respond and has accused volunteers of planting bones in the desert.
Since September 2023, the group has found 27 sites with human remains in the desert, Holeman said. 
“How did we get to this place as a country that we think so poorly of migrants?” Carpenter said during a recent search in the desert.
Historically, Border Patrol’s El Paso sector — which includes all 180 miles of New Mexico’s border with Mexico and 84 miles of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in West Texas — has had among the fewest migrant deaths across the southern border. 
That changed in late December 2022, according to an investigation by The Texas Tribune and Source New Mexico, when the city of El Paso joined forces with Gov. Greg Abbott to participate in his signature border mission, called Operation Lone Star. 
By 2024, the El Paso sector had become the deadliest place for migrants to cross along the entire U.S.-Mexico border. 
From January 2023 to August 2024, 299 human remains were reported in the El Paso sector, the most of any sector along the southern border, according to the most recent data available from federal government data. That’s more than double the number of cases reported during the 20 months prior, when 122 remains were recorded before El Paso had adopted Operation Lone Star.
Since El Paso joined Texas’ border mission in 2022, migrant remains discovered in the El Paso sector have increased every year, even as they have declined in every other part of the border. 
“We have people dying in New Mexico deserts because of Texas policies,” said New Mexico state Rep. Sarah Silva, a Democrat from nearby Las Cruces.

  });

Though many factors determine where and when someone crosses an international border  — including federal immigration policies, organized crime and natural disasters — experts and advocates say any policy that pushes migrants into the desert will likely cost lives.
Immigrant rights groups and researchers say more migrants are taking deadlier routes to enter the country since Texas launched Operation Lone Star in 2021 — flooding the border with state troopers, National Guard and miles of razor wire — as the federal government’s ever changing immigration policies have delayed or blocked migrants who want to claim asylum in the U.S.
“Any state lawmaker or local leader should be aware that these policies come at a human cost,” said Aimée Santillán, a policy analyst at the Hope Border Institute, an immigrant rights advocacy group in El Paso. “So anyone that decides to approach this type of enforcement is making a decision that they can live with these deaths.”
Meanwhile, bodies lie in the desert, unidentified, for months at a time. Eight months after Carpenter and Holeman’s group reported the set of six remains to authorities, many of the bones were still there. It remains unclear how New Mexico state and local officials intend to address the need for more resources to retrieve and identify the bodies.  
The striking increase in deaths in the New Mexico and West Texas desert is part of a global surge in migration. According to United Nations statistics from 2024, the number of immigrants worldwide has doubled since 1990, with 304 million people living in a country other than the one in which they were born. 
Last year was also the deadliest on record for migrants worldwide, according to the UN’s International Organization for Migration. 
“The rise in deaths is terrible in and of itself, but the fact that thousands remain unidentified each year is even more tragic,” said Julia Black, coordinator of IOM’s Missing Migrants Project.

      const iframe = document.getElementById(“migrant-remains-sub”);
      iframe.style.height = e.data[“custom-embed-height”] + “px”;
    }
  });

Neither the Trump administration nor elected officials from Texas or New Mexico have addressed the issue, even as the number of bodies discovered has skyrocketed. 
Abbott’s office blamed former President Joe Biden’s “open-border policies” for the loss of life when asked for comment. “The heartbreaking increase in deaths is the direct result of the chaos President Biden unleashed on the border,” said Andrew Mahaleris, Abbott’s press secretary.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also laid the blame on the federal government. 
“While state officials are sometimes called upon to respond to emergencies, immigration remains a federal responsibility. Gov. Lujan Grisham has consistently called on every administration — Trump, Biden, and now Trump again — to fulfill federal obligations at the border and provide adequate resources for humanitarian and law enforcement efforts,” her spokesperson Jodi McGinnis Porter said in an email.
Giving families closure
Holeman, 67, started volunteering with a search and rescue group in 2018 named Aguilas del Desierto — which is Spanish for “the Desert Eagles.” 
Holeman, a retired Marine veteran, said that as part of his military experience, he saw other countries returning dead American soldiers back to their families. He recognized the U.S. government doesn’t provide the same benefit to the families of migrants, so he wanted to help fill this gap.
He and Carpenter, 60, chose the New Mexico-Mexico border because it’s an area where groups in California, Arizona and Texas don’t come to regularly.
They named the group Battalion Search and Rescue, named for St. Patrick’s Battalion, an Irish immigrant military unit that defected from the U.S. to fight with the Mexicans in the U.S.-Mexico War. 
Once a month, a group of self-trained volunteers scours the desert for lost and missing migrants. The goal is to help save lives when they can, but for those who can’t be saved, they hope to provide closure for families who want to be reunited with their loved ones and given an opportunity for a proper burial.
“We’re just trying to fill a gap where the government is falling short,” Holeman said.
Among those whom the group has helped reunite with family is Ada Guadalupe López Montoya of El Salvador, who died at the age of 33 last year. 
The last time her family heard from her, López Montoya was in Ciudad Juárez, preparing to cross the border into El Paso — her second attempt to enter the United States. When she stopped responding to her family, they called the Armadillos Search and Rescue, a San Diego-based humanitarian group.
Cesar Ortigoza, 51, who co-founded that rescue group, called Holeman in New Mexico to ask if their group had found López Montoya, who had been reported missing since July 2023. Holeman searched his records and found that he had come across her passport, located next to human remains in September.
Two months later, Ortigoza flew to El Paso, drove to Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and hiked 3 miles to the site. He called the Doña Ana County Sheriff’s Office to report that the remains may belong to López Montoya, whose family had been searching for her for over a year. 
The Sheriff’s Office sent officials from the New Mexico Office of Medical Investigator, who arrived about eight hours later to recover the remains.
“As an immigrant myself, it’s important that families know what happened to their loved ones,” Ortigoza said.

Countless other families are still waiting for news of relatives who have disappeared while crossing the border. Some turn to Facebook, creating groups titled “Desaparecí cruzando la frontera,” Spanish for “I disappeared crossing the border,” with fliers depicting loved ones. 
Among them is 41-year-old Laura Tavares Vazquez of Guanajuato, Mexico. For nearly three years, her family has repeatedly posted a flyer with the coordinates of where she was last seen near Santa Teresa. 
Tavares Vazquez, who left her children behind, had called a relative from the desert to tell her she wouldn’t make it, the family wrote in a post. She felt weak and had an unbearable thirst that kept her from walking. A group she was hiking with through the desert left her behind on June 11, 2022. 
“That’s when our nightmare began,” the family wrote on Facebook. “It’s such a hopeless feeling not knowing what happened to her, where she is, if she’s okay, who has her and why, or where did they leave her behind.”
A relative, through a family spokesperson, declined to be interviewed, explaining that over the years, people have attempted to extort the family — offering to find Tavares Vazquez if the family pays an undisclosed amount of money.
Texas’ militarized border
In March 2021, Abbott announced Operation Lone Star, a military mission to deter immigrants from crossing the Rio Grande illegally. As part of this multibillion-dollar mission, Abbott sent hundreds of National Guard soldiers and state troopers to different parts of the 1,200-mileTexas-Mexico border. 
At the end of fiscal year 2022, six months after the state border mission began, Border Patrol reported finding 651 bodies along the Texas-Mexico border, more than triple the total from just three years prior.
Maverick County, home to Eagle Pass, quickly saw an increase in migrant bodies washing up onto the American side of the Rio Grande. In summer 2023, Abbott deployed a 1,000-foot barrier there, made up of buoys to block migrants from crossing the river. That same summer, Mexican authorities reported a migrant had been found dead — stuck to one of the floating orange spheres. 
The number of migrant bodies discovered on the riverbank of the Rio Grande in Maverick County jumped from 51 in 2021 to 132 the following year, according to data compiled by Stephanie Leutert, the director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin and a former State Department official under Biden.
El Paso, a binational Democratic stronghold, resisted for more than a year issuing a disaster declaration that would have resulted in joining Operation Lone Star, in part because officials disagreed with Abbott’s military approach. 
That changed toward the end of 2022, when thousands of migrants crossed the border from Juárez into El Paso, forcing the county and city to scramble to find enough shelter space for those sleeping on the streets after Border Patrol processed and released them.
Texas border cities and counties were incentivized to join the border because they would get state funding and other resources. By joining Operation Lone Star, then-El Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser hoped to get state-sponsored buses to transport migrants out of the city and take the pressure off the overflowing shelters.
Abbott quickly sent state police and National Guard soldiers to El Paso and rolled out miles of concertina wire on the banks of the Rio Grande between El Paso and Juárez. The soldiers also began firing pepper balls, a chemical irritant, at migrants to deter them from crossing the river.
  Texas National Guard troops prevent a group of primarily Venezuelan people who’d crossed the international border from turning themselves in to Border Patrol agents in El Paso on Dec. 20, 2022, the first week Texas law enforcement arrived in the city under Operation Lone Star.

Sophia Genovese, an attorney with the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, said last fall she represented a man in his 30s who was deported to Mexico and later crossed the Rio Grande from Juárez into El Paso. She said the man, who had grown up in Tennessee, tried to explain to soldiers that he was seeking asylum and wanted to surrender to Border Patrol agents. The soldiers, Genovese said, shot him with rubber bullets. He was eventually able to get past soldiers and turn himself into Border Patrol, Genovese said.
“We’re really concerned. We’ve had clients in the past who enter through the El Paso port of entry, or near the El Paso port of entry, who are being subjected to really intense violence by the National Guard,” she said. “Texas is very keen on participating in those enforcement operations. We’re going to see more loss of life.”
Leeser declined to comment. 
El Paso City Council member Josh Acevedo, who has opposed the city’s participation in Operation Lone Star, said the effects of the border mission in this area should serve as an example that this type of enforcement causes more harm than good. 
He said Abbott should collaborate with New Mexico in preventing these deaths. 
“But how do you get the governor of Texas, who is full of theatrics and lacks solutions, to be collaborative?” he said.
History repeating
Adam Isacson, a regional security expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, said smugglers take advantage of such clampdowns on the American side, making promises to vulnerable people, who are desperate to enter the U.S., that they can guide them around the blockades for a fee.
“The use of New Mexico in particular, really seems to have increased when Operation Lone Star put more people on the line, and it was just harder to turn yourself in the El Paso city limits,” he said. 
The trend has repeated itself for decades across the southwest border under Democratic and Republican administrations.
“The prediction is that with traditional entry and smuggling routes disrupted, illegal traffic will be deterred, or forced over more hostile terrain, less suited for crossing and more suited for enforcement,” according to a Border Patrol plan from 1994 signed off by Doris Meissner, the former commissioner of U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
In 1993, El Paso Sector Border Patrol Chief Silvestre Reyes launched Operation Hold the Line, which at the time used a novel approach to deter illegal immigration in the popular crossing point: a visible blockade of Border Patrol agents spaced along the border with Juárez. 
The approach sent apprehensions plummeting by 76% by the end of fiscal year 1994 in the sector. The Clinton administration decided to try it in the San Diego sector, which at the time accounted for 42% of apprehensions along the southern border. 
But the new vigilance in San Diego and El Paso quickly shifted the migrant flows to the Tucson sector in Arizona, which saw apprehensions increase by nearly 600% between 1992 and 2004, according to Border Patrol data. Migrants increasingly looked for other places to cross, and that often led them through remote terrain where they could easily run out of water and die of dehydration.
A 2009 congressional report found that these operations led to more deaths in rural areas of the border.
“One unintended consequence of this enforcement posture and the shift in migration patterns has been an increase in the number of migrant deaths each year; on average 200 migrants died each year in the early 1990s, compared with 472 migrant deaths in 2005,” the report said.
Meissner, who is now a senior fellow and director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the nonpartisan think tank Migration Policy Institute, has said she regrets this strategy because of the increase in migrant deaths. 
“The Border Patrol expected that there would be crossings in areas that were more dangerous. They didn’t expect that it would be in the numbers that ultimately materialized. Migrants are in desperate circumstances, they make desperate choices,” she said in a 2019 interview with The New York Times.

  U.S. Customs and Border Protection, along with the Department of Defense’s Joint Task Force Southern Border, hold a press conference after deploying two M1126 Infantry Carrier Vehicles to the El Paso sector in the U.S.-Mexico border in Sunland Park, New Mexico, on March 28, 2025.
It’s nearly impossible to determine how many people have died trekking through the desert. In part because bodies will deteriorate over time if they’re not found. Congress requires Border Patrol to collect data on how many migrants have died. But the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the Border Patrol “has not collected and recorded, or reported to Congress, complete data on migrant deaths.” 
Bryce Peterson, a volunteer and researcher with No More Deaths, an Arizona search group, said such groups have taken on the responsibility of collecting data because the federal government isn’t doing its job. 
“Things like the El Paso sector migrant death database are really filling in for what should be a government function, but government has failed miserably at it,” he said. 
New Mexico response
As deaths continued to increase year after year, New Mexico’s border counties and state agencies have been unprepared for the task of finding and collecting migrants’ bodies — or unwilling to tackle it.
New Mexico’s 180-mile border with Mexico is rural Chihuahuan desert, and the rough terrain should be a deterrent for many, said Michael Brown, a Luna County Sheriff captain, who has found migrant bodies. But with the border crackdown in Texas, Brown said his state needs to prepare itself because he expects more immigrants crossing through.
“The [New Mexico] governor is going to have to come to the realization that this is something that potentially could happen,” he said. “The federal government is going to have to realize that they’ve created a vacuum. They’re going to have to deal with this eventually themselves.”
In a statement, a spokesperson for the governor’s office said State Police perform more than 100 humanitarian rescues each summer in response to reports, demonstrating her office’s commitment to preserving life “regardless of circumstances.” 
But the governor’s office did not address questions about whether officials have a plan to search for, identify and repatriate remains when local or federal officials won’t. 
More than one in four bodies found in New Mexico since 2021 is unidentified, according to an Tribune and Source analysis. In Texas, just under 7% of the people found in that period are unidentified. 
Lujan Grisham’s office did not respond to a question about why that might be, though a spokesperson said that sites where bodies are discovered are often potential crime scenes. As a result, proper investigative protocols must be followed before repatriation can occur.  
  Battalion Search and Rescue volunteers meet at the parking lot of a Love’s truck stop in Santa Teresa on April 26, 2025.
  Volunteers sweep the landscape in a line formation searching for migrant remains on Jan. 25, 2025.
  Holeman calls the Doña Ana County Sheriff’s Office to collect human remains found outside of Santa Teresa, New Mexico, on May 3, 2025.
In Texas, counties spend an average of $13,100 per case to collect, investigate and bury remains, according to a May 2020 University of Texas report. Though, some border counties have taken shortcuts to reduce that cost, such as not ordering an autopsy or DNA test, the report says.
In New Mexico, the medical investigator’s office said it has not tracked migrant deaths in the past because the number of bodies was so low. But with the recent increase in remains being found, the state will need to address the issue soon by hiring more medical investigators to avoid a backlog that would delay the identification process, according to a research article by New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator.
New Mexico Sen. Crystal Diamond, R-Elephant Butte, who sponsored a failed bill in the last legislative session that would have appropriated state funds to help with humanitarian efforts, said border counties in the state need help addressing the large increase in deaths at the border.
“I think what people don’t want to talk about is the cost of the humanitarian efforts, and it is the counties bearing that weight,” she said.
McGinnis Porter, the governor’s spokesperson, said in a statement that another challenge is that migration patterns are complex and ever-changing, “driven by multiple factors, with cartels and human trafficking organizations choosing routes and drop-off locations that change frequently.”
“Any loss of life is a tragedy, and our hearts go out to the families of those who have died crossing into New Mexico,” McGinnis Porter added.

Meanwhile, Doña Ana County, which is immediately west of El Paso, has 10 field deputy medical investigators — the most of any county in New Mexico — but “they may be overwhelmed by the increased numbers of deaths,” a medical investigators’ research article says.
Carpenter and Holeman say that they’ve called the Doña Ana County Sheriff’s Office to report remains they’ve found. But her office has told them they don’t have deputies to respond, they said.
Doña Ana County Sheriff Kim Stewart has said that bodies found in her jurisdiction are not her priority. She has also dismissed Carpenter and Holeman’s efforts, saying she believes they are spreading misinformation and planting bones. She has also suggested the volunteers are discovering prehistoric bones.
Stewart’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
“I don’t know where they come from. I don’t know how long they’ve been there. I don’t know if they’ve been planted there,” she told KTSM, a local TV station. “If [the volunteers] are not going to stand by until we arrive, because [they] are too busy roaming the desert looking for I don’t know what, we’re not going to take these very seriously.”
A haunting encounter
Longtime rancher Nancy Clopton is still haunted by the sight of a dead woman she found on her property years ago. 
Clopton was tending to the water tank for her cattle in the New Mexico desert 100 miles west of El Paso. Temperatures in that stretch of desert near Hachita hit 110 degrees that week in 2021.
She walked along the curved edge of the 50,000-gallon steel tank and was startled to see a person, dressed in camo, seated on its concrete skirt. She couldn’t quite make out the person’s face, but she guessed she was looking at a young woman. 
“I yelled at her several times and got fairly close, maybe from here to that fence,” she said in a recent interview near her ranch, pointing about 20 feet away. “She wasn’t responding in any way, and I didn’t feel comfortable going up and actually touching her or trying to do something. Because to me, it was fairly obvious that she was dead.”
Clopton rushed inside and told her husband about the body and then called a contact at the Border Patrol. 
Soon after she led the agent to the water tank, a parade of border patrol agents, state troopers and medical examiners arrived. They interviewed her and collected the woman’s remains. 
In the days following, an agent told her the woman was from Mexico, but that’s all she ever learned about the woman, whom she still thinks about regularly.
After authorities left, Clopton was unsure what to do with the woman’s belongings and what she described as possible biohazards left behind. A crime scene cleanup company in El Paso told her it would cost up to $6,000 to clean the area. 
So she felt she had no choice but to take drastic action, she said. “My husband took a bucket with five gallons of gasoline in it, and he lit it on fire,” she said of the woman’s final resting place.
Ranchers who raise cattle near the border wall said there is no protocol for who to call when they find a person’s body, and they pointed to Clopton’s experience as an example of how ranchers are left on their own to deal with the humanitarian crisis. They also echoed calls for better cell and radio tower infrastructure in the area.
The woman Clopton found is Gabriela Ortiz Moreno, according to the autopsy report. She was 30 years old, from Mexico. Among her belongings was a notebook, jewelry and a pack of cookies. Whether her family ever learned of her passing is unclear. A spokesperson for the Mexican Consulate said that the information is confidential.
Investigative summaries also suggest she was seeking shade at the water tank, because “No rain or any type of cloud covering was available to the decedent,” an investigating officer wrote. 
“It’s terribly sad that people would be that desperate to come and that ill-prepared,” Clopton said. “They really don’t understand at all what they’re facing. This is the Chihuahuan Desert.”

(Leann Ray | West Virginia Watch)“Be aware of scammers who often target those facing hardships.” — West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey (Feb. 18, 2025) 
You need something or something is not right — making you anxious, perplexed or annoyed. Thus, you are looking for help. There are many scammers out there who are very willing to “help” you. With the aid of artificial intelligence, these scammers are becoming more sophisticated and cunning. 
According to a 2024 report by the Federal Trade Commission, scammers ripped off Americans for billions of dollars. There were 14,911 fraud reports by West Virginia residents alone, resulting in $27 million in losses. The largest proportion of these were “imposter scams” and “identity theft,” accounting for 29% of the West Virginia total. There were over 200 identity theft complaints filed including credit card, bank account and loan theft complaints.
So, how do these scammers get West Virginians hooked? Emails, phone calls and texts are the main methods. But there are others. 
For example, do you use search bars, Facebook or some other ways to find customer service telephone numbers? Do not do so ever again. Instead, log into the specific web site and/or open your account to deal with your issue.
Why? Scammers are experts at being right there when you search. They create phony sites and then buy ads to get their sites at the top of most search lists. A search might take you to an article that seems legitimate that includes a number for a fake call center. You then get a “professional” scammer who will reassure you that they can help. They will be extremely polite, helpful and believable, thus obtaining your information and money.
Here are a few typical scammer scenarios:
We’ve all searched for hotels, airline tickets, and car rentals on Expedia.com; booking.com; hotels.com; etc. They might be legitimate. But to be safe, go directly to the specific website to make your reservation, e.g., marriott.com; hertz.com, etc. Look carefully at the website address. One out of place character is a huge clue it’s not safe. For example: marriott.com might become marriot.com or hertz.com might appear as hertzs.com. 
Ever post a complaint on Quora or Reddit or Facebook or Nextdoor? In the future, do not. Scammers will “help” you in your time of need. “Certainly. I can help. I had the same experience and here’s what I did. Here’s the number to call.” That number could fake, taking you down the path to being scammed.
Scammers are experts at making their calls look legitimate. You repeatedly get calls from a number that you don’t recognize, although a company’s name appears. Let such calls go to voicemail (empty voicemail often). A legitimate caller, e.g., your doctor’s office, will leave a message.
Per McCuskey, “Scammers may cite West Virginia Code or ‘West Virginia Administrative Code’ and include legitimate-looking websites where they try to deceive recipients into paying for an unpaid toll or traffic ticket. Government agencies do not conduct business via text message — consumers should delete these messages immediately and report them as scams.”  
Disregard calls, pop-ups, emails and texts stating there’s an issue with any account. If you think there might be a problem, log in to your account yourself rather than responding. 
Phony letters and texts are constantly being received. You may be fraudulently billed for traffic fines (we have). Further, don’t pay a fine for missing jury duty. 
Customer service chatbots are annoying, but generally safe. If that firm has done what it should, your data should be secure. But you never know. Thus, do not provide a chatbot anything more than an order number. That order number will reveal your address so it’s unnecessary to give your address to the chatbot. And never reveal significant personal information. 
Certain scammers work neighborhoods. Never obtain repair work from someone who knocks on your door. They say they can do a job for you inexpensively — but want to be paid before they do the work or need money upfront to buy materials.
According to Gallup, 15% of Americans indicated that they or a family member were scammed last year. For those 18 to 29, the rate was even higher — 22%. 
Per Gallup, scamming is Americans’ second-highest crime concern. Over half of us (57%) worry that it might happen to them. Accordingly, we must be ever more vigilant. If you have a “feeling” that something is not quite right, pay attention to it. 
Go to consumer.ftc.gov to learn more about scammers. If you are a victim of a scammer, go to reportfraud.ftc.gov to report fraud and questionable business practices. West Virginia University also recommends that West Virginians visit the Taxpayer Guide to Identity Theft and IdentityTheft.gov websites.

(Getty Images)For decades, optometrists in all 50 states have been required to pass a standard, national exam for a license to perform eye exams, prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses and treat eye conditions.
In a few states including Kentucky, optometrists provide advanced care including laser and other eye surgeries.
But in a change that has stirred national opposition, Kentucky’s state board that licenses optometrists proposes no longer requiring part 1 of the three-part standard exam — considered the most difficult — instead allowing candidates to take a Canadian version critics say is far less rigorous.
“No state has ever accepted a foreign licensure exam as a valid substitute for initial licensure,” Dr. Rich Castillo, dean of the optometry school at the University of North Carolina-Pembroke, testified at a recent Kentucky legislative hearing. “They are not interchangeable.”
Castillo called the move “unprecedented and unnecessary.”
But the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners says the change is needed to ensure the state has enough eye care providers and because the difficult test may discourage prospective optometrists. 
After the COVID pandemic of 2020-23 disrupted in-person learning, “there were a number of optometry students that could not pass the national boards as required in current Kentucky regulation,” the state board said in written comments in support of allowing the Canadian exam.
And that could lead to fewer optometrists and reduced access to eye care in Kentucky, according to Dr. Joe Ellis, president of the board and a Benton optometrist.
“If they see that testing seems unsurmountable, they may not choose this profession down the road,” Ellis said at the April meeting of the legislative Administrative Regulation Review subcommittee.
Opponents say that’s no reason to adopt what they argue amounts to lowering standards for licensure.
A ‘tough exam’
Dr. Aaron Oberster, a 2023 graduate of the University of Pikeville’s optometry college — Kentucky’s only optometry school — spoke against the change at the hearing.
“Part 1 is a tough exam,” said Oberster, who said he practices at a rural hospital outside Kentucky. “But it’s an important step in the process to provide trustworthy care to the patients of Kentucky as well as the rest of the country.”










Licensure should be based on competency and not convenience


– Dr. Aaron Oberster, UPike optometry graduate


Part 1 is a multiple-choice exam that tests optometry graduates on applied science and medicine, as well as anatomy, physiology and pharmacology. Critics of the change say that passing that exam is especially important in Kentucky, where the legislature, under a lobbying blitz from optometrists in 2011, agreed to significantly expand their practice to include eye surgery and other advanced procedures.
As a result, Kentucky “has one of the broadest scopes of practice for optometrists in the United States,” according to the National Board of Examiners in Optometry, which administers the licensure exam in all 50 states.
By substituting part of the exam from Canada — where optometrists have a more limited scope of practice — Kentucky candidates would not be tested at the same level, Oberster said.
“Licensure should be based on competency and not convenience,” he said.
But the Kentucky optometric board is pressing ahead with a change to state regulations regarding licensure that Ellis said will give optometry graduates “an additional path to secure a Kentucky license.”
Asked for comment, Christi LeMay, executive director of the Kentucky board, said in a brief phone call the board would be issuing a statement on the subject but couldn’t say when it might be available. She also couldn’t immediately say how many optometrists are licensed in Kentucky, saying numbers had changed because of recent renewals.
The Courier Journal reported in 2018 the state had about 850 licensed optometrists, who hold a four-year, doctorate degree in optometry. Kentucky has about 200 ophthalmologists, medical doctors who have received advanced training in eye treatment.
Scores ‘trending up’
Dr. Jill Bryant, executive director of the national optometry exam board, said while scores on the test dipped nationwide after the COVID pandemic, they “are trending up” since students returned to the classroom.
“It looks like they are moving in the right direction,” Bryant said in an interview.
She was among opponents to Kentucky’s change who testified in April.
But while outside groups including the national board adamantly oppose the change, Ellis, president of the Kentucky board, told the legislative panel allowing the Canadian exam has broad support among Kentucky optometrists, long a politically powerful group.
“I assure you the Kentucky Optometric Association, the Kentucky College of Optometry (at Pikeville University), the doctors and the students in the commonwealth support this amendment,” Ellis said.
Ellis also is a former president of the Kentucky and the American optometric associations.
The Kentucky association said in a statement that it “strongly supports the sole authority of the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners to oversee the practice of optometry in Kentucky, which includes the legal authority to approve an alternate examination for licensure.”
Dr. Renee Reeder, dean of Pikeville University’s optometry college, said in an email that its graduates over the past two years have “surpassed” the national first-time pass rate on part 1 of the test, “reflecting the strength of our academic preparation.”
Candidates are allowed to take the test six times.
As for the proposal to allow the Canadian exam, Reeder said “we do appreciate the board’s thoughtful deliberation and commitment to ensuring that all pathways to licensure continue to meet the high standards of care Kentucky citizens deserve.”
‘I trust the providers’
The proposal next goes before the joint House-Senate Health Services Committee in July, which could find the proposal “deficient,” signaling disapproval. But that doesn’t stop the board from enacting the change; only the Kentucky General Assembly can do that when it next meets in January.
  Rep. Derek Lewis (LRC photo)
Lawmakers at the April hearing seemed inclined to support the change. No one on the panel criticized it and Rep. Derek Lewis, R-London and committee co-chairman, said he had contacted optometrists “who have never led me astray” who told him they support the change.
“I trust the providers I spoke to,” Lewis said. “I trust your authority of the board.”
Lewis also noted no one from Kentucky appeared to speak against the change.
“Does anyone that is speaking in opposition currently live in Kentucky?” he asked.
No one responded.
But Dr. Chip Richardson, a Georgetown ophthalmologist who has been following the proposed change, said in an interview he opposes it as a matter of “patient safety” since optometrists in Kentucky are allowed to do far more than conduct routine eye exams.
“As we expand the optometrists’ privileges in the state of Kentucky, we should increase the rigors of licensure as opposed to decreasing it,” he said. The proposed change is “offensive to those who got licensed under rigorous standards and it devalues an optometric education.”
‘Ongoing monopoly’
Among arguments the optometric board made in favor of allowing the Canadian exam is that it is more accessible because it is offered online.
Ellis, at the hearing, suggested opponents are “trying to protect an ongoing monopoly of the testing industry in the United States.”
And he pointed out candidates for licensure in Kentucky would still be required to pass parts 2 and 3 of the national exam, which cover patient diagnosis and treatment, including simulated encounters with patients.
Supporters of the national exam say it is offered in a more secure setting, with part 1, the multiple choice test on scientific and medical knowledge, offered at testing sites under supervision.
Other opponents who have submitted written comments against the change include the Association of Regulatory Boards of Optometry (of which Kentucky’s board is a member),  the Federation of Associations of Regulatory Boards and the National Association of VA Optometrists.
The Nevada Board of Optometry also has submitted a letter opposed to the change, saying it could affect reciprocity, in which state boards accept credentials of optometrists from other states.
Under the proposed change, candidates unable to pass part 1 of the national exam could become licensed in Kentucky by passing the Canadian exam, then seek licensure in another state, the letter said.
To prevent such a situation, the Nevada legislature recently passed legislation mandating that Nevada permit licensure of candidates licensed in other states only if they have passed each part of the national optometric exam, it said.
Candidates unable to pass the national exam “need additional education to improve their knowledge and skills, not a lowering of the standards for licensure,” it said.
The Kentucky optometric board next meets June 20, where the national exam board hopes to make its case against the exam change. It has submitted written comments for the meeting outlining its concerns.
Bryant, director of the national examiners’ board, said members of the national exam group will attend the board meeting.
“The U.S. and Canadian exams do not represent interchangeable parts,” she said. “It puts the validity of the licensure exam at risk.”

It stayed on overhead from 6:30 in the morning until 11:30 at night. Which was a surprise for the 34-year-old New Hampshire resident because he always thought of prison as a dark place, like in the 1999 movie “The Green Mile.” His cell wasn’t fully dark at night either. Guards with flashlights regularly checked on everyone held at the Wyatt Detention Facility.
Schmidt was housed among other Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees apart from the larger inmate population held by the U.S. Marshals Service awaiting federal court proceedings. Yet he learned other ICE detainees faced serious charges, including murder, sexual assault, and drug-dealing. The mission of the Wyatt — a quasi-public maximum security facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island’s smallest city — is to “protect the public from people who pose a threat to society.” 
Schmidt never committed any violent crime.
Instead, he got off a plane at Boston’s Logan International Airport on March 7 on his return from a 10-day trip to visit family and friends in his native Germany. Schmidt obtained his green card as a teenager and became a U.S. permanent resident. But for some reason, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents pulled him aside. 
They aggressively asked him about past misdemeanors from 10 years ago when he lived in California — including a charge of drug possession that had been adjudicated. They asked about his annual income, where his parents lived, and what they did for a living. 
He was held for hours, which turned into days during which he was denied the chance to speak with a lawyer, his family, or the German Consulate. At one point, Schmidt said he was strip-searched and thrown into a cold shower. He was given only a thin mat to sleep on and fed a cold cup of noodles. He collapsed after developing flu-like symptoms and was transported to Mass General Hospital, where he was handcuffed to the bed. 
After being discharged from the hospital, Schmidt was taken back to the airport. On March 11, four days after his return from Europe, CBP agents came to get him. 
“That’s the first time I went to Rhode Island,” he recalled in a recent interview at a coffee shop near his home in Nashua. “In hand shackles, feet shackles, in the back of an SUV going like 80 miles an hour.”
He speaks softly, with a faint accent, sometimes pausing to note the surreal facts of the 58 days he spent inside the Wyatt. 
In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Rhode Island Current, “When an individual is found with drug related charges and tries to re-enter the country, officers will take proper action. In this case, the conviction was dismissed, and the individual was released.” 
In several posts on the platform X , McLaughlin has called clips from news reports on Schmidt’s treatment by CBP at Logan “blatantly false,” “straight-up false,” and “flat-out FALSE.” 
Schmidt is readjusting to life back home. He said the ordeal cost him tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, lost wages from his job as a master electrician, and expenses for food, clothing, and phone calls home to his worried girlfriend. He is considering filing a lawsuit, though he doesn’t have details to share about that yet.
“This whole experience feels like a movie,” he said.

Not knowing why
Schmidt’s story is one of dozens of accounts of hyper-aggressive immigration enforcement since the start of Donald Trump’s second term. There’s the Canadian woman with a U.S. work visa detained by ICE for two weeks who wrote she felt like she had been “kidnapped;” the visiting scholar at Georgetown University with an academic visa held without charges at an ICE detention facility in Texas; the pair of Georgia newlyweds separated after the bride, an asylum seeker from Colombia, was detained by ICE. 
According to the Syracuse University-based public records database, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), 19,125 people were booked into ICE detention in March, when Schmidt was first detained. His case drew headlines because it initially made no sense.
New Hampshire’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan described the case as “very concerning,” while Massachusetts Democratic State Rep. Mike Connolly called Schmidt’s detention “outrageous” and “unlawful.” On X, a Canadian law professor’s post about Schmidt was shared more than 2,000 times. 
His case also highlighted the Wyatt’s role at the center of a yearslong political firestorm. Several public officials, including Rhode Island General Treasurer James Diossa, previously the mayor of Central Falls, have called for its closure. State lawmakers have introduced bills to close it down or, in the case of active bills in the House and Senate sessions, to stop ICE’s ability to do business with Wyatt for civil immigration violations. Community members regularly hold protests outside the Wyatt’s walls to draw attention to people detained inside. Since Trump’s inauguration, there have been at least six such rallies. 
One, on March 18, was for Schmidt. Outside the Wyatt, people chanted his name and held signs that read “FREE FABIAN” and “DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION.” 
Schmidt heard them from inside. It gave him a surge of adrenaline. And a realization.
“Whoa,” he recalled thinking at the time. “This is bigger than myself.”
Schmidt spent his childhood traveling with his mother and stepfather, who worked as a tech consultant. He has lived in Denmark, South Africa, and England; he can read and write in four languages. When he was 16, his stepfather’s work brought the family to Palo Alto, California. His stepfather’s visa was for people with extraordinary abilities in their field — often called a “genius visa” — and granted Schmidt legal entry as a dependent. Schmidt rode horses, played football, and embraced his new home. 
In 2022, he moved to Nashua to be closer to his mother, who had moved there. After a stint as a bartender, he found work as an electrical project lead at two affiliated companies: Greenerd Press & Machine Co., in Nashua, and Diamond Casting, in Hollis. 
Ian Wilson, a process engineer at Diamond Casting, called Schmidt a crucial member of the company. “He’s upstanding, friendly, gregarious, and very energetic,” he said.

While bartending, Schmidt met and fell in love with Bhavani Hodgkins, who is now his fiancée. (Schmidt has an 8-year-old daughter from a previous relationship who lives with her mother in California.) He and Hodgkins have a black Lab named Django. 
“This is where I’m from,” he said. “I love this country.” 
Low-quality food, high fees
The Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility opened in 1993 on the site of a former textile factory. At the time, it helped address a shortage in pre-trial federal jail space in New England. During the search for a suitable Rhode Island site, a few cities and towns opposed the facility. But long-struggling Central Falls saw an economic opportunity. 
Shortly after the facility opened, then-Mayor Thomas Lazieh called the Wyatt “a win now and a much bigger win down the road.”
The ensuing years brought some payments from the detention center to the city; Central Falls received a total of $5.3 million in impact fees from Wyatt from 1994 through 2008, according to a 2012 joint legislative commission.
But Wyatt also brought escapes, lawsuits over detainee mistreatment, criminal charges against staff members and wardens, a receivership, and — most notably — the 2008 death of an ICE detainee involving medical neglect and mistreatment. 
The death of that detainee, Hiu Lui “Jason” Ng, prompted ICE to withdraw from the Wyatt for a decade. In 2019, the agency returned, amid an outcry from community groups, the Rhode Island ACLU, and elected officials. 
Today, the facility boasts a capacity of up to 730 adult male and 40 adult female detainees. According to a report in late March, the facility held 617 detainees for the U.S. Marshals Service (590 male, 27 female), and 116 detainees for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (112 male, 4 female). One of those male ICE detainees was Schmidt.
He was housed in 10-by-7-foot cells with thick, pneumatically locking steel doors. One cell looked out over Macomber Stadium, where Central Falls High School plays athletics.

The food was so bad, he said, he wouldn’t feed it to his dog. Breakfast was some kind of “oversalted…flour soup,” Schmidt said, along with a pinkish sausage of unknown origin, a dry piece of cornbread, and a serving of lukewarm milk. Lunch and dinner consisted of food that came from a can — chicken, green beans — and powdered potatoes that tasted like cardboard. 
Schmidt’s account of the food provided at the Wyatt echoes a March report by the community organization Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance (AMOR), which states, “In the first two weeks of March, AMOR received messages from 16 people detained by ICE who specified that they would not have enough to eat without help purchasing food from the Commissary.”
Schmidt was scared, sad, and depressed during his weeks at the Wyatt. He missed his daughter, his partner, his dog. 
“Mentally, you have to learn how to block that out in prison or else you’ll ruin yourself,” he said. “You have to be able to be like, ‘OK, I’m not gonna miss my dog today.’” 
In April, Hodgkins shared a note Schmidt wrote in a Facebook post: “Time moves differently in here. It drags, heavy and cruel…I haven’t seen the sky in weeks.”
After Schmidt was moved to the Wyatt, Hodgkins spent hours on the phone — with him, his family members, attorneys and others — trying to strategize how to secure his release and ensure his safety and comfort until then. She was forced to navigate the substantial financial burden of having a loved one detained at Wyatt. 
To supplement the Wyatt’s food options, Schmidt needed to purchase food items from the commissary. He needed money to buy more toothpaste and soap because supplies issued to detainees didn’t last very long. Hodgkins created accounts so Schmidt could receive packages and communicate with her, via phone or video-chat. 
“Every single thing that you do at the Wyatt Detention Facility requires (a) form of payment,” she said.
A receipt Hodgkins shared on Facebook shows, between March 12 and May 6, she spent more than $2,600 in deposits into the facility’s TouchPay system — deposits requiring fees ranging from around 6% of a deposit to more than 40%. In one instance, she was charged a $4.30 fee for a $10 deposit. The total fees, across 25 deposits, add up to more than $220. 
  A record of deposits Bhavani Hodgkins made into Fabian Schmidt’s commissary account shows the fees she paid during the 58 days he was held at the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls. (Screenshot)​​
Here, again, Hodgkins’ experiences aligned with conditions described in AMOR’s report, which says Wyatt contractors charge “exorbitant” rates for basic services, including phone calls, text messages, and food to supplement insufficient nutrition. 
“In the first two weeks of March, 20 people detained reported to AMOR that calls were too expensive,” the report’s authors write. “During the same period, 43 individuals made new requests for Commissary help.” 
As she navigated these new challenges, Hodgkins said she was dealing with waves of her own anger, anguish, and sadness. She was fearful for Fabian’s health and safety, that he would be deported, that they would lose the life they had built together. 
Hodgkins rearranged her work schedule so she could make the 80-mile drive from Nashua to Central Falls in time to meet the facility’s strict rules that visitors arrive at least 30 minutes before visiting hours. During one visit, she saw an elderly woman with a walker turned away for arriving too late.
Hodgkins found the facility intimidating: a massive concrete building with small windows surrounded by tall razor wire fences. The “visits” were, in fact, a phone conversation with Schmidt while the two were separated by glass in a room lit by fluorescent lights. Once, when she washed her hands inside the facility, she noticed the water had a yellowish tinge.
“I really hope that no one has to go there to see their loved ones, because it’s truly horrible,” she said. 
ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When Rhode Island Current reached out to the Wyatt with detailed questions about the conditions both Hodgkins and Schmidt described, a spokesperson responded: “The Wyatt has no comment at this time.”
No problem with international travel in 2017
When protesters assembled outside the Wyatt on March 18 to call for Schmidt’s release, his lawyer, David Keller, said Schmidt’s past issues in California had been resolved and there hadn’t been any new official charges pressed against his client. 
“Imagine yourself being charged with a crime, held, and not even knowing what the crime is,” he told reporters. “That’s essentially his situation.” (Keller was unavailable to comment for this story.)
About a week later, Schmidt finally learned the reason for his detention: a misdemeanor charge for drug possession from California that had already been resolved. Schmidt had pleaded no contest to the charge in 2015, despite disputing that the drugs were his; he was unaware that the controlled-substance conviction marked him in the immigration system as inadmissible. He said he was never notified of these implications of a no-contest plea, nor had he been stopped by CBP after an earlier international trip in 2017. 
Once the immigration charges against Schmidt became clear, lawyers for Schmidt on both coasts swung into action. In California, a criminal attorney re-opened the drug case and was able to get it dismissed from the system. (Grounds for that dismissal: the substance Schmidt was charged with possessing had never been tested to confirm what it was.) In Boston, his immigration attorney worked to secure a hearing with an immigration judge. 
The hearing finally happened on May 8. The judge dismissed Schmidt’s immigration case in minutes. 










Time moves differently in here. It drags, heavy and cruel…I haven’t seen the sky in weeks.

Schmidt and Hodgkins finally reunited outside of ICE’s Boston field office in Burlington, Massachusetts. The days since then have been joyful. Shortly after his release, Schmidt proposed to Hodgkins. He has enjoyed regular walks with his dog, cooking dinner with Hodgkins and reconnecting with friends. 
But the couple’s life together is much different from the way it used to be. Schmidt estimates his time in custody cost him at least $65,000, between legal fees, lost wages, and the many costs of his Wyatt detention. An online fundraiser by his mother raised over $34,000. A second fundraiser launched by Hodgkins “to help aid other legal immigrants with injustice” is ongoing. 
The emotional toll has also been steep. In the early days after his release, he couldn’t take a nap while home alone, afraid people might come for him while he was sleeping. Routine activities like a trip to the grocery store can now trigger waves of panic. He is wary about driving, fearful of being pulled over and detained again over a minor infraction. 
“I have to be strong when he’s not, and I can’t show my fear as much because I don’t want him to get fearful,” Hodgkins said. “We’re going to spend the rest of our life healing from this trauma.”

The couple have embraced new roles as advocates for immigrants navigating an unforgiving system. They are calling for more transparency in the detention process, to spare others from the weeks of confusion they experienced. And they are speaking out against the heavy-handed response Schmidt faced for what was essentially a paperwork issue. 
As dark as his experience was, Schmidt said he benefited from privileges many other ICE detainees lack. He’s a white man who speaks fluent English, with access to a top-notch legal team. 
“I don’t even want to know what’s happening to other people,” he said. 
Although the Wyatt holds immigration-related detainees, Hodgkins wants people to understand it is designed to hold criminals. She said the staff there had no interest in helping her with the logistics of visitation or keeping her partner comfortable and connected while inside. 
“They’re not going to be nice to you,” she said. “They’re not going to be helpful to you.” 
Schmidt went back to work in early June. When he was away, his projects were either put on hold, or his work had to be delegated to other people, Wilson, his coworker, said.
“I’m very relieved that he’s been released,” he said, “and very concerned for our judicial system.”
In a June 2 Facebook post, Hodgkins wrote about feeling anxious, even as Schmidt was excited about his first day back to work. 
“No one prepares you for the fear and uncertainty that comes with being separated from a loved one under such traumatic circumstances,” she wrote. 
“But today, we’re beginning to find our rhythm again.”

A look at their political spending helps explain why. (Getty Images)FRANKFORT, Ky. – For decades, optometrists have wielded what seems to be outsized influence in Frankfort.
In 2011, for instance, they rammed a controversial bill through the General Assembly in a matter of days that significantly expanded the types of care optometrists can provide, despite warnings of risks by ophthalmologists, the medical doctors trained in eye care.
In a massive lobbying blitz, optometrists from throughout Kentucky flooded the Capitol, packed committee hearings, greeted lawmakers from their home counties and won passage in just 11 days of a bill that expanded their ability to provide laser and other eye surgeries, prescribe controlled drugs and perform other procedures previously limited to ophthalmologists.
Optometrists also made more than $400,000 in donations to candidates and political causes during that period, according to an analysis by the Courier Journal. They donated to 137 of the 138 members of the legislature — skipping only one, a physician who had announced he would not vote for what he called “a terrible bill.”
“It really was like a blitz,” said Dr. Chip Richardson, a Georgetown ophthalmologist who followed the passage of Senate Bill 110 in 2011. “It was a surprise bill that appeared with no warning.”
As a result, Kentucky “has one of the broadest scopes of practice for optometrists in the United States,” according to the National Board of Examiners in Optometry, which tests candidates for licensure in all 50 states.
Optometrists, who hold a four-year advanced degree in eye care, argued the bill would improve access to quality care and make it more affordable.
At the time, some legislators credited the success of the optometrists to the effort the group had made to establish a relationship with lawmakers.
Outspending doctors, bankers PACs
The relationship is nurtured by 11 registered lobbyists retained by the Kentucky Optometric Association, including super lobbyists John McCarthy, the national committeeman for the Republican Party of Kentucky, and Amy Wickliffe, the former finance chair for the Republican Party of Kentucky.
But the relationship is mostly sustained by a strong, steady flow of campaign cash to those in power in Frankfort, including — but not limited to — Republicans who hold a supermajority in the General Assembly. 
The Kentucky Lantern’s analysis of online records of the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance and the Federal Election Commission shows that in the past four years, optometrists have made more than $700,000 in contributions to candidates for the General Assembly, governor, other statewide offices and the two state political parties.

The big beneficiaries of the donations are those who wield the power in Frankfort — the Republican supermajorities in the General Assembly and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear.
Most of the more than $700,000 was contributed by the Kentucky Optometric Association’s political action committee called Optometric PAC. The Lantern’s analysis shows that Optometric PAC has made 483 contributions since Jan. 1, 2021, totaling about $400,000 to help candidates for the General Assembly. But the PAC contributions were supplemented by more than $300,000 in contributions to candidates for the legislature, governor and other state offices during the same period from more than 100 individual optometrists.
Though not as large as the seven-figure amounts donated by a couple of out-of-state billionaires to affect Kentucky elections in recent years, the Optometric PAC contributions are larger than those of most Kentucky special interest groups. The election registry website shows Optometric PAC gave more in contributions in the past two years than the political action committees of the Kentucky Medical Association and the Kentucky Bankers Association.
Dr. Michael Smith, treasurer of the Optometric PAC, described the political contributions as part of engagement with officials.
“Kentucky optometrists have a long history of civic engagement,” he said in a statement.  “The Optometric PAC supports elected leaders who share our goals of accessible, quality health care for Kentuckians.”
Optometric PAC’s contributions are as consistent as clockwork. Most of the 138 state legislators get at least $250 – even those in the tiny Democratic minority. But the big money goes to help re-elect majority Republicans. Optometric PAC has given $20,000 each over to the Republican Party of Kentucky, the House Republican Caucus and Republican Party of Kentucky since Jan. 1, 2021. Majority leaders and key Republicans get more than others. For instance, the campaign committees of House Speaker David Osborne, Speaker Pro Tem David Meade, Majority Floor Leader Steven Rudy, and Majority Caucus Chair Suzanne Miles each received $8,200 from Optometric PAC since Jan. 1, 2021.
Optometrists push to change licensing exam

Among others who got larger amounts is Rep. Derek Lewis, the London Republican who cochairs the Administrative Regulations Review Subcommittee. Lewis has received $5,700 from Optometric PAC in the past four years. In addition, last October, 14 individual optometrists bundled contributions totaling $3,275 to Lewis’ campaign committee.
Currently the optometrists are seeking a change in state regulations to allow candidates for licensure to substitute an exam offered by Canada for a portion of the standard, national exam — drawing criticism by opponents, who say it is less rigorous than the exam currently used by all 50 states.
Lewis, whose committee heard testimony on the optometrists’ proposal in April, said at the time he was inclined to favor the effort by the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners to allow the Canadian portion of the exam, saying “all the optometrists I spoke to across the state are for this.”

Optometric PAC did not make a contribution to either candidate in the 2023 general election for governor, but scores of individual optometrists did.
Election registry records show that the largest share of the optometrist contributions during the period went to the reelection campaign of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear: 64 optometrists bundled contributions totaling more than $68,000 to Beshear’s reelection committee. In addition, the Optometric PAC donated $15,000 to the Kentucky Democratic Party while Beshear was raising money for his 2023 reelection. Optometric PAC also donated $2,500 to Beshear’s 2023 inauguration committee.
By far the most active donor among the individual optometrists since Jan. 1, 2021 was Dr. Joe Ellis, of Benton, president of the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners, which is pushing for the easier Canadian exam, arguing that prospective optometrists may be discouraged by the difficulty of the U.S. test. 
While Ellis has also made contributions to important Republicans like Rudy, Ellis, and Senate President Robert Stivers, the majority of his contributions have gone to Beshear’s political committees. He is among Beshear’s bigger financial backers, giving $4,100 to his reelection campaign, $28,000 to the Kentucky Democratic Party during Besher’s reelection campaign, and $5,000 since Beshear’s reelection to the Beshear super PAC In This Together.
Kentucky secretary of state online records show that Beshear has appointed, and reappointed, Ellis to the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners, the Kentucky Health Benefit Exchange Advisory Board and the Judicial Conduct Commission.
Beshear’s opponent in the 2023 governor’s election, Republican Daniel Cameron, also got donations from at least 31 optometrists totaling more than $25,000.

For three straight presidential elections, Pennsylvania’s arguably been the most pivotal swing state in the nation.
After Donald Trump was able to flip the Keystone State in 2016, only for Joe Biden to narrowly win it back in 2020, the commonwealth became the top target for both parties by the beginning of the 2024 election cycle. When it was all said and done, Pennsylvania was once again the tipping-point state, as it was in 2016. Moreover, 2024 was also the third consecutive presidential contest where the final margin of victory was less than two points:
2016: 44,292 Votes; 0.72% Margin
2020: 80,555 Votes; 1.17% Margin
2024: 120,266 Votes; 1.71% Margin
Trump’s win in 2024 was still noticeably larger than his previous victory in 2016 and his defeat in 2020. So, how exactly did this happen?
The Prelude: 2021 to 2024
Biden’s Fall
Joe Biden was elected amid the COVID-19 pandemic because the public thought he’d do a better job ending the crisis and transitioning the country out of the morass. Biden’s campaign, however, was always positioned as a moral crusade, exemplified by his slogan: “a battle for the soul of the nation.” The former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair was also deeply concerned over how Donald Trump was affecting America’s image on the world stage.
So as COVID-19 cases receded in 2021-2022, the public grew far more concerned about the after-effect of increased inflation, which hit its highest point in four decades. Yet all the while, President Biden’s focus remained on foreign affairs and the nation’s soul. This strategy was emblematic of Biden’s philosophy of defending institutions, and seeking to build them back up after the turmoil of the Trump years. The drawback is that it made Biden the institutionalist president at a time when Americans were souring on just about every institution imaginable. So as inflation and high prices persisted for years, swing voters saw Biden as part of the problem.

Nonetheless, Democrats had a historically successful midterm election in 2022, losing just 9 House seats while gaining one Senate seat and two governorships. In Pennsylvania particularly, the party did especially well behind Gov. Josh Shapiro’s 15- point landslide victory. Not only did John Fetterman defeat Mehmet Oz in the commonwealth’s open U.S. Senate race, but Democrats also flipped the state House for the first time in a dozen years. Such a performance gave the Biden team confidence that their “soul of the nation” strategy – which they doubled down on with a September 2022 primetime address outside Philadelphia’s Independence Hall – would not only secure a second term, but that Pennsylvania would once again be a key component.
Trump’s Rise
As Biden began a slow, steady fall downward from the heights of his inauguration, Donald Trump rode a characteristically scattershot path to victory. Despite several assertions of “the greatest comeback in American history,” in these years Trump’s return was less of an unthinkable impossibility and more of a slowly growing and looming cloud.
Republican congressional leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy refused to ensure Trump never held office again in the wake of his unprecedented attempts to overturn the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. That included the Senate falling short in its effort to impeach Trump, which according to the Constitution, would have disqualified him from running for office.

Throughout 2021 and 2022, while U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland was slowly building a case to prosecute Trump, the ex-president was still leading early 2024 surveys and therefore his endorsement remained a must-have for Republican congressional candidates. So when Ron DeSantis’ primary campaign imploded in early 2023, Trump was free to devote all his time to his anticipated rematch with Biden.
Consequently, Trump began working behind the scenes to win back billionaire media moguls like Rupert Murdoch and Elon Musk (who bought Twitter in 2022), as well as neutralize former foes like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeffrey Bezos. As a result, the social media ecosystem was far more Trump-friendly than it had been in 2020.
In retrospect, the fall of 2023 ended up being an inflection point in the race. That September, Donald Trump took a lead over Joe Biden in both the Decision Desk HQ and RealClearPolitics national poll averages that he’d never relinquish. That same month, Hunter Biden was indicted on firearm charges, a move that his father felt was political retribution caused by the various federal and state indictments of Donald Trump earlier that year.
Moreover, the Oct. 7 attacks against Israel precipitated a bloody battle in Gaza that dominated headlines and split the Democratic coalition. For a president obsessed with foreign relations, Biden would spend considerable time on this conflict, yet was unable to successfully stop the fighting.
Biden’s staff began to notice accelerated signs of aging in the incumbent. Post-debate reporting and post-election books both identify this as the period when Biden’s decline became particularly precipitous. By early 2024, sizable majorities of voters (and even Democrats) told pollsters they thought Biden was too old and wanted an alternative candidate. The Biden camp, however, was convinced that voters would come around once they realized it was a binary choice between Biden or Trump.
After all, Biden’s 2020 primary campaign only prevailed when voters rallied around him to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders ahead of the Super Tuesday contests. Two years later, Biden was burdened by abysmal approval ratings, only to surge after the Dobbs abortion decision ignited the base and avoided a midterm wipe-out. The lesson Biden and his team appeared to take from these instances was that they weren’t obligated to answer the public’s concerns, that voters would instead be forced to once again flock back to them at the last minute.
According to the book “Original Sin” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Biden’s longest serving aide Mike Donilon would frequently point to how they’d overcome aging concerns during the 2020 campaign and assert, “He’s going to get elected again with people thinking he’s too old”.
Moreover, in today’s ultra-polarized environment, Biden was never too far behind in the polls. In fact, as Trump stood trial in New York City and was eventually convicted, Biden was able to narrow the gap with Trump and seemed poised to pull ahead as they approached their unusually early summer debate.

The Chaotic Summer
The Debate, the Shooting and the Switch
The June 27 debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump was the equivalent of a political earthquake. Biden’s shockingly terrible performance, and his stubborn refusal to realize he could not recover politically, led to three-and-a-half weeks of questions as Democrats publicly fretted about how to push Biden out of the race.
Trump’s luck turned as well. Just four days after the debate, the Supreme Court on a party-line 6-3 vote delayed Trump’s Jan. 6 trial past Election Day. Another attempt to hold Trump legally accountable for his actions was avoided, freeing him to spend more time on the campaign trail and preventing a high-profile reminder of his failure to stop rioters from driving Congress from its chambers.
Only 12 days later, an assassin shot Donald Trump and killed an attendee during a rally in Butler. The failed attempt on Trump’s life served to further motivate his supporters, provided Elon Musk an opportunity to officially declare his support, and encouraged more bro-sphere podcasters to feature him as a guest. Furthermore, it undercut Democrats’ central argument that Trump was a fundamental threat to the Republic, as the media was newly sensitive to any commentary that could be seen as inciting violence against Trump.
Within 48 hours, Trump announced JD Vance as his vice presidential pick, and three days after that, delivered his acceptance address at the 2024 Republican National Convention. As a result of this cavalcade of events, Trump’s lead in national and Pennsylvania polls hit their highest point of the entire campaign.

For as quickly as the race was turned upside down, it was upended yet again when Biden dropped out and was replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris. By early August, Harris was able to take the lead nationally and in the commonwealth, putting Trump behind for the first time since the fall of 2023. Newly-enthusiastic Democrats packed stadiums to see Harris and running mate Tim Walz, including for their debut in Philadelphia. Harris rode this momentum through her sole debate with Trump in early September, where she bested her opponent and consequently boosted her numbers to an all-time high.
Fall of Bad Campaign Decisions
At this point in the campaign, Harris was not only clearly up in Pennsylvania, but other swing states like Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin. Yet by Election Day, Trump had caught Harris nationally and in nearly every swing state, as most polls found it to be a margin of error race in the final days.
So what caused Harris’ lead to evaporate over the course of October? Well, there’s no shortage of theories, with one of the more popular premises suggesting that the Trump team’s TV ad avalanche concerning Harris’ past positions on transgender issues was the culprit.
But Trump attributes his victory more to the border and immigration than any social issues. For their part, the Harris team found that the most effective attack ad from the Trump campaign wasn’t any of the ones dealing with transgender issues, but rather a spot featuring Harris praising ‘Bidenomics’.
Then there’s the issue of Kamala Harris herself, as the vice president’s personality proved to be a poor fit for this unusual race. While she was always a cautious and considerate candidate throughout her political career, the unique circumstances of this abbreviated campaign called for someone more willing to take bold chances.
“We shouldn’t have been playing this thing so safe,” her running mate Tim Walz concluded in March 2025. “I think we probably should have just rolled the dice and done the town halls. We, as a party, are more cautious.” Walz also echoed the post-election claims of Harris’ top advisors, that their own polls never showed her in the lead. “In football parlance, we were in a prevent defense to not lose when we never had anything to lose because I don’t think we were ever ahead.”
Meanwhile, progressives feel that a post-debate, centrist pivot away from her economic populist message caused her campaign to stall. They found the decision to hold three rallies with Liz Cheney in one day particularly galling. A few weeks after the election, David Plouffe answered these critics by asserting: “When you’re being attacked as being a crazy, out-of-touch, California liberal; when you have generals and former Republican elected officials saying ‘I’m for Kamala Harris’, that helps rebut that. In many respects, that’ll be more effective than what she would say herself.”
Yet in their attempt to convince voters that Harris was moderate, they swung too closely back to Biden’s original institutionalist strategy. Instead of convincing toss-up voters that Harris wasn’t a radical, the approach gave the impression that Harris was part of the same old system people desperately wanted to change.

To that point, Biden and Harris’ complex relationship was an immensely important dynamic in this race that’s worth delving into.
Joe Biden first approached the “veepstakes” as a two-time failed presidential candidate in 2008, when Barack Obama sought out a gray-haired eminence for his VP. Obama asked for and received a pledge from Biden that he wouldn’t try to run for president again. As then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saw her favorability numbers skyrocket during their first term, some Obama staffers even considered swapping out Biden for her in 2012. With Hillary in a more advantageous position, Obama began to explicitly favor her for 2016, which caused Biden to grow deeply resentful, believing he’d done a good enough job as vice president to earn Obama’s support.
So Kamala Harris stepped into a fraught position, especially considering the lingering anger from Jill Biden and Biden campaign staff over Harris’ 2019 debate attack on Biden.
Once in office, Biden refused to spend any political capital to pave the way for Harris. After all, if Harris began to poll better than Biden for 2024, the clamor to replace him would begin to gain real traction. So Harris instead got saddled with tough portfolios, like the border, that caused her numbers to drop and pundits to doubt her effectiveness.
By July 2024, when Harris’ numbers finally did surpass Biden’s and she took over the nomination, it behooved her to make a clean break from Biden as she sought her own term. Harris, however, seemed to believe voters would judge her harshly if she knifed her former running mate. According to Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper, Harris pushed back against the suggestion that she separate from Biden. “If I were to really distinguish myself, how would that make me look? Disloyal,” she told them.
Biden didn’t help matters either, stubbornly insisting that Harris defend their record and reportedly telling her “No daylight, kid” before her debate with Trump. Harris appeared to take that advice to heart; appearing with Biden at his convention send-off, then for a joint event in Maryland, and even a third hand-off ceremony in Pittsburgh on Labor Day.
Of course, Harris’ worst moment of the campaign arguably came when she refused to highlight any differences with Biden during her Oct. 8 appearance on The View. Not so coincidentally, mid-October is right around when Harris’ downturn in the polls began.
All the while, Biden continued to make damaging gaffes on the campaign trail. First, he called to “lock [Trump] up” while stumping in New Hampshire. Even worse, during a livestream interview inexplicably scheduled right before Harris’ closing address in D.C., Biden called Trump supporters “garbage”, neutralizing a scandal that was hurting Trump in the final week of the race.

Going into Election Day, it was apparent that Kamala Harris would have to put together record margins for a Democratic presidential nominee in Philadelphia as well as its four suburban collar counties: Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery. In 2012, Barack Obama set the high water mark for Philly with a 492,339 vote margin, while in the suburbs Joe Biden’s 2020 performance was best, as he won by 293,094.
Yet Harris finished nowhere close to those marks, winning Philadelphia by 424,260 and the collar counties by 243,386. Had Harris hit Biden and Obama’s margins, those 117,787 votes would’ve nearly erased Trump’s statewide advantage of 120,266. Just two years ago, Gov. Shapiro won the suburbs by 388,273, the best showing yet for a statewide Democratic candidate. That wide gulf between Shapiro and Harris illustrates just how far short she fell from her potential ceiling.
This reality is particularly damning for Democrats, because in the Trump Era they depended on substantial suburban margins to make up for Republicans posting record rural results and steadily eating into Dems’ urban advantages. To wit, Harris’ aforementioned Philly margin was far behind Hillary’s (475,277) and Biden’s (471,050) margins, thanks to Trump’s ongoing improvement with non-white voters.
As for the suburbs, by a slim 291 votes, Donald Trump managed to become the first Republican to carry Bucks County since George H.W. Bush in 1988. He pulled this off by securing support in ancestrally Democratic Lower Bucks, carrying precincts in places that have been trending red for a while now, like Bensalem, Falls and Middleton townships. Not so coincidentally, Bucks is also the only collar county that’s recently lost population in several spots, Lower Bucks among them. Concurrently, Harris couldn’t continue to maximize her gains in white-collar Central Bucks, where she held one of her most high-profile ‘Country Over Party’ campaign events alongside dozens of Republicans in Washington’s Crossing.
Lehigh Valley

Four years ago, the Lehigh Valley was perhaps the sole region where Biden left votes on the table, thanks to his underperformance with Hispanics. Pennsylvania is home to hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans, not only in Philadelphia, but in cities like Allentown, Bethlehem and Reading as well.
Democrats were hopeful that the crude comments made during Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally in New York City would inspire Puerto Rican voters in these areas to turn out and support Harris. Despite ample anecdotal evidence, however, this surge never arrived and Harris saw her Hispanic support plummet.
Take, for example, the majority Hispanic city of Allentown. As pointed out by J. Miles Coleman of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, Allentown swung nearly 20 points towards Trump between 2016 and 2024. At the same time, the Allentown Morning Call found, Trump improved on his 2020 showing against Biden in all 20 of the Hispanic-heavy precincts they surveyed.
This all meant that Harris performed well behind Biden’s pace in Lehigh County, which Biden won by 14,080 votes (7.58%), while Harris carried it by just 5,110 (2.69%). In neighboring Berks County it was a similar story, as Trump added another 8,742 votes onto his 2020 margin. He also carried the bellwether county of Northampton – which along with Erie was one of PA’s two Obama/Trump/Biden/Trump counties – by 3,162 votes (1.77%) after losing it by 1,233 votes (0.72%) four years ago.

Amid the larger statewide swing towards Donald Trump, several counties in this region actually moved towards Harris, with neighbors Adams and Franklin forming a line of blue-trending counties running all the way up to Union. In fact, most of the counties where Harris bested Biden were rural counties where Trump apparently hit his ceiling.
One exception was Cumberland County, which thanks to the sprawling Harrisburg suburbs, was one of the few areas in the nation to shift towards Democrats for three straight presidential elections. To that point, Harris’ 44.45% was the most for a Democratic presidential nominee since LBJ won it in his 1964 landslide.
Yet the most populous counties in south central Pennsylvania, Lancaster and York, stayed loyal to Trump. Democrats were initially hopeful that they could make in-roads here, especially after Josh Shapiro nearly carried Lancaster in 2022. Nevertheless, Trump was able to secure a small increase in his Lancaster margin, improving from 44,362 in 2020 to 46,142 in 2024. His growth in York County proved even larger, as he picked up 4,339 votes from four years ago. As a result, Harris’ gains in the other regional counties here were fully nullified.

Whereas Harris lost a ton of ground in Philadelphia, it was an entirely different story across the state in Allegheny County. Trump’s improvement there was one of his weakest anywhere in the state, gaining just 1,525 votes or 0.18% from his 2020 performance.
In nearly every neighboring county, however, the swing towards Trump continued. After a temporary reprieve in 2020, Appalachia continued to somehow become redder and redder as Trump posted some of the best numbers here for a Republican presidential nominee in a century. Leading the way was Westmoreland County, where Trump won by 60,104 votes, his second-highest margin statewide.
The Harris campaign tried to keep margins down by sending Harris and Walz to stump in Beaver County on Aug. 18. Despite some recent Democratic wins – Bob Casey,Tom Wolf in 2018, and Josh Shapiro in 2022 – these efforts were unsuccessful, as Trump improved upon his 2020 performance here, increasing his margin from 16,637 (17.63%) to 19,641 (20.64%).
Ironically, the one county in the southwest region where Harris slightly improved over Biden was Butler, site of the failed assassination attempt against Trump. So while the shooting had an aforementioned impact on the national campaign, contrary to Sen. Fetterman’s claim, there was no apparent effect specific to this region.

Erie County continued its incredible track record as a bellwether for the commonwealth. Since 1948, the winner of Erie also won Pennsylvania in 19 of the past 20 presidential elections (the sole exception was supporting Michael Dukakis in 1988).
In spite of that, President Biden never visited this county during his four years in the White House. Conversely, Donald Trump made Erie his first Pennsylvania stop of the 2024 election cycle, holding an area rally on July 29, 2023, months before any potential primary contest.
Over a year later, Trump returned to the city on Sept. 29, 2024 for another event in a smaller building, and gave his opponents ammunition by admitting to denying his workers’ overtime pay. “I hated to give overtime. I hated it,” he told the largely blue-collar crowd. “I’d get other people. I shouldn’t say this, but I’d get other people in.”
A few weeks later, Kamala Harris made her first campaign visit to Erie, drawing thousands to the Erie Insurance Arena that Trump could fill in 2023, but not 2024. This was all part of a nationwide trend of crowd size analysis that gave Democrats so much hope in the final months of election season.
As for the differences in results between 2020 and 2024, Trump didn’t flip many suburban precincts around the city; in fact, only a few Millcreek districts switched sides from 2020. Nonetheless, Trump shifted the margins in the city and elsewhere enough to go from losing the county by 1.03% to winning it by a nearly identical 1.02%.

As recently as a decade ago, a deep blue line would flow uninterrupted through Lackawanna and Luzerne counties, part of a Scranton/Wilkes-Barre corridor that powered Democratic candidates for years. In 2016, however, Donald Trump transformed the region by gaining more than 10 points each in those counties. While native son Joe Biden widened Hillary’s three point advantage in Lackawanna to eight points, Harris managed to do even worse than Hillary here, winning by less than three.
In addition to eating into Democratic support in the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre themselves, Trump won back precincts in places like Moosic, Old Forge and Taylor in the southwestern portion of Lackawanna. Meanwhile in neighboring Luzerne, Trump’s margin grew to 29,940, considerably higher than the 26,237 and 22,056 margins he posted in 2020 and 2016 respectively.
Furthermore, Trump became the first Republican presidential nominee to carry Monroe County since 2004; prevailing by just 669 votes in a county Biden won by 5,334 votes four years ago. Since Monroe is about 17% Hispanic, this is yet another sign that Harris lost major ground among Pennsylvania’s Hispanic voters.
Conclusion: Candidate Quality
After three straight brutally competitive presidential elections, Democrats find themselves losing ground among nearly every demographic both nationally and in Pennsylvania. Many party leaders and pundits will recount the story of 1992 and advise a pivot to the center. This advice, however, ignores the fact that Bill Clinton and Michael Dukakis were both moderate, DLC Democrats. The difference was Clinton’s far superior communications skills, which allowed him to fight back against Republican attacks much more effectively than Dukakis ever could. The takeaway appears to be candidate quality is a considerably more consequential factor in elections than candidate ideology.
All three Democratic nominees over this period (Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris) were flawed candidates, who’d previously failed to impress a national electorate. Even with Biden’s 2020 win, they could overcome their deficiencies for a time, but they were all ultimately unable to change the actual political environment. Instead they were always reacting to Donald Trump, who despite never winning a majority, managed to dominate American politics over three election cycles.
Given all of the above, the takeaway is that swing voters who decide elections aren’t looking for a candidate who shares their ideology, their race or their gender; they’re looking for a candidate who inspires.

By connecting the dots across the health care system, VITL is making it easier for providers to help patients stay up-to-date on immunizations — a win for individuals and for public health across the state. It’s one more reason Vermont continues to rank among the healthiest states in the country.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tracking immunizations so y[...]","Immunizations have long been one of Vermont’s most powerful public health tools, helping protect both individuals and communities from serious illness. But keeping track of your vaccine status can feel surprisingly complicated.
Who hasn’t had that moment in urgent care, staring blankly when asked, “When was your last tetanus shot?” And if you’re managing not just your own vaccines, but also those of your kids or aging parents, the challenges only multiply.
Health care providers have long relied on a powerful tool for accessing the most complete immunization histories possible for their patients: the Vermont Department of Health’s Vermont Immunization Registry, a secure, centralized system containing Vermonters’ immunization records. Now, that data is even more efficiently accessible to busy primary care providers and practice staff through a partnership between VITL (Vermont’s nonprofit health data sharing network), the Vermont Department of Health, and practices and hospitals around the state.    
VITL offers a new service to primary care practices and other health care provider offices, directly connecting their electronic health records to the Vermont Immunization Registry, so they can query for data in an instant, without opening another program. 
In the past year, VITL delivered immunization data into providers’ electronic health records over half a million times. For patients, it happens behind the scenes, delivering their essential records to their health care providers when and where they need them.
Here are three things to know about how VITL is helping you stay on top of essential immunizations.
1) What is health information sharing?
At the heart of this effort is health information sharing — but what does that actually mean?
In short, it’s the secure electronic sharing of your medical information, like vaccine history, among your providers. VITL connects many Vermont practices and hospitals to each other and centralizes data to create one health record for each Vermonter. That record includes information like your name and date of birth, along with allergies, medications, lab results, and immunizations. 
Having one record from the many places you receive care enables your providers to access a more complete, up-to-date picture of your medical history and current treatments. The data is available to health care providers and staff, insurance providers for certain initiatives such as care coordination, and public health professionals like the staff at the Vermont Department of Health who lead initiatives to keep Vermonters healthy and well. 
2) Faster access to immunization records means better care
A real-world example of this system in action comes from Primary Care Health Partners (PCHP), one of Vermont’s largest independent medical groups.
In the past, PCHP staff often had to manually check state records or call pharmacies to get vaccine histories — a time-consuming process for already busy primary care staff. But now (thanks to the Immunization Registry Query & Response Service, as it is known to the medical community), things have gotten easier.
Now, with just a few clicks, PCHP providers and staff can instantly pull immunization records from the Vermont Immunization Registry right in their own electronic health record, freeing up valuable time for patient care. PCHP estimates their nurses save more than an hour and 20 minutes every day, thanks to the VITL service. This system also ensures that clinicians have the most current immunization data, which is critical for supporting each individual’s health and for protecting vulnerable populations and improving public health outcomes.
3) Updated immunization records help patients stay on schedule
One of the biggest advantages of this system is its ability to help keep immunization schedules on track.
The VITL service enables primary care clinicians and staff to pull immunization records from other providers’ offices — and from clinics and pharmacies — right into their patient’s record for a more comprehensive immunization history. Even better, the system can flag upcoming or overdue immunizations, helping patients and families stay ahead of their health needs even if they can’t track everything themselves.
“Immunizations are crucial for preventing the spread of infectious diseases,” says Amanda Jones, Informatics Director at the Vermont Department of Health. “The Vermont Immunization Registry gives health care providers easy access to individual vaccination records and forecasts future patient immunization needs — this technology is keeping people in Vermont up-to-date on vaccines and really protecting our communities.”
By connecting the dots across the health care system, VITL is making it easier for providers and patients alike to manage immunizations — a win not just for individuals, but also for public health across the state. It’s one more reason Vermont continues to rank among the healthiest states in the country.
If you want to learn more about how VITL shares your health data with health care providers, there is information on vitl.net/sharing. Every Vermonter has options, and you can explore them on the VITL website. The VITL team is also available to talk with you and answer questions about health information sharing Monday–Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., excluding holidays. VITL’s toll-free number is 1-888-980-1243.

Joseph Shekarchi acknowledged the difficulty in crafting a state budget due to uncertainty in D.C. during a State House briefing on Tuesday, June 10, 2025. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Health care may have received top billing in the revised $14.3 billion fiscal year 2026 budget lawmakers unveiled late Tuesday night, but the silent star is its Congressional counterpart.
The federal budget reconciliation bill still under debate in D.C. threatens to topple safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance, and in turn, the state’s carefully balanced budget.
“It seems like Washington doesn’t even know what’s going to happen in Washington,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in a June 12 briefing on the budget with fellow Democratic state representatives. 
Which puts the onus on state lawmakers to prepare, and protect, as best they can in the face of uncertainty. One possibility: returning to Smith Hill in October to revise the fiscal 2026 budget based on any federal changes.
It’s an unusual but not unprecedented move; while the Rhode Island General Assembly typically convenes for six months, from January to June, lawmakers can come back — and they have. In 2020, after the pandemic abruptly curtailed the regular session less than halfway through, lawmakers returned for a brief December session to pass a state budget and appoint judges.
Shekarchi was reluctant to commit to the prospect of a second session this year, though both chambers will keep the option open by not formally adjourning after their final day in June.
“It’s a possibility not a probability,” Shekarchi said. “I don’t want to speculate.”
Senate President Valarie Lawson was also noncommittal.
“We will continue to monitor developments on the federal level and make a determination when the impact becomes clear,” Lawson said in an emailed statement.
What is clear is new language in Rhode Island’s revised fiscal 2026 budget, laying the groundwork for potential overhauls to federal tax policies and funding cuts.
Multiple ‘big beautiful bill’ mentions
The 435-page document contains at least five new sections specifically devoted to addressing uncertainty in D.C., including multiple references to President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” as the federal current tax and spending has been called.  
The Republican budget reconciliation bill is named in Rhode Island’s proposed spending plan specifically in relation to taxes. Lawmakers want to make sure the existing state tax base upon which their revenue calculations rely is shielded from major changes in federal tax code.
Other, first-time additions to the annual state spending plan formalize work that has already begun behind-the-scenes, calling on various state agencies and departments to study and prepare for possible changes to federal grants, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Medicaid comprises more than one-third of the state’s annual budget. Rhode Island also received $343 million in federal food assistance funding in fiscal 2023, the most recent data available. 
“We wanted to recognize the work that’s being done, and memorialize it,” Shekarchi said during the June 12 budget briefing. “We are making sure we are ready.”
Each advisory group is also required to submit a report of recommendations from its review to the governor, House speaker and Senate president, “as soon as practicable after the enactment of the federal budget for fiscal year 2026” and no later than Oct. 31.
And, based on Congressional Republicans’ push to increase cost-sharing requirements in states based on payment mistakes in their food assistance programs, Rhode Island’s revised budget plan also calls for a working group, led by its human services department, to study and make recommendations on how to reduce SNAP under and overpayments. 
In fiscal 2023, Rhode Island’s food assistance program error rate was 12.4% compared with the 11.68% national average. The Congressional reconciliation proposal sets a 6% error rate cap before states have to spend more as a penalty for payment mistakes. 
The reconciliation budget approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in a party-line vote on May 22 sets a 2028 start date on SNAP changes. But Rhode Island administrators want to start preparing now, said Sharon Reynolds Ferland, House fiscal advisor.
“This also sets up an ongoing framework for oversight reporting,” Reynolds Ferland said, speaking to the House Committee on Finance at its June 10 budget hearing.
Shekarchi said state officials remain in “close communication” with its federal delegation on measures out of Congress.
Until then? 
“We’re flying blind to some degree on some it,” Shekarchi said. 
The Rhode Island House of Representatives is scheduled to consider and vote on the revised fiscal 2026 budget at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday. If approved, the spending plan then heads to the Senate, which has not yet scheduled a vote.

(Photo by Julia Steiny for Rhode Island Current)In a buzzy first-grade classroom at Compass School in North Kingstown, kids greet friends while leisurely working on the “Do Now” tasks posted on the white board. Some practice typing with laptop software; others puzzle over books. One group pretends to look busy while chatting discreetly. 
Soon, their teacher, Kerry-Ann Edmondson — “Miss Kerry” to the kids — pulls the class together for a lesson with the lauded University of Florida Learning Institute or UFLI curriculum (pronounced You Fly). UFLI teaches teachers how to help kids learn and apply every skill necessary to acquire accurate, confident reading fluency, with dramatic results. 
During the first part of these 30-minute sessions, the class reviews concepts they’ve already learned, constantly practicing before taking on a new one. Earlier that week, they’d learned about the suffix “ed’ that changes verbs into past tense. 
Today will add to their understanding of suffixes with the “es” that makes words plural. First, Edmondson has students write out sentences at their desks that make “base” words plural, “bosses,” “dishes.” After using a few activities to teach the new concept, Edmondson shifts to helping the kids apply the new concept in a narrative context which naturally has all sorts of opportunities for her to quickly correct mistakes. On the board, Edmondson posts a roughly 100-word story about Alex and two foxes who live in a den near a lake. 
“What is the first thing a reader does?” Edmonson asks. 
“Find the words you don’t know,” chimes a student chorus. 
If a kid can adequately decode a word, getting all the sounds right, but has no idea what the word means, reading didn’t happen. Imagine the English language learners who might be terrific at sounding out words, but need an increasingly broad language background to know what words mean. All kids have gaps in their backgrounds that need attention to get them to fluent reading comprehension. 
The kids flag “lake,” “bush” and “den” as unfamiliar. OK, do any of the kids know what these words mean? One student says a “lake” is a really, really big puddle. They discuss that and the other words, teasing out meanings with Edmonson’s encouragement. 
The story is full of plurals as well as present tense verbs that end with “s,” which is confusing. More than once, Edmondson clarifies the distinction with explicit instruction. 










If a kid can adequately decode a word, getting all the sounds right, but has no idea what the word means, reading didn’t happen.


Finally, they read. They unpack, decode and then encode each word to practice automaticity. (That means during the nano-second it takes to read this sentence, you are not sounding out words because the sound/letter combinations have become automatic. You belong to the one-third of American readers who already have a full set of the building blocks of reading and writing.)
Nationally, about 31% of American 4th graders read at their grade level. In Rhode Island the percentage is 33%. 
For 50 years, researchers insisted reading instruction hew to what’s called the “science of reading.” But during that time, most districts did not use science-based reading instruction but struggled with the failures of Whole Language, Balanced Literacy, and the guessing-dependent Caulkins’ workshop model. As 40 states passed reading laws mandating science-based reading instruction, educators at every level scrambled to find appropriate curricula. Curriculum publishers slapped “science of reading” on re-tooled or hastily created materials that everyone knew had holes and weaknesses. 
UFLI was developed over the course of nearly 30 years, refined along the way as University of Florida developers piloted their work-in-progress with cooperating Florida districts. Teachers were invited to critique the curriculum as well as to share fun or effective tricks for how to put across each concept. Having classroom teachers field test curricula components is rare. As a result, when the program was published in 2023, it included a wealth of downloadable materials, detailed lesson plans, activities, and assessments. Compass adopted it in 2023.
The program gives students in K-2 all the reading building blocks they need to become proficient:  the 20 vowel sounds, 44 phonemes (the smallest unit of spoken sound), and 250 graphemes (the sound of a letter or combination of letters that make up a sound). These tiny units combine to make tens of thousands of morphemes, the stand-alone words that might include single letters – “I” – to base words with suffixes, to use today’s example. 
Teachers in later grades use the exact same UFLI scope and sequence to ramp up older struggling readers. 
The scope and sequence is summarized here. 
UFLI has its detractors, but from my reading of teacher Facebook groups, the objections largely have to do with teachers’ fondness for other programs they’re using.
But most teachers are thrilled to see their readers learning much more quickly and confidently than they had with other programs.
As research and teacher innovation evolve, UFLI might lose its go-to status. But for now, it is by far the most complete, best sequenced, most teacher- and kid-friendly set of reading skills assembled. Low-performing districts in particular should take note.

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)When tornadoes strike or floodwaters rise in Kentucky, it’s local charitable nonprofits that mobilize early to provide relief, working hand in hand with first responders to help neighbors in crisis. Within hours, nonprofits and volunteers are clearing debris, offering shelter and serving hot meals from a borrowed kitchen.
Beyond disaster response, nonprofits are our champions — our neighbors quietly stepping in to bridge a critical and often urgent gap among public systems. They provide shelter to women and children escaping domestic violence. They mentor rural students in STEM and the arts. They deliver meals to seniors. They provide quality after-school and summer youth programs. They connect families with vital services. Nonprofits provide calm in the chaos, hope in times of hopelessness, and opportunity and joy in moments of despair.
Yet despite their incredible impact and critical role, some Americans question whether nonprofits are truly essential. That’s because when nonprofits are doing their jobs well, they can be nearly invisible. They quietly fill critical service gaps with urgency and professionalism, regardless of politics or recognition. Nonprofits are indeed essential and make no mistake: their impact is anything but small.
Today, the impact of charitable nonprofits is under threat. 
Recent federal funding cuts and uncertain future funding are straining many nonprofits. Now, Congress is advancing tax legislation that could make matters worse for nonprofits in Kentucky and across the nation, and more importantly, for the people nonprofits serve. The bill would increase taxes on foundations and nonprofits and disincentivize charitable giving, diverting critical resources away from the very organizations our communities rely on. The bill also threatens critical safety-net programs for Kentucky’s most vulnerable.
A recent Impact Report from Kentucky Nonprofit Network, the state’s association of charitable nonprofits, highlights what’s at stake: nearly half of Kentucky nonprofits partner with federal, state or local governments to deliver services that help communities thrive. Nonprofit–government partnerships help Kentucky tackle our most pressing challenges and opportunities. When resources and partnerships are cut, delayed or withdrawn, it’s not just a financial issue, it’s also a crisis that impacts families, communities and local economies across the commonwealth.
A rural food pantry may not be able to feed hungry families. A veterans’ organization might not make payroll. A community theater may shut its doors and close a vital aspect of local tourism. A domestic violence shelter could turn away families in desperate need because they don’t have enough staff. Even nonprofits not directly impacted — like the animal shelter where you adopted your pet— feel the ripple effects. 
These aren’t hypotheticals. They’re happening right now. And this isn’t just a nonprofit problem. It’s a community problem. It’s our problem, yours and mine. 
Nonprofits are our neighbors, working alongside government and businesses to build healthy and safe communities, a strong workforce and a vibrant economy. When they’re underfunded and threatened, we all lose.
We’re calling on legislators to recognize the nonprofit sector as the indispensable partner it is. Specifically, we’re calling on Kentucky’s U.S. senators to work to remove harmful provisions from the federal tax bill and instead bolster support for nonprofits by expanding incentives for charitable giving and ensuring funding priorities that reflect the critical role of nonprofits in Kentucky communities.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) With early voting already underway and primary day set for Tuesday, Virginia’s House of Delegates races are shaping up to be a revealing test of party identity, grassroots energy, and electoral ambition. 
For the first time in many years, Democrats have fielded candidates in all 100 House districts — a feat that underscores just how determined the party is to hold the majority it won back two years ago, and how fired up its base has become heading into another high-stakes election year.
Many of the most compelling primaries are playing out in safely blue districts, where challengers are confronting Democratic incumbents from the left and prompting broader questions about the party’s ideological trajectory. 
Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said this year’s primary season offers “a chance to decide whether the party wants to aim for a consistently centrist message, or push in a more liberal direction.” 
While Virginia Democrats have traditionally leaned toward moderate candidates in statewide elections, Farnsworth said, there’s a growing appetite among some voters to advance a more progressive agenda.
The current moment, he adds, is reminiscent of 2017, when Donald Trump’s presidency helped spark a blue wave in Virginia. 
“You’re seeing the willingness of Democrats to run even in places where the party is not favored,” Farnsworth said. “And even when challengers are taking on incumbents in Democratic House seats, when you put those things together, you really see a high level of energy.” 
But that momentum may come at a cost, he added. “Moderates remain the single most threatened category of Virginia elected officials out there.”
Here’s a rundown of 10 races to watch when polls close Tuesday evening.
 House District 1: Del. Patrick Hope vs. Sean Epstein vs. Arjoon Srikanth

Del. Patrick Hope, D–Arlington, is one of only two veteran Democratic delegates facing a primary challenge this year — the other being Del. Delores McQuinn, D–Richmond. But unlike McQuinn, who carries a single opponent, Hope confronts a two-way contest in Virginia’s 1st House District, with Sean Epstein, a community-minded first‑time candidate advocating for smarter spending and federal-worker support, and 27‑year‑old software engineer Arjoon Srikanth, who frames himself as a fresh, tech-centric alternative, seeking to unseat him. 
Hope, first elected in 2009, brings deep experience — and plenty of it. He says he personally knocks on about 4,000 doors a year to stay connected to Arlington voters. A longtime proponent of ranked-choice voting and a collaborator on local housing, transit, and infrastructure issues, he also garnered support from a developer backing a Tysons casino, alongside two other Arlington delegates.
Epstein, who formally launched his campaign in early April, criticized the “toxic” tone of politics, calling for “a fresh set of ideas.” Meanwhile, Srikanth contends that the party needs to meet the moment of “a new Trump era” with more clarity and vigor. “Younger people are moving away from the Democratic Party,” he told a voter forum last month, arguing that leadership has grown “stagnant.” 
Because no Republican has declared in this safely Democratic district, Tuesday’s primary is likely to determine the next delegate. With early voting underway, Arlington’s Democratic base faces a choice between seasoned leadership and new voices for a changing electorate.
 House District 21: Gregory Gorham vs. Xanthe Larsen vs. Sahar Smith

Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, is among a slate of vulnerable Democrats this year. He’s on the receiving end of attack ads from Republican groups but is getting a helping hand from national and state Democratic funding sources to support him. 
Vying to take him on and hoping to oust him come November are three Republicans that first must face off in Tuesday’s primaries: Gregory Gorham, Xanthe Larsen, and Sahar Smith. 
Smith is an Egyptian-born immigrant who served in the U.S. military and became a citizen in the 1970s. She has called herself “pro-life,” making herself a reliable vote for Republicans wishing to quash the in-progress reproductive rights constitutional amendment. 
She and Gorham have expressed in local candidate forums that they’d like to see stronger data center reform — a key local issue in Northern Virginia where many centers have proliferated in recent years. Thomas had a bill this session to increase transparency for centers, but it was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Gorham argues the bill was too soft, and would like to tax data centers more rigorously. 
Attorney Xanthe Larsen appears to have not been present at a handful of candidate forums and does not appear to have a campaign website. 
 House District 37: Del. Terry Austin vs. Austen Schwend

In a rare GOP primary challenge to a sitting House member, Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, is the only Republican incumbent this year facing a test from the right in House District 37. Despite representing the deep-red district since 2014 without a primary opponent, Austin now finds himself in a faceoff with political newcomer Austen Schwend, a farmer, engineer, and business owner who says frustration with government decisions drove him to run — literally while pushing pigs out of the way on a snowy day.
“I feel like I’m having to do all of this because politicians keep making bad decisions,” Schwend told Cardinal News, describing the moment he decided to enter politics.
Schwend’s campaign centers on lowering taxes, opposing green energy initiatives, and increasing transparency in education spending. He has also criticized Austin’s past support for a proposed wind farm in Botetourt and highlighted Dominion Energy’s role as the delegate’s top donor. But Austin insists, “The fact that Dominion has given me money has nothing to do with my support of any project.”
Austin, a veteran lawmaker and senior Republican on the House Transportation Committee, has emphasized his bipartisan work on infrastructure and regional economic development. He acknowledged the challenge with pragmatism: “The longer you serve, the more people are going to think that maybe you’re not doing what they want… and that’s OK too.”
Political analyst Stephen Farnsworth calls the race “a key one to watch,” adding, “To what extent is the Republican Party going to have any daylight between itself and President Trump?”
 House District 46: Mitchell Cornett vs. Adam Tolbert

An open seat is up for grabs to represent Smyth County in southwest Virginia after Republican Jed Arnold stated he would not seek reelection.
Mitchell Cornett, a member of the Grayson County Board of Supervisors, and Adam Tolbert, a higher education official, are vying for the nomination to run in November.
“Our district needs a representative who truly lives and breathes the values that make Southwest Virginia special,” Cornett told The Patriot. “As your delegate, I will stand firmly for our constitutional rights, protect the sanctity of life, and ensure our region’s voice is heard clearly in the General Assembly.”
Tolbert has received a significant number of endorsements from current seatholders, including House Minority Leader Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott County, and Sen. Todd Pillion, R-Washington County. If elected, Tolbert said his office will focus on legislation to lower energy costs, and support educational and economic opportunities.  
The Republican nominee will face Democrat Jamie Ralston Hendry in a strongly conservative district that encompasses the counties of Grayson, Smyth and Wythe, and part of Pulaski County. 
 House District 62: Karen Hamilton vs. Clay Jackson

Voters will elect a new delegate from Culpeper County in the next few months, but not until a Republican nominee is selected next week.
Karen Hamilton, a business owner, and Clay Jackson, a beef farmer and former county supervisor, are seeking the nomination to replace Republican Del. Nick Freitas. Hamilton received the endorsement of the outgoing delegate who served five terms in Richmond.
“Delegate Nick Freitas has battled in Richmond for 10 years to protect our individual liberties and boldly advocate for conservative values,” said Hamilton to the Star Exponent. “Going forward, the people of the 62nd District deserve to have strong representation and a voice for fiscal responsibility, limited government, and moral clarity in the commonwealth.
Jackson told the media outlet that he’s running because voters in the district are being “left behind.” If elected, he will continue to take pride in representing his constituency, just as he did when he served as chair of the Madison County Board of Supervisors. 
Democrat Sara Ratcliffe, a lifelong caretaker, will face the nominee in the strong conservative House District 62 race. Ratcliffe is running for a second time. She lost to Freitas in 2023 by more than 20 percentage points, despite being the top fundraiser. 
District 62 encompasses the counties of Greene and Madison, and parts of Culpeper and Orange counties.
 House District 70: Hailey Louise Shupe-Dollar vs. Cynthia Scaturico

The district caught national attention in 2017 when Democratic incumbent Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, lost to then-delegate David Yancey following a tie in which his name ended up drawn from a bowl to break it. She later won one election in 2019 and has represented the district ever since. In an election year where around 80 women are running between both parties, she will face one of two Republican women challengers come November. 
Military veteran Hailey Louise Shupe-Dollar wants to decrease or eliminate personal property taxes. While her campaign website lacks an issues page, there is a form to fill out asking would-be constituents to tell her what matters most to them. 
Dollar’s opponent in the primary, Cynthia Scaturico, is a homemaker who has expressed support for GOP efforts to give parents more authority in public education policies and curriculum. She would also like to see more investment in Hampton Roads infrastructure and lower taxes on small businesses. 
 House District 72: Randolph Critzer Jr. vs. Bilal Raychouni 

Two Democratic hopefuls are seeking to unseat longtime Republican Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, in a district that has elected Ware to eight consecutive terms.
Randolph Critzer Jr., a Richmond attorney, and educator Bilal Raychouni are seeking the Democratic nomination. In 2023, Raychouni made it to the General Election, but lost to Ware by 36 percentage points.
Raychouni is running on a platform to support rural areas with health care and transportation services.
Critzer wants to ensure recycling services are available in his district after the county made changes to residential curbside recycling in Chesterfield. If elected, he said he would propose a bill requiring all localities that have provided recycling services within the past 10 years to restore the services to all citizens.
District 72 includes the counties of Amelia, Nottoway and Powathan, and part of Chesterfield County. 
 House District 73: Leslie Mehta vs. Justin Woodford

Though the Chesterfield County-anchored House District 73 has a Republican lean, Democrats are hoping to edge out incumbent Del. Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield, later this year. But first, two Democrats are facing off in Tuesday’s primary to see who will be up to bat later this year. 
Former 1st Congressional District candidate Leslie Mehta announced her bid back in February and has secured the endorsement of Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger. A month later, finance consultant Justin Woodford stepped into the race. 
Both candidates support ways to help make health care more accessible and affordable as well as housing —- with Woodford noting support for a failed bipartisan effort this year to curb hedge funds’ abilities to purchase investment homes, a key blockade for first-time homebuyers. 
Mehta also cites her experience as an appointee of Youngkin’s to the state’s rare disease council. Having lost her oldest daughter to Rhett Syndrome, she has provided insights to congressional legislation as well as served as the interim CEO of the International Rhett Syndrome Foundation. 
Both candidates support Virginia’s in-progress constitutional amendments to enshrine reproductive rights, voting rights and remove a defunct ban on same-sex marriage. While two of the amendments have advanced with bipartisan support, the reproductive rights measure has only advanced because of the legislature’s current Democratic majority. Earley was an outspoken critic of the amendment earlier this year. 
Advancing or defeating the amendment may be a key factor in this year’s House elections, for which the future of it hinges on. 
While the district could continue to favor Earley, it did favor Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris last year by 0.6% of a point — enough to signal hope for his challengers. 
 House District 75: Stephen Miller‑Pitts vs. Lindsey Dougherty vs. Dustin Wade.

Covering the city of Hopewell and parts of Chesterfield and Prince George counties, the 75th House District has become a focal point of Democratic interest in Tuesday’s primary. Three candidates are vying for the party’s nomination to challenge Republican Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, this November: returning hopeful Stephen Miller‑Pitts, community advocate Lindsey Dougherty, and nurse Dustin Wade.
Miller‑Pitts, a combat veteran, educator, service‑disabled small‑business owner, and activist, secured nearly 45% of the vote in 2023, falling just 5 points short of Coyner. He told The Mercury earlier this year that his campaign “built a lot of great momentum and community engagement” and he’s eager to “build upon what we did two years ago when nobody really was looking at this seat.” 
The three‑way Democratic contest itself signals growing energy as Virginia voters respond to national economic pressures. Locally, that enthusiasm is being fueled by concerns over recent mass layoffs and shifting regional dynamics that saw Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., carry the district last year.
With the filing deadline long passed, Democrats have locked in a primary that reflects their newfound vigor — a district now seen as competitive, energized by robust candidate recruitment and fast‑changing political tides. 
 House District 97: Tim Anderson vs. Christina Miriam Felder 

A current House incumbent could face a former member contingent upon the results of the Republican primary between educator Christina Miriam Felder and Tim Anderson, who served in the body from 2022 to 2023, when he resigned to mount an unsuccessful Senate bid.
The district encompasses the city of Virginia Beach.
Regarding his renewed interest in running for office, Anderson said Democrats cannot be allowed to control the House of Delegates because they are catering to “far-left” progressive policies, including passing legislation that provides violent offenders “easier access” to bail. He said the result left a woman dead when the husband was released, NBC4 Washington reported in 2024.
Felder told WAVY she is running to address the “massive” changes to public safety and education, made by Democrats, that have left her district dramatically different and made it feel like “hell” in the community.
“This is not the Virginia Beach I knew and grew up in,” Felder said. “We as citizens pay our taxes and want things to get done correctly. My fellow community members couldn’t believe how much changes the Democrats rapidly had done. So, now I am here and this will end now.” 
The winner will face Del. Michael Feggans, Virginia Beach, in November for the district seat.

Across the commonwealth, 14 school divisions, including Portsmouth, Chesapeake and Symth County, and the Department of Juvenile Justice have appealed to use $25 million. The Virginia Department of Education wants to use nearly $8 million.
Elie Bracy, III, superintendent of Portsmouth Public Schools and president of the Virginia Association of School Superintendents, said the relief funds provided a “needed lifeline” for Portsmouth and other school communities across the nation during the pandemic. 
“Specifically, those funds helped us quickly adapt to otherwise unforeseen technology, safety, mental health and academic recovery needs,” Bracy said in a statement. “As such, we remain hopeful that the appeal process will find that our use of these funds is warranted and we – along with divisions like us – will be able to fulfill the work we have been planning.”
Beginning in 2020, states, including Virginia, were awarded millions in grants through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations and the American Rescue Plan Acts. Schools have used these funds to support safe operations for students and staff, and address the pandemic’s impacts on learning with tools such as tutoring and after-school programs.
Although the federal government extended the deadline under President Joe Biden’s administration, schools were required to return all unspent funds, which were intended for immediate and short-term needs.
In a letter dated March 28, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, President Donald Trump’s appointee, notified states and school divisions that the final day for them to spend and use all money received from the federal government was on the same day, March 28. The original deadline was March 2026. 
McMahon said the Education Department would not change the deadline.
“The department has concluded that the further extension of the liquidation period for the aforementioned grants, already well past the period of performance, was not justified,” wrote McMahon. “You and your subrecipients have had ample time to liquidate obligations.”
After McMahon’s notice, 16 states plus the District of Columbia sued McMahon and the Education Department. The states and DC won a preliminary injunction blocking the department from recovering the relief funds while the case is litigated. 
Virginia did not join the suit. The Mercury contacted the Office of the Attorney General for comment.
Virginia’s school divisions filed their appeals with the state education department, which vets the appeals, then submits them to federal education officials.
Virginia Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson told the Mercury that the appeals for funding cover such areas as replacing school buses and renovating buildings.
Like the school divisions, the commonwealth is seeking a decision on two appeals near $8 million for the state’s Attendance Data Dashboard, designed to combat chronic absenteeism, and Grow Your Own, a program to support teacher apprenticeship pipelines.
The Virginia Department of Education did receive an extension for $18 million for statewide tutoring services. Gullickson said federal approval of the request will allow schools to take advantage of “high-intensity” tutoring platforms specifically for reading and math through tutoring services such as Zearn, Ignite and Lexia for the upcoming school year. 
Portsmouth’s funds would cover contracted staffing services, including teachers and nurses, as well as other projects, such as purchasing buses with air conditioning and school library furniture. If the appeal is not granted, the school division will use funding from the 2024-2025 budget to cover the amounts already expended. 
Lauren Nolasco, a spokeswoman for Portsmouth Public Schools, said because the school division did not plan for such expenditures, the money would come from other programs.
Carol Bauer, president of the Virginia Education Association, said in a statement that school division leaders planned their budgets based on “promises” made by the federal government, but the notice from McMahon has left essential programs and personnel at risk.
“This has created an unprecedented disruption for Virginia’s students, particularly in our most vulnerable communities,” Bauer said. “These cuts aren’t just budget lines, they’re threats to the academic recovery and emotional well-being of our students. While other states took action to protect their students and schools, it’s deeply disappointing that Virginia’s Attorney General stood silent as critical resources were stripped away. Our students and educators deserve better leadership, commitment, and advocacy from those entrusted to defend their interests.”

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)In the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, more than 2,000 refugees came to North Carolina under the Biden administration’s Uniting for Ukraine humanitarian parole program.
Now, three years later, those who arrived under the program say they fear they will be forced to uproot their lives once again as President Donald Trump puts migrants in his crosshairs.
On Jan. 28, the Trump administration announced it would pause all new sponsorship applications for humanitarian parole programs, effectively halting new admissions to the Uniting for Ukraine program. Asked in March whether he would revoke Ukrainian refugees’ status, Trump told reporters that “there were some people that think that’s appropriate, and some people don’t, and I’ll be making the decision pretty soon.”
But in April, some Ukrainians admitted under the program received email notices from the Department of Homeland Security that their status was being terminated, and that they must self-deport — an alert that was soon retracted as mistaken, but which still shook those who received it and many others who did not.

In an emailed statement Friday, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin did not address the Uniting for Ukraine program directly, but alleged President Joe Biden “abused the parole authority to allow millions of illegal aliens into the U.S.”
“Under federal law, Secretary Noem — in support of the President — has full authority to cancel or modify these policies. Doing so is a promise kept to the American people to secure our borders and protect our national security,” McLaughlin wrote. “We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.”
In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end Biden-era humanitarian parole programs for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, which had cited “conflict-ridden” homelands as cause for granting temporary status so migrants could live and work in the U.S. lawfully. That same authority could be used to terminate the parole program for Ukrainian refugees.
 North Carolinians have ‘opened their homes’ and ‘opened their hearts’
Iryna Yermolaieva, a teacher from Kherson, escaped with her two children while the city was under occupation by Russian troops in the spring of 2022.
The plan was not to come to the United States. She held out hope for a quick end to the war as she remained in Europe and waited to be reunited with her husband, who was not able to leave at first. After five months apart, he joined her, and by the fall, they realized they could no longer put their lives on hold while awaiting peace. A friend referred her to the Uniting for Ukraine program, and in January 2023, they moved in with a host family in Apex.
Yurii and Anastasiia took a similar path. They fled their city of Mariupol, among the most devastated by the war, for the United States in 2023 with their son while Anastasiia was pregnant with a daughter.
The couple, who requested to be identified by first names only out of concern for retaliation, initially moved in with sponsor Keith Mast, who lives in Greenville. The Uniting for Ukraine program’s premise was to match refugees in need with hosts willing to guarantee financial support for their first year in the U.S. as they found jobs and community. In that goal, both families found success through the program, living independently in Cary and Brevard, respectively, not long after arriving.
Though she didn’t know much about North Carolina before arriving, what has struck Yermolaieva most is the people. Because the family didn’t yet have vehicles, members of Christ the King Lutheran Church in Cary — which they attended with their host family soon after arriving — volunteered to give their children rides to school, putting together a schedule of who would help out each day. The church community also helped Yermolaieva and her husband get to job interviews and the grocery store.
“When you came here, of course, you are confused, but in a very short period we felt really nice here, because of people, because of church, all the community, and just people all over,” she said. “That makes feel really better for Ukrainians when you feel that support.”
Ridge Road Baptist Church in Raleigh has welcomed the burgeoning Ukrainian community, she added, opening its doors each weekend to a makeshift Ukrainian Saturday School where around 40 children of varying ages learn language lessons, make art, and socialize with one another.
Also embodying that spirit of generosity is Brian Snyder of Apex, a volunteer with Ukrainians of the Carolinas who has sponsored multiple families and given help to many others. One task he’s undertaken to help them: getting hundreds of donated bikes to refugee families, an opportunity he called an “amazing blessing” that he’s found very rewarding as he watches newcomers use the bikes to get around the community and build deeper ties with their neighbors.
“They’re extremely grateful for the kindness and the generosity of Americans here, particularly in central North Carolina, who’ve opened their homes, opened their hearts, who’ve helped folks through difficult situations, helped them get jobs, helped their kids get signed up and set up within schools,” Snyder said.
In Brevard, Yurii and Anastasiia don’t know any other Ukrainian families, but they’ve still found the community “really friendly and helpful,” Anastasiia said through an interpreter. She added that interacting mostly with Americans has helped her improve her English skills more quickly.
“Maybe it’s a good thing that we are the only Ukrainian family in the area, because in the other cities, there are many Ukrainians, so it’s easy to get lost,” she said in Ukrainian. “We are kind of an artifact here.”
 ‘Start it all over from zero’
Though neither family received the April email instructing them to leave the country, both said they’ve felt greater uncertainty this year in part because of it.
“We do feel more vulnerable,” Yurii said, though he stressed that he did not want to speak against the current government. “We feel uncertainty and it affects not only me, but my family.”
But they did not let the email faze them: “We did not pack our suitcases,” Anastasiia quipped.
Both families said that since the change in administration, they’ve largely turned to unofficial sources like news outlets, blogs, and social media to find information about the future of the Uniting for Ukraine program, with little in the way of official communication to give them guidance.
Yermolaieva said she has felt some comfort in reading about other Ukrainian families still getting approval for temporary protected status, a designation that would allow her family to stay longer than the parole program, which is set at two years with the possibility to apply for two-year renewals.
Even if they are approved for a longer stay, there’s no guarantee their loved ones will be able to remain. Yermolaieva said her mother followed her to the U.S., but arrived after Ukrainian refugees were no longer being offered the opportunity to apply for Temporary Protected Status, which she said means their only option is applying a renewal of parole.
“If they won’t give her re-parole, I don’t know what to do next — all her family’s here,” Yermolaieva said. “I know a lot of other families with the same situation, sometimes even husband has TPS and his wife with kids came later.”

At the opposite end of the spectrum are cases like Yurii and Anastasiia, whose young children are fully acclimated to life in the U.S. and would have difficulty adjusting anywhere else. Their daughter, born shortly after they arrived, is a U.S. citizen and has never known life in another country.
“We are hoping she could stay and continue in this country. Even our older son, it’s been three years and he seems to be more American now,” Yurii said through the interpreter. “Even for us, we are getting assimilated here and it would be hard to, all of a sudden, to have to move again and start it all over from zero again.”
For many Ukrainians in the U.S., those familial ties also extend to their host families, who they’ve grown deeply connected with in the past three years. Mast, who Yurii and Anastasiia call their “second Papa,” said that regardless of what happens with the program, “we’re family,” and he will remain in their life to help them however he can. “You do what you can for your family,” he said.
Yurii and Anastasiia as well as Yermolaieva stressed separately that they pay taxes, don’t abuse benefits, and abide by the law with the goal of being good citizens who give back to the country that has taken them in and given them shelter from the war. “We hope that the government will have mercy on us and will allow us to stay, to get legalized,” Yurii said.
“We are nice, we are friendly, so we try to show that we are not just here to stay and to use everything that you have here in the USA,” Yermolaieva said. “We are ready to give something to the USA and to give something to people.”
“The only worry and concern we have is that we don’t get deported,” Yurii said. “The rest we can do on our own strengths.”
 ‘No one’s being flown back to a war zone tomorrow’
As humanitarian parole recipients from other countries receive notices to “self-deport” and return to their home countries, some Ukrainians are left to contemplate how impossible that ask may be.
Even in parts of the country that do not see regular combat, Russian airstrikes and drone attacks are a constant looming threat, able to strike virtually anywhere in Ukraine. “In one moment, we lost everything,” Yermolaieva said of the attacks on her hometown, which she said still faces a barrage of as many as 100 bombs in a day.

Just last week, she said, her family received photos of their in-laws’ home, which was bombed to rubble in May and is now in a state that is “impossible to rebuild” from.
“That’s insane that people just may go home any moment and it’s really dangerous there in Ukraine,” Yermolaieva said. “I hope they will give us the opportunity to stay here, and yeah, people deserve just to be in a safe place.”
According to Benjamin Snyder, a Charlotte-based immigration attorney who has worked with many Ukrainian refugees, even amid the uncertainty, there remain options for remaining in the U.S. for families who are unable to return home or who do not wish to uproot their families from America after becoming part of the community.
“What I would advise is that they consult with an experienced immigration attorney to make an individualized assessment of their personal legal situation,” said Benjamin Snyder, who is not related to Apex volunteer Brian Snyder. “There’s a range of options that depend on when you got here, how you got here, and what you’ve been doing since you’ve got here.”
The asylum process, he said, is one option available to many Ukrainian families, despite inaccurate rumors that they are largely not eligible. While there is a requirement for individuals seeking asylum to apply within a year of arrival, that can be waived, and a variety of circumstances can be considered in whether to grant asylum status — though because that process requires applicants not to leave the U.S. for several years or more, it may not be suitable for those whose goal is still to return home after the war.
Mast, Yurii and Anastasiia’s sponsor, said the asylum process is “tricky” for them because they may not directly fit the requirements. “But their country’s being bombed — their city, Mariupol, was destroyed — so in legal, or in conversation, it seems like asylum is appropriate.”

Benjamin Snyder, the attorney, said his advice to Ukrainian clients who have voiced concerns about rhetoric and potential policy changes from the Trump administration is to “remain calm” first and foremost.
“I try to bring people back to earth and remind them that they do have rights to pursue and the opportunity to advocate for themselves,” Benjamin Snyder said. “No one’s being flown back to a war zone tomorrow or any time soon, not without the paperwork being fully adjudicated by the Immigration Service.”
His hope is that Congress steps in to pass a long-term solution for Ukrainian refugees admitted through the program, citing a similar law enacted under the first Trump administration that granted relief to Liberians in the United States who had similarly been under a temporary status for an extended period of time.
Brian Snyder, the sponsor and volunteer, said he and other supporters of Ukrainians in the Carolinas have contacted elected officials with their concerns about the future of the program and protections for refugees from the war who have made the U.S. their home.
“We want to remind our elected officials that there are 200,000 to 300,000 people here that are contributing members to society and that, frankly, ending the humanitarian parole program would take away our community’s opportunity to live out our faith,” he said.
Yermolaieva said she feels gratitude toward all Americans, regardless of their personal support for Ukraine, because without them, her family would not be able to stay here. “They deserve this thank you, because we came to their country,” she said.
“And also, I would like to give part of my heart to to people who support Ukraine because they give chance for people to live, to escape and to bring their kids to a safe place,” she added. “If people stay in Ukraine, you may be dead just the next day.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20220305_153112_resized-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-16 05:59:07.701768

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Maine lawmakers took up more than a dozen bills related to firearms late last week, covering a variety of issues including concealed carry laws, safe storage and the definition of a machine gun. While many have already been killed, some proposals are still waiting for further action to determine if they will make it to Gov. Janet Mills’ desk. 
Here’s a closer look at what happened with the legislation.
Concealed carry bills 
Following recommendations from the Judiciary Committee, the chambers rejected four proposals introduced this session to amend the state’s concealed carry laws. 
This included LD 1049, which sought to eliminate the requirement that someone carrying a concealed weapon without a valid permit needs to inform law enforcement immediately during routine traffic stops, arrests or detainment. 
During discussion on the House of Representatives floor, Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) said that removing that requirement would “disrupt the balance” that allows Maine to be a constitutional carry state. 
“I wanted to stress again that all of the testimony that we heard from law enforcement was supportive of the ‘ought not to pass’ in this bill, and that the current law as it exists is the product of a compromise that brought us constitutional carry in the state of Maine,” Lee said.
The House and Senate rejected a proposal (LD 829) from Sen. David Haggan (R-Penobscot) that he said would clean up confusion in existing law by making it clear that someone can carry a concealed firearm in a state park, so long as they are not otherwise prohibited from possessing one. 
Lawmakers in both chambers also voted down a proposal to reduce the age limit that a person can carry without a permit (LD 424) and LD 998, which would have removed the requirement that an employee have a valid concealed carry permit to store a firearm in their vehicle at work.
Large-capacity magazines 
Lawmakers in both chambers opted to kill LD 1109, which started as a proposal to ban the possession of large-capacity magazines. 
Before it hit chamber floors, the bill divided Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. Some opted to amend the bill to focus on the trafficking of those items while others backed an amendment to limit magazines to 10 rounds for long guns and 15 for handguns.
Committee chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) asked the Senate to pass the amendment that would address the trafficking of a large-capacity ammunition feeding device, which is defined as accepting more than 20 rounds of ammunition. However, they rejected that 15-20 before opting to kill the bill.  

Safe storage and hold agreements bills 
The House voted 67-81 and the Senate voted 16-19 against passage of LD 1120. That proposal sought to expand current firearm storage laws so someone would be liable if their negligent storage led to a person who is prohibited from possessing a firearm gaining access to one.
The Senate also voted down an amended version of LD 1299, which would prohibit a person from storing a handgun in an unoccupied vehicle, unless it is out of view and locked specifically in a hard-sided container with the car locked. 
The House still has yet to take up the bill. 
Both chambers supported an amended version of LD 1174, which would limit the liability on gun shops that enter into firearm hold agreements. That bill was initially more narrow and sought to give a gun shop immunity when taking possession of a firearm owned by a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces or first responders. 
Though a majority of the Judiciary Committee did not support that proposal, the amended version that won over the chambers was backed by most Republicans on the committee and one Democrat. 
The bill also received an enactment vote from the House Friday. It needs final approval from the Senate before it can be sent to Mills. 
Firearms at polling places 
After the House rejected it, the Senate narrowly supported a bill that would allow municipalities to adopt policies prohibiting firearms within municipal buildings and polling places. 
LD 1743 was also supported by Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who told the Judiciary Committee that towns should have the option to regulate firearms in polling places because there is often anxiety over threats to election workers that data collected by her office shows persist.
Haggan said during the floor debate that creating this sort of patchwork policy in the state could cause firearm owners to unintentionally be in violation. 
The House has yet to revisit the bill, leaving it still in nonconcurrence.
Serialization
Lawmakers in the House voted 77-70 to support an amended version of LD 1126, which would require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns that are assembled at home or those made with a 3D printer. It would also prohibit undetectable firearms, meaning those that can’t be spotted with a metal detector — which is the case for  many 3D printed guns. 
Rep. Sam Zager (D-Portland), the bill’s sponsor, said it is “crucial” for enhancing public safety and supporting law enforcement amid the growing prevalence of “ghost guns.” However, opponents of the bill argued it would infringe on the rights and traditions of Mainers. 
The Senate originally supported the bill, as well, but then moved to reconsider on Friday leaving it in limbo. 
To sell or destroy firearms
On Thursday, the House and Senate rejected the version of LD 411 that was backed by Democrats on the committee, instead opting for the version backed by Republicans. 
The proposal asks the attorney general to update the rules relating to the disposition of forfeited firearms so that the majority of proceeds from auctioning those guns goes to the state’s Safe Homes Program. That program supports the safe storage of firearms, prescription drugs and other dangerous weapons. 
The bill also received its second vote of approval from the House Friday. The Senate still needs to give its final approval before the bill can head to Mills.  
Background checks
Without discussion on the floor, the House voted 76-72 to reject LD 1062, which sought to roll back background checks on the private sales of firearms. Essentially, it would have repealed a law that was part of a slate of reforms introduced last year by Mills in response to the Lewiston shooting that expanded background checks to advertised sales.
The Senate also voted down the measure 18-15 on Friday.
Tracking firearm purchases
LD 1867, which prohibits financial institutions and merchants from using firearm codes to track purchases, initially passed the Senate 20-15, but then the upper chamber reconsidered its decision and tabled the bill to be taken up again later. 
On the Senate floor, Sen. Matthew Harrington (R-York), who sponsored the bill, described it as prohibiting financial institutions from creating a “de facto gun registry.”
The House still has yet to take up the bill. 
Definition of machine gun
Carney said during the Senate floor debate that LD 677 addresses a “glaring gap” in statute by essentially banning bump stocks or other accessories that turn semi-automatic firearms into machine guns. However, Haggan argued the change could “leave the door wide open for banning all firearm modifications,” including those used by people with disabilities. 
Mills made a similar argument when she vetoed a proposal Carney put forward last session to update the statutory definition of machine gun. In her veto message, Mills said she worried the bill would have unintentionally banned weapons that responsible gun owners use for hunting or target shooting.
Carney said she took those words to heart when drafting her bill this session; however, the Senate and House still rejected it.
But that wasn’t the final word on the state’s definition for a machine gun. LD 953, which seeks to align Maine’s definition with the federal definition, was tabled in the Senate after it narrowly failed passage.

(Photo courtesy campaign)With seven contenders vying to become Virginia’s next lieutenant governor, the Mercury asked all the hopefuls to answer a questionnaire covering their political and legislative experiences and their positions on policy that shapes citizens’ lives. Here are Democrat Babur Lateef’s responses, which have been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Virginia’s constitution stipulates that the lieutenant governor presides over the state Senate. How has your legislative or political experience prepared you for that role?
Lateef: I’ve spent the last seven years as the At-Large Chair of the Prince William County School Board, Virginia’s second-largest school division in the 10th most-diverse county in the nation. I served as Chair of the University of Virginia Health System Board, where I tackled statewide issues like healthcare access, rising student debt, and housing affordability. 
Beyond my official roles, I bring the perspective of a practicing physician, the husband of a federal worker at the NIH, and a proud product of public schools — from kindergarten through medical school. Every day I listen to Virginians — patients, parents, and public servants—and I understand what’s at stake. As Lieutenant Governor, I’ll bring that same grounded, results-driven leadership to the Senate chamber.
The last four years have shown us the benefits and challenges of a gubernatorial administration working effectively with a legislative body of the opposite political party. How would you participate in strengthening a productive working relationship with legislators, even if the General Assembly is controlled by a party that’s opposite of yours?
Lateef: Throughout my career, my work has centered on listening to people, hearing their concerns, then working to solve the challenges they face. I’ve worked across ideological lines to raise teacher and nurse pay, expand Medicaid access, and increase graduation rates without letting partisanship get in the way of progress.
In Prince William County, we’ve had board members from across the political spectrum. Yet we achieved historic gains in student performance, pay equity, and inclusion by focusing on common goals and treating each other with respect. That’s exactly the spirit I’d bring to the Senate chamber as lieutenant governor.
I’m also uniquely positioned to understand where families are struggling, because I see 50–60 patients a day as a doctor. That real-world perspective helps cut through political noise and center our conversations on kitchen table issues people are concerned about: affordability, access to quality healthcare and education, and economic opportunity. No matter who controls the General Assembly, I’ll be ready to work with anyone who’s serious about improving the lives of hardworking Virginians.
Though lieutenant governors are not legislators, they can signal favor of work the General Assembly does. Are there specific types of legislation that your office would advocate in support of in the General Assembly? 
Lateef:  First and foremost, every Virginian — regardless of race, ethnicity, or identity — deserves the opportunity to live in a safe, vibrant community and to experience the pride and stability that comes with homeownership. Creating those opportunities through a “Home by 30” program will be a top priority of mine. Second, we know that investments in education have the highest returns. That’s why I’ll fight to fully fund our public schools and put Richmond’s multi-billion-dollar budget surpluses to work for our students and teachers. Finally, it’s long overdue for Virginia to repeal its most-hated tax, the car tax. I support using our budget surpluses either to fully fund our schools, or to go toward giving our hardworking families a tax break.
What is your stance on school choice and how do you propose to address educational disparities?
Lateef: I strongly oppose diverting public dollars to private school voucher programs or other so-called “school choice” schemes that weaken our public schools and widen opportunity gaps.
Virginia’s public schools are underfunded. Despite our reputation as a top state for business and a nearly $2 billion surplus, we rank far too low in per-pupil spending — about $1,900 below the national average.
As Lieutenant Governor, I will make fixing that inequity a top priority. That means removing funding caps, updating the formula to reflect actual student needs, and ensuring that every school — regardless of zip code — has the resources to provide a world-class education. We must invest in teacher pay, student mental health services, and expanded access to early childhood and career and technical education.

Do you support the current administration’s focus on revising school curricula and how would you approach curriculum content as lieutenant governor?
Lateef: I do not support the Youngkin administration’s efforts to whitewash our
curriculum. We must teach history accurately and unbiasedly to all people. Sanitizing history does a disservice to our students and undermines their ability to think critically, empathize with others, and engage as informed citizens.
That said, I do support efforts to improve academic rigor across all subjects. 
In light of recent controversies involving public officials, how do you plan to uphold and promote ethical standards in your role as lieutenant governor?
Lateef: Ethical leadership starts with transparency, accountability, and a commitment to public service over personal gain, and that’s how I’ve led throughout my career. As Chair of the Prince William County School Board and the University of Virginia Health System Board, I’ve overseen large institutions that directly impact tens of thousands of lives. In both roles, I’ve ensured that decision-making was transparent, inclusive, and well-intentioned.
I’ve never taken contributions from predatory industries like the gambling, and I’ve consistently advocated for policies that protect the most vulnerable — from students and teachers to frontline workers and federal employees. 
As Lieutenant Governor, I will continue to lead with that same integrity. I’ll support ethics reforms that increase transparency in campaign finance and ensure that all elected officials are held to the highest standards. 
How do you plan to use your tie-breaking power to influence legislation, and in what areas do you see the most opportunity for bipartisan cooperation?
Lateef: I’ll use my power to cast the tie breaking vote to stand up for working families, protect public resources, and ensure that the Commonwealth remains focused on long-term prosperity — not short-term gains.
I’ve consistently opposed casinos in Northern Virginia and slot machines in 7-Elevens (so-called “skill games”), because I believe predatory gambling is not an economic development strategy. It disproportionately targets working-class families and communities of color. …  If legislation expanding gambling or casinos reaches a tie in the Senate, I will vote no — because our economy should be built on addiction and exploitation.
At the same time, I see real potential for bipartisan cooperation in areas where Virginians overwhelmingly agree: expanding access to affordable housing, investing in workforce development, improving public education, and lowering healthcare costs. 
What’s the most important thing for Virginians to know about you?
Lateef: I served the same locality as former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger while she represented the 7th District. We worked together to deliver federal funds to address the teacher shortage (a program that Trump recently cut). She recently announced support for policies that I’ve long supported, including addressing housing affordability and repealing the car tax.

(Photo courtesy campaign)With seven contenders vying to become Virginia’s next lieutenant governor, the Mercury asked all the hopefuls to answer a questionnaire covering their political and legislative experiences and their policy positions on policy that shapes citizens’ lives. Here are Democrat Aaron Rouse’s responses, which have been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Virginia’s constitution stipulates that the lieutenant governor presides over the state Senate. How has your legislative or political experience prepared you for that role?
Rouse: I’m a fighter and I’ve proven it at every step of my life. I was raised in Hampton Roads by my incredible single mom. Football took me to Virginia Tech and then to the NFL — but I came back home to serve my community. In 2018, I was elected to the Virginia Beach City Council. When Roe v. Wade was overturned, I stepped up again — defeating Glenn Youngkin’s hand-picked candidate and becoming  the deciding vote to protect abortion rights in Virginia.
I’ve delivered real results for Virginians — like passing a new law this year to protect federal workers and contractors from the chaos created by Trump and Elon Musk. I championed the “Save Local Pharmacies” Act to take on Big Pharma and make sure families, especially in rural and underserved communities, can have access to life-saving medication. And I’m not done.
I also believe the lieutenant governor needs to be someone who knows their way around the General Assembly, has strong support from colleagues, and brings the lived experience of everyday Virginians. I’m proud to have the most endorsements from members of the General Assembly than anyone else in the race for Lieutenant Governor. That’s the approach I’ll take.
The last four years have shown us the benefits and challenges of a gubernatorial administration working effectively with a legislative body of the opposite political party. How would you participate in strengthening a productive working relationship with legislators, even if the General Assembly is controlled by a party that’s opposite of yours?
Rouse:  Even before I was elected to office, I built strong relationships with lawmakers across the aisle, including Delegate Terry Kilgore, Senator Todd Pillion, and Delegate Terry Austin. Together, we’ve worked on bipartisan legislation like the NIL bill to support our student athletes and the Save Local Pharmacies Act, which helps rural Virginians access the medications they need. I was also the only Democrat to vote with my colleagues from (Southwest Virginia) to lower the cost of their electric bills and hold the region’s utility accountable.
The challenges facing Southwest and Southside Virginia such as job growth, infrastructure, and healthcare access aren’t partisan. They’re Virginia issues. And the only way we solve them is by working together. As Lieutenant Governor, I’ll bring that same spirit of collaboration to the State Senate. I’ll work across the aisle to tackle real challenges, and I’ll work with anyone, Democrat, Republican, or Independent, if it means moving our Commonwealth forward.
Though lieutenant governors are not legislators, they can signal favor of work the General Assembly does. Are there specific types of legislation that your office would advocate in support of in the General Assembly?
Rouse: Families across Virginia are feeling squeezed, and right now they need leaders who are focused on helping them keep more of their hard-earned money. That has been my priority from my time on Virginia Beach City Council, to the Virginia State Senate, and it will be as Lieutenant Governor. I’ve led efforts to lower prescription drug costs, expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, raise the standard deduction, and deliver tax relief for seniors. As Lieutenant Governor, I’ll keep fighting to expand the child tax credit, eliminate the grocery tax, and make homeownership more accessible for first-time buyers. That includes expanding down payment assistance, strengthening tenant protections, and holding bad landlords accountable—because every Virginian deserves a safe, stable place to call home. We must also work with local governments to increase the supply of workforce housing and partner with employers to offer housing benefits so workers can live near their jobs.
I’ll lead the charge to defend Virginians from the chaos caused by Donald Trump and Elon Musk—standing strong to protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
And I’ll never stop investing in our childrens’ futures. That means raising teacher pay so the best brightest teach our kids, expanding mentorship and training programs for educators, and partnering with universities to build a diverse, talented workforce. I’ll also strengthen career and technical education to ensure every student is ready for high-quality, good-paying jobs.
What is your stance on school choice and how do you propose to address educational disparities?
As a product of Virginia’s public schools, I know firsthand that a child’s zip code should never determine their future. But since the pandemic, we’ve seen how deeply under-resourced schools—especially Title I schools—have struggled, and it’s our responsibility to reverse that trend.
I’ve stood firm in the Senate to protect and expand public education funding. As Lieutenant Governor, I’ll continue that fight by working with the Spanberger administration to raise teacher pay so we can recruit and retain the best educators in every community. I’ll expand mentorship and training programs, and build strong partnerships with Virginia’s HBCUs to grow a more diverse, representative pipeline of teachers.
I’ll also fight to give localities the option to fund critical school construction projects by allowing them to adjust their local sales tax — a common-sense measure that Governor Youngkin vetoed. And I’ll invest in apprenticeships and workforce training programs so that students, especially those in underserved areas, have clear and attainable pathways to high wage, high growth careers, whether they choose college or not.
Do you support the current administration’s focus on revising school curricula and how would you approach curriculum content as lieutenant governor?
Rouse: This administration has been laser focused on one thing – undermining and dismantling public education in Virginia. As Lieutenant Governor, I will be laser focused on ensuring that every child is able to learn and thrive in our public schools. That includes ensuring we have school curricula that challenges our students and sets them up to succeed in high-paying jobs, and … instilling critical thinking, civic understanding, and respect for the diversity that defines our Commonwealth. I will work with educators, parents, and experts to ensure that our curriculum is grounded in facts, inclusive of all voices, and prepares students not just for today’s workforce, but for the challenges of tomorrow. As Lieutenant Governor, I will stand firmly against any politically motivated efforts to whitewash history or censor our classrooms. Our children deserve the truth, and they deserve the tools to build a better future.
In light of recent controversies involving public officials, how do you plan to uphold and promote ethical standards in your role as lieutenant governor?
From a young age, my grandfather instilled me with three principles. He told me to keep God first, work for everything that you want, and your word is your bond. Those principles have stuck with me my entire life, and have pushed me to hold myself to a high ethical standard.
In the Senate, I’ve fought to protect voting rights and strengthen ethics in Virginia. I’ve worked to prevent unjust voter purges, expand access to voting, and restore voting rights for returning citizens through a constitutional amendment.
As Chair of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, I led efforts to ensure fair and inclusive elections. I’ve also championed campaign finance and ethics reforms, pushing for stronger regulations, better oversight, and higher accountability for candidates and elected officials. My goal has always been to make Virginia’s political system more transparent, accountable, and focused on serving the people.
How do you plan to use your tie-breaking power to influence legislation, and in what areas do you see the most opportunity for bipartisan cooperation?
I know how to work on a team, and I know how to win tough fights—whether it’s on the football field, on city council, or in the state Senate.
I’ve been the deciding vote to protect abortion rights, led efforts to lower prescription drug costs, and passed new protections for federal workers — even in the face of extreme opposition. I know how to navigate tough political terrain and still come out with real results. That’s what I’ll bring to the role of Lieutenant Governor. I won’t just preside over the Senate—I’ll be traveling the Commonwealth, in the meetings, building coalitions, and doing the work to make sure our agenda moves forward.
What’s the most important thing for Virginians to know about you?
I’m running for Lieutenant Governor because every Virginian deserves the opportunity to thrive, and we need a fighter who can stand up to Trump to make that happen.
When Roe v. Wade was overturned, I beat Youngkin’s hand-picked candidate for State Senate, and I’m proud to say I was the deciding vote to protect abortion rights in Virginia.  I’ve stood up to Trump time and again, including getting a new law signed this year to protect federal workers and contractors from Trump and Musk’s chaos. As Lieutenant Governor, I’ll go toe to toe to defend Social Security and Medicare and fight to lower the costs for all Virginians. Because everything is on the line and I don’t back down.

(Photo courtesy campaign)With seven contenders vying to become Virginia’s next lieutenant governor, the Mercury asked all the hopefuls to answer a questionnaire covering their political and legislative experiences and their policy positions on policy that shapes citizens’ lives. Here are Democrat Ghazala Hashmi’s responses.
Virginia’s constitution stipulates that the lieutenant governor presides over the state Senate. How has your legislative or political experience prepared you for that role?
Hashmi: With my six years of experience as a state Senator and nearly 30 years of professional engagement as an educator, I am uniquely qualified to bring a significant level of expertise, legislative accomplishments, and critical insights to the role of Lieutenant Governor. In addition to the full range of education issues (inclusive of K-12 and higher education), I have focused my efforts on health care, housing, the environment and Virginia’s energy needs. As the Chair of Education and Health, Vice Chair of the Joint Commission on Health Care, member of the Virginia Housing Commission, as well as numerous other commissions and boards, I have built the critical relationships across state agencies and developed policy insights that will help me to serve as a strong, capable, and effective leader in Virginia’s next administration.
The last four years have shown us the benefits and challenges of a gubernatorial administration working effectively with a legislative body of the opposite political party. How would you participate in strengthening a productive working relationship with legislators, even if the General Assembly is controlled by a party that’s opposite of yours?
Hashmi: I consider many of my colleagues across the aisle to be strong allies in the work to improve education outcomes and economic opportunities for the regions that they serve. Although a few of the issues upon which the General Assembly focuses are partisan in nature, the majority are nonpartisan and impact the lives of families and communities. These established relationships and a history of collaboration with several of these colleagues position me to work effectively, from the first day, with General Assembly members on both sides of the aisle.
Though lieutenant governors are not legislators, they can signal favor of work the General Assembly does. Are there specific types of legislation that your office would advocate in support of in the General Assembly? 
Hashmi: Fully funding public education and lowering the costs of post-secondary credentials and college degrees: All children in Virginia should be guaranteed quality public education that prepares them for well-paying jobs or higher education. I will continue to work to invest in schools, students, educators, and support staff. I will also continue efforts to ensure that we develop paid internships, apprenticeships, and workforce training. I will work to lower tuition costs to make college more affordable.
Ensuring access to affordable and quality health care: Given federal threats, protecting Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act is a top priority. The loss of Medicaid funding will leave vulnerable Virginians without access to critical healthcare and impact our entire health system. I will continue my efforts to provide all children with healthcare coverage, regardless of documentation status. I will work to address healthcare disparities by continuing to support the work of doulas, midwives, community health workers, and remote patient care.
Fighting for housing affordability: All Virginians deserve safe, habitable, and affordable housing. I will continue my work to expand higher density housing development, more affordable housing, financial products that help first-time homebuyers, protections for tenants, and to decrease eviction rates. 
What is your stance on school choice and how do you propose to address educational disparities?
Hashmi: I proudly defeated Governor Youngkin’s efforts to funnel public education dollars into private schools. As a recent statewide audit highlighted, our state has underfunded public education by more than $6 billion.  For many localities, this underfunding results in restrictions on teacher aides, larger class sizes, a loss of counselors, and limitations on resources. Funding public education and lowering the high costs of post-secondary credentials and college degrees is our biggest challenge. We can pay for these initiatives through a variety of approaches, including closing corporate tax loopholes, “rightsizing” our tax structures that place the greatest burden on middle class and working families, and through slight tax increases on luxury or second homes, but we will struggle to pay for it if we divert public funds to private schools. 
Do you support the current administration’s focus on revising school curricula and how would you approach curriculum content as lieutenant governor?
Hashmi: No. I have fought and defeated Governor Youngkin’s attacks on teachers and his attempts to ban books and whitewash our history. I feared the direction we were going in the Commonwealth — the direction that we actually saw come to pass — that is the direction of book bans and censorship, Hashmi said on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon. We had superintendents who actually began to remove books from school libraries, which is why I wrote the bill to stop schools from banning books. As Lieutenant Governor, I will oppose book bans and censorship and I will center educational best practices when approaching our curriculum.
In light of recent controversies involving public officials, how do you plan to uphold and promote ethical standards in your role as lieutenant governor?
Hashmi: Strong ethical standards are essential for our elected officials. Most importantly, I support campaign finance reform. I support a ban on the personal use of campaign funds, a bill which we finally passed this year, and a ban on contributions from publicly-regulated corporations such as Dominion Energy. 
How do you plan to use your tie-breaking power to influence legislation, and in what areas do you see the most opportunity for bipartisan cooperation?
Hashmi: I have the most legislative experience of any candidate in this race. In my six Sessions in the General Assembly, I am proud to have been a champion for progressive legislation and goals, and to have been a solid partner in the work of many organizations and groups seeking to positively impact the communities that have been historically underrepresented in the economic, social, and political decision-making process. I chair the Senate Committee on Education and Health. My experience prepares me to be an influential voice on legislation.  I have already collaborated with bipartisan colleagues on improving education outcomes for rural schools, expanding career and technical education programs, supporting community colleges and access to degree programs, providing internship opportunities in emerging technologies, responding to critical healthcare needs, and more, and I would continue that work as Lieutenant Governor. 
What’s the most important thing for Virginians to know about you?
Hashmi: I am the most experienced legislator in the race and have an actual legislative track record that addresses the issues that Virginians most care about: education, health care, housing, and opportunity. When Trump came after abortion rights, I wrote the bill protecting contraception and helped to draft language for our constitutional amendment protecting abortion; that’s why I’m the only candidate endorsed by abortion rights groups. When Trump came after our health care, I wrote the plan to protect Medicaid in Virginia. In the face of attacks on public education, I crafted the budget plan to increase funding for our schools. As the Trump Administration assails our freedoms and our values, I have pushed back hard, and I’m running because Virginia needs an executive team, inclusive of a strong Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General, that is not only ready to respond effectively to the Trump administration but also ready to chart the next four years of policy that will effectively cast Virginia as an exemplar for other states.

(Photo courtesy of campaign)With seven contenders vying to become Virginia’s next lieutenant governor, the Mercury asked all the hopefuls to answer a questionnaire covering their political and legislative experiences and their positions on policy that shapes citizens’ lives. Here are Democrat Alex Bastani’s responses, which have been lightly edited for clarity.
Virginia’s constitution stipulates that the lieutenant governor presides over the state Senate. How has your legislative or political experience prepared you for that role?
Bastani: I have been active in Democratic politics and union activism since the 1990s. I volunteered to help Senator Robb defeat Olivier North and successfully lead my union’s efforts to defeat Newt Gingrich’s Government Shutdowns and Budget Cuts. As an elected union leader, I faced four government shutdowns, a threatened furlough, and the proposed privatization of federal jobs. And each and every single time I defeated right wing union busters and my local grew. Unlike professional politicians, when times were tough I held town halls with our members and spoke the plain truth. No matter how heated the discussion, I stood strong and I can assure my fellow citizens that I will run the Virginia Senate with that same strength, and openness. 
The last four years have shown us the benefits and challenges of a gubernatorial administration working effectively with a legislative body of the opposite political party. How would you participate in strengthening a productive working relationship with legislators, even if the General Assembly is controlled by a party that’s opposite of yours?
Bastani: While the position of Lieutenant Governor on paper is a  part time job, I envision my efforts to serve and listen to the citizens of Virginia as my full time occupation. We will never achieve a productive relationship in the legislature in smoke filled backrooms in Richmond.  But we can rebuild a community of common interests in the churches, schools, union halls, and community centers of Hampton Roads, Chesapeake, Southside, Southwest, and yes inside the beltway. The route to build coalitions that leads to legislation for all Virginians is to create a productive working relationship with the voters, and then we can reach compromise in the legislature that benefits people not corporations.
Though lieutenant governors are not legislators, they can signal favor of work the General Assembly does. Are there specific types of legislation that your office would advocate in support of in the General Assembly? 
Bastani: Raise the minimum wage to $20/hour on July 1, 2026—because no full-time worker should live in poverty.

 Repeal “Right to Work” laws, restoring workers’ First Amendment rights to organize and demand better conditions.
 Grant collective bargaining rights to state and municipal employees, including teachers and first responders.
 Guarantee universal physical and mental health care, so no Virginian has to choose between their health and their job.
 Fund student debt relief by making the military-industrial complex pay its fair share.

What is your stance on school choice and how do you propose to address educational disparities?
Bastani: First,  I want (to) state that just like teachers, parents have an integral role to play in the education of their children.  However, they cannot act as barriers to knowledge for other people’s children. Secondly, if a parent chooses to home school or send their children to private school the government should respect that decision. However, the state is not required to provide financial assistance to any private entity which bars students’ attendance including economic exclusions. Finally, we must allocate resources more fairly in order that a student in the financially limited schools in Southside and Southwest have the same educational opportunities as in those wealthy counties in northern Virginia. 
Do you support the current administration’s focus on revising school curricula and how would you approach curriculum content as lieutenant governor?
Bastani: No, Governor Youngkin’s objection to students earning credits for graduation through classes such as Black studies is emblematic of regressive leadership from a darker repressed time in our nation and Commonwealth’s history. 
In light of recent controversies involving public officials, how do you plan to uphold and promote ethical standards in your role as lieutenant governor?
Bastani: The first step for ethical leadership is for all candidates and elected leaders to refuse to accept corporate donations. This I have pledged and obeyed in my primary campaign and will continue through my public service. Secondly, elected leaders should never accept employment from state lobbyists upon the end of their term of office, something for which I have no desire.
How do you plan to use your tie-breaking power to influence legislation, and in what areas do you see the most opportunity for bipartisan cooperation?
Bastani: I will always use my bully pulpit as the tie breaking vote in the Virginia Senate to amend legislation to benefit those two thirds of Virginians who live paycheck to paycheck. I pledge to use my tie breaking vote as an ombudsman for the working class. 
What’s the most important thing for Virginians to know about you?
Bastani: I have dedicated my entire professional life to serving other people. Whether as an attorney, a union leader, or simply a Freshman High School coach. Both my parents dedicated their lives to serving others in the medical profession by curing the body and soul.  I aspired to protect people’s economic living standards and keep as many people in the middle class as I could. I am not a perfect man but my first priority has been and always will be to fight the powerful on the behalf of the often powerless.

Here are Republican John Reid’s responses.
Virginia’s constitution stipulates that the lieutenant governor presides over the state Senate. How has your legislative or political experience prepared you for that role?
Reid: My entire professional and personal life has been at the cross-section of politics and policy. From serving as Senior Staff in the U.S. Senate working on behalf of Virginians to Directing editorial communications across the country for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to analyzing and critiquing Virginia leaders and ideas for the last decade, I’m uniquely positioned to help create a reasonable and responsible legislative agenda and lead the Senate so all Virginians are served.

The last four years have shown us the benefits and challenges of a gubernatorial administration working effectively with a legislative body of the opposite political party. How would you participate in strengthening a productive working relationship with legislators, even if the General Assembly is controlled by a party that’s opposite of yours?
Reid: I am a unique candidate who has spent a lifetime navigating controversial issues with a wide variety of people with differing views. Some have mocked my time as a popular radio host but to be a talk show host you must study issues and listen intently to others before you offer a strident opinion, Having watched the Virginia legislature up close for decades I have no doubt I will be able to forge working relationships with reasonable people in both parties.
Though lieutenant governors are not legislators, they can signal favor of work the General Assembly does. Are there specific types of legislation that your office would advocate in support of in the General Assembly?
Reid: It’s imperative that the Lt Governor show clear leadership, while confirming a commitment to the rule of law and objectivity in its administration. I intend to side with the law abiding citizens and advocate boldly for them against the movement to coddle criminals. Tax reform is also an imperative as Virginia risks falling behind other states with no car tax and lower or no income tax. We need a rethinking of our tax structure to keep and recruit business and an increasingly mobile workforce, And I’d very much like to help create options for families as they seek a school that will appropriately educate their children.
What is your stance on school choice and how do you propose to address educational disparities?
Reid: There are great public schools in Virginia but there are also big problems that the public system does not seem to be able to correct. Providing options for parents and kids must be a priority and we need to reverse the recent trend of making opting out more difficult for parents. Charter, church, and home school opportunities and funding must be expanded. And I will be unpopular for demanding a return to personal and academic discipline perhaps with the first step being mandatory uniforms and more severe punishments instead of the passive programs of the last two decades.
Do you support the current administration’s focus on revising school curricula and how would you approach curriculum content as lieutenant governor?
Reid: Our students need focused attention on the fundamentals that allow them to grow intellectually and they need to graduate with a warm appreciation for the society they are inheriting instead of arriving at age 18 with hostility and disdain for their own country and culture. The time of anti-western and anti-American indoctrination must stop.
In light of recent controversies involving public officials, how do you plan to uphold and promote ethical standards in your role as lieutenant governor?
Reid: A few key rules: Obey the law. Don’t lie. Be above reproach ethically and stay fully focused on the fundamentals of each task. I try to always be fair- in business and in broadcasting and I will continue to do so in this role.
How do you plan to use your tie-breaking power to influence legislation, and in what areas do you see the most opportunity for bipartisan cooperation?
Reid: It appears that we are entering a very hyper partisan era at the capitol, I am relatively conservative and will vote and advocate with those values as a general guide.
What’s the most important thing for Virginians to know about you?
Reid: I left a successful job and career and a decent paycheck to pursue this job and this leadership opportunity. This is not about money or celebrity status or power or future politics for me, it’s about leading away from zealotry and social justice warrior agendas and making reasonable and responsible and fair decisions so that free citizens can manage their own lives as they see fit.

(Photo courtesy campaign)Three contenders are aiming to become Virginia’s top prosecutor. The Mercury asked the attorney general hopefuls — incumbent Republican Jason Miyares and Democrats Jay Jones and Shannon Taylor — to answer a questionnaire to outline their legal experience and their positions on legislative policy that shapes citizens’ lives. On primary day, June 17, Taylor or Jones will win the chance to challenge Miyares on Election Day in November. Here are Democrat Jay Jones’ responses, which have been lightly edited for length and clarity.
What do you see as some unresolved or ongoing consumer protection concerns you would address in your role as attorney general?
Jones: The Attorney General should work for the people, not the wealthiest corporations in our state. I will always fight to hold special interests accountable, to encourage cleaner and more affordable energy practices, and to protect families from unfair utility costs. But my opponents can’t make that promise, because they are taking massive corporate campaign checks from Dominion.
As Assistant Attorney General in Washington, D.C., I was a member of the Office of Consumer Protection, where I fought gun manufacturers, financial institutions, and housing conglomerates to stand up for the rights of everyday citizens. As Attorney General, I’ll continue this fight and take on the corporate price gougers driving up costs for working families. That includes standing up to monopolies like Kroger and Albertsons whose proposed merger would raise grocery prices and hurt Virginia communities. 
I’ll expand the Consumer Protection Section to aggressively go after companies that break the law to make a buck — whether through collusion, predatory lending, or digital exploitation. I’ll prioritize enforcement that protects low-income and vulnerable Virginians. 
Data centers continue proliferating in Virginia, and state regulators have confirmed their energy demands will increase in the coming years. As AG, how would you help the state navigate this dynamic? Are there regulatory issues related to data centers that concern you or that you would like to alter?
Jones: We must always work to ensure a strong Virginia economy AND protecting local communities and maintaining their voice in developments that affect them. As Attorney General, I will always enforce the rules without giving large corporations an unfair leg up and make sure Virginians have their say in regulatory processes. I will particularly emphasize that Virginia’s clean energy development can be expanded without corporate interference preventing the growth of the clean energy we need, that creates good Virginia jobs that powers our economy.
What sets you most apart from your opponents?
Jones: I’ve served as a legislator, an Assistant Attorney General, and a lifelong public servant focused on fairness and justice. As an Assistant Attorney General, I fought to hold large corporations and gun manufacturers alike accountable, taking on a ghost gun manufacturer to get illegal guns off the streets and working to stop the Kroger-Albertson’s merger to prevent higher grocery prices. In the House of Delegates, I fought to expand abortion rights, expand Medicaid, raise teacher pay, and championed clean energy growth that creates good jobs and lower energy bills . I also helped pass Virginia’s red flag law to keep guns out of dangerous hands. I know how this office works—and how to deliver real results for Virginians. I bring both legal experience and a deep understanding of how to make policy work for people.
Finally, I know what it takes to lead at this moment. We need an Attorney General who won’t hesitate to take on Jason Miyares and Donald Trump. I’m ready to do that on day one.
What role do you think Virginia should or shouldn’t play in immigration, particularly with the Trump administration’s term overlapping with what could be your term?
Jones: Immigration enforcement is the job of the federal government.Local law enforcement already has a massive job keeping our communities safe from violent crime. There’s no question  our immigration system is broken and it’s unacceptable that Congress and the federal government refuses to fix it.
Attorney General Jason Miyares and Gov. Glenn Youngkin have credited Operation Ceasefire with helping to reduce violent crime in Virginia. How would you build on those efforts and/or what would you change about it?
Jones: I’ve fought for commonsense gun safety measures before—and I’ll do it again. While serving as an Assistant Attorney General in Washington, D.C., I worked to keep ghost guns off our streets—because no one should be able to assemble a deadly weapon with no background check and no serial number. As a delegate, I voted to expand background checks and supported red flag laws that allow intervention before it’s too late. That’s why I’m proud to have been recognized as a Gun Sense Candidate by Moms Demand Action, which reflects my commitment to protecting our communities. Meanwhile, we have an Attorney General who uses the office to fight against common sense gun safety measures that save lives. As AG, I’ll do what he won’t— crack down on illegal trafficking and work every day to reduce gun violence in Virginia.
Though attorneys general are not legislators, they can signal favor of work the General Assembly does. Are there specific types of legislation that your office would advocate in support of in the General Assembly?
Jones: As Attorney General I’ll take on price gouging, housing discrimination, and corporate abuse, while defending reproductive freedom and civil rights. Legislation that works towards those goals are those I would support.
Considering the investigations into admission practices at Thomas Jefferson High school in Northern Virginia, how would you approach balancing diversity initiatives with concerns about potential discrimination? 
Jones: As Attorney General, I will enforce the law fairly and make sure the rights of all Virginians are protected.
The Youngkin administration has supported policies requiring parental consent for changes to students’ names and pronouns. How do you reconcile these policies with transgender students’ rights to privacy and autonomy? Would you support expanding or limiting such policies?
Jones: I believe these are decisions that should be decided locally, and that neither politicians in Richmond nor Washington should be telling local communities and parents what to do.
What are your thoughts on a retail cannabis market in Virginia? What’s your response to the concerns of some residents and lawmakers that Virginia’s decriminalization of recreational cannabis use by adults without creating a state-authorized way to buy it perpetuates a legal limbo?
Jones: I support legalizing retail sales of cannabis—but it must be done responsibly. That means strong consumer protections, clear safety standards, and a regulatory structure that ensures all Virginians have a fair shot to participate in the industry. The gray market that’s popping up is a symptom of inaction. It’s time to bring clarity, fairness, and structure to this issue.

(Photo courtesy Stoney campaign)iWith seven contenders vying to become Virginia’s next lieutenant governor, the Mercury asked all the hopefuls to answer a questionnaire covering their political and legislative experiences and their positions on policy that shapes citizens’ lives. Here are Democrat Levar Stoney’s responses.
Virginia’s constitution stipulates that the lieutenant governor presides over the state Senate. How has your legislative or political experience prepared you for that role?
Stoney: I would enter office with more formal government experience than any Lieutenant Governor in recent memory, with more than a decade of executive leadership at both the state and local levels. That experience has allowed me to build strong relationships with leaders on both sides of the aisle, which is essential for serving as a fair and effective presiding officer. As Secretary of the Commonwealth, I worked closely with the General Assembly to deliver results for the McAuliffe administration. As Mayor of Richmond, I partnered with the City Council to confront tough challenges and get things done. In both roles, I learned the importance of clear and consistent communication, as well as setting clear expectations. As presiding officer, Senators will know I say what I mean and mean what I say. We may not always agree, but we will treat each other with the respect and decorum the people of Virginia deserve.
The last four years have shown us the benefits and challenges of a gubernatorial administration working effectively with a legislative body of the opposite political party. How would you participate in strengthening a productive working relationship with legislators, even if the General Assembly is controlled by a party that’s opposite of yours?
Stoney: We have to begin with shared values: we all want our kids to be successful, to keep a roof over our heads, and to put food on the table. Those are the values that unite us, and they should be the foundation for any conversation between elected leaders, no matter their party. From there, we can confront the shared challenges facing Virginians today: our children are falling behind in public education, and rising costs are making it harder for families to make ends meet. We will not agree on everything, and that is okay. I will be a happy warrior—someone who is willing to stand firm on values, speak up when there is disagreement, and still find a way to work together when common ground exists. Disagreement does not have to lead to dysfunction. We can, and must, learn to disagree without being disagreeable. That is the kind of leadership I have practiced as mayor and will bring to the role of Lieutenant Governor: focused on results, rooted in respect, and ready to build bridges. At a time when Donald Trump is modeling the opposite—division and chaos—we need leaders in Virginia who will rise above the noise and stay focused on delivering for working families.
Though lieutenant governors are not legislators, they can signal favor of work the General Assembly does. Are there specific types of legislation that your office would advocate in support of in the General Assembly? 
Stoney: With abundance as our north star, I believe the General Assembly should prioritize legislation that lowers costs and expands opportunity, starting with housing. I strongly support efforts like Senator Sturtevant’s bill to curb private equity and hedge fund purchases of single-family homes. When large investors buy up housing stock, they drive up prices and shut out first-time buyers and working families. That is not a sustainable path forward for Virginia. We need to build more and build smarter. The General Assembly can incentivize localities to increase housing supply by easing outdated regulations on parking minimums, expanding access to accessory dwelling units, and encouraging zoning reforms that allow for greater density in areas where it makes sense. These are practical steps that can make a meaningful difference in housing affordability. However, we cannot stop at policy alone. The state must also be a true partner to local governments by investing in the infrastructure that supports growth. That includes roads, water systems, schools, and energy capacity. Too often, localities are expected to implement policy without the necessary tools or funding. If we want to bring down costs and create communities where people can thrive, we need a shared commitment to both bold ideas and meaningful resources. That is the kind of partnership I will champion as Lieutenant Governor.
What is your stance on school choice and how do you propose to address educational disparities?
Stoney: The experience in Arizona has shown us what happens when school voucher programs are expanded without guardrails. They blow a hole in state education budgets, and the vast majority of the money goes to families who were already sending their children to private schools. That is not school choice; it is public subsidization of private education for the well-off.
Instead of siphoning dollars away from our public schools, we need to modernize Virginia’s funding formulas so the state fully covers the true cost of educating every child. That includes lifting the arbitrary cap on support staff, a cap that has remained in place since the Great Recession, as documented in the 2023 JLARC report. Our students deserve access to counselors, social workers, and intervention specialists who can provide the individualized support needed for success.
As Mayor of Richmond, I increased local school funding by nearly 60 percent because I believe deeply that investing in public education is a down payment on our future. While Governor Youngkin and Lieutenant Governor Sears have tried to raid public education dollars to benefit private schools, they have presided over a Virginia that ranks 50th in reading recovery and 41st in math recovery since the pandemic. That is unacceptable.
We need to invest in the fundamentals: strong public schools, adequate staffing, and the resources every student needs to thrive. Every child in every zip code deserves a fair shot at success.
Do you support the current administration’s focus on revising school curricula and how would you approach curriculum content as lieutenant governor?
Stoney: We absolutely cannot allow partisan politics to dictate what is taught in our classrooms. On his first day in office, Governor Youngkin signed an executive order banning what he and others have labeled as inherently divisive concepts. In practice, this has meant restricting classroom discussion about race, history, or systemic inequality. He also launched a parent tip line to report teachers and directed the Department of Education to remove references to topics like unconscious bias and institutional racism.
The administration also pushed to rewrite Virginia’s history and social studies standards, initially proposing drafts that downplayed Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Juneteenth, and Indigenous perspectives. Only after widespread public outcry and criticism from educators were those changes revised.
As Lieutenant Governor, I will support educators, families, and the State Board of Education working together to ensure students are prepared for the real world. That means telling the full truth of our shared history, not just the version politicians like Donald Trump and Glenn Youngkin wish had been the case. We should be teaching students how to think, not what to think, and we must keep politics out of the classroom.
In light of recent controversies involving public officials, how do you plan to uphold and promote ethical standards in your role as lieutenant governor?
Stoney: As Lieutenant Governor, I will uphold the highest ethical standards. Virginians deserve to know that their leaders are working for them, not for special interests or political insiders. I have been honored to take the oath of office three times, and each time I committed to uphold the Constitutions of Virginia and the United States. I will do the same in this role, not just in words but through action. That includes adhering fully to the financial disclosure requirements of the office and conducting myself with transparency.
I will issue a public schedule on a consistent basis and make myself available to both the people and the press for questions. Whether I am in Richmond or traveling across the Commonwealth, I will be accessible and accountable. Good government begins with open communication and trust that is earned through action.
How do you plan to use your tie-breaking power to influence legislation, and in what areas do you see the most opportunity for bipartisan cooperation?
Stoney: My north star for any decision I make in elected office is simple: what is best for working people. That will be my guiding principle if I am called to cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate. I have dedicated my life to public service to ensure every Virginian gets a fair shot, and I will carry that same commitment into the office of Lieutenant Governor.
I know what it means to live on the margins. I was raised on the wages of a father who worked construction, landscaping, and custodial jobs, and the Social Security check that helped my grandmother get by. I am here because of their sacrifice, and I have never forgotten what it feels like to worry whether there is enough to make ends meet. That is why I see a real opportunity for bipartisan cooperation when it comes to curing the cost-of-living crisis that working families face across Virginia.
We can find common ground on housing by easing regulatory barriers, investing in infrastructure, and expanding supply in a way that respects local needs. We can work together to bring down everyday costs, from child care to energy bills. These are not Democratic or Republican issues. They are kitchen table issues. In this moment, all Virginia leaders must stand together to protect our federal workforce and defend the most vulnerable Virginians who are under threat from Donald Trump’s so-called “big beautiful bill.” We need leadership that is focused on solutions, not slogans, and I am ready to work with anyone serious about delivering for the people of this Commonwealth.
What’s the most important thing for Virginians to know about you?
Stoney: I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I am the son of two unwed teenagers, and my grandmother saved my life by stepping in to raise me. Neither she nor my father graduated from high school, but they gave me something even more valuable: faith, discipline, and a deep sense of responsibility to others. My grandmother often reminded me, “To whom much is given, much is required.” That scripture became the foundation of my life.
I was the first in my family to graduate from high school, then the first to earn a college degree. Since then, I have dedicated my life to serving Virginia. I led the Democratic Party of Virginia as Executive Director, served in the governor’s cabinet as Secretary of the Commonwealth, where I helped restore voting rights to over 200,000 Virginians, and served as Mayor of Richmond, where we cut the poverty rate by a third, built new schools, and brought down Confederate monuments in the former capital of the Confederacy.
I understand what working families are facing because I have lived it. And I have the executive experience at both the state and local level to get things done. In a time of real danger and uncertainty, Virginians need leadership rooted in both lived experience and proven results. I would be honored to earn your vote on June 17.

(Photo courtesy campaign)Three contenders are campaigning to become Virginia’s top prosecutor. The Mercury asked the attorney general hopefuls to answer a questionnaire covering their legal experience and their positions on policy that shapes citizens’ lives. Here are Democrat Shannon Taylor’s responses.
What do you see as some unresolved or ongoing consumer protection concerns you would address in your role as attorney general?
Taylor: In this time of rising prices and a shaky economy, Virginians are struggling to make ends meet, to purchase necessities and to handle the ever escalating costs of housing. 
I will work with the General Assembly to ensure we do everything we can to strengthen and stabilize the economy so every Virginian can succeed. Moreover, price gougers and internet scammers are attacking too many Virginians, making it even harder for them to succeed. One of my priorities is to crack down on internet crime and on price gouging, forming a unit within the attorney general’s office to address these pernicious crimes. 
Data centers continue proliferating in Virginia, and state regulators have confirmed their energy demands will increase in the coming years. As AG, how would you help the state navigate this dynamic? Are there regulatory issues related to data centers that concern you or that you would like to alter?
Taylor: Data center development represents possible economic development opportunities but requires large amounts of land, of energy, and of water which impacts the communities in which they are located. Moreover, the requests are increasing quickly without consideration of needed rules and guidelines.
As we consider when and how to approve data centers, we need to make sure we do so in conjunction with our clean energy laws and regulations, making every effort to ensure they are energy efficient and use clean energy to power them. Moreover, the data center should pay for the costs of the generation and transmission of the needed energy. Those costs should not be passed on to residents. 
What sets you most apart from your opponents?
Taylor: I am the only candidate to have prosecuted a case and flipped a Republican seat. 
I became the first Democrat elected Commonwealth’s Attorney for Henrico County in decades, winning re-election three times with bipartisan support. I know how to beat powerful interests that get in the way of progress: I’ve taken on the gun lobby to reduce illegal guns on our streets, held fraudsters accountable for exploiting seniors and driving up costs, and was one of the first prosecutors in the nation to push back against criminalizing women and doctors for accessing abortions after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a national movement for other prosecutors to do the same. 
Virginia needs an Attorney General with prosecutorial experience, a proven record of winning tough fights, and the track record to stand up to Trump and Elon Musk to protect our rights. As Attorney General, I will be a steadfast last line of defense for protecting Virginia’s families, communities, and pocketbooks.
What role do you think Virginia should or shouldn’t play in immigration, particularly with the Trump administration’s term overlapping with what could be your term?
Taylor: My job will be to keep Virginians safe and that means all Virginians. If someone breaks the law they should be held accountable, in compliance with Virginia law, federal law and our Constitution. We must ensure that the Trump Administration is not illegally targeting Virginians and defying the rule of law in order to push his extreme political agenda.
Attorney General Jason Miyares and Gov. Glenn Youngkin have credited Operation Ceasefire with helping to reduce violent crime in Virginia. How would you build on those efforts and/or what would you change about it?
Taylor: I have spent my career taking illegal guns off the streets and advocating for survivors of gun violence. I am a proud recipient of the Everytown for Gun Safety Gun Sense Candidate of Distinction Award and have worked alongside Gun Violence Prevention advocates to try and remove ghost guns from our streets and institute common sense reforms. 
I’m the only candidate in this race with local experience as a Commonwealth’s Attorney and I will bring that experience and knowledge to the office of Attorney General, allowing me to better assist Commonwealth’s attorneys and localities that are struggling. I can be a mentor for those jurisdictions and a support.
Though attorneys general are not legislators, they can signal favor of work the General Assembly does. Are there specific types of legislation that your office would advocate in support of in the General Assembly?
Taylor: The Attorney General’s office works hand in hand with the General Assembly to push forward legislation to fight for Virginia families. I support all three constitutional amendments- protection of reproductive freedom, removing the egregious and illegal ban on same sex marriage from the Virginia Constitution and support for restoration of rights. 
I will advocate at the General Assembly for laws that protect rights and freedoms, for reasonable gun safety, for cracking down on internet crime, stalkers and human trafficking. 
Considering the investigations into admission practices at Thomas Jefferson High school in Northern Virginia, how would you approach balancing diversity initiatives with concerns about potential discrimination? 
Taylor: All Virginians deserve to be protected under the rule of law and the Constitution. We must ensure our Attorney General is fighting discrimination in every corner of our Commonwealth and will work to protect all Virginians’ freedoms, protections and rights. 
The Youngkin administration has supported policies requiring parental consent for changes to students’ names and pronouns. How do you reconcile these policies with transgender students’ rights to privacy and autonomy? Would you support expanding or limiting such policies?
Taylor: Glenn Youngkin is following Donald Trump’s playbook to target our children for his own extreme political agenda. 
We need leaders who will stand up to Donald Trump’s egregious political overreach and ensure that Virginians have a champion for them in the Attorney General’s office. 
What are your thoughts on a retail cannabis market in Virginia? What’s your response to the concerns of some residents and lawmakers that Virginia’s decriminalization of recreational cannabis use by adults without creating a state-authorized way to buy it perpetuates a legal limbo?
Taylor: We must ensure lawmakers are providing clear regulations and safety precautions for the cannabis industry. We must prioritize public safety and ensure that localities have the resources necessary to keep Virginians safe.

(Photo by Juan Vassallo/Investigate Midwest)As Jill Trapp steered her pickup truck down the red dirt roads of southeast Oklahoma, she raised a hand to greet a passing neighbor — a calf roper who once made it to the National Finals Rodeo. 
She drove on, passing a modest cowboy church where Sunday sermons share space with country music and the smell of brisket. 
Then, rising among the cedar and elm trees, came a familiar and unwelcome sight: a row of long, gray, windowless chicken houses, each longer than two football fields.
“I try not to dwell on it. I pretend they’re not here,” Trapp said.
But soon her truck jolted as it rolled through a pothole — one of many left behind by the constant flow of semitrucks hauling hundreds of thousands of chickens through the area. 
In this corner of the state, the poultry industry is hard to ignore.
Within a roughly 25-mile radius of the southeast Oklahoma town of Idabel, there are 59 industrial poultry farms — more than half built in the last 15 years, typically larger than older operations. Together, they raise nearly 7.4 million birds at maximum capacity. All but six grow chickens for Tyson Foods, the largest meat company in the country; the other six farms supply Pilgrim’s Pride, a Colorado-based, multinational food company.
Beyond the usual concerns these farms raise — pollution and odors from the large amounts of waste they generate, problems that have sparked lawsuits in Oklahoma and other states — residents in McCurtain County have another worry: the aquifer.
The region’s rapid growth — driven by poultry farms, marijuana farming, and a tourism boom in Hochatown — is putting mounting pressure on local water supplies. And locals are starting to wonder just how much strain the aquifer water can take. 
Industry-friendly laws and nominal penalties have allowed companies like Tyson to operate with little accountability. Minimal oversight from state agencies often means residents have little information about whether the industrial poultry farms are polluting or depleting the region’s groundwater.
“I’m concerned that we’re going to overuse our waters and not have sustainability for the future,” said Charlette Hearne, a prominent water rights advocate based in Broken Bow.
Dust, flies, and trucks thundering through the night
When Trapp and her husband built their home about 20 years ago, they were drawn to the area’s remoteness and lush landscape — the perfect place, they thought, to start a family and raise cattle and backyard chickens. 
But five years after settling in, a man knocked on their door.
He told them he had purchased the property next door and planned to build six large chicken houses. He also asked them not to raise any chickens, warning they could infect his flock and jeopardize his business.
“This initial disappointment didn’t compare to what happened in the last 15 years,” Trapp said last month at a community meeting in Idabel attended by more than 150 people, including officials from the Oklahoma Water Resources Board.
She went on to describe the overpowering smells that fill her backyard whenever one of the farm’s chicken houses is cleaned out, the swarms of flies and layers of dust that settle on the walls of her house, and the noise from trucks hauling birds throughout the night.
“Each contract grower is required to comply with federal, state, and local laws, including the Oklahoma law to have a farm-specific Nutrient Management Plan (NMP),” a Tyson Foods spokesperson said in a statement. “The terms of each NMP include requirements for storage and disposition of poultry litter, as required under the Oklahoma Registered Poultry Feeding Operations Act. The NMPs are developed with measures designed to prevent discharge.”
The May 1 meeting primarily focused on a proposed 12-building chicken farm, which, if built, would become the second-largest poultry operation in the area. 
The farm’s owners requested a permit from the Oklahoma Water Resources Board to use approximately 86 million gallons of water per year, equivalent to the average water usage of 785 four-person households.
Unlike most other chicken farms in Oklahoma, the cluster of farms in McCurtain County sits atop a regulated aquifer, the Antlers. These farms use water from the aquifer for bird consumption, sanitation and cooling the chicken houses.
The current limit for permitted water withdrawals from the Antlers aquifer is 2.1 acre-feet per acre, or more than 680,000 gallons of water for each acre of land — the highest allocation of any groundwater basin in the state. State officials set that limit in 1995 by dividing the aquifer’s estimated total volume by the acreage above it.

“Our law is designed to deplete the aquifer. It is designed to mine the water for economic purposes,” said Sara Gibson, general counsel for the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, during the meeting.
For Hearne, this admission makes one thing clear: Oklahoma’s water laws need to be updated to reflect the state’s growth and protect its natural resources.
She points to the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer — adjacent to the Antlers — as a success story. 
In the 1980s, local advocates pushed for federal recognition of the aquifer as the region’s only viable drinking water source — a designation that later helped residents push for a comprehensive hydrological study and block a plan to export water.
That study led to a significant change: the aquifer’s withdrawal limit dropped from 2.0 acre-feet to just 0.2 — the lowest in the state.
To Hearne, it’s a straightforward lesson of how science should guide water policy. 
“You’ve got to know your monthly, daily, seasonal variations before you can issue permits properly,” she said.
But perhaps the biggest shock for those at the meeting came with the revelation that most poultry operations typically don’t apply for water permits at all.
‘Domestic use’ loophole lets industrial farms pump water without permits, and without limits
Lobbying by the poultry industry in the 1990s led to a loophole where a permit isn’t required if a property owner claims the water is for “domestic use” rather than a business.
“If the farm is doing business as Bob and Mary Jo Smith, they don’t need a permit. If they’re doing business as Smith Poultry LLC, they do,” Gibson explained. 
While the 63 industrial poultry farms in McCurtain County are owned by individual farmers, they raise chickens under contract with corporations like Tyson Foods and Pilgrim’s Pride, which tightly control their operations. Only four currently have water permits, with a fifth pending for the planned 12-house chicken facility.
Not only does “domestic use” allow a farm to operate without a water permit, but the operation can pull more than twice the amount of water from the aquifer compared to what is allowed under an agricultural use permit.
In practice, the situation is even murkier. Many farms registered as LLCs — which should have permits — also lack them, a gap that Gibson says she is working with the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (ODAFF) to address. The few farms that have applied for permits have likely done so to exceed the limits allowed under domestic use.

Meanwhile, water usage is essentially unlimited: the Water Resources Board relies on an honor system for water reporting — the four poultry farms in McCurtain County with water permits reported zero use in 2024 — and the agency has never revoked a permit or penalized anyone for exceeding their allowed water usage.
“The water used on farms is required to be obtained from lawfully acquired sources,” a Tyson Foods spokesperson said.
Last year, Gov. Kevin Stitt vetoed a bill that would have required metering devices on all groundwater wells across the state — a move praised by the agriculture industry and the Oklahoma Farm Bureau.
The Republican governor rejected the bill despite concerns over intensifying droughts and the agriculture industry’s heavy water use, particularly in northwest Oklahoma. The region recently experienced its second-driest period in over a century. And its main water source, the Ogallala Aquifer, has been significantly depleted by Seaboard Foods.
Even if there were stricter rules and required metering, there may not be enough money for enforcement or aquifer studies, according to Gibson. 
The Water Resources Board’s annual budget — excluding supplemental funds for water and wastewater infrastructure and other programs — has ranged from $5 million to over $8 million in recent years. The agency said it has fewer than 20 staff members to review an average of 250 permit applications and amendments each year, investigate issues and conduct fieldwork.
“We used to have field offices around the state. We don’t have those anymore,” Gibson said.

E. coli in the well — who’s accountable
Many attendees at the meeting expressed concerns not only about water quantity but also water quality. 
The Water Resources Board does not evaluate water quality before issuing a permit — it does not test for drinking water contaminants or assess the potential impact of runoff. And if an aquifer is suspected of being contaminated by a poultry farm, oversight falls to state agriculture department.
Following the May 1 meeting in Idabel, Trapp decided to test her well water. The results came back positive for E. coli.
The lab notified her that the presence of the bacteria posed a “primary health concern,” though it could not determine the source of the contamination.
Asked whether proximity to a poultry farm could be the cause, Teena Gunter, general counsel at the agriculture department, responded:
“[E. coli] is not common in well water near poultry farms,” she said. “Poultry farms are considered no-discharge facilities. So for anything to run off from that process would be a major violation.”
But Jayme Cannon, an environmental scientist with the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, says well owners living near poultry farms should be concerned about bacteria like E. coli. 
“If E. coli is consistently present in the well, yes, that is a cause for concern.” Cannon said. “E. coli is an acute health risk and if it is present in water, the water should not be used for drinking or consumption.”
Last year, an Oklahoma conservation group found elevated levels of E. coli and enterococcus in parts of eastern Oklahoma with a high concentration of poultry farms — an indication of animal feces contamination.
Trapp plans to retest her water to rule out contamination caused by recent storms. But even if the bacteria returns, proving it came from the Tyson farm next door would be difficult — and past violations by poultry farms have rarely led to serious penalties.
In 2023, Oklahoma agriculture department fined 14 poultry farms between $100 and $300 each for failing to submit or submitting late their litter management reports. The highest fine, $600, was issued to a farm that failed to renew its license or file any reports for three years. It was the only enforcement action taken by the agency.
“Agencies are limited in what they can do because of the authorities they’ve been granted by the legislature,” said Shanon Phillips, director of the water quality division at the Oklahoma Conservation Commission.

A bill passed last year increased the fines the agriculture department can impose to $1,000 and gave the agency more authority to act when poultry farms break the rules. 
But the same bill also granted poultry companies legal protection, shielding them from lawsuits as long as they comply with regulations.
That’s troubling, critics say, because even when farms follow the rules, pollution continues to be a problem.
In 2005, then-Attorney General Drew Edmondson sued a group of poultry companies over elevated phosphorus levels in the Illinois River watershed caused by chicken litter used as fertilizer. Rainfall and irrigation washed phosphorus from the litter into nearby streams and rivers, fueling algae blooms and degrading water quality. 
After 18 years of litigation, a U.S. District Judge ruled in favor of Oklahoma, holding poultry companies — including Tyson Foods — responsible for polluting the watershed.
The companies pushed back, citing improvements since 2005. But at a hearing last year, six scientific experts testified that chicken litter pollution remains a serious problem. They presented data showing rising phosphorus levels, with some arguing that a ban on the use of chicken litter as fertilizer may be the only solution.
The same system that broke previous farmers now recruits new ones
During this year’s state legislative session, Sen. George Burns, R-Pollard, introduced two bills aimed at stopping the growth of the poultry industry in his district after hearing from his constituents.
One bill proposed a moratorium on all new poultry farm applications, while the other would have required poultry farm owners to provide proof of residency.
“These people are from Vietnam. They are getting 1% loans. They come in here and put these mega operations all over southeast Oklahoma — and they are illegal,” Burns said during a February Agriculture Committee hearing. He later referred to the farms as “filthy operations.”
But the senator did not present any evidence that the poultry farms were operating illegally or that their owners were undocumented residents. Both bills ultimately failed in committee.
The bills, even if passed, would not have addressed the water concerns voiced by residents of McCurtain County.
Brad Phillips, who has lived on his land in McCurtain County since he was 10 years old, challenged the groundwater permit for the planned mega chicken farm next to his property. He and one of the applicants, Duc Minh Tran, appeared at a hearing at the Oklahoma Water Resources Board offices in Oklahoma City.
“We’re always about three weeks from a drought… it seems like in these more recent times my stock ponds go drier quicker,” Phillips said during his testimony.
Tran, who speaks limited English, gave brief responses during questioning. But after the hearing, his attorney, Bryan Nowlin, said Tran is an American citizen, is following the law, and wants to pursue the American dream by building a successful business.

Across the country, a growing share of poultry farmers are Asian immigrants, particularly Vietnamese and Laotian. Burns’ remarks reflect the suspicions of some McCurtain County residents, many of whom have either filed for bankruptcy as poultry farmers or know others who have. They question why a new wave of growers is willing to take on millions in debt to build farms for the same companies that drove others into financial ruin.
These tensions have been exacerbated by reports of undocumented workers and labor exploitation at marijuana farms, many operated by Asian immigrants.
Investigate Midwest could not independently verify whether immigrant farmers receive low-interest loans, special bonuses or subsidies. But many appear to operate under the same contract system that has long exploited chicken farmers.
Amanda Hitt, a lawyer who has spent more than a decade representing whistleblowers in the food system, urged the USDA to collect updated demographic data on poultry contract growers after working with clients who speak little or no English and have been subjected to exploitative, and often misleading contracts.
“They’re asked to just sign documents and they just go ahead. They don’t know what they’re signing. They don’t know why they’re signing. They just sign it,” Hitt said. “They’re very willing to take orders and directives and do more than their white counterparts.”
Jack Brown, who lives near the town of Valiant, has been a poultry farmer for Tyson since 1995. Last year, the company told him that his chicken houses were too old and they were ending his contract.
He said the early years were profitable. But then the company started penalizing him, withholding chickens for six months at a time for two consecutive years, without explanation. They kept demanding upgrades, which he made — spending $200,000 — until he could no longer afford to keep up.
“When I built my (chicken) house it cost $250,000,” Brown said. “Now it costs nearly $1 million. So I couldn’t keep up with the technology and production.”
With his main source of income gone, Brown, a retired electrician, has returned to work refurbishing turbines.
Brown knows some of the newer Asian poultry farmers in the area and maintains friendly relationships with them  — as does Jill Trapp, despite her frustrations with the Tyson farm next door.
Trapp, whose neighboring poultry farm is owned by a Vietnamese man, describes a warm relationship with her neighbor. They exchange Christmas gifts, and she chats with his son when he visits, since he speaks fluent English. Her issue isn’t with the farmers themselves — it’s with the companies behind them.
“Corporations just have this individual to make it look like they’re a little chicken farmer, but they’re not,” Trapp said. “Big corporations, the big chicken houses and marijuana farms come in and they all dig wells… Now, that’s not a very untypical thing in agriculture. But they’re not individuals anymore.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/5-1-25_Oklahoma-PFO-7-1024x619.jpg,,,2025-06-16 05:59:07.701768

(Photo: NCGA videostream) A panel of three federal judges will consider whether the election districts North Carolina Republicans approved for congressional and legislative seats diminish Black voting power in violation of the Constitution and federal law. 
Black and Latino voters, the state NAACP, and Common Cause are suing over districts drawn in 2023 and used in last year’s elections. 
Two separate lawsuits filed in December 2023 –  the first over congressional districts and the second over congressional and legislative districts – were consolidated for the trial that begins Monday in Winston-Salem. 
The focus is on six of 14 congressional districts, nine of 120 state House districts, and five of 50 state Senate districts. 
The lawsuit contends Republicans “drew minority voters into and out of districts based on their race” to decrease minority voting power and increase Republican power. 
During the 2023 redistricting debates in the legislature, Republicans said repeatedly that they did not use racial data in creating the districts. The Senate redistricting criteria allowed partisan advantage to be considered. 
In court filings, lawyers for Republican legislators suggested that the lawsuits dress partisan gerrymandering claims “in racial garb.”
The state Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court have ruled that they do not have a role in judging partisan gerrymandering. That leaves racial gerrymandering as a key reason North Carolina election district maps  can be challenged.
The trial will produce no evidence of racial motive, the Republicans’ lawyers wrote. 
“Legislative denials of racial motive may be discredited only based on compelling, contrary evidence. None is available.”
The shape of congressional and legislative districts helps determine which party holds power in Raleigh and in Washington. 
Using a congressional district map drawn by a special master for the 2022 elections, Democrats won seven of the state’s 14 congressional seats and Republicans won seven.  
Republican legislators were able to redraw the map for last year’s elections. The 2024 districts produced a North Carolina congressional delegation of 10 Republicans and four Democrats. 
“Redistricting is about power. Who gets it.  Who keeps it, and who ultimately gets left out,” Da’Quan Love, executive director of the state NAACP,  told reporters Thursday. 
“Too often, Black communities in our state are carved up, silenced, and sidelined by maps drawn not to represent us, but to restrict us,” he said.  “When politicians use gerrymandering to divide our neighborhoods and weaken our votes, they’re not just manipulating the process, they are rigging the outcomes.”
The lawsuit challenges Congressional District 1 in the northeast, Congressional District 5, which is mostly in the northwest, District 6 and District 10 in the Piedmont, and Districts 12 and 14 in Mecklenburg and counties to the west. 
In the Piedmont, Republican legislators sliced heavily Democratic Guilford County into pieces and divided them among majority-Republican districts. No Democrat, including Democratic incumbent, chose to run in the new Republican District 6. 
The Senate districts challenged are in Mecklenburg County and in the Eastern and northeastern parts of the state.
Two of the districts are the subject of a separate lawsuit where voters contend that counties that make up part of the Black Belt in eastern North Carolina were divided to dilute Black voting power. 
Senate district 8, which was redrawn to add majority Black neighborhoods in Wilmington to a predominately Republican district, is also part of the suit.
House districts challenged include those in the eastern and northeastern parts of the state, Forsyth, Wake, Vance, and Granville. 
The hoped-for outcome is for the court to require the legislature to redraw the maps, said Hilary Harris Klein, a lawyer with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, told reporters this week.  The SCSJ is representing the state NAACP, Common Cause, and individual voters.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/HilaryHarrisKlien_9272023.jpg,,,2025-06-16 05:59:07.701768

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Cities lead bans on algorithmic rent hikes as states lag behind

Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Lisa Bowman, director of marketing and communications at the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Bowman wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” she wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin) Last year, lawmakers united to expand the use of accessible voting machines in local elections to all cities and towns, passing a one-year pilot program overseen by the Secretary of State’s Office.
But while that effort continues, disability rights advocates are raising concerns about proposed legislation they say could make it harder for people with disabilities to vote.
In one effort, House and Senate Republicans are considering a bill to require that people applying for an absentee ballot by mail provide photocopied proof of their identity — or a signature backed by a notary.
And in another, lawmakers are weighing a bill to give cities and towns the option to not provide accessible voting machines in local elections unless voters who would use them write letters requesting them.
The two efforts are both set to be debated by House and Senate negotiators this week. And they have emerged as Republicans have taken steps to tighten the verification process for voting and registering to vote in New Hampshire, arguing the state’s current processes are vulnerable to fraud.
In 2024, then-Gov. Chris Sununu signed House Bill 1569, which requires that people who are newly registering to vote in New Hampshire provide hard copy proof of their citizenship through a birth certificate, passport, or other qualifying document. The bill, which includes the furthest-reaching voter registration requirements in the country, has since been challenged by two federal lawsuits. 
This year, the House and Senate have sought to extend HB 1569 to absentee voting. Senate Bill 218 would require absentee voters registering in New Hampshire to submit the same hard copy proof of citizenship as other voters.
And a late amendment added to Senate Bill 287 by the House would also add new documentary requirements for people requesting absentee ballots.  
In introducing the new amendment, Rep. Ross Berry, a Weare Republican and the chairman of the House Election Law Committee, said it was intended to provide the same amount of scrutiny for absentee voters as for in-person voters.
“As amended, this bill aligns the process of requesting an absentee ballot more closely with the requirements for in-person voting,” Berry wrote in the House calendar. “Under current law, voters requesting an absentee ballot are not required to provide proof of identification, whereas those voting in person must present acceptable photo identification.”
On Tuesday, disability rights attorneys and advocates held a press conference speaking against that potential new requirement, which they said could impede the ability of homebound people with disabilities to vote.
Under the amended SB 287, people unable to get to their town or city hall to request an absentee ballot in person would need to either have access to technology to print a copy of their necessary documents or have access to an accredited notary who can affirm the voter’s signature on the absentee ballot application form.
James Ziegra, senior staff attorney at the Disability Rights Center of New Hampshire, said that would be burdensome to many voters.
“Even if they are able to make a copy of their license, those who are unable to drive are going to need to arrange transportation and assistance to get to their local town offices and complete their paperwork,” Ziegra said during the press call.
But Berry dismissed that concern, saying the state has options for digital notarization for those who aren’t able to easily leave their homes.
“Importantly, New Hampshire law currently allows for electronic and remote notarization services, providing an additional, accessible option for voters to verify their identity remotely,” Berry wrote. “Voters who request an absentee ballot in person may simply present their ID at the clerk’s office.”
Advocates have also raised concerns with House Bill 613, which would give towns an option to not provide accessible voting machines in specific circumstances. 
Currently, the Help America Vote Act of 2002 requires that the Secretary of State’s Office provide accessible voting machines to cities and towns for all elections with federal candidates on the ballot. In New Hampshire, that includes the presidential primary, the state primary in September, and the general election in November. But the requirement does not apply to municipal elections in which candidates are aldermen, councilors, or mayors, and it does not include town elections, such as annual town meeting.
Until recently, towns were not obligated in New Hampshire or federal law to provide accessible voting machines for those local elections. And the Secretary of State’s Office did not provide the machines loaned out for federal elections to do so, arguing it was too burdensome to program and transport them to all towns that needed them.
In 2024, lawmakers sought to change this, passing legislation requiring the use of accessible voting machines in local elections, and creating a pilot program in which the Secretary of State’s Office loaned the machines to towns during the spring 2025 town meeting season. This year, the Legislature is attempting to make that arrangement permanent, via House Bill 67, and require the machines to be used in all town elections.
But HB 613, as amended by the Senate, would create an exemption. If passed, a town or city could choose to post a notice on its website at least three months before the election informing voters that the accessible machines will not be available to voters unless a voter notifies the town clerk in writing at least two months before the election that they would like to use it. Under the bill, if a town posted that notice and no voters requested the machines, the town would not be required to provide the machine.
Speaking in favor of the amendment on the Senate floor on June 5, Sen. James Gray, the chairman of the Senate Election Law and Municipal Affairs Committee, said he had proposed the exemption after hearing from towns in North Country that were concerned about the requirement to provide and program accessible voting machines for local elections. 
“Some of the communities up north said that it would cause a problem from them because they were in multiple school districts — one for their elementary school, sometimes one for the middle school, and maybe even another one for their high school — and then the municipal ballot itself, which meant that they would have to pay for the programming of that machine four times to be able to run the election,” Gray said. 
Ziegra criticized HB 613, as well. “HB 613 is unconstitutional, and it gives an out to towns that don’t want to provide disabled residents the means to vote accessibly,” he said. 
He argued that by giving cities and towns statutory permission to not provide accessible voting machines would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and potentially the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
To some cities, that threat is not hypothetical: Concord and Exeter have both purchased accessible voting machines in recent years after residents alleged discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act when the cities did not initially provide the machines.
Randy Pierce, the CEO of Future in Sight, a nonprofit organization that provides services to visually impaired people, added that it could be difficult for visually impaired people to know that they will need to send a letter in order to have an accessible voting machine made available to them. 
“I ask you to think about this: Would you imagine going to face all these barriers, just to access something that everyone else is able to do easily (and) simply?” Pierce said. 
The future of the legislation is unclear. All four of the bills that could affect voters with disabilities — SB 218, SB 287, HB 613 and HB 67 — have been sent to committees of conference this week to hash out disagreements between House and Senate Republicans.
But Sarah Chouinard, a representative of the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights, urged lawmakers to reconsider many of the bills. 
“We’re here today to sound the alarm,” Chouinard said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/votinghopkinton-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-16 05:59:07.701768

(Getty Images)Cheryl Guerin said that without the “wraparound” services her son received when he was suffering through his chronic mental illness, the consequences would’ve been dire.
“He wouldn’t be alive,” Guerin, of Enfield, said during a press conference hosted by several mental health advocacy groups Wednesday.
Guerin said her son lives with a serious mental health condition that’s caused anxiety and led him to run away from school. There were times when he was unable to leave his room or bed. His mental health challenges have led to stays at Hampstead Hospital, the state’s youth psychiatric hospital and residential treatment facility, and the family struggled to navigate the state’s health care system as they tirelessly worked to help their son through his struggles.
“Simply put, my family was in crisis,” she said.
However, the family was eventually able to access New Hampshire’s state-run FAST Forward program. She said despite her family having employer-sponsored health coverage, she wasn’t able to access the program until her son’s condition worsened enough to become eligible for taxpayer support. Only then was the family able to receive wraparound services.
“Looking back,” she said, “our participation in that FAST Forward program was one of the key turning points in my son’s recovery and in our family’s ability to move out of the crisis.”
The services are designed for families that have already attempted less intensive treatments and are dealing with complex situations. The goal is to help them navigate the state’s complicated web of care systems, including mental health care, special education, and child protective services. The program works with families to develop a plan for addressing mental health challenges before they worsen to the point that in-patient psychiatric care is required.
Now, there’s an effort in Concord to ensure this care can be provided by private health insurers. The FAST Forward program currently accepts private insurance but insurers typically do not cover the services. Around 20% of FAST Forward participants are commercially insured, but most aren’t paying for the program with their insurance. When someone’s insurance doesn’t cover the care, if their need for the program is enough, the state pays for it out of the general fund. Those 20% of participants cost the state Department of Health and Human Services $1.9 million annually, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Senate Bill 128 would require private insurers to help cover the cost of the program for their customers and create a public-private mechanism — via a new nonprofit organization — to oversee funding of the expanded program.
The legislation, which did not get full approval from the Legislature as a standalone bill, has been incorporated into the Senate’s budget proposal. However, the House didn’t include it in its version. As the two chambers negotiate the differences between their two budget bills — House Bills 1 and 2 — Guerin and mental health advocacy groups like New Futures, the National Alliance on Mental Illness-NH, and Connected Families NH are pushing for the House to accept the proposal. During their press conference Wednesday, they commended Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte and the Senate for their support.
However, some have criticized the proposal over cost concerns. In an open letter, Pat Abrami, vice chairman of a taxpayer interest group called Granite State Taxpayers characterized it as “hidden tax.”
“This is an annual ($)2.5 million tax on all commercial insurance premium holders,” Abrami wrote, “most of which will never gain any benefit from the program it will be funding.”
Granite State Taxpayers contended that, if the proposal goes into effect, insurers will increase premiums for policyholders to cover the cost of the program. The organization pointed to testimony from insurance companies opposing the bill.
At a Senate hearing in February, Andrew Hosmer, a lobbyist for Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a private insurer based in Massachusetts that serves customers throughout New England, said the bill would create “an enormous administrative burden.” He said the organization worries about how expensive its assessment on carriers like Harvard Pilgrim would be. Sabrina Dunlap, senior director of government affairs for national insurer Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, said insurers already cover most of the services involved in wraparound care even if they don’t cover the FAST Forward program in its entirety specifically.
Granite State Taxpayers also lamented that the bill was never given a hearing before any House committees. SB 128 was tabled by the Senate before it went to the House. Later, the Senate inserted the bill’s language into the budget bills, hoping to approve it along with the rest of the budget instead of independently. (Both chambers are controlled by Republicans.)
This type of major policy initiative needs to be heard in the appropriate House Committees,” Abrami wrote. “The Senate did not want to send this over to the House for scrutiny.”
In an attempt to address cost concerns, the mental health advocates last week argued that the proposal would save the state money long term. They argued wraparound services prevent more costly emergency room visits, inpatient psychiatric hospital stays, and other state costs down the line.
Michele Merritt, president of New Futures, argued it would be “cost-neutral.” She said currently taxpayers are subsidizing the care at a cost of $2 million annually because patients who don’t receive wraparound services end up on Medicaid.
“For me, the claim that this is something that will cause premiums to go up is a dog whistle,” Merritt said.
She said stakeholders and advocates have tried to work with insurers several times to get them to cover this care without legislation, to no avail.
“Here’s the quiet part that I’m going to say out loud,” Merritt said. “There is a reason for this: Health insurance companies have a perverse financial incentive to delay or deny access to these services, because when they do, the burden and cost shifts to the state, to the taxpayer. The system rewards commercial carriers for providing the least amount of care possible to kids with mental illness. Without timely access to middle-tier behavioral health supports like FAST Forward, children decompensate until the point that they require inpatient hospitalization. At that point, many children become eligible for Medicaid, and then the state assumes full financial responsibility for their care.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/teenwraparound-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-06-16 05:00:02.723097

It also includes a contentious provision to move certain materials deemed not fit for children.
According to budget documents, the Senate proposal works the same as the House’s, meaning public libraries would receive monthly payments paid directly through transfers from the General Revenue Fund.
That move was criticized by libraries and advocates, at first when an initial House draft of the budget eliminated the Public Library Fund all together, instituting a mechanism that would have been based on population. While the House revised their draft to return the Public Library Fund, it changed the mechanism to the lump-sum GRF funding, rather than the previous funding mechanism, funding the libraries with a percentage of the tax revenue received by the state. Critics said moving to a line-item in the General Revenue Fund leaves the funding more open to elimination entirely, while legislators who supported the idea said tax revenue percentages were more fiscally unpredictable.
The same budget increases the Local Government Fund, which receives its monies through tax revenue percentage, from 1.7% to 1.75%, the exact change library advocates wanted to see for the Public Library Fund.
The library fund had $504.6 million at the end of fiscal year 2025, under the Senate’s plan, according to the Ohio Library Council. The new budget would provide $490 million in fiscal year 2026, and $500 million in 2027.
“This reduction comes at a time when libraries are busier than ever, supporting essential programs like summer reading that help children avoid the ‘summer slide,’” said Ohio Library Council executive director Michelle Francis, referring to the reduction in reading comprehension and literacy that can happen to kids while they’re out of school for the summer.
It was evident even before Senate discussions on the budget had begun that a change to the library fund was likely to be kept. At a gathering of Ohio public libraries at the Statehouse that just happened to fall on the day the House released their final budget draft, Senate Finance Committee Chair Jerry Cirino told reporters he supported the move as was written in the initial House draft.
“I think like everybody else that we appropriate, it should be a biennial appropriation process that’s justified based on input and feedback that we get, not an automatic number,” Cirino told media in April.
State Library of Ohio
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe Senate proposal also creates a State Library Operating Expenses Fund, which neither Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive budget nor the House budget included. The provision would transfer $9 million over the next two years away from the Public Library Fund to the new expenses fund for the State Library of Ohio.
The State Library works to conserve historical documents for the state, as well as working as a resource-sharing entity with libraries across the state. The agency receives funding from both the state and from federal grants.
State Librarian Mandy Knapp said the budget draft cuts the library’s operating expenses by $245,000 in fiscal year 2026 and $331,000 in 2027, compared to the House budget draft. The cuts come alongside rising staffing and health insurance costs, and at a time when the current library facility is “no longer suitable to house the State Library’s collection,” Knapp told the Senate Finance Committee.
“State Library is already maximizing every dollar of funding,” Knapp said. “Without the modest increase to State Library’s operating expenses … that were included in the previous budgets, services will be reduced.”
Knapp also pushed back on the change to put the State Library of Ohio expenses under the Public Library Fund, saying its current line-item in the General Revenue Fund is more appropriate.
“The Public Library Fund was created to support Ohio’s public libraries as defined under the (Ohio Revised Code),” Knapp said. “As the State Library is a state agency that operates a research library and supports a federally funded grant-making program for all types of libraries, it is more appropriate to fund the State Library through the General Revenue Fund rather than the Public Library Fund.”
The State Library is still in danger of federal funding losses as well. It receives funding through the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services, an institute that has had an uncertain future under the Trump administration, facing threats of total elimination as part of federal funding cuts.
In May, the State Library said it had “received reassurances” that it would be getting the remainder of their IMLS grant funding for the fiscal year. But the federal legislation that authorizes the grant funding the State Library of Ohio receives is set to expire in September, according to a spokesperson for the library.
“This act requires reauthorization for the State Library of Ohio to maintain its services to Ohio libraries of all types and to provide library databases for all Ohioans,” wrote Marsha McDevitt-Stredney, spokesperson for the library. “Additionally, reauthorization is essential for the State Library to continue the distribution of federal grant funds to libraries.”
As of June 6,  a federal judge allowed cuts to the Institute of Museum and Library Services to continue temporarily while a lawsuit brought forth on behalf of the American Library Association goes forward.
With the Senate and House funding mechanisms matching in each state budget draft, it’s likely the levels will be maintained through the conference committee process to harmonize both versions into a final draft to be sent to Gov. Mike DeWine for his signature, and/or for line-item vetoes.
Still, Francis said the council remains “hopeful” that things may change through conference committee negotiations.
Also included in both the House and Senate versions of the budget was a provision that requires public libraries to place “material related to sexual orientation or gender identity or expression” in a part of the library “that is not primarily open to the view of minors.”
Library leaders decried the move, saying smaller libraries couldn’t accommodate a request, and even the ones that could said it would come at significant administrative cost to move the materials. They also criticized the provision for being vague about what materials would be included in such a requirement.

Americans have long maintained a healthy instinct to be skeptics. We pride ourselves on demanding proof.
Unfortunately, in recent years, the explosion of social media in which every person has a public platform has allowed this natural skepticism to fuel a situation in which distinctly unscientific conspiracy theories get way too much attention.
And this, tragically, has led millions of people to waiver in their faith in science.
This trend is on display right now in Washington where federal budget writers are planning to slash scientific research funding at a time in which the need in numerous realms — like combating disease and developing clean energy – has never been greater.
Here in
And that would be a terrible mistake.
The bottom line: Science — genuine science — is the ultimate expression of a skepticism-based search for the truth. By forsaking it, we head down a very dangerous road indeed.

Dennis Chack, a former FirstEnergy executive who previously pled the Fifth, took the stand to answer questions from attorneys representing consumers, manufacturers, and energy companies.
The Florida meeting
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Chack described a meeting at former Ohio PUCO chairman Sam Randazzo’s Florida home in April 2019 with FirstEnergy’s then-CEO Chuck Jones and a handful of other executives including then-CFO Steve Strah and John Skory, who headed up a FirstEnergy subsidiary.
“There was discussion about House bill 6, discussion about the SEET (significantly excessive earnings) test and the discussion about DMR (distribution modernization rider),” Chack explained.
House bill 6 bailed out FirstEnergy nuclear and coal plants. Changes to the SEET test protected FirstEnergy from having to pay millions of dollars in refunds. And the Distribution Modernization Rider tacked a surcharge on Ohio ratepayer’s bills to pay for energy grid improvements — an audit later found FirstEnergy did little to track what it did with the money.
FirstEnergy collected $460 million from customers; auditor unsure if it was spent on bribes

Pressed on whether the conversation turned to how Randazzo could influence the outcome of those issues, Chack begged ignorance.
“I don’t know if it did or it didn’t,” he said.
“Those discussions were brought up by Chuck,” Chack continued. “And he talked to Sam about each of those areas, and asked if there was help that Sam could provide in those areas.”
“And then when that was kind of concluding,” he said, “Chuck asked us — myself, John Skory and Steve — asked us to go outside, he wanted to talk to Sam in private.”
Chack said Jones and Randazzo spoke alone for about 10 minutes before coming back out.
After the House bill 6 scandal came to light, Jones was terminated along with Chack and FirstEnergy Vice President of External Affairs Michael Dowling.
Strah got a promotion, taking over as the company’s CEO.
The text messages
Chack received a text message from FirstEnergy CEO Jones, referenced in the company’s deferred prosecution agreement, that detailed the influence Randazzo had already exerted on the company’s behalf and explaining some in the PUCO wondered “does he work there or for us?”
On the stand, Chack attempted to downplay the exchange. He said the company was trying to get a license for brokerage, but it was proceeding slowly.
“It usually takes four to five weeks,” he said. “It had been months now, and we were starting to write contracts for it, and we did have a third-party backup if we needed it.”
So, Chack asked Jones, the company’s CEO, if he could check with Randazzo to “just see if this thing is going to pass or not? And if it is, is there any way that he can move it up a little bit?”
Chack said he had no inclination Jones could exert undue influence over Randazzo. He only assumed as CEO, Jones had a good enough relationship to get information. He depicted the text message as a simple explanation for the delay.
Rachael Guastella, an attorney with the Retail Energy Supply Association asked if Chack was aware PUCO commissioners are prohibited from speaking about open proceedings. Chack said he wasn’t, and claimed he never received ethics training on dealing with the commission.
She asked if Chack was at least aware that commissioners are the decision makers those cases. Chack again claimed he was not.
“If the commissioners were not the decision makers on such certification,” she asked, “Who did you assume were the decision makers?”
“I thought it was staff below that,” Chack said.
Chack’s firing
As the company’s vice president of product development, marketing and branding, Chack oversaw FirstEnergy’s advertising efforts. He explained his termination was tied to a contract with Tony George, a Cleveland businessman who sold billboard placements to FirstEnergy.
“When I was interviewed on that they asked me if the document was accurate and that my signature and date were accurate, and I said they were accurate,” Chack said. “I didn’t disclose it was back dated.”
George served as a go-between for FirstEnergy and former House Speaker Larry Householder. He also worked closely with Chack’s daughter who was starting up a company called DMA Consulting and curious about going into outdoor advertising. She emailed Chack a $44,000 a month advertising proposal mirroring contracts used by George.
In an internal memo from Nov. 2020, FirstEnergy officials point to the backdated contract Chack referenced and added he “may have had an immediate family member who worked at a vendor company that resulted in a conflict of interest.”
Despite his daughter sending in a contract proposal, Chack testified it was never executed, and the company never did business with her.
But Kim Bojko, an attorney for the Ohio Manufacturer’s Association, brought up a FirstEnergy presentation stating Chack signed off on payments to George-controlled companies that later funneled money to his daughter’s business. In all, FirstEnergy said, Chack’s daughter received more than $500,000.
Bojko walked Chack through several allegations laid out by the FirstEnergy board — that Chack deleted documents related to his daughter, that he produced a bogus, backdated contract to cover payments to George companies, and that two of those companies directed roughly half a million dollars to his daughter’s consulting company.
“That’s what it says here,” Chack answered repeatedly.
Boyko even pointed to 1099 tax forms. In 2019, George’s company Strategies for Results paid DMA Consulting $484,000 and and other George firm, Ohio Outdoor Advertising, paid DMA $44,000.
Calling back to that contract proposal Chack’s daughter submitted, Bojko asked, “this is the same contract that was for $44,000 a month or $2.6 million that we discussed earlier?”
“No,” Chack replied.
“This contract’s not the $44,000?” Boyko asked.
“It is, but it’s not for — it was never put in place,” he insisted.

(Photo courtesy of Visit Fargo-Moorhead)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted, and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”
In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns, and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
Outbreak moves north
In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet, and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”

Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas
According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 6, there are 1,168 confirmed cases affecting 33 states. Texas reported two more cases June 10, and Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 17 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.

Lawmakers passed Ohio House Bill 3 on Wednesday, also known as the Enact the School Bus Safety Act. Ohio state Reps. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, and Bernie Willis, R-Springfield, introduced the bill, which now goes to the Senate for consideration. 
“This is one of those bills that I believe is going to be transformational for the way that our school districts think about school bus safety for our kids,” Willis said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The bill increases the penalties for illegally passing a stopped school bus with a fine that would range from $250 to $1,000. Repeated offenses could lead to a license suspension, a required safety course and a $2,000 fine. The current penalty for illegally passing a stopped school bus in Ohio is between $0-$500. 
“We’re missing probably thousands and thousands of illegal passages that are happening because we are not utilizing things that could work,” Willis said. 
In an effort to record people illegally passing a school bus, H.B. 3 authorizes the use of school bus camera requirements. Ohio’s law currently neither specifically authorizes nor prohibits the use of cameras on a school bus. 
“(A school bus driver) can review the footage later, and in accordance with current law, they can put together the report that says this happened at this time,” Willis said. 
The Ohio Department of Public Safety reported in 2021 more than 14,000 citations were issued over a four-year period for illegally passing school buses, Paul Imhoff, government relations director of the Buckeye Association of School Administrators, said during his testimony in April. 
“These dangerous incidents are placing children’s lives at risk, and H.B. 3 would make positive steps forward to enhance school bus safety and mitigate these unnecessary and dangerous occurrences,” he said. 
Thomas said the bill is about children’s safety. 
“Thousands of students in Ohio ride school buses and too many are put at risk by drivers who illegally pass stopped buses,” he said. 
The bill, however, does not require seat belts on buses. 
Seat belts are optional on large school buses weighing more than 10,000 pounds and 63% of Ohio school districts have at least one bus that has a seatbelt, said Lacey Snoke, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce. 
Only eight states require seat belts on school buses: New York, New Jersey, Arkansas, California, Florida, Louisiana, Nevada, and Texas.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine assembled the Ohio School Bus Safety Working Group in 2023 after   Aiden Clark, a Northwestern Local Schools elementary student, died in a school bus crash. The Working Group issued 17 recommendations last year, but requiring seat belts on buses was not one of them.
The National Transportation Safety Board recommends states mandate school buses to have over-the-should and lap seat belts for all passengers.
There were 976 fatal school-transportation-related traffic crashes from 2013 to 2022 and 1,082 people were killed in those crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
Ohio Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, introduced a similar bill in the Senate about school bus safety earlier this year. Senate Bill 62 would create a $300 civil penalty for drivers who pass a stopped school bus illegally. The bill has had three hearings so far.

Local governments and schools say it would come at their expense.
We’ve been talking to homeowners like Debra Weygandt for years. She told us how her property values increased by more than 30% in the most recent reappraisals.
“It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this big jump like this,” Debra Weygandt in Akron’s Highland Square told News 5 in 2024.
Homeowners in different areas across the state are seeing similar hikes. Like Ed Livernois, who was shocked when we spoke to him about his increase last summer.
“I just got a heart attack,” Livernois said.
But state lawmakers say they have a solution.
“$3.5 billion dollars of direct property tax relief to every property owner across the state of Ohio,” said state Rep. David Thomas (R-Jefferson).
Thomas, with the support of state Rep. Bill Roemer (R-Richfield) introduced H.B. 335, a massive property tax relief bill. Among many provisions, the bill limits how much money school districts can get from rising home values — without going to the ballot.
“Eliminating inside millage means that when we see valuation increases, our property owners will not see their tax bills going up near what they’ve seen over the last five years,” Thomas said.
Parma City Schools Superintendent Charles Smialek said that the bill would take away $1.5 billion from schools — with no replacement funding mechanism.
“How they anticipate we’re going to continue to provide any type of services with $1.5 billion less than we collect right now is just unfathomable to me,” Smialek said.
Lawmakers say that schools can go back to the voters for help. But Parma has already been struggling. It has had seven failed levies since 2018.
“We’ve been able to continue to provide a great education for students despite the fact that we haven’t had new money since 2011, but we’ve reached a point where we can’t continue to do that,” Smialek said. “We will have to make very difficult decisions, and it’s bad for kids.”
Schools are also facing other funding challenges. State lawmakers have passed legislation slashing their expected budget by hundreds of millions.
Schools will need to cut staff, classes and extracurricular activities, the superintendent said.
Roemer said that there are other ways schools can save money.
“We want to use this bill as one facet of having those conversations, which could be hard conversations, about shared services, consolidation, mergers, so that costs can be reduced,” Roemer said.
H.B. 335 is just the latest in property reform legislation. The General Assembly has been considering 19 bills.
Because H.B. 335 is brand new, homeowners like Weygandt haven’t gotten a chance to weigh in on it at the statehouse. But last year, she talked about her struggles.
“Just with everything going up all the last years, it’s really hitting the pocketbook,” she said.
A group of homeowners is taking tax relief into their own hands — fighting to get a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would abolish property taxes.
This was put forward, in part, to get lawmakers to do something, organizers say.

(Kevin Winter/Getty Images)Brian Wilson, the sonic architect and soaring falsetto voice of the Beach Boys, was one of the most difficult interview subjects of my career.
Not because he was angry or mean or uncooperative. Indeed, during our six-minute phone conversation in 2009, the famously troubled Wilson couldn’t have been any more pleasant. He simply gave short answers, then stopped speaking. I would ask another question, drawing on my knowledge as a longtime fan, and he would respond with another brief quip.
I didn’t extract any hot gossip for my readers in Concord, New Hampshire. But I didn’t need to. Wilson had already shared his heart and soul with anyone able to hear. You just have to listen to his majestic sweep of recorded work, all the way from the Beach Boys’ 1962 album “Surfin’ Safari” to his 2021 solo record “At My Piano.”
It was all there in the notes.


 Opinion editor Clay Wirestone interviews Brian Wilson in October 2009. The picture was taken before Wilson’s performance in Concord, New Hampshire, on Nov. 3 of that year.
Wilson died Wednesday in Los Angeles at age 82. He had retired from touring in 2022 as he grappled with assorted mental and physical ailments. His wife and devoted protector, Melinda, had passed a little over a year ago. There are surely worse tragedies in the world than an old man with a rich legacy passing away peacefully in his sleep. Yet news of his passing hit me hard, as our state and nation and world convulsed with anger, violence and panic.
Wilson actually came from Kansas roots. His grandparents lived in Hutchinson, and his father was born there in 1917. But I connected with his work before learning of those local ties.
Let me explain why. Wilson was blessed with immeasurable musical gifts, creating the definitive California sound through hit record after hit record. “Surfin’ U.S.A.,” “I Get Around,” “Help Me Rhonda” and “Good Vibrations” soared through the pop-rock stratosphere. Yet in his mid-20s, Wilson began to grapple with mental illness. He was later diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. For the better part of six decades, he heard voices and battled depression.
Wilson nevertheless persisted. He endured dark periods, such as nine years under the control of dubious psychiatrist-Svengali Eugene Landy. His onetime band recorded terrible singles without him. (“Kokomo,” anyone?) He gained and lost tremendous amounts of weight, recorded beautiful music that record companies ignored.
Finally, in the mid-1990s, he escaped the clutches of Landy and married Melinda. He began a solo career in earnest, recruiting a band of fresh-faced musicians from LA and Chicago. He completed the abandoned Beach Boys art-pop project “Smile.” He recorded “That Lucky Old Sun,” a fizzy concept album about California. And the formerly stage-averse musician toured the globe, playing masterpieces such as “Pet Sounds” in their entirety.
I hopped aboard in the mid-’90s, as a high-school age fan. I watched as Wilson picked himself up, dusted himself off, and embarked upon this second act.


 Wilson performed this Beach Boys oldie with daughters Carnie and Wendy for the 1995 documentary “I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times,” directed by fellow musician Don Was.
He inspired me. I’m anxious by nature, sometimes high strung and fearful. Even today, I find myself randomly fretting about a potential interview or column. Yet any challenges I face surely pale compared with his. As bandmate Darian Sahanaja told Variety, Wilson “suffered nearly every day of his life in a struggle to find a little bit of peace and love.” That’s a hell of a burden.
The other lesson that Wilson taught me was this.
You may face unimaginable challenges. You might get knocked down time and again. Yet you can push forward and create work of worth and importance. Wilson’s late appearance sometimes drew scorn from those who didn’t understand his story or diagnoses. But that didn’t stop him. He still recorded and performed his music, still put his beating heart out there for the public to see.
In a way, that’s what I try to do here with my columns, what I encourage others to do when they write.
We all face obstacles. Sometimes those obstacles take a chunk out of us along the way. But that’s no reason to be silent. Indeed, that’s all the reason to speak and sing more loudly. That’s all the more reason to seek connection where we can, joining our voices into a powerful chorus.
Wilson managed that even in death. After he died, both President Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued statements. The two men have been at odds over protests in Los Angeles, but they managed to agree on this.
“Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys was a true Musical genius, right up there with the greatest, EVER,” Trump posted on his Truth Social account.
“Jennifer and I join the world in mourning the death of Brian Wilson, a musical genius and California icon,” Newsom wrote in a statement.
Perhaps we should just send the two men to a Beach Boys concert and see if they can work things out. Just an idea.
Wilson’s music has been a vital part of my life for three decades. I was lucky to interview him, to meet him briefly, and to come to know members of his touring band. They followed his example of spreading love through music. Some will join former Beach Boys Al Jardine on the road this summer, playing some of Wilson’s more obscure works. Sadly, they don’t have any Kansas dates booked at the moment.
Brian Wilson has died. But not his music. And not his example of persisting and caring, no matter what. Love and mercy to you all.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As a pharmacist born and raised in Cleveland, I know firsthand what pharmacies mean to our communities across Ohio — from small towns to city neighborhoods. We’re more than places to pick up a prescription; we’re often the most accessible health care providers people have. 
That’s why I want to be clear when I say pharmacies aren’t asking for a handout — we’re asking to be paid enough to cover the basic cost of doing our jobs. 
Ohio House Bill 96 includes a pharmacy reimbursement provision that would require health plans and pharmacy benefit managers to reimburse all Ohio pharmacies at no less than the actual cost to dispense prescriptions. I believe this is a necessary step, and it’s long overdue.
Right now, pharmacies across Ohio are getting paid less than it costs to buy the medication and safely fill a prescription. We’re losing resources on the very thing we’re here to do—provide patients with access to medication. 
And as a result, pharmacies are closing. 
In 2024, 215 pharmacies closed in Ohio. Already this year, 35 more are gone. That’s not a coincidence. It’s a direct result of payments lower than a pharmacy’s costs and broken reimbursement practices.
Pharmacies are often the most accessible part of the health care system. We don’t require appointments. We’re open evenings and weekends. When a pharmacy closes in a small town or underserved neighborhood, patients lose essential access to care. 
There’s a common misconception that paying pharmacies more will lead to higher health care costs or increased insurance premiums. But the data simply doesn’t back that up. States that have implemented similar reimbursement models — like West Virginia — have not seen premiums rise as a result.
 In fact, Ohio’s own Medicaid program switched to a cost-based model and has saved the state over $140 million. 
At-cost reimbursement for pharmacies gives pharmacies a fighting chance. Without it, more pharmacies will close — and Ohioans will be left with fewer options, longer drives, and real barriers to getting the medications and support they rely on every day.

North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
As measles outbreaks grow, Trump cuts hinder vaccination efforts

It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
 ‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas

According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 6, there are 1,168 confirmed cases affecting 33 states. Texas reported two more cases June 10, and Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
Some measles response plans crash to a halt after Trump cuts

There have been 17 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)My guess is that most Nebraskans associate Los Angeles with the Hollywood sign, Disneyland, movie stars, mud slides, fads, freeways, Rodney King, Valley girls (and boys), the beach, earthquakes, horrific fires and a Southern California vibe that far too many disparage as being the home office of the “Left Coast.” Indeed, a recent sloganeering barb from the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce aimed at the entire Golden State (and others) bragged, “We don’t coast!”
But here’s the deal: You do. Sure, you can’t “coast” as in driving to the ocean to see the Pacific. But if my ten years of living in Los Angeles are any indication, life there and here is remarkably the same. That is not to say differences between the Southland and Nebraska aren’t considerable, be they political, topographical or climatic. 
Normal people
While it may be a shock to some that all except a tiny fraction of the nearly 20 million people in the Southland do what we do here in Nebraska: live, love, work, play, pray, hope, dream and raise our families, aiming for our kids and grandkids to have it better than we did in a world that’s better than ours was.
Still not convinced? I get it. But as the television cameras, talking heads and the chattering class go on about Los Angeles as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducts immigration raids with the National Guard and Marines on scene, remember this about the city of movie magic and make believe: The White House is telling us a lie … a wide screen, double feature, surround sound, technicolor, iMaximum whopper. 
The administration insists “insurrectionists” were laying siege to LA, something not a single credible news service on the ground reported. Nor, according to polling, was the public buying it. Perhaps that is because Americans now know an insurrection when they see one.

The hyperbole persists: To help justify the president’s unwarranted, exacerbating and constitutionally-suspect deployment of troops to assist the Los Angeles Police Department and LA County Sheriff’s Department keep the peace during anti-ICE protests, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstie Noem called LA a “city of criminals.” Based on what?
Others jumped in to criticize. At least one should have considered math. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckebee Sanders insisted in an online post that such discord would never occur in the Natural State because “we value order over chaos” only to be reminded by others that the homicide rate in her beloved Arkansas is twice that of California.
Noem’s calculus leaves one wondering, too. While railing against the protests and California political leaders, she said “… we had over 400 to 500 targets we were going after …” That’s 400-500 out of Greater Los Angeles’s 18.3 million.
Violence and lies
Yes, some violence and looting occurred. Anyone participating in such was committing a crime and should have been arrested. Full stop. Such acts diffuse the issue that sparked the protests, which dampens the message and the muscle of those peacefully taking to the streets, an American right since before we were a country. Indeed the first casualties in the American Revolution were in a crowd of protestors in Boston, shot when the Redcoats opened fire.
Amplifying the lie, some of the national media’s coverage was breathless. Others, thankfully, presented a bigger, more accurate picture, reporting that aside from protests in downtown LA and in the city of Paramount, 30 minutes south of LA City Hall, the whole of the city was going about its normal day-to-day business. 
LA is 500 square miles. The protests garnering attention and footage were in about five blocks of downtown. That perspective flies in the face of tall tales of an insurrection and a city on fire, hoping to convince the public with disinformation that bringing in federal troops was not what it appeared: a serious stretch, legally and morally.
We need immigration solutions. What has transpired to date appears to solve little and a capitulating, complicit Congress is of virtually no help. We were told that federal agents were going after violent criminals in the country illegally. We now seem to be someplace altogether different. 
Nebraskans share another thing in common with Angelenos. We both live where our neighbors, co-workers, classmates, families and friends come from a well of diversity, enriching our communities and a shared culture. Nor are we and our California cousins unique. Over 14% of America is foreign-born. That’s closing in on 50 million people. 
If immigrants and diversity make Los Angeles a “trash city,” what the president called the City of Angels last week, one might wonder if some believe that is true for the rest of our immigrant-rich nation.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Law enforcement officers on Sunday night arrested Vance Boelter, who is accused of assassinating Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park as part of a larger plot to kill Democratic elected officials and other advocates of abortion rights.
Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
The arrest comes after a 43-hour manhunt — the largest in state history, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.
At the time of his arrest, Boelter was armed, but ultimately surrendered. Officers did not use any force, said Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger of the Minnesota State Patrol.
In the state’s new Emergency Operations Center in Blaine — which was paid for by legislation passed by Hortman’s DFL-controlled House in 2020 — Gov. Tim Walz thanked law enforcement and decried political violence and hateful rhetoric.
“This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “Now is the time for us to recommit to the core values of this country, and each and every one of us can do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than argue, debate an issue, shake hands, find common ground.”
Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats of violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. He survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. An unsealed criminal complaint indicates that the Hoffmans’ daughter called the police to report the shooting of her parents, the Associated Press reports.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the attacker in a fake law enforcement uniform shoot Mark Hortman through the open front door, according to the complaint. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a cop car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds.
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle. From there, teams from dozens of law enforcement agencies fanned out in search of Boelter.
Boelter was spotted in the area, and officers converged around him, Evans said. He declined to provide some details of the tactics used by law enforcement to capture Boelter.
Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.
“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation…those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.
Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Strib.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Times reported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On Sunday night as leaders spoke to the press, Boelter was being questioned by law enforcement, but officials declined to say where he was detained and which agency was questioning him.
On the steps of the State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

Michael White and Matthew Lowe,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/16/hb-6855s-approach-to-kratom-does-not-serve-connecticut-residents/,"Not all kratom is equal, and as such lumping whole leaf kratom into this bill is both alarming and unwarranted.","Connecticut House Bill 6855, currently awaiting the signature of Gov. Ned Lamont, proposes sweeping changes to the state’s drug policy. Ostensibly a bill focused on regulating cannabis, hemp products, and pharmacy practices, HB 6855 also gives heightened authority to the Department of Consumer Protection to designate and schedule additional substances as controlled drugs.
Buried in the language of the bill is a troubling and unjustifiable provision: the inclusion of Mitragyna speciosa, commonly known as kratom, as a substance to be classified under Connecticut’s controlled substances framework. 

C. Michael White, Professor of pharmacy.
There is no distinction made between the natural leaf, which has centuries of safe use, and more modern concentrated extracts and semi-synthetic or synthetic derivatives that are calling themselves kratom, which should be the focus of this legislation.
The inclusion of regular leaf kratom is not only scientifically unsound, but it also threatens more than 250,000 Connecticut residents who rely on kratom for relief from occasional pain, mood enhancement and for some people, to help them substitute for, or wean off opioids. As a pharmacist, clinical pharmacologist and faculty member in the University of Connecticut’s Department of Pharmacy Practice, I have worked to educate students and vulnerable communities about opioid risks and provided naloxone kits to communities throughout Connecticut to control the opioid epidemic. I fear this one aspect of the bill could be counter to those efforts while the general aspects of the bill are sound.
Not all kratom is equal, and as such lumping whole leaf kratom into this bill is both alarming and unwarranted. Kratom, a plant in the coffee family, has been used safely for centuries in Southeast Asia. Kratom alkaloids primarily work through serotonin and alpha-1 and alpha-2 stimulation and only partially interact with opioid receptors. Animal studies suggest kratom alkaloids are not desired by morphine addicted rats, do not provide euphoric effects like regular opioids, lessen opioid withdrawal symptoms, and ultimately lower the use of opioids. 
Anecdotal experiences in illicit opioid users abound suggesting less opioid use and sharing of needles, and enhanced ability to work and care for themselves when kratom is used. In 2024 the Food and Drug Administration set out to establish a safe dosing range and found kratom was well tolerated at all tested levels, even at the highest dose of 12 grams. Until recently, kratom was supplied by law-abiding businesses as natural health remedies and the available evidence suggests it was not a public health threat.
Its pharmacological profile is vastly different from illicit opioids or synthetic compounds sold as dietary supplements (tianeptine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, mitragynine pseudoindoxyl) that only work through potently stimulating opioid receptors. The 7-hydroxymitragynine and mitragynine pseudoindoxyl products were being sold as kratom and much of the recent fervor against kratom is actually a backlash against these products. Animal studies and anecdotal human experiences strongly suggest that these products cause euphoria, are highly addictive, and reinforce the use of opioids. Bad actors have invaded the market with these synthesized, concentrated, and dangerous products. These synthetic drugs are commonly packaged to target minors by mimicking popular consumer products like ice cream cones, sugar encrusted gummies, taffy, popping crystals, and chocolate bars.
We applaud the Connecticut legislature’s proposed action against these potent opioid receptor stimulators and against other synthetic products such as intoxicating hemp (which chemically convert CBD into intoxicating THC), phenibut, xylazine, and nitrous oxide. While only tianeptine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, and mitragynine pseudoindoxyl potently stimulate opioid receptors like heroin, all these products are referred to as “gas station heroin” because they do not meet the definition of dietary supplements, are addictive/habit forming, pose a direct threat to public health, and are commonly sold in gas stations, smoke shops, and convenience stores.
Leaf kratom is not “gas station heroin” for the reasons mentioned above and should not be the focus of scheduling activities. Semi-synthetics and synthetics that amplify potency from what is found in nature are the problem – not what Mother Nature created. 
Legislation needs to draw that clear distinction to avoid ‘throwing the baby out with the bathwater’, which unfortunately is the case with this bill here in Connecticut. HB 6855 explicitly identifies kratom’s leaves, stems, and extracts as a substance subject to scheduling by the Department of Consumer Protection. There are no requirements for public hearings, scientific evaluation, or consultation with medical and pharmacological experts. The bill does not specify the schedule placement, but contextually groups natural leaf kratom with unapproved drugs.
This move would be devastating, not just for consumers, but for public health. Criminalizing kratom will not make vulnerable populations safer; it will drive kratom users to unregulated markets or back to dangerous counterfeit or illicit opioids. It will also criminalize responsible adults for using a botanical that they depend on for daily functioning and wellbeing.
Consider that the scheduling of natural kratom has been rejected at a Federal level twice in 2016 and 2018 respectively, and by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021. Banning was not thought to be the answer because of the overwhelming number of compelling anecdotes that kratom consumers shared and the known risks if those people returned to counterfeit or illicit opioids. This bill stands in direct opposition to scientific advancement and the accelerating momentum towards evidence-based regulation of kratom in the U.S.
Currently, more than 128 million people are covered by meaningful kratom consumer protection laws passed in 17 states. Connecticut should follow the trend and create more stringent regulations for kratom rather than ban it. As the chair of the Kratom Consumer Advisory Council, we have identified ways to reduce the risks of kratom use in communities while preserving access. These best practices make up the backbone of legislation that just passed in Nebraska and Colorado and can be a model for Connecticut.
To be clear, we are in agreement with the inclusion of 7-hydroxymitragynine, a semi-synthetic alkaloid, in this bill, but it needs to be clarified that it is banned if it makes up more than 2% of the total alkaloid fraction of kratom. This is because a tiny amount of mitragynine is converted into 7-hydroxymitragynine in the leaf drying process when kratom powder is formed. Banning any concentration of 7-hydroxymitragynine would still effectively be a kratom ban.
The scientific community generally agrees: leaf kratom is not without risks but the risks can be managed through sensible regulation, not prohibition. A scheduling action on all forms of kratom based on incomplete or biased understanding risks eroding public trust in our drug policy. Of concern to clinical pharmacologists like me, it sets a dangerous precedent for how we handle emerging natural substances.
Leaf kratom does not belong in HB 6855, a bill that was rushed through in the last three days of the legislative session without citizens being aware that it even included leaf kratom and denying their ability to tell legislators the implications passage would have on their wellbeing. Its inclusion is arbitrary, unsupported by contemporary science, and inconsistent with the bill’s stated goals of improving drug regulation and public safety in Connecticut.
We urge Gov. Lamont to, at a minimum, demand the removal of language targeting kratom. Public policy should be guided by science —not fear, misinformation, or political expediency. We are happy to work with regulators and legislators to come up with regulatory language that threads the needle between safety and access.

Tim Walz said during a press conference that the shooting “appears to be a politically motivated assassination.” (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Law enforcement officers on Sunday night arrested Vance Boelter, who is accused of assassinating Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park as part of a larger plot to kill Democratic elected officials and other advocates of abortion rights, according to a state official with knowledge of the arrest.
The arrest comes after a two-day manhunt. Law enforcement officers had been searching all day after locating Boelter’s abandoned vehicle near Green Isle, where Boelter has a home.
Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin, Minnesota. Both Hoffmans survived the shooting, but received surgeries for their injuries and remain hospitalized.
Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The attack, which has shocked Minnesotans and the nation, comes amid rising political violence since the emergence of President Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats of violence against his political enemies and praised his supporters who, for instance, attacked officers while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He later pardoned all of them. Trump himself survived two assassination attempts in 2024.
Authorities say Boelter attacked the Hoffmans at their home in Champlin at approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday morning.
At around 3:30 a.m., Brooklyn Park police headed to the Hortmans’ home to proactively check on them following the attack on the Hoffmans, said Drew Evans, superintendent at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at a press conference Saturday morning.
When they arrived, the officers saw the shooter in a fake law enforcement uniform exiting the front door of the house. Out front, emergency vehicle lights flashed from a Ford Explorer outfitted to look like a cop car. When the officers confronted the shooter, a gunfight ensued, and the killer escaped, abandoning the vehicle.
Inside, Hortman and her husband, Mark, were dead from gunshot wounds.
In the SUV, police found a document with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.

Evans said Sunday that the document is not a “traditional manifesto that’s a treatise on all kinds of ideology and writings.” Instead, it contains a list of names and “other thoughts” throughout.
On Saturday afternoon, police raided a home in north Minneapolis where Boelter lived part time. In an interview with the Star Tribune and other media outlets, Boelter’s roommate and childhood friend David Carlson shared a text message Boelter sent him at 6:03 a.m. saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly.”
Federal and state warrants were out for Boelter’s arrest, and the FBI was offering a $50,000 award for information that led to Boelter’s capture.
On Sunday morning, law enforcement officers detained and questioned Boelter’s wife as she was driving through Mille Lacs County with other family members. Evans said Sunday none of Boelter’s family members are in custody.
Sunday afternoon, law enforcement officers located a car linked to Boelter in Sibley County within a few miles of his home address in Green Isle.
Law enforcement officials continue to investigate Boelter’s motives, Evans said, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions.
“We often want easy answers for complex problems, and this is a complex situation…those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation,” he said.
Fragments of Boelter’s life available online, and interviews with those who know him, shed light on his religious and political beliefs.
Boelter’s LinkedIn page indicates that he spent many years working in food production before becoming the general manager of a 7-Eleven. More recently, he worked at funeral homes, the New York Times reported.
Boelter was facing financial stress after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Carlson, the Star Tribune reported.
The website for a private security firm lists Boelter as the “director of security patrols,” and his wife as the CEO. He purchased some cars and uniforms but “it was never a real company,” Carlson told the Strib.
Carlson said Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, the New York Times reported.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.
The reporting on Boelter’s religious life suggests that his beliefs were rooted in fundamentalism, though he doesn’t appear to have been ordained in any particular denomination, said Rev. Angela Denker, a Minnesota-based Lutheran minister, journalist and author of books on Christianity, right-wing politics and masculinity.
“What this kind of theology says is that if you commit violence in the name of whatever movement you’re a part of, then you’re going to be rewarded,” Denker said.
The gunman shot John Hoffman nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, according to a statement from Yvette.
The Hoffmans’ nephew, Mat Ollig, wrote on Facebook that Yvette used her body to shield her daughter. John Hoffman is “enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,” Yvette Hoffman said in a statement.
On the steps of the State Capitol Sunday, mourners created an extemporaneous memorial for Hortman, who will be known as one of the most consequential progressive leaders in recent state history.

Despite a gradual decline in overall traffic fatalities across the U.S., teenage drivers continue to face a disproportionately high risk of deadly crashes.
A new report from the ConsumerAffairs Research Team reveals that drivers aged 15 to 19 remain nearly four times more likely to be involved in fatal accidents than their older counterparts.
In 2022 alone, more than 2,500 fatalities involved teen drivers—an average of 11.57 deaths per 100,000 American teens.
Though national fatality rates among teens have remained relatively steady over the past decade, experts say that’s hardly a cause for comfort.

“While teen fatal crashes did rise from 2012 to 2022, this trend was not linear and was not limited to teen drivers,” the report cites Rebecca Weast, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). “Fatalities dropped from 2017 to 2019 before rising during COVID, and this trend is also visible across adult drivers.”
While teen crash deaths did rise between 2012 and 2022, the trend wasn’t linear and mirrored broader national patterns, as fatalities dropped between 2017 and 2019 before spiking during the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw fewer drivers on the road but more deadly crashes.
To pinpoint where young drivers are most at risk, ConsumerAffairs analyzed fatal crash data across all 50 states, focusing on contributing factors such as reckless driving, speeding, and driving under the influence.
Delaware Ranks Third Worst in the Nation
Delaware emerged as one of the states with the most dangerous driving conditions for teens, ranking third worst overall behind Montana and Wyoming, respectively.
The state recorded 14.29 teen-driver-involved fatalities per 100,000 teens in 2022—well above the national average.
Driving under the influence appears to be a particularly deadly issue for Delaware teens, with 6.35 fatalities per 100,000 involving impaired teen drivers—the second-worst rate in the country behind only Montana.
The state also ranked fourth worst for fatalities stemming from other dangerous driving behaviors, such as aggressive or inattentive driving.
Despite these grim statistics, Delaware did see one bright spot: it had zero fatalities involving teen speeding in 2022, the best record in the U.S.
The state also boasts strong distracted driving laws, including a total cellphone ban for teenage drivers and a hands-free requirement for all motorists.
Still, Delaware’s poor performance echoes a broader pattern. Many of the states with the worst records for teen driving fatalities also rank poorly in general road safety metrics, including high rates of drunk driving, fatal crashes, and road rage incidents.
As traffic deaths remain a persistent public health concern, experts stress the importance of preventive strategies—including comprehensive car insurance, public awareness campaigns, and above all, distraction-free, responsible driving.

During an interview last week with the Capital-Star on an unrelated subject, Rozzi revealed that he had been harassed by the man, who was not a constituent but lived nearby in the Reading area. He said the episode contributed to his decision to get out of politics.
“There comes a time when you know it’s time to leave,” Rozzi said, adding that the polarized politics of the last several years made leading as a moderate lawmaker difficult. “You constantly had to look over your shoulder.”

The reality of political violence in America loomed over a day of peaceful demonstrations Saturday in which millions protested the Trump administration and its aggressive deportation tactics.
Early Saturday morning, former Minnesota state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were assassinated by a gunman posing as a police officer who knocked on their door. Democratic Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the night at their home and are expected to survive. 
Pennsylvania has also been affected by politically motivated violence this year. An attacker firebombed the Governor’s Residence on April 13, after the first night of Passover. It forced Gov. Josh Shapiro, his wife and their children to evacuate in the middle of the night. 
Cody Balmer, the Harrisburg man charged with the attack, later told authorities he hated Shapiro and disagreed with the governor’s support for Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks.
Shapiro called on leaders across the country to speak with moral clarity after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Hortman’s death Saturday morning.
“This is unacceptable — we all have a responsibility to stand up and work to defeat the political violence that is tearing through our country,” he said. “America is better than this.”
Rozzi could not be reached over the weekend to comment on the Minnesota shootings.
The Exeter Township man who faced misdemeanor charges for harassing Rozzi and his then-girlfriend died before the case was set to go to trial last year, Berks County District Attorney John Adams confirmed. The accused stalker had a history of unusual behavior in which he expressed a willingness to “die in combat.”
Rozzi, who served as speaker in early 2023 when control of the House was uncertain, said the man was allegedly motivated by a belief that former President Joe “Biden and the Democrats were going to destroy America.”
Adams identified Rozzi’s stalker as Victor Greer, 56, who died in June 2024, when the case was “very close to going to trial.” The most serious charge against Greer was a third-degree misdemeanor, Adams said.  
“This individual was definitely harassing and stalking him and his then-girlfriend and I’m sure it was somewhat traumatic,” Adams said.

About a decade before he died, Greer was arrested in Manhattan on weapons charges.
Officers pulled over Greer for driving the wrong way on a one-way street around 1 a.m. July 2, 2014, and spotted ammunition and three knives inside the car, according to reports. 
In the center console of Greer’s vehicle, police found a note that said “I want to die in combat and want to go to heaven and meet god,” and also mentioned his cats, his parents and his favorite movies, authorities said.
The New York Police Department bomb squad searched the car’s trunk and found two unloaded semi-automatic rifles, a semiautomatic handgun, a 12-gauge shotgun, more than 400 rounds of ammunition, a bottle rocket and drug paraphernalia, Reading-area TV station WFMZ reported.
Rozzi was elected speaker in January 2023 after Democrats won a one-vote majority in the House in the previous November election. One incumbent Democrat had been reelected despite dying weeks before the election and two others resigned to take higher offices, leaving control of the House to be decided in special elections.
After Democrats were unable to muster votes to elect current Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia), Rozzi struck a deal with Republicans in which he agreed to become an independent to secure GOP support to elect him as speaker. He won the 115-85 vote with 16 Republicans joining Democrats’ unanimous support. 
Rozzi told the Capital-Star last week that he had always considered himself politically moderate and felt he was getting lost in the House where the parties seemed to be moving farther apart.
“I was a nonexistent type of person,” Rozzi said. 
Rozzi said he planned use his speakership to pass legislation to provide a two-year window for victims of childhood sexual abuse to sue their abusers and those who enabled them. Legislation to hold a referendum on amending the state constitution to provide the window had passed in the previous session with bipartisan support, but was derailed by an administrative error.
He faced opposition from Republicans, including a key ally who called for him to resign, when his promised switch from Democrat to independent never happened. 
Rozzi said he’s hopeful the state Senate will act on the survivors’ window amendment this session. The legislation passed the House earlier this month. 
A Commonwealth Court panel last week upheld the right of abuse victims to sue public agencies for enabling their abuse under a law Rozzi passed in 2019, which he described as gratifying knowing that it would help protect children. 
“I’m happy to look back but I’m also happy to not be there,” Rozzi said.
After leaving office, Rozzi said he started working on an autobiographical book about his abuse and his rise to speaker. He said his chances of getting back into politics are slim, although he said he would consider running for state Senate if the seat was in danger of being lost.
For now, Rozzi said he’s doing “a ton of writing,” enjoying “being able to breathe,” and is looking forward to getting out of town for a while.
“Twelve years is a long time,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DSC_0593-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-15 18:00:57.604503

Despite soggy skies, more than 150 young anglers turned out on Saturday, June 7, for the 39th Annual Delaware Youth Fishing Tournament, hosted by the Delaware Natural Resources Police.
The event, held at three locations across the state, crowned 9-year-old Kohen Marvel of Smyrna as the overall champion after he reeled in 9.53 pounds of fish at the Akridge Scout Reservation in Kent County.
Sponsored by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), the annual tournament aims to introduce children to fishing while promoting conservation and catch-and-release practices.

Participants, ages 4 to 15, competed in age groups at Lums Pond in New Castle County, Akridge Scout Reservation in Kent County, and Blockhouse Pond in Sussex County.
New Castle County
At Lums Pond, 7-year-old Caleb Polite landed both the overall county title and the largest fish of the day—a 3.3-pound largemouth bass. In stark contrast, Mikey Hopkins caught the tiniest fish, a bluegill weighing just 6 grams (0.211 ounces).
Other age group winners included:

Ages 4–7: Miles Hopkins (1.54 pounds)
Ages 8–11: Nathan Johnson (3.09 pounds)
Ages 12–15: Brooks Wilke (2.56 pounds)

Kent County
Marvel not only won the county competition in Kent but also took home the state championship trophy with the day’s heaviest total catch.
Other notable performances at Akridge included Beau Lindale, who won the 4–7 age group with a 7.85-pound catch, and Matthew DeCarlo, who led the 8–11 group with 6.30 pounds.
Lucas Seeley caught the largest fish in Kent County—a 2.3-pound largemouth bass—while the smallest, a 124-gram bass, was caught by Devyn Thompson.
Sussex County
In Sussex County, 8-year-old Webb Ciavarra topped the field at Blockhouse Pond with a 4.15-pound haul, including the county’s biggest fish, a 1.6-pound largemouth bass. The smallest catch was a 16-gram bluegill by Jissac Heath.
Other winners included:

Ages 4–7: Manny Ortiz (1.46 pounds)
Ages 8–11: Jissac Heath (1.44 pounds), second to Ciavarra
Ages 12–15: Austin Rowlands (1.72 pounds)

Delaware Technical Community College is making a major boost to its culinary arts department.
The school will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday afternoon to unveil its newly renovated and expanded culinary arts wing at the Stanton Campus, which now includes 8,800-square-feet of space with state-of-the-art kitchen equipment, industry-standard technology, and a new dining room.
The expansion allows the college to increase enrollment in culinary arts associate degree and baking/pastry diploma programs from 125 students to 225 students.
Delaware Tech’s Culinary Arts Program at the Stanton Campus had reached the point where our facilities could no longer adequately support its students and program requirements.
READ: First State Educate launches free training program for school board members
In 2020, Del Tech was told by the American Culinary Federation Education Foundation Accrediting Commission that if it did not address our kitchen via renovations and expansion, then future compliance with their accreditation standards would be at great risk.
“Based on research that we conducted as a follow-up to address the concern, we learned that the food service job sector was expected to total 51,200 jobs by 2028 in Delaware and that the industry would generate more than 2,900 new jobs in the state’s economy between 2021 and 2028,” said Dan Ehmann, vice president and campus director of Del Tech’s Stanton Campus. “When turnover or replacement needs were added to this total, then the food service industry was projected to generate 8,800 job opportunities annually in the state through the year 2028.”
The previous square footage of the kitchen was just 1,036 square feet, while the total space for the program was 3,180 square feet.
“Unfortunately, this limitation on space placed a cap on our culinary program enrollment to a maximum student capacity of 125 students,” Ehmann said. “This cap limited the college’s ability to continue to meet present and future workforce needs in the state.”
The project expands the school’s culinary footprint by 5,600 square feet and will enable it to increase student enrollment in the Culinary Arts associate degree and diploma program by 80%.
“Additionally, for the first time, the space will also allow the college to offer new short-term training needs of the hospitality industry through our Workforce Development and Community Education Division, who can offer a Food Preparation Technician Certificate Program,” Ehmann said.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/culinary-arts-banner.jpg,,,2025-06-15 18:00:57.604503

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)SPRINGFIELD, OHIO — Roughly 500 gathered at Springfield City Hall Saturday to protest the administration of President Donald Trump. But even though Trump last year highlighted the city’s 15,000 residents from Haiti, many have been been scared into the shadows, protestors said.
“I really believe that most people don’t want what’s happening right now,” said Jessica Shafer, a mental health therapist who works with vulnerable children in Springfield. “I come to things like this because I think it’s incumbent on people who can to come to these things and stand up and show people it’s OK to make your voice heard.” 
The rally in Springfield was one of more than 1,000 across the country that drew more than a million “No Kings” protestors against Trump on Saturday.
No Kings protests around the nation denounce Trump’s actions

Trump put Springfield’s Haitian community in the crosshairs last year when, during a presidential debate, he repeated the racist lie that the immigrants were stealing their neighbors’ pets and eating them. Then a senator from Ohio, now-Vice President J.D. Vance repeated the lie about his own constituents — even though his staff knew the allegations were untrue.
In the wake of the untruths, dozens of bomb threats were made to Springfield schools and other public buildings and its Haitian residents came in for even greater harassment.
“They’re terrified. Rightfully so,” Shafer said of her Haitian neighbors. “I can’t tell them anything. I wish I had answers, but I don’t. I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t have any way to relieve their anxieties.” 
Trump is now revoking temporary protected status for a half-million immigrants, including those from Haiti. That condemns thousands of Haitians in Springfield to return to a place where anarchy and gang violence reign, said Carl Ruby, a pastor who has many of the immigrants in his congregation.
“They go back and forth between somehow thinking it’s going to work out to being terrified,” he said. “What people need to understand about them is what they’ve already been through in Haiti. So this does not scare them as much as it scares us.”
He added, “But they are good people and they’re in danger. There are people at my church who are on lifesaving medications they can’t get in Haiti. They’ll die if they get deported. There is one person whose children are still in Haiti and the gangs beheaded a 12-year-old girl on the street that runs in front of their house. People don’t understand what they’re sending Haitians back to.”
Shafer said that the things that Trump and his allies in Congress want to do would be devastating to everybody in Clark County, of which Springfield is the seat — not just the Haitians. 
About 770,000 Ohioans stand to lose health coverage under Medicaid if the U.S. House budget — Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” — becomes law. Hundreds of thousands in the state are also likely to go hungry if cuts to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program in the legislation become reality.
“I know what’s going to happen if we cut Medicaid,” Shafer said. “Forty four percent of Clark County is on Medicaid. I work with youth. Seventy seven percent of Springfield’s school district rely on SNAP funds to provide free and reduced lunches. We have roughly 17,000 households that rely on SNAP benefits in our county. And they’re talking about cutting all of that.”
Sherry Schaaf, who lives in Clark County outside of Springfield, said she turned out because she thinks Trump is tearing at the foundations of democracy. For example, she said, Trump deployed the National Guard and the Marines to quell protests in Los Angeles even though the governor and the mayor didn’t want them.
“It’s treasonous,” Schaaf said. “It’s all for political theater.”
She said she felt a duty to stand publicly against such conduct.
“It is time for us to stand up against the administration and the illegal things that they are doing,” Schaaf said. “If we don’t stand up we’re going to end up like Germany did.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A 39-year-old man died Saturday night after being shot during Salt Lake City’s “No Kings” protest while a crowd of about 10,000 people marched near 151 S. State Street, the Salt Lake City Police Department confirmed Sunday. 
Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, a Utah resident, was shot at the demonstration. Despite life-saving efforts from SWAT medics and Salt Lake City Fire, Ah Loo died at an area hospital. 
As of Sunday morning there were still unreleased details about the incident as the investigation is ongoing, Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said in a news conference. 
A chaotic scene ensued after two armed men in high visibility vests, who Redd described as “possibly part of the event’s peacekeeping team” saw 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa separating from the crowd, moving behind a wall, pulling out a rifle and starting to manipulate it. 
“Gamboa was then confronted by these two men, witnesses say. Gamboa raised the weapon in a firing position and began running toward the crowd,” Redd said on Sunday. “One of the individuals fired three rounds, striking Gamboa, and tragically striking the man who later died.”
The preliminary police investigation found that the victim was not the intended target, “but rather an innocent bystander participating in the demonstration,” Redd said. Gamboa also sustained a minor gunshot wound in the confrontation.

As the scene unfolded, a bystander took a backpack from Gamboa that contained an AR-15 style rifle and a gas mask, Redd said.
Gamboa’s motivations for being at the protest are still unclear, and there is no indication that others were working with him, Redd said. 
Detectives booked Gamboa into the Salt Lake County Metro Jail for investigation of murder, police said in a release.
Gamboa has no criminal history, police said. Jail documents state he is being held without bail.
Police had not taken any action against the two peacekeeping members as of Sunday, Redd said. The man who fired the shots is cooperating with police.

The scene was chaotic and unfolded very quickly, Redd said, but many people assisted the officers.
“The crowd actually pointed him out to law enforcement, and their actions were heroic,” Redd said.
In a Facebook post Sunday morning, Utah 50501 — the group that organized Saturday’s protest — said it is currently working with police. 
“Our team was directly involved. We have been in direct contact with law enforcement,” the Facebook post read. “Some of you seem to think a keyboard and social media give you a free pass to be nasty and accusatory. Our teams just had to deal with something extremely traumatizing and when faced with personal risk to their own lives, chose to run towards the danger in order to serve this community.” 
The group said it’s working to set up a vigil for the victim.
“We respectfully ask to refrain from speculation about the alleged shooter’s motives and identity — that information will come out soon enough. It is better to wait for the facts, even though it is difficult given the emotional and charged nature of this incident,” the group said in a separate Facebook post Sunday morning. “This was a horrific moment of violence in a historic day full of thousands of Utahns exercising their right to protest. Nothing will ever change the undeniable strength of our community.”

Chuck Grassley announces the Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act. (Photo courtesy of Sen. Grassley's YouTube channel)In this week’s D.C. Dispatch, Sen. Chuck Grassley touted provisions in the “one, big, beautiful bill” that would increase funding for law enforcement and immigration agencies.
Meanwhile, a coalition of nonprofit organizations is seeking changes to the bill, and Iowa delegation members also addressed proposals this week dealing with fentanyl trafficking, violent crime, federal benefit fraud and more.
Immigration, law enforcement funding
Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released the text Thursday for the panel’s provisions in the Senate’s version of the budget reconciliation legislation. The provisions seek to increase funding for immigration agencies, reimburse states for immigration-related expenses, provide additional funding to law enforcement agencies, impose additional fees on immigration applications, and hire additional Department of Justice attorneys to challenge universal injunctions. 
The immigration agencies expected to receive additional funding under this bill are the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Justice. Funding is distributed with the intention of increasing the staffing in these agencies. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide Reimbursement Fund seeks to reimburse states for funds spent on “investigation, location, apprehension or temporary detention” of unauthorized immigrants. 
Under the new provisions, additional funding will also be allocated to expand resources to police and law enforcement officers. Funding will be allocated to the Bureau of Prisons for “capital improvements to detention structures” and increased staff. Additional funding will be allocated to law enforcement training centers, the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, Community Oriented Policing Services and the 287(g) program. The 287(g) program allows non-ICE law enforcement agencies to enforce certain aspects of U.S. immigration law.
Outside of increased funding, the provisions will require courts to publish metrics on the frequency of universal injunctions, establishing judicial training programs on the impact of universal injunctions and requiring that courts impose a bond upfront when litigants seek a preliminary injunction. A universal injunction is a federal court decision that blocks the government from enforcing a law or policy nationwide.
Iowa nonprofits ask Sens. Ernst and Grassley to reconsider provisions in joint letter
The Iowa Nonprofit Alliance and 96 other Iowa nonprofit organizations wrote a joint letter addressed to Grassley and Sen. Joni Ernst urging them to reconsider provisions outlined in budget reconciliation bill approved by the House. 
The specific provisions addressed in the letter were budget cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Pell Grant reductions, changes to charitable deductions and new tax burdens on nonprofits. The letter argues the budget cuts will “harm Iowa families” and simultaneously “increase pressure on community-based nonprofits” seeking to fill the space. Over 730,000 Iowans rely on Medicaid and SNAP with one-third of them reliant on both programs. 
They also argue the reduction to Pell grants come at a time when Iowa is “struggling to fill essential jobs,” and the cuts will make higher education less accessible, “weakening the economy in the long run.”
The letter said these organizations were “alarmed” by proposals to cap or lessen universal charitable deduction and impose new taxes on nonprofits and foundations. They argue these changes would “reduce donations, divert resources away from essential services, and undermine our ability to serve our communities,” at a time with increased demand for nonprofits and with demand expected to increase if the bill is passed.
“Nonprofits are not just service providers—we are employers, community hubs, and often the last line of support for people in crisis,” said Alex Rice, executive director of Iowa Nonprofit Alliance, in a press release. “We ask our senators to stand with Iowa’s communities and the organizations working every day to support them.”
Fentanyl enforcement bill passes through Congress
Bipartisan legislation to permanently classify “fentanyl-related” substances as Schedule I drugs headed to the president’s desk after passing the U.S. House Thursday on a vote of 321-104.
Grassley led the Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act, with Sens. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana and Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Hampshire, according to a news release. 
 Schedule I drugs are classified as “drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, rendering drugs in this category effectively illegal for anything outside of research, with few exceptions.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, synthetic opioids like fentanyl made up for 68% of overdose deaths in 2022.
“I’m proud to see Republicans take real action to combat the fentanyl crisis, advance life-saving research and support our brave men and women in blue,” Grassley said.
 Ernst bill targets foreign-led crimes
A bill sponsored by Ernst and Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, aimed at increasing penalties for crimes committed in the U.S. on behalf of a foreign government, passed the Senate Tuesday.
The Deterring External Threats and Ensuring Robust Responses to Egregious and Nefarious Criminal Endeavors Act heads to the House of Representatives. This bill seeks to “increase criminal penalties for individuals who commit or attempt to commit, violent crimes in the United States.”
Under the DETERRENCE Act, individuals convicted of an offense “at the direction of or in coordination with a foreign government,” could see their sentences increase by up to 10 years.
“Peace through strength is back and that includes right here at home. I look forward to the House swiftly passing this commonsense bill to create severe consequences for those who wish to harm our citizens,” Ernst said in a press release
 Nunn introduces bill to reimburse ‘victims of SNAP fraud’

As Republicans in Congress seek to reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Rep. Zach Nunn introduced legislation this week aimed at benefit fraud.
The SNAP Anti-Theft and Victim Compensation Act of 2025 would expand the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Office of Inspector General to investigate and prevent cases of SNAP benefits theft. Under this act. the inspector general would be authorized “to issue subpoenas, coordinate across law enforcement agencies, and access EBT processor data during investigations.” 
It also authorizes states to distribute compensation to families with stolen benefits and establishes a new civil penalty to act as a deterrent to fraud. Individuals found guilty of SNAP fraud would be penalized for “twice the value of the stolen benefits.”
Nunn proposes bills dealing with law enforcement, student housing
Nunn also introduced several bipartisan bills last week.
The Retired Law Enforcement Officers Continuing Service Act, introduced Tuesday, aims to establish a new federal grant program to allow law enforcement agencies to hire retired officers “to serve in civilian roles like forensics, financial crimes, and IT analysis,” and train civilian personnel. This bill is co-led by California Democratic Reps. Josh Harder and Eric Swalwell, and Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Pennsylvania.
The Preventing Lethal Agricultural and National Threats Act, introduced Thursday, would create a new criminal offense for “importing high-risk agricultural biological agents with increased penalties for individuals linked to foreign governments.” This bill is co-led by Rep. Josh Riley, a Democrat from New York.
The Campus Housing Affordability for Foster Youth Act, introduced Thursday, aims to allow the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to waive restrictions on using Section 8 assistance for on-campus housing for students with foster care or emancipation backgrounds. 
Section 8 assistance is a voucher program provided by HUD to help individuals afford safe, private housing. Current federal policy blocks the use of Section 8 for college students seeking on-campus housing. 
This bill is co-led by Greg Landsman, a Democrat from Ohio; Mike Lawler, a Republican from New York; Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, and Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska.
 Hinson introduces RNs for Rural Health Act

Reps. Ashley Hinson and Hilary Scholten, a Democrat from Michigan, introduced the bipartisan RNs for Rural Health Act, which seeks to update Medicare policy. The revision would allow registered nurses to perform Medicare annual wellness visits at rural health clinics. 
Currently, the clinics are reimbursed for visits, only when annual wellness visits are performed by approved RHC practitioners, RNs are not included.
“This is a commonsense solution that expands healthcare access, reduces costs, and enhances care in rural districts like mine—a win for our communities, medical professionals, and their patients,” Hinson said in a press release.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Despite triple-digit heat, thousands gathered in downtown Las Vegas for the nationwide “No Kings” rally against the Trump administration and presidential overreach on Saturday.
The demonstration coincided with the president’s birthday, which in turn happened to coincide with his $45 million military parade in Washington, D.C. The event, which observed the U.S. Arm’s 250th birthday as well as Trump’s 79th, represented the largest display of military might in the nation’s capital in decades.
Like millions in towns large and small across the country, an estimated 8,000 demonstrators gathered near the federal courthouse on Clark Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. 
People of all ages, from babies to seniors using wheelchairs and walkers, marched along the street, waving flags, raising – often comical – signs, and chanting. Several protesters also passed out water and electrolyte drinks to combat the heavy 104 degree heat.
Indivisible, the grassroots group that organized the “No Kings” protest, said the demonstrations were in opposition to the erosion of democracy and “Trump’s illegal power grabs.” 
The Las Vegas protest builds on a week of mounting anger and disgust over immigration raids in Los Angeles and Trump’s decision to escalate the tensions by federalizing and deploying California’s National Guard without the consent of California state leaders.
Adriana Cisneros, a daughter of immigrants from Mexico, said it was one of the largest protests she’d ever seen Downtown. The 48-year old mother of three brought her daughter and niece to protest nationwide immigration raids at work sites by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“They’re tearing families apart, and kids disappear when they tear them away from their families. That’s what we’re fighting for, for our kids, peace and love and unity, instead of this hate that [Trump] brings to our country, we don’t need that here,” Cisneros said, holding an amalgamation of both the U.S. and Mexico flag. 
Cisneros said her grandparents first arrived in the U.S. through the Bracero program, which issued temporary work permits to millions of Mexicans to ease labor shortages during World War II, highlighting the contribution of Mexican workers throughout U.S. history. 
“I work with people that are here legally and have work permits and all of a sudden, they’re being revoked. No. It’s unjust,” she said.
The demonstration was largely peaceful, however, law enforcement made 15 arrests Saturday in connection to the event. A demonstration in Downtown Las Vegas Wednesday ended with 94 arrests. Police accused protesters of throwing rocks and water bottles at officers, blocking several streets and vandalizing property.
Heavy police presence dotted Saturday’s event. Police helicopters buzzed overhead and snipers surveyed from surrounding rooftops.


Eric Masiers, a 58 year-old U.S. Army veteran and member of the IATSE Local 720 union, said he spotted the snipers immediately. 
“I understand the police presence, but it’s a very peaceful protest out here,” Masiers said. 
Masiers said he was there to celebrate the Army’s 250th anniversary and oppose what he sees as growing presidential overreach by Trump. Masiers said he was extremely troubled by Trump’s liberal use of executive orders to bypass Congress. 
“Trump is trying to make this a dictatorship. As a veteran, I just won’t allow it. I won’t have it. I will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Masiers said. 
As a veteran, Masiers said he was appalled by the use of taxpayer money to fund the $45 million military parade taking place in the Capital, as well as the federalization of the California National Guard. 
Trump also ordered 700 U.S. Marines deployed to Los Angeles.
“What Trump is doing to the troops, they’re making them illegally break their oath. You’re not supposed to stand against our own citizens,” Masiers said.

Katherine Kennedy, a 56-year old retiree and Masiers’ fiancee, said the rising protests against presidential overreach was “history in the making.”
“Growing up, I never would have dreamed that we could have a dictator in the White House,” Kennedy said, holding on to her seeing-eye dog, Bentley. “What are we leaving to our kids, our grandkids?”
“It’s sad what this country has become. It really is. Hopefully when [Trump] gets out of office, the damage isn’t so far set in our division as a country that we’ll be able to heal after we get him the hell out of office. That’s my hope for this country,” she continued.
Both Masiers and Kennedy said they feared for the economy, adding that they don’t believe Trump has fulfilled promises to bring down the price of groceries, gas, and other necessities.
Trump has acknowledged that his deportation agenda is hurting farm and hotel industries, and vowing to stop harsh immigration raids on those industries. Trump owns a number of hotels in the U.S., including one in Las Vegas.
Jesse S., who asked that only his initials be used in place of his last name, said the damage is already done and that job site raids have already hit Las Vegas. The 28-year old said he was attending the protest to stand for immigrants who are too afraid to speak out.
Jesse said the majority of immigrants in Las Vegas work jobs that can be difficult to fill, like construction and hospitality, in order to provide for their families.
“I work construction and they already raided two job sites,” Jesse said. “It’s messed up that they’re going into jobs, construction sites, restaurants, even food markets and just attacking us.”
Jesse, whose grandparents immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico, said he strongly supports immigration reform for “families that are here looking for a better life,” like his family did decades ago. 
“We shouldn’t be waiting 20 years to get our green cards,” Jesse said. 
A small handful of pro-Trump counter-protestors stood on a street corner waving flags as the “No Kings” protestors marched by, but there did not appear to be any conflict between the two groups.
Nationwide, there were more than 2,000 “No Kings” protests across several states including neighboring Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico and Wyoming.

The protest crowds mixed with those gathered earlier in the day for Spokane Pride and the Two Spirit Powwow. The demonstration was mostly peaceful, but later in the evening, a smaller group squared off with local police.
“If the kids are united, we’ll never be divided,” the crowd chanted at one point.  
Cynthia Hamilton, an organizer of the protest, said Democrats in Washington state are doing the right thing by fighting Trump administration policies in the courts and peacefully protesting.

But Hamilton also noted that many of the protesters in Spokane on Saturday were older and said she’d like to see younger people getting more involved.
“You have to get into the game, you have to register to vote, you have to take a little break off your screen time,” she said. “Maybe learn about civics, and this does really affect your life. It’s not like ignoring it will make it go away. Because it ain’t going away.”
She floated some national candidates she sees as promising. “Give me more Pete Buttigieg, give me some [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], give me more Bernie [Sanders],” said Hamilton. 
Among the other protesters was Raven Tucker, 76, a Vietnam veteran who served in the U.S Air Force at Fairchild Air Force Base, near Spokane, from 1968 to 1986. He was one of many gathered on Spokane Falls Boulevard.

Tucker recalled how, during his training in the 1980s, a KGB agent who’d defected gave a lecture about Russia’s foreign interference operations. 
“I think Donald Trump is an operative for the KGB and Putin, and that’s my honest feeling right now,” said Tucker, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He said his concerns about Trump deepened following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling on presidential immunity. 
“They just gave him freedom to [do] whatever he wants, they just want to step over the Constitution,” said Tucker. ​
“If we don’t go out and fight now and then, we’re gonna have to live under a new king,” said Tucker. “I learned that in the military, the difference between fear and courage is just doing it.” 
Hamilton raised concerns that the U.S. is losing the trust of other countries since Trump took office in January.
“We have to earn that back, and trust is so hard to earn,” she said.  
The official “No Kings” demonstration lasted until around 5:30 p.m., but protests carried on afterward.

An estimated 10,000 people were marching at the time.
Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd told media shortly after 10 p.m., about two hours after the incident, that gunshots had been fired as protesters were walking near 151 S. State St. Police responded immediately, finding one person with life-threatening injuries.
It wasn’t clear whether the first responding officers had heard or seen the shooting, or what alerted them to the incident, Redd said.
Officers received immediate witness information from people in the crowd and pursued the suspected shooter to 200 East and 100 South. It was discovered he too had a gunshot wound, Redd said, and he was treated and taken to a hospital under police observation.
Two more people who Redd said were involved in the incident were also arrested. No details about their possible involvement were provided. Redd said police are not looking for any additional people, and there is no ongoing threat to the public.
Investigators are working to determine what led up to the shooting, including whether any of the people involved were participating in the march.
“It appears they were involved at some level in the protest, or at least as part of the group that was walking,” Redd said.
 Demonstrators scatter as gunshots ring out at Salt Lake City ‘No Kings’ protest

A Utah News Dispatch reporter who was on scene saw panicked protesters scatter just before 8 p.m., many of them running and shouting that there were gunshots. Minutes later, a Salt Lake City police officer ran past, saying officers were looking for a male dressed in black with a gun, and asking “where is he?”
About a half a block east of the Wallace F. Bennett Federal Building, near 125 S. State Street, a photojournalist working with the Dispatch saw a crowd of people running after gunshots broke out. Near the north corner of the Federal Building plaza, people were seen taking shelter behind concrete walls and cars.

Further south down State Street, the photojournalist saw a crowd of first responders, including police and volunteers wearing vests, crouching around a man lying on the ground. What appeared to be his hat, lying next to him, was covered in blood.
Near 102 South and 200 East, the photojournalist saw a man on the ground in handcuffs, surrounded by police. Officers then walked the man away before setting him on a curb, where first responders appeared to render him aid for about 15 minutes.
First responders then put the man on a gurney, still handcuffed, before loading him into an ambulance and driving him away.

After the shooting, protesters were emotional. Some cried and hugged each other. An activist was also heard yelling in a loudspeaker: “Don’t let them tell you this was a riot. We only want to be heard. We were nonviolent.”
 Salt Lake City mayor condemns shooting during protest

The demonstration was the last and largest of 11 planned protests across the state Saturday in conjunction with nationwide demonstrations against President Donald Trump, including another Salt Lake City protest that drew thousands more to the University of Utah that morning.
The demonstration that began at Pioneer Park, 350 S. 300 West, had been boisterous but peaceful up until the shooting, with protesters marching up 400 South to State Street and circling around the block at the Wallace F. Bennett Federal Building to double back. Before they set out, speakers at the park had urged nonviolence, their message met with cheers.

Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, who joined Redd to brief reporters, condemned the shooting while thanking Salt Lake City police for their “swift and professional response to this tragic event.”
“The violence that we’ve seen here today in Salt Lake City and even in other parts of this nation is horrific. And it is not who we are,” she said. “Let me be clear. This act of violence does not define our city.”
Utah’s capital of Salt Lake City is a Democratic stronghold in an otherwise deep red state.
Mendenhall, a Democrat, said the purpose of Saturday’s demonstrations was a “powerful and peaceful expression until this event. And that cannot be overshadowed or silenced by a single act meant to harm.”
“I want to urge everyone in the public to be calm, to give one another grace, and to look out for one another tonight and in the coming days,” she said.
Mendenhall again thanked Salt Lake City police and other first responders including Salt Lake City firefighters for their “heroic actions,” calling them “among the best in this city, and I am so proud of you.” She also thanked protesters who came downtown to “stand peacefully together.”
“Your city sees you,” she told protesters. “Thank you for using your voice. Thank you for your peaceful cooperation with our police department tonight. And please know that your calm response and your support of their efforts likely prevented a more dangerous potential situation. You represent the Salt Lake City that I am proud to call home.”
The mayor added that “we will not walk in fear of one another. Not in this city, and not in this nation.”
“America, we are better than this violence,” she said. “We are stronger than this hate. This moment does not define us.”

 Utah governor responds to violence

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, issued a statement at about 9 p.m. saying the shooting was “a deeply troubling act of violence and has no place in our public square.”
“This is an active situation, and we’re working closely with law enforcement to ensure accountability,” Cox said.
About 20 minutes later, Cox in a post on X, said he had just spoken with Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall about the shooting.
“My heart is broken for everyone impacted tonight,” he said. “Thank you to the thousands of protestors who exercised their constitutional rights in the right way tonight. I’m grateful to security, SLCPD, DPS, and medical personnel who jumped into action to protect lives.”
Another one of the state’s top Republicans, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, also issued a statement expressing gratitude for Salt Lake City Police’s “prompt actions in maintaining order, safeguarding our communities and bringing a dangerous situation under control in Salt Lake City. Their dedication helped protect lives and restore order.”
“The freedom to organize and participate in peaceful protests is a cornerstone of our great country,” Adams said. “However, violence, destruction and vandalism are unacceptable.”

Since 2020, 36 states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery department.

(John Moore/Getty Images)Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.


 
Births are expensive
The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.
“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
 
Ripple effects
Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
 
State action
Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

By connecting the dots across the health care system, VITL is making it easier for providers to help patients stay up-to-date on immunizations — a win for individuals and for public health across the state. It’s one more reason Vermont continues to rank among the healthiest states in the country.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tracking immunizations so y[...]","Immunizations have long been one of Vermont’s most powerful public health tools, helping protect both individuals and communities from serious illness. But keeping track of your vaccine status can feel surprisingly complicated.
Who hasn’t had that moment in urgent care, staring blankly when asked, “When was your last tetanus shot?” And if you’re managing not just your own vaccines, but also those of your kids or aging parents, the challenges only multiply.
Health care providers have long relied on a powerful tool for accessing the most complete immunization histories possible for their patients: the Vermont Department of Health’s Vermont Immunization Registry, a secure, centralized system containing Vermonters’ immunization records. Now, that data is even more efficiently accessible to busy primary care providers and practice staff through a partnership between VITL (Vermont’s nonprofit health data sharing network), the Vermont Department of Health, and practices and hospitals around the state.    
VITL offers a new service to primary care practices and other health care provider offices, directly connecting their electronic health records to the Vermont Immunization Registry, so they can query for data in an instant, without opening another program. 
In the past year, VITL delivered immunization data into providers’ electronic health records over half a million times. For patients, it happens behind the scenes, delivering their essential records to their health care providers when and where they need them.
Here are three things to know about how VITL is helping you stay on top of essential immunizations.
1) What is health information sharing?
At the heart of this effort is health information sharing — but what does that actually mean?
In short, it’s the secure electronic sharing of your medical information, like vaccine history, among your providers. VITL connects many Vermont practices and hospitals to each other and centralizes data to create one health record for each Vermonter. That record includes information like your name and date of birth, along with allergies, medications, lab results, and immunizations. 
Having one record from the many places you receive care enables your providers to access a more complete, up-to-date picture of your medical history and current treatments. The data is available to health care providers and staff, insurance providers for certain initiatives such as care coordination, and public health professionals like the staff at the Vermont Department of Health who lead initiatives to keep Vermonters healthy and well. 
2) Faster access to immunization records means better care
A real-world example of this system in action comes from Primary Care Health Partners (PCHP), one of Vermont’s largest independent medical groups.
In the past, PCHP staff often had to manually check state records or call pharmacies to get vaccine histories — a time-consuming process for already busy primary care staff. But now (thanks to the Immunization Registry Query & Response Service, as it is known to the medical community), things have gotten easier.
Now, with just a few clicks, PCHP providers and staff can instantly pull immunization records from the Vermont Immunization Registry right in their own electronic health record, freeing up valuable time for patient care. PCHP estimates their nurses save more than an hour and 20 minutes every day, thanks to the VITL service. This system also ensures that clinicians have the most current immunization data, which is critical for supporting each individual’s health and for protecting vulnerable populations and improving public health outcomes.
3) Updated immunization records help patients stay on schedule
One of the biggest advantages of this system is its ability to help keep immunization schedules on track.
The VITL service enables primary care clinicians and staff to pull immunization records from other providers’ offices — and from clinics and pharmacies — right into their patient’s record for a more comprehensive immunization history. Even better, the system can flag upcoming or overdue immunizations, helping patients and families stay ahead of their health needs even if they can’t track everything themselves.
“Immunizations are crucial for preventing the spread of infectious diseases,” says Amanda Jones, Informatics Director at the Vermont Department of Health. “The Vermont Immunization Registry gives health care providers easy access to individual vaccination records and forecasts future patient immunization needs — this technology is keeping people in Vermont up-to-date on vaccines and really protecting our communities.”
By connecting the dots across the health care system, VITL is making it easier for providers and patients alike to manage immunizations — a win not just for individuals, but also for public health across the state. It’s one more reason Vermont continues to rank among the healthiest states in the country.
If you want to learn more about how VITL shares your health data with health care providers, there is information on vitl.net/sharing. Every Vermonter has options, and you can explore them on the VITL website. The VITL team is also available to talk with you and answer questions about health information sharing Monday–Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., excluding holidays. VITL’s toll-free number is 1-888-980-1243.

Hundreds of flatbed loads of honey bees are trucked into Washington every spring, enabling the production of apples, cherries, pears and berries in the state.
The pollinators are estimated to add at least $18 billion in value to crops throughout the U.S., yet the past year has been catastrophic.
“We are in the middle of a colony collapse disorder like we haven’t seen since the early 1990s,” said local beekeeper Dawn Beck, who has a master beekeeper certificate from the University of Montana and one from Cornell University.
About 1.7 million honey bee colonies — nearly 60% of all such hives in the country — were lost between June 2024 and March 2025, according to survey data from the nonprofit “Project Apis m.” (Apis mellifera is the scientific name for honey bee.) With about 50,000 bees per colony in peak season, that is close to 80 billion bees.
Imagine opening the lid of a bee box and finding it full of dead bees this spring, Beck said. Imagine doing that more than 1.5 million times.
“Absolutely devastating,” she added.
Researchers estimate the deaths, likely caused by viruses, have resulted in more than $600 million in lost pollination income and honey production, as well as the costs to replace the colonies.
Commercial operators were hit hardest ahead of the start of their annual migration through the fields of the country. One of these seasonal journeys made international news on May 30, when a commercial operator temporarily lost its load of millions of bees that were leaving a Whatcom County blueberry field, destined for South Dakota.
Roughly 62% of commercial colonies collapsed. Usually, commercial beekeepers’ experience, resources and management practices increase the survival rate of their colonies. However, other types of beekeepers had better survival rates, losing a little more than half of their colonies.

“We were surprised by the sheer number of colonies that commercial beekeepers lost,” said Priyadarshini Basu, a bee researcher and assistant professor of Pollinator Health and Apiculture with Washington State University’s bee program.
Without immediate intervention, the newest wave of colony collapse could drive up the costs for farmers, disrupt food production and shutter many commercial beekeeping operations, experts warned in April.
What caused losses?
As reports of large-scale honey bee losses started rolling into the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bee Labs in January, researchers scrambled to assess the scale and severity of the losses, as well as identify the potential cause.
The effort pulled in members of Project Apis m., the American Beekeeping Federation and the American Honey Producers Association.
A preprint scientific paper out of Bee Labs points toward disease-carrying, parasitic mites’ resistance to a widely used miticide — a chemical used to kill mites. The finding underscores “the urgent need for new control strategies for this parasite,” the researchers wrote.

A screening of samples for known pathogens and parasites identified three viruses, including acute bee paralysis, in “unusually high levels.” The viruses are tightly connected to Varroa mites.
These microscopic mites feed not only on the fatty body tissue of the honey bees but also on their brood, where baby bees develop.
Because the mites also spread viral diseases, “it’s like a double whammy,” Basu said.
“While viruses are a likely end-stage cause of colony death, other stressors such as nutritional stress and agrochemicals may have also played significant roles,” the researchers wrote.
Basu, who is among the scientists tackling the issue, agreed, saying the issue causing the collapse was most likely a combination of stressors.
Nutrition is fundamental to the health of a colony, Basu explained, pointing out that quality food supports a stronger immune system for combating stressors.
“We need to have better solutions in tackling poor nutrition,” she said.
Millions of bees need to be trucked into Washington because there isn’t enough nectar and pollen — known as forage — to sustain them within the state.
“The lack of forage is the reason behind all this trucking beehives across the country,” said Tim Hyatt, a second-generation beekeeper in central Washington and the legislative chair for the Washington State Beekeeper Association.
Hyatt said his family moved their operation to the Dakotas in the 1970s to avoid the harsh pesticides used at the time. Forage is also more abundant in the region.
After his bees pollinate fruit trees in eastern Washington, Hyatt goes straight into honey production, avoiding berry pollination contracts in Whatcom and Skagit counties.
Pollinating blueberries doesn’t fit into Hyatt’s schedule, but the crop also has a reputation for being tough on bees, he explained. In addition to the pollen not being very nutritious, working the crop can also lead to a bacterial disease that affects honey bee larvae known as European foulbrood disease.
While some reports show honey bee health declines following blueberry pollination, the topic is still an area of scientific exploration, explained Lisa Wasko DeVetter, an associate professor in small fruit horticulture at WSU.
“There’s a lot of great researchers trying to answer that question,” DeVetter said.
Necessary to feed America
An estimated one in every three mouthfuls of food in the U.S. benefits from honey bee pollination, according to USDA. These bees — not native to North America — were brought from Europe in the 1500s and 1600s, along with many of the crops they evolved with.

While Washington state has more than 600 species of bees, only honey bees are relied on to pollinate crops.
The bees work in other states, too. Nearly every commercial bee operator’s season starts in almond orchards in California at the end of January. The first “mega pollination” event of the country brings more than a million colonies into the state to service roughly 1.63 million acres of almond trees.
In general, commercial operators generate revenue in three ways: queen bee breeding, honey production and pollination services. Hyatt said his company’s revenue is — on average — split evenly between revenue from pollinating services and revenue from honey production.
Commercial bees working the West Coast move north from the almonds, first being put to work in fruit tree orchards, and then berries and other crops.
Of the top 10 agricultural commodities in Washington, apples, cherries and pears are 100% dependent on honey bee pollination. Whatcom County’s famous raspberry and blueberry fields also depend on these bees.
Whatcom County has an estimated 15,000 acres of berry crops, which produce more than 99% of Washington’s raspberries.
Without pollinating services, farmers might get half a ton of raspberries per acre instead of 6 or 7 tons, estimated Red Raspberry Commission Executive Director Henry Bierlink.
“When you invest as much as you do in that area, you need good production,” Bierlink said.
Not only do the bees significantly enhance fruit production, but quality pollination also produces bigger fruit, up to a point, DeVetter explained.
DeVetter observed strong colonies arriving in Whatcom and Skagit berry fields to pollinate crops this year, despite the colony collapse.
“I had no concerns about the quality or strength of these hives as they were going into raspberry,” DeVetter said, pointing out that the colonies had grown strong after working the almond and tree fruit crops before getting to berries.
But the potential impact of the colony loss at a national level is profound, confirmed Basu.
“Losing colonies is not only impacting the economics of beekeeping but also the agricultural industry because we are reliant on honey bees for commercial pollination and honey production,” Basu said.
“Beekeepers need solutions,” she added.

Former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed Saturday morning by a gunman impersonating a police officer. Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were also shot in their home in a separate incident but are expected to survive.
As of Sunday morning, a manhunt is still underway for a 57-year-old suspect, who police say left behind a manifesto and a target list that included dozens of Minnesota Democrats as well as abortion providers and pro-choice activists.
“There is no place in America for political violence of any kind,” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said in a statement. “The news of the assassination of one Minnesota lawmaker and her husband and the shooting of another lawmaker and his wife is both horrific and terrible for the entire country. Marty, the girls, and I ask that all Georgians join us in keeping their families, friends, and colleagues in our thoughts and prayers, as well as the law enforcement hunting down the madman responsible for this tragedy.”

In separate but similarly worded statements, Georgia state Senate Democrats and Republicans also condemned political violence.
“Political violence has no place in our democracy,” reads a statement from the Senate Democratic Caucus. “Gun violence has no place in our country. As we enter this weekend, we stand firm in our conviction that political violence has no place in American democracy. And we condemn any person who urges the use of force or violence to solve any political dispute.”
The Senate GOP statement contained the same sentiment but made no mention of guns.
“There is no place in America for political violence,” their statement reads. “In a constitutional republic, we settle our differences through debate, elections and the rule of law, not violence. Those who resort to the use of violence and force to advance political agendas are enemies of freedom and must be held accountable.”
Georgia’s House leaders were also unified in their condemnation of the attack.
“There is absolutely no room for this kind of violence and hatred in our nation, and we must all remain united in our commitment to condemn and root out these acts of evil whenever and wherever they occur,” said House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican.

House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley, a Columbus Democrat, also called for prayers for the families.
“Our hearts break for the families of Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, and for Senator John Hoffman and his wife, who were horrifically shot last night in a targeted attack,” Hugley said. “It is an unspeakable tragedy when those who have dedicated their lives to public service are targeted because of their positions. We must reject extremism, violence, and the politics of hate at every turn. I pray for the victims, their loved ones, and hope that law enforcement is able to swiftly bring this terrorist to justice.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The Trump administration recently terminated more than $5 million promised to South Dakota for expanded access to digital technology. That increases the administration’s total federal funding cuts impacting South Dakota state government to $23.7 million, according to the Bureau of Finance and Management.
The $5 million was awarded to the state in January under the State Digital Equity Capacity Grant Program. Digital equity initiatives increase physical access to high-speed internet by building infrastructure, teaching digital skills and ensuring access to digital devices.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration terminated the funding, part of $1.44 billion in funding nationwide, on May 9. 


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


The state Department of Labor and Regulation was in the “early stages of implementing” its program, so “there will be no impact on the public,” according to an emailed statement. Proposed activities, according to a department presentation on digital access, included creating digital equity coalitions, improving access to workforce services, providing digital literacy training to inmates, and expanding public-use and loaner digital device offerings, among other ideas.
Digital access improves access to education, employment and health care, said state Labor and Regulation Secretary Marcia Hultman in an emailed statement.
“South Dakota is a large, rural state. We have numerous avenues to continue improving digital access, even without these grants, and will continue moving forward to do so,” Hultman said.
Hultman added that her department is looking into offering a digital literacy foundational course. The department also offers Grow with Google certificates, to help people prepare for in-demand digital jobs, at no cost to the state.
The department lost an additional $658,000 recently, awarded in April 2023 under the federal Unemployment Insurance Integrity Grants program.
The state already spent one-quarter of the grant, which totaled $869,000, on a multi-factor authentication employer sign-in for the unemployment insurance portal. The department planned to use remaining funds to implement identification verification.

The way this package is being discussed, however, might make you think Nebraskans won’t suffer any harm from its passage. This could not be further from the truth.
The bill increases the debt to fund tax cuts for the extremely wealthy and finances the single biggest increase in history in funding for sweeping and extreme enforcement of long-outdated immigration laws.
We saw the devastating impact of harsh enforcement just last week in Omaha — with raids in Nebraska that destabilize our communities, damage our economy and, more importantly, spread unnecessary and toxic fear.
Local impact
The House bill would provide funds to expand these types of actions, which result in separating families and harming our longtime neighbors who have been part of the fabric of local communities throughout Nebraska for years, but are stuck in immigration limbo because Congress hasn’t meaningfully updated our immigration laws in nearly 40 years. This, in turn, creates destabilizing ripple effects on whole communities.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the House tax plan would give the wealthiest 1% of Nebraskans an annual tax cut of over $100,000 while the lowest-income Nebraskans would only receive $170, while that same vulnerable population also feels the hardest impacts of Congress’ food and health care cuts.
The legislation also actually adds $2.4 trillion to the deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office. So much for fiscal responsibility.
The bill includes unprecedented cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, which nearly 1 in 4 Nebraskans rely on to get health care. The budget office estimates the bill would cut Medicaid spending alone by $723 billion, the biggest cut to Medicaid in its 60-year history. These are not savings. These are cuts to coverage for people, families, and children.
Some of the reasons for this loss in coverage include harsh new work requirements, as well as new barriers and red tape, resulting in an estimated 45,000 Nebraskans losing Medicaid.
Real costs
The bill also would require Nebraska to pay for a portion of the cost of SNAP for the first time, which means new costs ranging from $16 million to $82 million in the state budget. Nebraska would be forced to find a way to pay the cost, cut food supports dramatically or opt out of SNAP entirely.

At least 29,000 Nebraskans are at risk of losing at least some of their food assistance, including children and families who would have to follow strict and unnecessary work requirements.
These are examples of how the bill passes the buck to Nebraska to make the hard decisions. But make no mistake: The legislation passed by the House would lead to losses in health care access and food assistance. Congress is simply shifting the responsibility to state lawmakers to decide who gets thrown from the lifeboat.
In short, we are being told a story that the legislation passed by the House harms no one, when the truth is that the bill turns our values upside down: tax breaks for those who don’t need them, separating families and cutting from health care and food supports. Our Nebraska leaders in Congress should make better choices for their constituents.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Gary Waugh clutched the 13-folded flag in its frame as he stood among more than 1,000 people gathered on a hot, smoggy Saturday afternoon at Patterson Park in Baltimore for a political rally.
Waugh, 71, said the flag represented his father, William, a World War II vet who he said would have been “disgusted” by the Trump administration. Waugh brought the folded flag so his father could be a part of the more than 2,000 “No Kings” rallies nationwide to protest the Trump administration.
“I figured he would have wanted to come down and see what we were doing today,” Waugh said.
The sizable crowd in Patterson Park was just one of more than 40 in Maryland Saturday that were held in city halls, park and highway overpasses, among the thousands of anti-Trump demonstrations across the United States opposing the president and his policies.
The peaceful protests were deliberately scheduled to counter President Donald Trump’s (R) military parade in Washington, D.C. to mark the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army’s founding. Saturday also happened to be Trump’s 79th birthday.
The conflicting events led to signs, chants and speakers at the No Kings rallies that challenged who the “real” patriots were, arguing that it was those who were participating in peaceful protests Saturday against the administration.

Several protesters, including Waugh, saw the military parade not as an honor to American troops or a recognition of Flag Day, but as an ego-boost for the president.
“It’s an abomination,” Waugh said of the military parade. “It’s horrible, it’s not what our country is about. It’s all about him. It’s fueling his ego at my expense, and it’s just obscene as far as I’m concerned.”
Indivisible, a national organization dedicated to opposing Trump and his policies, said that the protests are in response to Trump’s “authoritarian overreach,” which includes rising numbers of warrantless immigration raids, cuts to federal funding and jobs, reductions to health care spending and more.
Veronica Koch, 28, attended the Baltimore rally dressed in a costume loosely inspired by John Adams — an outfit she had previously prepared back in October for a Founding Fathers-themed party.
Her costume may have been light-hearted, but her message, that she “absolutely loved America,” was serious.
“I love our people, and I want America to be a place that is welcoming, which is something that we literally wrote our Declaration [of Independence] about,” she said.
“I support our military. I do not support the hatred that we have become,” she said. “I don’t love what our flag has come to represent … I feel like we’re kind of trying to reclaim it.”
No Kings protests around the nation denounce Trump’s actions

Signs, chants and speeches given in Baltimore targeted several Trump administrations policies. Top of mind for several protesters was the increasing activity of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Maryland and elsewhere.
Jontadria Davison, 27, said that some of her Latin and Hispanic coworkers at the restaurant where she works have become more fearful under the Trump administration.
“They’re all scared. My coworker was scared to take her daughter to school the other day, because she’s worried that ICE is going to come get her,” she said. “It’s a dark time for everybody, so they’re not playing.”
People attending a rally in Rockville earlier that day shared similar concerns.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who spoke at both the Baltimore and Rockville protests, referenced the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrigo Garcia to El Salvador as an example of Trump’s “lawless” approach to governing.
“If Donald Trump can trample all over his [Abrego Garcia’s] constitutional rights, he can trample over all of your constitutional rights,” Van Hollen said.
“The people are being tested by a man who is an autocrat. A man who does not believe in democracy. A man who does not believe in the Constitution,” Van Hollen said. “So, it’s great to see the people – ‘We the People’ – are gathered to make sure we protect our country and our Constitution.”

Linda Graziani, a Montgomery County public school teacher, felt that the millions in taxpayer dollars necessary to put on the military parade would be better spent elsewhere, including in education and health care. She was one of thousands who lined the sidewalk of Rockville Pike Saturday morning.
“He’s … taking money away from Medicaid, taking away money from the people who need it and giving it to the people who don’t need it with tax cuts,” Graziani said of Trump. Reports say that the parade is estimated to cost about $45 million.
Sylvia Greenberg, 56, drove from Gaithersburg to attend the Rockville rally with her daughter, Evlin. She said the Trump administration’s “centralization of power, ignoring our checks and balances,” is “just not American.”
“Which one is more American? People standing up for what they feel is right or a show of tanks and guns with somebody who’s centralizing power for himself?” she asked. “I think we’re the more patriotic.”

BIRMINGHAM — When Jilisa Milton received the grant termination letter, she wasn’t surprised. She suspected this day would come.
The language the Greater Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution (GASP) had used in its application to the Environmental Protection Agency had been clear. “We’re talking about helping a community,” Milton, GASP’s executive director, said last week, “where Black people have been disproportionately impacted.”
Black residents had breathed heavily polluted air from a nearby coke plant for decades, and their neighborhoods had been declared a federal hazardous waste Superfund site after it was determined that waste soil laced with arsenic, lead and benzo(a)pyrene, a human carcinogen, from several nearby coke plants had been spread around their homes as yard fill.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In light of this history and continued industrial pollution, GASP had obtained a $75,000 air monitoring grant from the Biden EPA in 2023.
Milton received the letter earlier this month from officials in President Donald Trump’s EPA terminating the grant because it no longer aligned with the agency’s priorities.
“I knew at some point they would notice the language of our grant,” Milton said, in that it made reference to services intended to help Black people.
Still, she said she doesn’t regret the way GASP characterized the situation on the ground in north Birmingham—that the need for air monitoring stemmed from the city’s history of corporate exploitation of majority-Black workers and residents.
Growing up in Birmingham, Milton said her grandparents often discussed the legacy of workers in the Magic City—so-nicknamed because of the seemingly supernatural economic boom spurred by steel production following the end of the Civil War.
“The majority of these workers were Black, and we can see the disparate impact that still has today,” Milton said. “And it’s really important for Birmingham to talk about our legacy and our history.”
Sanitizing that history, then, to comply with the Trump administration’s stated opposition to all things DEI and environmental justice—as if they were the same thing, just because they both often involve Black people—doesn’t sit well with her.
“I think the narrative work is gone then,” Milton said. “And we have to think about history so we don’t live it again.”
The grant, awarded through EPA’s small grants program, was set to fund GASP’s efforts to train residents in using air monitoring equipment to help establish a community air monitoring program, allowing those in north Birmingham access to critical information about the pollutants filling their lungs every day.
In addition to what is now the 35th Avenue Superfund site, encompassing the neighborhoods of Collegeville, Harriman Park and Fairmont, north Birmingham remains home to several polluters, leaving its residents in the 90th percentile for particulate matter, according to EJ Screen, a government tool also recently shuttered by the Trump administration.
That context of present and past pollution was what made securing funds for air monitoring so important, Milton said, giving residents an opportunity to learn more about the continued impact of industry on their health.
“For decades, residents of North Birmingham and other historically marginalized communities have been forced to live in the shadow of toxic industries with little support or transparency,” Milton wrote in a statement after receiving the termination letter. “The grant made it possible for us to monitor and document the pollution people live with everyday. Revoking this support sends a message that the health of Black, Brown, and low-income communities in Alabama is disposable.”
In its letter, EPA officials said the agency no longer supported the grant’s objectives.
“The purpose of this communication is to notify you that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is hereby terminating Assistance Agreement No. EQ-02D22522 awarded to GASP,” the letter said. “This EPA Assistance Agreement is terminated in its entirety effective immediately on the grounds that the award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

GASP’s isn’t the only environmental justice effort in Alabama nixed by federal officials. In April, Trump announced the termination of what the administration termed an “illegal DEI” settlement aimed at addressing sewage issues in the state’s black belt that have left its majority-Black residents sometimes unable to flush their own toilets.
The agreement, reached under the Biden Administration, required the state’s Department of Public Health to improve sanitation efforts in the region. It’s still unclear what that termination will ultimately mean on the ground.
In the end, Milton said the impact of the administration’s decision to terminate the north Birmingham air monitoring grant is racist.
“Look at the way they talk about environmental justice,” she said of administration officials. “They say it’s illegal to address these issues. So you hear the things they say, and it’s reasonable to discern from that that the impact is racist, and that what they’re doing is intentional.”
People of all races are forced to face the consequences of polluted air and water, Milton emphasized, but ignoring the reality that people of color have borne and continue to bear the brunt of industrial exploitation isn’t helpful. In fact, she explained, doing so could undermine the relationship organizations like hers have built with residents of color living through the impacts of pollution every single day.
“I don’t want to sacrifice the trust we have in communities that want to be heard because they notice that we start to change the way we talk about these issues,” she said. “Because they are the most important stakeholders. They’re who we’re here to serve.”
Moving forward, GASP plans to appeal the termination with EPA officials, Milton said, though she suspects the agency is unlikely to change its mind. If that’s the case, the nonprofit will do what they’ve always done—look to individual donors to fill in the gaps. It’s work that can’t be abandoned, Milton said. Not if she can help it.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bluestone-Coke-Facility-for-June-15-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-15 08:59:03.009701

June 14, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz VelizSeveral thousand people of all ages and backgrounds packed one of the oldest parks in Southwest Detroit on Saturday, June 14, in the early afternoon, participating in the protest called “No Kings Day” convened by local social movements and organizations as part of a nationwide movement.
The nationwide protests, mainly against Trump’s presidency, took place on the same day as the military parade in Washington D.C. to celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday, but also Trump’s 79th birthday. Ranging between $25 million to $45 million in cost, the military parade gathered nearly 7,000 soldiers and 150 vehicles, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, as well as military flyovers from 50 aircraft. 
The Detroit gathering was one of dozens held across Michigan and more than 1,500 nationally, gathering from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands in major cities. Other Michigan cities hosting protests included Flint, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Ferndale, and even as far away as Ironwood in the western Upper Peninsula.
Pro-immigration and anti-Trump administration slogans in English and Spanish were heard all across Clark Park as more demonstrators continued coming to the rally, filling the surroundings as far as the eye could see.
Just minutes after the scheduled start of the rally, a scuffle broke out between motorcyclists and some demonstrators, shortly after a group of bikers, members of the Detroit Highwaymen, arrived, claiming they were there to ensure order in support of the nation. Brief moments of shoving and shouting followed the altercation before volunteers, part of the organization, stepped in to calm the situation.

Police arrived moments later to help disperse the crowd. No arrests were reported.
As thousands of attendees raised their voices, a wide range of concerns and causes rose with them. While many of the chants expressed strong opposition to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and federal policies impacting undocumented immigrants, calling for Detroit to become a sanctuary city, demonstrators also raised their voices in support of the LGBTQ+ community and protest of what they say is a genocide in Gaza.
Several speakers, including local activist leaders and Democratic Michigan politicians, gave their words in English and Spanish to the attendees.
Among the speakers, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) shared passionate comments to the public, expressing her support for the Detroit community in resisting the current federal administration and its latest policies impacting Detroit’s community and across the state.  
“When I look at all of you, you don’t have to have a ZIP code in Detroit to understand that fascism hurts all of us. Many of you have your stance in why you’re here,” Tlaib told the crowd “Maybe immigrant rights. Maybe Free Free Palestine. Maybe LGBTQ. Maybe it’s fighting to make sure workers are protected. Maybe saying you will not dismantle education in our country. Whatever issue, the more we are connected, the more dangerous we become to this administration.”

Tlaib also emphasized support for immigrant families affected by federal border agents, mentioning Maykol Bogoya-Duarte, an 18-year-old Colombian high school student who was arrested by ICE and has lost his appeal to stay in the country; consequently, he will be deported soon.
“You showing up like this to show that we’re going to resist; them kidnapping Maykol; them kidnapping our family members; them ignoring Supreme Court decisions; them going around Congress to go to war; all of these fascist, unconstitutional, unlawful decisions only can be fought when we resist in the streets,” Tlaib said.
As the rally continued, some counter-protesters approached carrying flags and signs, sparking minor confrontations involving shoving and insults while they walked through the crowd. Volunteer protesters helped to disperse and avoid confrontations.
Among them, holding the American flag, was Andre Williams, 24, who expressed support for current ICE activities, claiming that undocumented immigrants should be deported to prioritize the American labor force. He also made remarks against the LGBTQ+ community.
“I’m an American who is tired of seeing people supporting illegal immigration. Illegal immigration is a big problem in this country.” Said Williams. “You’ve got big corporations that use illegal immigrants as economic pawns. They will sit back and abuse these people and advocate for them to be here. We want American workers to be employed.”

Williams was repeatedly surrounded by volunteers and escorted out of the rally. They held hands around him and gently pushed toward the edges of the crowd, sparking tense moments filled with shouting and insults from demonstrators.
A community also built by immigrants
A few days earlier, on Wednesday morning, pro-immigrant activist groups reported that five or six individuals, four of them believed to be Venezuelan, were detained following the dismissal of their immigration cases in court. That same day, demonstrators gathered outside the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building in the morning and later in the afternoon at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office.
An ICE spokesman told the Detroit Free Press that ICE officers can make civil immigration arrests near courthouses if they have credible information and as long as local laws don’t prohibit it.
The activists stated that these practices against immigrants are intensifying in Detroit.
A few blocks away from where these activists rallied, Ofelia Torres, 29, a Detroit resident, arrived at the “No Kings Day” protest carrying a Mexican-American flag. She mentioned that her grandparents helped build the city after immigrating directly to Michigan in the 1970s.
“In the 1970s, my grandparents were immigrant workers from Mexico who helped build the Renaissance Center, which is the largest landmark in this city, this border town that people often forget. So that’s the reason why my parents, my siblings, and I were born and raised here,” Torres said.
“Every time I see downtown, I know this city was built by my grandparents and so many others,” Torres emphasized.

A few steps from her, holding a Mexican flag and a sign that read “Orgullo Latino”, which means “Latino Pride” in English, followed by “Every damn day,” Leonardo Enriquez, 23, a Detroit resident, shared that he is the son of Mexican immigrants who came from Guadalajara more than fifteen years ago and have been working ever since.
“It’s sad to see that he’s afraid to go out and be outside because of everything that’s happening, and he’s just doing what he can to support his family. I’m here because my mom and dad couldn’t make it today,I wanted to represent them,” Enriquez said.

Around 4 pm, after the speeches ended, attendees began to march from Clark Park to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office. The American flag and flags from different countries, such as Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Argentina, were waved along with signs through Mexicantown streets and Michigan Avenue by protesters as they chanted and marched.
Marching at the front of the crowd, Silvana Palma, an Argentine immigrant, held and waved the light blue and white flag with the sun at its center. She shared that she arrived 15 years ago and has lived in Detroit ever since.
“I just hope things work out for us, and that we’re given the same right to live here as anyone else,” Palma said.

The protesters approached the outside of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office where they held a rally, listening to speeches and chanting slogans against ICE. Without any other incidents involving counter-protesters or the police, a few minutes before 6, the protesters walked back to Clark Park where they ended the march.

More than two years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus, Martha White refused to give up her seat on a city bus in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Soon, another Black woman joined her. 
The bus driver threatened to arrest them, but when the Rev. T.J. Jemison, pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church, arrived, he informed the driver of a recently passed city ordinance that meant White hadn’t violated the law. As a result, white bus drivers began a strike. When that ended days later, Jemison and others began a boycott. 
Jemison had long been upset about the fact that although Black riders made up 80% of passengers, they had to stand in bus aisles while seats remained empty: “I thought that was just out of order; that was just cruel.” 
Thousands attended the nightly meetings, and their numbers continued to grow. Money collected at meetings went to pay for gas for providing rides. The boycott ended with the compromise that other than the two side front seats for white riders and a long rear seat for Black riders, the remaining seats would be occupied on a first-come, first-served basis. After that success, a young Martin Luther King Jr. came and visited Jemison. 
Two years later, the Montgomery Bus Boycott was born.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06104053/June15-update-Baton_Rouge_Bus_Boycott.jpg,,,2025-06-15 08:59:03.009701

Vermonters asked for tax relief, not a complete transformation of the education system. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont fathers: This Father’s Day, let’s commit to saving rural Vermont.","This commentary is by 17 Vermont fathers and members of the Rural School Community Alliance. Their names are listed below the text.
As Vermont dads of children attending Vermont schools and members of the Rural School Community Alliance, we’re used to showing up for our kids: on the sidelines, at bedtime, in the school pickup line and around the dinner table. Today, we’re showing up in a different way: to urge lawmakers to stand up for our kids and our communities as they consider final changes to the education transformation bill.
We love Vermont for many of the same reasons we choose to raise our kids here: the tight-knit communities, the open spaces, the chance to know your neighbors and the powerful bond between rural schools and the towns they serve. But right now, that way of life is at risk.

The Rural School Community Alliance represents school districts, supervisory unions and municipal leaders in more than 100 Vermont towns and villages along with numerous supporters from non-member towns throughout Vermont. Rural community schools are not just places of learning; they are cornerstones of civic life, economic resilience and family stability. As the future of public education in our state hangs in the balance, we ask the Legislature to keep five key priorities in mind:
Transparency around the funding formula
Before any new funding system is enacted, Vermonters deserve a clear, honest accounting of how it will affect our communities, property taxes and school budgets. We can’t make decisions in the dark and our lawmakers shouldn’t either.
Protecting democratic engagement
No school should be closed without a vote of the people. Period. Community input is essential to maintaining trust and ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of kids, families and taxpayers. A full educational and community impact study should be required before any closure is even considered.
Guidelines not mandates
Don’t tie the hands of education professionals. Apply guidelines, not mandates for class, school and district size. Especially in rural Vermont, flexibility is needed to maintain optimal learning environments.
Respect for what works in rural governance
Supervisory unions strike a critical balance in Vermont, allowing for collaboration and efficiency without sacrificing local voice and oversight. Any governance changes must build on what works for rural schools, not impose a one-size-fits-all model that erodes accountability, weakens community bonds and likely only costs more money.
Real community voice in redistricting
The redistricting task force must listen to the people. Community-developed proposals should be seriously reviewed and, where possible, integrated into final decisions. The best solutions will come from the ground up, not the top down.
Vermonters asked for tax relief, not a complete transformation of the education system. After years of pandemic recovery, workforce shortages and skyrocketing health care costs, this is not the time for sweeping, untested reforms that put rural kids and families at risk. Proposals to further consolidate our schools, without strong Vermont-based evidence of cost savings or academic gains, are deeply concerning.
Forced consolidation will hollow out our towns, reduce civic participation and make it even harder for young families to stay in, or move to, rural Vermont. For us, this isn’t just policy. This is personal. Because when the local school closes, the town often fades with it.
This Father’s Day, we’re not asking for cards or neckties. We’re asking for leadership that values rural communities and keeps Vermont’s children at the center of every decision.
We urge legislators to do right by our kids and stand with rural families. Let’s build a future where every Vermont child, no matter their ZIP code, has access to a strong, vibrant community school.

At camp, you can learn to change the world.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sultana Khan: When it is hard to know what to believe in, believe in the power of connection. And summer camp..","This commentary is by Sultana Khan of Randolph, executive director of YWCA Vermont and Camp Hochelaga.


Right now, so many of Vermont’s small, wonderful communities are struggling to combat divisiveness, financial hardship, the impacts of climate change and so much more. During times of uncertainty, it often seems easier to turn inward than to reach out. But when it is hard to know what to believe in, believe in the power of connection. And summer camp. 
Summer camp is the antidote to so many of the systemic causes that erode young people’s self-esteem and sense of adventure. 
In my new role as the executive director of YWCA Vermont and Camp Hochelaga, an inclusive girls+ camp on the shores of Lake Champlain, I am once again immersed in the joy and wonder that is camp.
Summer camps have rich, historic traditions of creating spaces where young people can experience the awe of a world where they are not constrained by the rules society creates to keep them in their place. Where they can build deep, lasting relationships with other youth who have also been seeking a place where they can be their weirdest, most authentic selves. Where they can see models of kindness, acceptance and generosity. 
Camp can be a place where you are able to more clearly see your part in our natural world. As humans have created technologies that make our lives more comfortable (and with climate change, more liveable), we have distanced ourselves from the impact of those technologies. By controlling the climates within our homes, we have made the outdoors a place to be tolerated rather than understanding that the outdoors is our home. 
Camp Hochelaga is a rustic camp — our campers and counselors sleep in cabins that don’t have electricity. With the windows open, you can hear the scurrying and chittering of the creatures that share our spectacular environment on the shores of Lake Champlain. You can observe deer, foxes, snakes, eagles, fish, chipmunks and so many other inhabitants who share our earth. Sometimes, significantly less pleasantly, you can also smell skunks.
Understanding humanity’s power and responsibility to care for the world we think of as solely our own is essential to supporting the next generation in fighting against the destruction of our planet through relentless consumption. 
More importantly, camp is a place of connection. At a time when Americans feel increasingly isolated and lonely, camp offers a place for girls to bond over experiences and values that social media seeks to undermine through conformity and a sustained focus on materialism. Camp offers an alternative proposal to finding happiness in owning things that impress others. Camp offers a way of living that prioritizes community over consumption.
At camp, you can wear your beloved ratty shirt without teasing. You can produce weird plays that make everyone laugh (or cry!), or sing off-key to songs that have been sung for more than 100 years. 
You can cry about the world and find a loving shoulder of someone who has been exactly where you are, trying to find brightness amid the challenges of life. You can jump off a dock for the first time, holding the hand of a friend who has done it before, encouraged by the cheers of your cabinmates. 
At camp, you can learn what it means to be yourself while being a part of a greater whole. At camp, you can live a full, joyful life, supported by adults who know how valuable it is to be told you can do anything with a little hard work and a supportive community. 
At camp, you can learn to change the world.

The Girl and the Sky
Fiona Bock, 15, Glover
A little girl looked up to the sky – 
“So big and far away, it’s like that, why? 
I don’t know why you are 
The way that you are,  
But you have far, shining stars 
And I’m but a trying cry.” 

The sky bent down to the ground where she sat
And murmured softly, “You’re but a lass,
So young with such promise,
I’ve seen it go by.
But you’re here right now,
So look at the flowers, 
Don’t cry.”

“Isn’t the world changing so fast?
Haven’t the days we’ve known
Almost wholly gone past?
Where are the bluejays, the startling colors?
Where is the wonder, not thunder, the sunburns of summer?”

“Aye,” cried the sky, now that you say,
“I’m choking on smoke,
I’m beat up and broke,
I’m torn and I’m worn 
And I’m shorn of my hope!”

“But you still are blue, e’en behind the clouds
Your colors are true, your face is so proud!
Your tears give me life. 
I’m sorry your strife
Is cause of my parents and grandparents and human amount!”

“It’s not one, but it’s all,”
Said the sky with a sigh,
“It’s not just one person’s fault,
But the shared blame is the shame
Which prevents us from acting!
You’re worse if you’re silent 
For you’ll find hurt by your neighbor’s violence!”

In the rain that poured down,
The girl wept with the sky, 
The drains drank up the water 
And tears fell from her eye. 

“What now, my sky, where can I go
When the entire earth is 
Sunk to death row?
How can I make fire to feed a starving world
When fire is stolen and used to make gold
That the true people won’t see,
That will kill the honeybees,
And without honey, without sugar,
Without life or love, 
Without wonder we plunder.
I’m so sad, sky, I’ve fallen under!”

“But these are happy tears,
I have not fear 
But hope! 
I will profess my hope
For you!”

So she danced in the rain from the sky,

This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra and Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th. Meet Shefali and Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Almost three years after the fall of Roe v. Wade made way for near-total abortion bans, state lawmakers are weighing whether to offer more specific guidance about when doctors can perform abortions in a medical crisis.
Texas, Kentucky and Tennessee all passed laws this year ostensibly clarifying the scope of their abortion bans, a reaction to climbing sepsis rates and harrowing stories of patients who have suffered or died preventable deaths. Since June 2022, lawmakers in at least nine states have introduced such bills.
But doctors, attorneys and policy experts say that the laws being enacted will not solve the problems health providers have been forced to navigate since the end of Roe: The risk of being punished has deterred physicians, hospitals and health systems from providing consistent care, even when it is needed.
“The problem with these clarifying laws is they don’t expand access under the law, they don’t change the definitions, and they don’t remove the legislative interference in the practice of medicine,” said Molly Meegan, chief legal officer and general counsel to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
In Texas, a bill that awaits Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature ostensibly clarifies when the state’s near-total abortion ban allows for the procedure, saying explicitly that physicians do not need to wait until a patient is in imminent danger of dying to perform an abortion. The bill also requires training for doctors and lawyers on the state’s abortion law.
But lawmakers have made clear that the bill, crafted in consultation with Texas-based health professionals and abortion opponents, does not introduce new exceptions; Texas’ ban does not allow for abortions in cases of rape, incest or fatal fetal anomaly. And if enacted, it would codify a Texas Supreme Court decision that found that the state’s ban still applied even in cases with complications that could threaten a pregnant person’s health.. Such was  the case for Dallas woman Kate Cox, who experienced amniotic fluid leaking and cramping — which create the risk of bacterial infection — after discovering a likely-fatal fetal anomaly in her pregnancy.
Some former abortion patients whose lives were endangered because of delayed or denied care, including several who challenged the Texas abortion ban, said they fear Senate Bill 31 may not address situations like theirs.
Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after being denied an abortion when experiencing a life-threatening condition called preterm premature rupture of membrane, said at a legislative hearing on the bill that it likely doesn’t provide the clarity she would have needed.
“It is unclear whether SB 31 would have prevented my trauma and preserved my fertility had it existed in 2022, and I find that problematic,” Zurawski said. She only received care after she developed sepsis.
Clarification bills can have mixed support in legislatures. Local physicians might back tweaks to exemption language if they see it as potentially lifesaving for their patients. Some anti-abortion advocates might also favor changes if the legislation can address certain medical emergencies that they believe fall outside of a state’s ban, such as ectopic pregnancies or preterm premature rupture of membranes.
But not all anti-abortion advocates or Republican lawmakers within these statehouses support even a small clarification.
“I think in all these cases, lawmakers are being pulled in different directions by these different constituencies,” said Mary Ziegler, an abortion law historian at the University of California, Davis. “The bills themselves are kind of muddy, because they’re trying to be different things to different people.”
The end result are clarification laws that remain unclear to physicians and their employing hospitals and health systems, who can still face high penalties for violating an abortion ban.
“When the law isn’t clear, physicians don’t intervene,” Ziegler said. “You’re not going to be willing to gamble your liberty and your medical license on an uncertain interpretation of the law.”
In Kentucky, doctors vocally opposed a Republican-backed bill that supporters said would help health professionals understand when they can provide abortions. Like in Texas, the state’s ban only allows abortion when it is necessary to save a pregnant person’s life. The clarification bill listed specific conditions that would qualify for an exception to the ban — such as sepsis, hemorrhage or ectopic pregnancy — despite concern from doctors that a delineated list wouldn’t be able to predict every possible situation where an abortion might save someone’s life.
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed the bill in March, calling gaps in the law “literally a matter of life and death.” The state’s legislature, where the GOP holds a supermajority, voted days later to override him.
“It’s hard to create this laundry list of, ‘This is OK, this is not OK,’ because unfortunately, medicine is something with a bunch of gray areas,” said Dr. Caitlin Thomas, an OB-GYN in Louisville.
In Georgia — where pregnant, brain-dead woman Adriana Smith remains on life-support until she can give birth later this summer, and where the death of Amber Thurman was attributed to the confusion created by the state’s abortion ban — some lawmakers have asked physicians whether a clarification might allow doctors to provide abortions when the pregnancy threatens a patient’s life, possibly by listing specific conditions that qualify for an exception.
“We encouraged them not to, and said that would not be helpful,” said Dr. Neesha Verma, an Atlanta-based OB-GYN. “The more and more prescriptive you make these laws, the less space there is for clinical judgment.”
Following a case filed by seven Tennessee patients who had been denied abortions under the state’s ban, lawmakers in that state passed a law this year meant to clarify that, under the state’s ban, abortions could be performed in cases of preterm prelabor rupture of membrane or severe preeclampsia, but that the exception did not include mental health emergencies. Mental health conditions including substance use disorder, depression and confirmed or probably suicide are the largest single cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the state, according to a 2022 report.
The interest in clarifying bans — including from some lawmakers who oppose abortion — “is a response to where we know the public is and the fact that we know the public is generally supportive of abortion access and also has been presented with these terrible preventable cases since Dobbs,” said Kimya Forouzan, who tracks state policy for the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit abortion research organization.
That ambiguity was on display in a Texas case last year. A state judge held that the state’s abortion law exception permitted Cox to have an abortion when her doctors discovered the anomaly in her pregnancy. But the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, swiftly intervened, threatening legal action against any health care provider that performed an abortion on Cox. Cox ultimately left the state to terminate her pregnancy.
Michele Goodwin, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine and author of “Policing the Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood,” said state officials can do more to ensure health providers know their legal rights.
“It would be credible for states’ attorneys generals and the prosecutors who are conservative to immediately issue statements of clarity, saying that they are opposed to these kinds of conditions, that they will not prosecute,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AMR0780-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-15 08:00:03.789795

Some, like Jackson and Greenville, opt to instead celebrate Juneteenth.","Mississippians who are uncomfortable with the state recognizing Confederate Memorial Day as a holiday have options.
The state’s about 300 municipalities and 82 counties do not have to recognize the holiday. They can replace it with another holiday, such as the June 19 nationally observed Juneteenth, which commemorates the freedom of African Americans, or with a Mardi Gras holiday or with various other holidays.
The Mississippi legal code recognizes 10 holidays ranging from the traditional ones like Christmas, Thanksgiving and Veterans Day. The state honors Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert E. Lee on the same day in January. And baffling to many, the state has a Confederate Memorial Day holiday in April.
Efforts have been ongoing for years by many to replace Confederate Memorial Day, which by the definition of what the confederates were trying to accomplish commemorates slavery.
State leaders have rebuffed efforts to replace the holiday. Incumbent Gov. Tate Reeves and governors before him have taken the additional step of proclaiming April as Confederate Heritage Month.
But the state code surprisingly provides a reprieve for those wanting to be more inclusive or to at least not recognize Confederate Memorial Day. The law allows counties and municipalities to replace one of the state holidays, with the exception of Veterans Day and Martin Luther King Jr./Robert E. Lee Day, with one of their own.
Many cities do that. For instance, the city of Hattiesburg recognizes Good Friday instead of Confederate Memorial Day. The city of Greenville replaces Confederate Memorial Day with Juneteenth. Back in 2022, the Jackson City Council replaced Confederate Memorial Day with Juneteenth.
There are multiple issues surrounding a holiday. First of all, it is a day that most of the public offices recognizing the holiday are closed and many public employees are off.
The federal government, for example, recognizes Juneteenth as an official holiday, resulting in federal services being curtailed. That also is the case in Mississippi cities like Greenville and Jackson which recognize the holiday in lieu of Confederate Memorial Day.
Not surprisingly, the federal government does not recognize Confederate Memorial Day.
Besides a holiday being a day off for some, a holiday also is a symbol of what we believe as a society.
As state Sen. Derrick Simmons, D-Greenville, wrote in a recent Mississippi Today Ideas essay, “Holidays are public statements of our values. They are moments when a state, through official sanction, tells its citizens: ‘This is what we believe is worthy of honor.’”
Simmons has worked in the Mississippi Legislature to try to replace Confederate Memorial Day. He has been unsuccessful thus far.
But his twin brother, Errick Simmons, who is mayor of Greenville, was able to eliminate Confederate Memorial Day thanks to the state law giving cities and counties the option to replace one holiday.
Errick Simmons recently said, “The city of Greenville will never honor or celebrate Confederate Memorial Day — now or forever. As a city rooted in resilience, progress and unity, we categorically reject any celebration of a past rooted in oppression, division and racial injustice. As long as I am mayor of this great city, we will never honor or celebrate it.”
But the state of the Simmons brothers’ birth continues to do so.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/06155046/Juneteenth-at-Smith-Park5.jpg,,,2025-06-15 08:00:03.789795

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on June 12.
After staggering levels of growth at the onset of the pandemic, skier visits in Vermont leveled off this season, but the industry is still booming, according to discussions and presentations from Ski Vermont’s annual meeting at Sugarbush Resort last week.
Ski industry stakeholders discussed several topics at the event, and Ski Vermont — the public face of the Vermont Ski Areas Association — released its highly anticipated skier data for last season, figures that are difficult to find anywhere else and all but impossible on a resort-by-resort basis.
Vermont saw 4.16 million alpine skiers this season, a 1.1 percent increase from last year and a 6.2 percent increase over the last ten years, according to Ski Vermont. This year’s percent increase paled in comparison to figures from 2021 and 2022, which means visitation is leveling off, but resorts felt more prepared for big crowds than three years ago, according to Molly Mahar, Ski Vermont’s president.
Vermont remains the top ski state in New England and fourth largest in the country, according to figures from Ski Vermont. Vermont led New England in increased skier visits by less than one percent but trailed the national average increase of 1.7 percent.
In a lesser sung tune, Vermont’s cross-country ski areas saw a surge in visitation that outpaced alpine resorts. Heavy snowfall and consistently cold weather benefitted cross-country ski operations, which saw a 37 percent increase in visitation, or 322,353 total skiers. Those figures are a significant improvement from last year, when visitation fell by 50 percent due to inclement weather and poor conditions.
David Rye, director of the Outdoor Center at the von Trapp Family Lodge and Resort, agreed it was a good year for cross-country skiing. The trails at von Trapp were open for 110 days this year with 100 percent of terrain open for 62 consecutive days, he said.
Rye didn’t give specific numbers on visitation, but said the number of skier rentals, visits and ski school lessons all increased significantly.
Alpine skier visitation took a hit toward the end of the season as policies and rhetoric from President Donald Trump’s administration deterred Canadians from visiting Vermont resorts, according to Mahar.
Canadians account for up to 50 percent of skier visits in northern Vermont, according to Ski Vermont. Resorts like Jay Peak shouldered a brunt of that impact, but additional areas in the northern tier, including Stowe Mountain Resort, Smugglers’ Notch and Bolton Valley, were also impacted, Mahar said.
Ski Vermont can’t do much about Trump’s rhetoric, but the organization is working harder than ever to maintain advertising in Canada, she added.
Stowe wasn’t the only town playing in powder this year either. Vermont saw an average snowfall of 218 inches, a 19-inch increase from last year, and 35 inches above the 10-year average. As a result, resorts averaged 117 operating days, although this is slightly below the 10-year average of 123 days.
Beyond the numbers, participants at last week’s event dove into a lengthy discussion about the Vermont’s ski industry workforce, which ranged from the various education programs around the state preparing workers for jobs the ski industry to the impact Trump’s immigration policies may have on international workers at ski resorts.
Mahar estimated that out of 13,000 workers in Vermont’s ski industry, around 1,000 are international, and 10 resorts, including Stowe Mountain Resort, employ international workers. She said the impact of losing those workers would be significant.

Chelsea Burton is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
In the home of Rik Palieri, a country-roots and folk singer living in Hinesburg, the walls are filled with instruments: Native American flutes, guitars, banjos and more. They listen to — and help him express —  the songs, sounds and stories of his life.
From East Brunswick, New Jersey, Palieri grew up listening. In hearing performers at a nearby college campus and songs around the kitchen table, he developed a love for music early on.
“I was young and just brimming with a love for folk music that was just driving my friends crazy,” Palieri said. 
So, at age 15, he picked up famed folk singer Pete Seeger’s book, “How to Play the 5-String Banjo.”
That decision was the first of his lifelong career in music. Palieri ended up befriending his teacher in the 1970s. The two jammed together the first time they met — a fitting interaction that kicked off a friendship rooted in music.
Palieri has kept the letters the two sent each other over the years, and he even has a picture of Seeger’s banjo framed in his house.
He’s honored his idol on the road, too. In 2013, Palieri and folk singer George Mann toured across the Rust Belt, through the Mountain West and along the West Coast, performing “for unions and union people,” as Mann put it in an account from that year. 
The tour was a recreation of one from 1941 by the Almanac Singers, a loose group featuring Seeger and Woody Guthrie as mainstays, along with musicians such as Cisco Houston and Bess Lomax Hawes.
Outside of Seeger, Palieri has found support from his wife of 33 years, Marianna Holzer. The two live in a wooden home in Hinesburg with their big white dog, Dolina, and a vast collection of instruments — two favorites are his guitars, Pearl and Lucky.
In Hinesburg, Palieri hosts a monthly jam at the Carpenter-Carse Library, along with the Great Vermont Barn Dance Show. 
“Getting people together and playing music — that’s what it’s all about,” he said.
But Palieri’s impact has extended far outside Vermont. Inspired by the music scene proliferating in Burlington, the singer started his television show, “Songwriter’s Notebook,” in 1999 on Vermont Community Access Media (now part of the Media Factory). It features musicians of any form, from songwriters to instrument-makers. 
The Library of Congress contacted Palieri 10 years later, inducting his show into the archives of the American Folklife Center in Washington, D.C. His honors also include a 2023 lifetime achievement award from the New Jersey Folk Festival, which is in its 50th year in his home state. 
Palieri was most excited to talk about his most recent album, “Hands of Time,” which came out on streaming platforms toward the end of last year.  
He recorded it in a house where once stood Philo Records — an old recording studio based out of Ferrisburgh. The inspiration came from iconic troubadour Utah Phillips — an old folk friend and mentor of Palieri’s who had recorded at the studio in the 1970s.
Phillips lived in an old railroad car nearby. About a decade after Phillips’ death in 2008, family, friends and folk fans held a concert to raise enough money for the old flanger car to be moved to the Black Butte Center for Railroad Culture in Weed, California.
Between performances, Philo founders Michael Couture and Bill Schubart came into the old studio to talk to Palieri. “Do you hear it?” one of them said, Palieri said. “It’s the sound of the studio. It’s still in the walls.” 
The interaction lit the spark.
All the songs are originals except for one: “Going Down the Road Feeling Bad,” a traditional American folk song. A big part of folk music tradition is “playing the old stuff,” Palieri said. 
He recorded the song on an 1800s Edison phonograph cylinder — the earliest medium for recording sound for playback.
The project was not his first time finding inspiration from Phillips. He was featured on the 2009 album “Singing Through the Hard Times: A Tribute to Utah Phillips,” which earned a nomination for best traditional folk album at the Grammys that year. The nomination and his experience qualified him to join the Recording Academy, the group that judges music for the awards every year.
A lot of Palieri’s songs would seem perfect on the protest line, Like the folk singers of the past, Palieri’s pro-labor music works in response to a volatile political climate.
“We’re out on the street because we know how important it is to have our freedoms — to say what you wanna say and be who you wanna be,” Palieri said. “It’s more important than ever to be able to express who you are through your music and your work.”
He also has two books that capture his life and travels. “The Road Is My Mistress” is the first, from 2004. In his more recent — 2020’s “Banjo Man: Adventures of an American Folk Singer” — he hoped to say thank you to his mentors and pass along their stories.
“The stories are your biggest legacy. When you’re gone, the stories live on,” Palieri said.

If all goes as planned, a pregnant person working with a state-certified doula could have their expenses covered by Medicaid.

When Maria Rossi first started working as a doula 15 years ago, she immediately noticed a startling contrast in who was able to access her services. “It was so stark, the differences of what’s being offered to people who had means versus those who didn’t,” she said. 
That’s important because the benefit of doulas lies in their ability to work outside of the traditional medical establishment, she said. Rossi said doulas address the emotional needs of clients, rather than offering clinical medical services. 
Rossi started the doula program at Washington County Mental Health Services 12 years ago because she wanted to provide more birthing resources to Vermonters who aren’t white, are experiencing poverty, live in a rural area or struggle with substance abuse. 
For years, doulas across the state have told lawmakers their services can bridge the gap in resources. They’ve pointed to research that shows pregnant people who use doulas are more likely to have positive birthing outcomes. 
And they’ve asked lawmakers to make their services more affordable. 
Now, a new law signed by Gov. Phil Scott Monday, creates a roadmap to having Vermont Medicaid cover up to $2,100 in doula services. The state and federally funded insurance program would specifically pay for doulas to work with people before, during and after birth. The law also creates a certification program for community-based doulas who serve lower income and under-resourced populations.

The time around birth can be very powerful, but has the potential to be traumatic, Rossi said. 
From 2012 to 2023, 29 people died from pregnancy complications in Vermont, according to an annual state report. Across those cases, researchers found that rural counties in Vermont have a maternal mortality rate three times higher than in Chittenden County — and 83% of Vermonters who died during the perinatal period were insured by Medicaid. 
Nationwide more than 80% of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States are preventable, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. National data also shows huge racial disparities. Black people are more than three times likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause, according to the CDC. 
Those statistics, along with input from doulas, inspired the law.

If all goes as planned, a pregnant person working with a state-certified doula could have their expenses covered by Medicaid. But officials at the Department of Vermont Health Access, which operates the program, have “significant concerns regarding funding and implementation” of the law, said Alex McCracken, a spokesperson for the department. 
First, state officials must figure out how to certify doulas. The Office of Professional Regulation, which operates under the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, is tasked with developing the certification process and carrying it out. The office wants a training standard that will teach doulas how to address the distinct needs of underserved populations, said Jennifer Colin, the office’s general counsel. 
Once the certification is designed, the Department of Vermont Health Access must seek federal approval to change its Medicaid plan by July 1, 2026. But health officials worry the “community-based” doula certification program as envisioned by the law won’t meet federal standards, McCracken said. 
In early May, McCracken cautioned lawmakers against any amendments to the state plan “given the current volatility and uncertainty in the federal environment.” Just days later, President Donald Trump announced billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid’s federal funding. 
Upon signing the bill, Scott gave those concerns a platform.
“Outstanding operational concerns must be addressed before we seek to amend our Medicaid plan,” Scott said in a statement. He urged lawmakers to address any unresolved administrative stumbling blocks next year. 
Lawmakers who worked on the legislation understand those concerns. Sen. Martine Laroque Gulick, D-Chittenden-Central, the bill’s lead sponsor, said she’s optimistic state agencies can work together to get everything ready for federal approval. 
Officials at the Office of Professional Regulation supported the bill and are excited about its passage, Colin said. She said state officials across agencies can work together to create a certification the feds will green-light.
Creating a certification process aims to strike a balance between public protection and maintaining accessibility, Colin said. 
To Rossi, accessibility is what the profession is all about. 
Doulas that could be certified under the new law are “usually serving a higher level of need, and a more marginalized population,” she said. Rossi describes her work as more of a “behavioral intervention” that addresses a client’s emotional needs. 
Rossi sees the law as an important step in closing gaps in access birthing resources and improving maternal care. She said the issue is timely as some hospitals in Vermont consider closing birthing centers in response to expensive healthcare costs. 
Lawmakers recently passed another new law aimed at expanding options for pregnant people. The legislation creates a licensure process for freestanding birthing centers and reduces regulatory barriers for them to open. The law also directs state administrators to seek Medicaid coverage for their services, and requires private insurers that cover maternity services to include freestanding birth centers as providers. 
Doulas are essential in rural communities where there are fewer health care resources, Rossi said, and research shows their services prevent birthing complications and make cesarean sections less likely — ultimately lowering hospital costs. 
Other doulas echoed the sentiment in conversations with officials from the Office of Professional Regulation, according to a state study prompted by a related law last year. 
Those conversations are why administrators recommended that lawmakers create a voluntary certification process for doulas, rather than setting a higher bar like a licensure requirement. One certified nurse midwife, who was not named in the study, said they work with immigrants and refugees in Chittenden County. 
They said the needs of immigrants are not being met — and that access to culturally relevant doula services could create better birthing outcomes and overall more positive medical experiences.
Now, private insurance companies might consider covering doulas as well. BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont started a pilot program last year to gauge member interest in doulas and has seen positive results, said spokesperson Sara Teachout. 
While the pilot is still ongoing, the company could mirror the state and provide coverage for certified doulas down the line, Teachout said.

The pursuit of truth has become overshadowed by narratives shaped by ideology rather than data. Political entanglement in the scientific realm hasn’t just obscured facts, it’s bred mistrust and disinformation—the antithesis of scientific discovery.
While both scientists and politicians influence public understanding, they do so differently. Scientists seek truth but often struggle to communicate in accessible terms. Conversely, politicians are effective communicators but aren’t always tethered to evidence. The resulting disconnect can fuel misunderstanding and deepen divides. An example: the debate around NIH budget cuts—not a clash of values, but perhaps a failure to understand one another.
Let’s talk numbers…
President Trump campaigned on the promise to curb national spending by eliminating what he deemed as “waste” to facilitate a smaller, more efficient government. In the era of inflation, I’m always looking for ways to save; a sentiment I’m sure many working Americans share. So, let’s break down the fiscal year of 2026 (FY2026) budget cuts.
In 2024, the federal government spent $6.75T, of which the National Institutes of Health accounted for a total of 0.7% of the total. In the FY2026 budget, the Trump administration cut the NIH budget by about 40%, which if effectuated, would save taxpayers nearly $18B. While this figure sounds impressive at first blush, compared to our total national FY2026 budget, it only represents a cut of around 1.5%. Meanwhile, the same proposal includes a 13% increase in defense spending, despite the existing U.S. military budget already exceeding that of the next ten countries combined.
The cost of defunding science
The federal government’s assault on science has begun to take a dramatic toll nationally. But let’s look at what this means for North Carolina; where science isn’t just an abstract benefit, but an economic engine. Prior to NIH cuts, the North Carolina life sciences industry generated $2.4 billion in state and local tax revenue annually. However, due to funding cuts, North Carolina lost over $1.2 billion in scientific funding and over 5,000 jobs. Some researchers estimate the state will lose nearly $659 million in new economic activity annually as a result.
Several prominent Ivy League, public, and private universities either admitted less students, rescinded offers, or paused admissions all together for the incoming 2025 class. Anecdotally, I’ve heard PhD students left to choose between joining labs they’re not interested in or dropping out of their programs altogether as labs are losing funding. We’re not just losing research dollars. We’re losing future scientists and, in turn, potential scientific breakthroughs as the next generation of scientists is being stymied.
The real disconnect: It’s not “wasteful” nor about “wokeness”
The FY2026 NIH cuts eliminate funding for what is termed “radical gender ideology” and “DEI expenditures.” Meanwhile, indirect costs—like keeping lab lights on, maintaining research infrastructure, and paying support staff—would be slashed from the traditional 30-60% down to 15%. The Trump administration argues the majority of taxpayer dollars designated for scientific research should go toward the direct advancement of science.
Here’s where the miscommunication lies:
As a taxpayer, I agree, the dollar amount I pay in taxes to fund science should go toward the direct advancement of science, not pushing any particular political ideology. As a scientist, however, I know that indirect costs are essential to scientific innovation. It’s impossible, for example, to run a freezer storing life-saving samples without electricity.
Moreover, collecting a diverse sample pool isn’t about advancing “woke ideology,” it’s good scientific practice. In fact, my job would be a lot easier if the human population was identical. However, biological differences, geographic factors, societal influences, even individual behaviors all have the potential to influence how diseases develop and treatment outcomes. If a medication isn’t tested across diverse groups, how can we trust it will work for everyone?
We’re actually on the same side
In spite of political differences, I believe most Americans—left, right, scientist, skeptic—want similar things: a strong economy, a healthy population, and the prudent use of taxpayer dollars. But we will not get there if we continue to talk past each other. We need to stop letting pride, fear, and bad communication hold scientific progress hostage. So, here’s my FY2026 proposal: let’s move forward by recognizing what is fact vs. ideology and come together—not as opponents but as citizens committed to solving problems. Science isn’t wasteful, it’s crucial. And the cost of cutting it too deeply may not show up on your next tax bill but perhaps your medical bill.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Research-flu-Getty-2025.jpeg,,,2025-06-15 07:00:12.928179

Jeff Landry addresses the Louisiana Legislature on opening day of legislative session, Monday, April 14, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)Louisiana lawmakers adjourned the 2025 regular lawmaking session Thursday having passed a budget with hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure spending; bills aimed at lowering insurance races; and a massive rewrite of state ethics laws. 
In its early days, the eight-week session was at first dominated by a battle between insurance companies and the personal injury attorneys over how to lower car insurance rates. 
That policy dispute also led to a showdown between Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple and Gov. Jeff Landry, both Republicans, over who should be held responsible for Louisiana’s sky-high insurance costs. 

At the end of the session, the governor engaged in a power struggle with Senate President Cameron Henry over private school vouchers and prescription drug regulations. 
The following list evaluates how certain political figures and causes fared in the lawmaking session:  

WINNER: Senate President Cameron Henry 

Henry, a Metairie Republican, resisted pressure from Landry and the conservative House to push through more radical policy proposals than he said the Senate, which has a more moderate approach to politics, felt uncomfortable adopting. 

Despite a wave of attack ads in the media and pressure from the governor, Henry refused to fund an expansion of Louisiana’s private education voucher program. He also declined to force a Senate vote on a proposal to radically remake Louisiana’s pharmacy network, in spite of social media threats from Landry to force a vote on the issue.  

The Senate president blocked a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion policies that the House endorsed. His chamber also turned down a proposal from Landry to give the governor more control over licensing boards and commissions. 
TOSS-UP: Gov. Jeff Landry 
As noted above, Landry lost a couple of high-profile legislative fights with the Senate over his signature private education voucher initiative and prescription drug regulations. 

Some of his strong-arm tactics also simply weren’t effective at getting his agenda passed, particularly in the Senate. 

Landry’s public rally with school children that was meant to pressure legislators into funding more vouchers didn’t elicit the response he wanted. The ultimatum he issued to call lawmakers back into a special session also didn’t force the Senate into passing the pharmacy bill he was backing. 
On other fronts however, he had legislative victories. He was largely able to get his agenda to address Louisiana’s car insurance crisis through the Legislature. A number of bills that reworked the way state agencies – including the Louisiana Workforce Commission, Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Children and Family Services – function also passed.

LOSER: Government transparency 
Lawmakers approve a handful of bills that will make it difficult to scrutinize government officials for inappropriate behavior, government corruption and conflicts of interest. 
House Bill 681 by Rep. Marcus Bryant, D-New Iberia, could subject people to jail time and fines if they post personal information about state lawmakers, statewide elected officials and Public Service Commissioners on the internet. 
It prevents the elected officials’ home addresses, phone numbers, personal email addresses, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, federal tax identification numbers, bank account numbers, credit and debit card numbers, license plate numbers from being published in government records or on a public website. Also protected under the law are marital records and birthdates. 
An official’s church, the school or daycare their child attends and the employment location of their spouse, children or dependents would also be shielded. 
Two other pieces of legislation that massively write government ethics and campaign finance laws would also lead to less disclosure of who is donating to and spending money on political campaigns. 
WINNER: Government corruption
Along with weakening public transparency laws, Landry and lawmakers have made it harder for the Louisiana Board of Ethics to charge any elected official, public employee or government contractor with wrongdoing. 
The change to the board’s investigative process may simply allow those accused of wrongdoing to run out the clock on the board’s ability to even bring charges against them, according to the board’s own members. 
The board is only given a year to investigate and charge a person with a violation before it reaches a legal deadline to do so. The new process for investigations is more time consuming and will make it difficult to finish on time, board members said. 
  Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple speaks to reporters about his legislative agenda to tackle high insurance rates, Thursday, April 10, 2025. (Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)
LOSER: Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple
Temple successfully pushed most of his legislative agenda through, but he lost a public feud to fellow Republican Landry over a bill that would allow the governor to cast blame onto him for the state’s insurance crisis. He will now have greater authority to reject insurance rate hikes, a responsibility he doesn’t want to have. He will now be open to criticism when he doesn’t turn down rate increases that are not popular with the public. 
WINNER: Insurance industry
Insurance companies are the real winners of Temple’s agenda of “tort reform” bills they have been trying to get on the books for years. The new laws are supposed to tamp down lawsuits and reduce the amount of money plaintiffs can recover from bodily injury accidents.

LOSERS: Carbon capture critics 
Carbon capture and sequestration made a cozy home for itself in Louisiana this session. Bills attempting to assert local control over where and whether projects to store injected carbon dioxide underground happen largely died in committees. 
Other moves to ban the practice entirely or tax CO2 injection also got little love. Surviving CCS measures that made it into law are provisions restricting the use of eminent domain for CO2 storage transport pipelines and keeping court venues for these eminent domain claims local to the parish in question. 
WINNER: Rep. Dustin Miller
Miller, an Opelousas Democrat, holds a key seat as chairman of the House Committee on Health and Welfare in a legislature where Republicans hold the supermajority. One of his bills was amended in the late stages of the session to prohibit companies from owning both drugstores and pharmacy benefit managers in Louisiana. Although the legislation was denied a final vote in the Senate on the last day of the session, Miller still received a bipartisan standing ovation from his colleagues in the House for his effort.
He did manage to finesse an exclusion for his home city in one of the year’s most contested bills. A statewide ban on speeding enforcement cameras everywhere but school zones will take effect Aug. 1, except in Opelousas.       
WINNERS: Public school teachers 

Landry and lawmakers had initially said they would not give public school teachers another $2,000 pay stipend after a constitutional amendment to provide that money permanently failed to pass in March. They quickly backtracked, however, and ended up putting the teacher’s stipend back into the budget for the 2025-2026 school year. 

The lawmakers are also putting another constitutional amendment on the ballot next year that would raise teacher pay slightly if the voters approve it. Teachers and school support staff would get $2,250 and $1,125 more respectively in their permanent pay if the ballot proposition passes. 
The teachers also successfully fought off legislation that would have made it harder for their unions to collect dues that are automatically deducted from paychecks. 
LOSERS: Abortion medication providers 
Doctors and activists who provide abortion-inducing medications to Louisianians could be sued under a proposal approved by lawmakers. 
House Bill 575 by Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, easily passed both chambers. She dubbed her proposal the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act,” though it would apply to all forms of the procedure. 
In addition to allowing out-of-state providers to be sued, it extends the window for filing litigation from three years to five. 
TOSS-UP: College athletes 
Louisiana college athletes will not be receiving a tax exemption on their name, image and likeness (NIL) income this year, as two proposals to do so stalled due to the state’s lean budget situation. But lawmakers may take another crack at it after a task force meets over the next year and submits recommendations for NIL legislation. 
But each Division I college athletics program in Louisiana will be the beneficiary of an increased gambling tax, which will send nearly $2 million annually to be spent on expenses benefitting athletes. 
WINNERS: Nursing home owners  

Nursing home owners were able to pass legislation that will limit the damages collected from wrongful death and injury lawsuits brought against their facilities. There are 60-plus pending lawsuits from former clients and their families against nursing home ownership groups across the state currently. 
LOSERS: Civil service workers 
Lawmakers approved a constitutional amendment that could weaken the state civil service system that provides protections to thousands of state employees. The proposal still needs approval from Louisiana voters before it’s enacted, but the fact that the bill made it out of the legislature this year signals that a two-thirds majority of lawmakers may no longer value a system that has held strong in Louisiana for roughly 70 years.  
  Democratic lawmakers stand together May 19, 2025, in the Louisiana House of Representatives to oppose Rep. Emily Chenevert’s House Bill 685, which prohibits policy on diversity, equity and inclusion in state government and prevents state colleges and universities from requiring DEI in their curricula with limited exceptions. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)
WINNERS: DEI and academic freedom
A proposal that would have prohibited diversity, equity and inclusion practices across state government and prohibit state universities and colleges from requiring certain race and gender-based curricula for undergraduate students was purposefully stalled in the Senate. 
Henry, the senate president, said the measure was unnecessary. 
The bill was also opposed by The Louisiana chapter of the American Association of University Professors. 
LOSERS: People incarcerated on split-jury verdicts
Louisiana voters amended the state constitution in 2018 to eliminate convictions through non-unanimous juries in felony criminal trials, but the change didn’t apply to such verdicts before the change. Two years later, U.S. Supreme Court ruled that split-jury verdicts were unconstitutional, but it left it up to Louisiana to determine whether their ruling would apply to older cases.
Lawmakers have tried multiple times since then to provide an avenue for those convicted by non-unanimous juries to seek a review of their cases. Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, managed to get his bill through committee this year, but it was shot down on the Senate floor despite having the support of the Louisiana Republican Party and GOP Congressman Clay Higgins, an ardent anti-crime proponent.
WINNER: Children’s teeth 
Louisiana lawmakers opted against a conspiracy-theory fueled bill that would have prohibited public water systems from fluoridating their water. Water fluoridation is considered key in reducing dental complications in children. 
LOSER: Wetlands
It is now easier to build in Louisiana’s isolated wetland areas— kind of. The state adopted a new definition of what counts as a wetland with Senate Bill 94 by Senator Mike “Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, excluding areas cut off from surface water connection to rivers and lakes or surrounded by levees. 
Despite some legal confusion as to whether the legislation violates the Clean Water Act, there are now legal avenues to argue that these isolated wetland areas don’t need permits to drain, dredge and fill.
WINNER: Fortified roof program
Lawmakers have embraced the state’s fortified roof program as one of the only effective means of lowering homeowner insurance rates. This session, they established a new $10,000 income tax credit that should go a significant way in helping homeowners afford the hurricane-resistant roofs. 
WINNER: Saudi Arabia 
Louisiana has included $7 million in the state budget to spend on a LIV Golf League event that is expected to come to the Bayou Oaks golf course in New Orleans City Park next summer. 

Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world with nearly $1 trillion in assets, owns LIV Golf. 

LOSER: Science
The governor has signed a bill that bans the dispersion of chemicals for weather modification. Technological advances in  have safely produced results in rain-starved areas, but they have also launched far more unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. Louisiana joins Florida and Tennessee with new laws based on this speculation, and similar legislation is under consideration in other states. 
Awaiting the governor’s signature is a bill that would allow the over-the-counter sale of ivermectin. The drug’s proponents praise it as a treatment for COVID-19 symptoms, though federal regulators haven’t approved it for that use.

Regina Young (D-Philadelphia/Delaware) at a press conference in Harrisburg to raise awareness of wrongful conviction compensation legislation. (Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Most states have a system for compensating people after they’ve been exonerated. 
Pennsylvania does not, despite state lawmakers steadily introducing bills to create one for at least the past two decades.  
That would change under identical wrongful conviction compensation bills currently in each chamber of the state legislature. But the proposals are a mixed bag, according to some proponents, who believe few would qualify for payment.

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/13epWCCR.mp3
For now, exonerees in the commonwealth have to hire a lawyer and sue to try to get monetary damages for being imprisoned for something they didn’t do. 
Even then, winning these cases isn’t straightforward, according to attorney Jeffrey Deskovic. 
“The overwhelming majority of exonerees here in Pennsylvania are uncompensated because the facts of their case didn’t lend [themselves] to being able to prove malicious misconduct,” said Deskovic, who specializes in these cases after doing 15 years himself for a crime he did not commit. “It’s simply that they were wrongfully imprisoned.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Also, lawsuits often take years and the outcome’s uncertain, noted Bijan Taheri, executive director of Youth For Innocence, a consortium of high school and undergraduate volunteers who do case intake for lawyers. 
“ That’s time people who are just getting out of prison, who have no resources, don’t have,” Taheri says. “It’s really important that … these people can be compensated and have those services right out of the gate instead of being forced to wait three, four, five years and eventually, maybe, get compensated.”
Taheri, of Philadelphia, and Deskovic, of New York, spoke at a gathering on the Capitol steps to try to raise awareness of the legislation. New York-based national innocence nonprofit It Could Happen To You organized the event.
Thirty-eight states and Washington, D.C., have wrongful conviction compensation statutes.
Pennsylvania is the most populous of the remaining states without one, according to Professor Jeffrey Gutman, director of the Public Justice Advocacy Clinic at The George Washington University Law School.
The fine print
Most states don’t have a dedicated revenue stream or funding source for wrongful conviction compensation. The proposal in Pennsylvania also does not identify one. 
But the way the legislation reads currently would limit who qualifies, some advocates say. 
“It’s not gonna end up costing the state a dime because no one’s gonna get any money out of it,” said Adele Bernhard, a professor at New York Law School who’s focused her career on wrongful incarceration. 
To qualify, someone’s conviction would have to have been reversed based on “actual innocence,” the legislation states.
During the proposed compensation application process, the court would need to be “satisfied of the individual’s actual innocence,” to ultimately approve payment.
That phrase – actual innocence – stood out to both Bernhard, who first compiled a compensation statute policy matrix in 1999, and Gutman, who now keeps it updated for the National Registry of Exonerations. 
“ That’s bad language. Nobody will get their award,” Bernhard said. “It’ll be a stumbling block.” 
That’s because judges tend to overturn convictions when there’s new evidence – a witness, new information about the confession or identification, etc. – that they believe, had a jury heard it, would’ve resulted in an acquittal instead, she said. 
“DNA is obviously a slam dunk. And it depends what else you have,” Bernhard said. “Whatever it is, is that new information sufficient for a court to say you’re actually innocent? They are not generally going to say that. They’re going to hedge their bets a bit and say, ‘No. I think a jury would’ve acquitted if they’d heard this information about the police officer.’”
Five states require a prior finding of actual innocence to qualify for wrongful conviction compensation. 
Pennsylvania’s law could say something like “the conviction was overturned and the indictment vacated on grounds consistent with innocence,” she said. 
“That gets rid of the bogus claims where somebody’s had their case overturned based on some sort of a technicality and then dismissed because they can’t find the witness and it has absolutely nothing to do with innocence,” she said. 
The  measure calls for a process that’s as informal as possible. But people likely will need an attorney to navigate it, according Bernhard, especially because prosecutors on the original case would have a month to object. 
Petitioners would have 15 days to respond to any objections from law enforcement or a flat out denial, according to the legislation. 
Those relatively tight timelines could help address delays that can be an issue in some other states, Bernhard said. 
Some components match what’s in place in other states, according to Gutman.
The bill also calls for: 

Paying exonerees between $75,000 per year of wrongful incarceration – or $100,000 if the person was on death row – plus $50,000 per year on probation or parole.
Reimbursements for related expenses such as restitution and medical care, in addition to no more than $75,000 in legal fees (calculated at up to 10 percent of the payout)
A six-year window to file for payment starting upon release from prison or a decision on a compensation application, whichever is later.
Notifying potentially eligible people by the Department of Human Services and Board of Pardons. 

“The provisions about non-monetary services are quite strong, but they don’t help people who don’t qualify,” Gutman said via email. 
Sponsor Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia/Montgomery) said lawmakers have been working to find language that gets enough support to move the bill. 
“We’re going to continue to try to be creative,” Hughes said. “We’re gonna try to answer people’s concerns or questions. The objective remains the same. But maybe we have to utilize different language to get it all the way home.”
A spokesperson for cosponsor Sen. Camera Bartolotta (R-Washington) said her office didn’t participate in negotiations about the language in the bill. 
 The impact of stigma 
Some advocates said they believe an application-based system would mean more predictable costs – potentially lower, even.
Adequate support would ultimately help exonerees get back on their feet and contribute to society, they noted.
Deskovic said he experienced the difference first-hand. The New Yorker said his home state didn’t have wrongful conviction compensation when he was exonerated and released, let alone re-entry services. 
“I was always passed over for gainful employment,” he said. “There was a stigma around whether I was out on a technicality or because I was innocent.”
Deskovic struggled, as many exonerees do, with catching up to new technology during his prison sentence, in addition to post-traumatic stress and finding stable housing. 
Five years later, he secured compensation through New York’s compensation statute. 
“Suddenly, I didn’t have the mental strain,” Deskovic says. “I was able to pay my bills. I was able to go to college, get a bachelor’s and master’s and a law degree, and be a lawyer, and have a nonprofit organization. I know many exonerees in other states that have compensation that were able to put their lives back together again.”
Yeidja Bostick, of Philadelphia, is still waiting for that reprieve.
“It’s really come to a point that this compensation is like a matter of life and death,” Bostick said. “All those years I felt like I could have been financially okay if I had gainful employment. But really no one wants to hire you.”
Bostick’s conviction for vehicular homicide was overturned at the end of 1993. 
She said she didn’t receive support for finding a job, managing post-traumatic stress or anything else after her exoneration and release from prison. She said she’s now working as a courier driver and getting by, but still struggling with debt accumulated over years of struggling to find stability and gainful employment. 
“There’s nothing that we can do to get that time back, but going forward, it’s time to right the wrongs of the injustice,” Bostick said. “Just make it happen.”
It’s not just prison itself, supporters pointed out: the trauma of the experience, the toll it takes on physical health and the ensuing loss of time, educational opportunities, career progression and financial stability have devastating longterm consequences. 
Stigma and lack of specific support exacerbate all of that, as Deskovic referenced. 
Researchers have documented discrimination against exonerees in multiple arenas including housing and employment. 
A recent study added to the canon with an audit of therapists. 
Basically, the team emailed therapists with nearly identical treatment queries. They described symptoms verbatim. The change came with just a few words: the writer identified as either a former first responder, someone on parole or someone who’d been exonerated.
Exonerees had the lowest response rates, with nearly half of emails ignored. 
One possible explanation, according to Towson University Professor Jeff Kukucka, is that people simply don’t believe the claims of innocence (despite these being upheld in court). 
Parolees got the most referrals, with about 40 percent of respondents suggesting another provider. 
To Kukucka, a lead researcher on the study, that supports a better explanation: a systemic blind spot when it comes to exonerees. So, the therapists didn’t know how to help or what to suggest as an alternative. 
“There are tons of agencies whose mission is to help people transition from life in prison and criminal offenses to a productive crime-free life after prison, that are geared toward giving people a second chance,” Kukucka said. “We don’t yet have nearly the same level of systemic support for wrongly incarcerated people.” 
Fifteen of the 39 states with compensation statutes guarantee mental health support for people with an overturned conviction. 
“ There’s an assumption that’s implicit in a lot of these statutes that when a wrongly incarcerated person leaves prison and comes back into society, that if we give them some money, they’ll be able to figure it out,” he said.
Political progress? 
Two years ago in Pennsylvania, a wrongful conviction compensation bill passed out the House Judiciary Committee on a party line vote before stalling for the year or so remaining in that session. That’s the most progress any legislation on the issue’s made. 
State Rep. Regina Young (D-Philadelphia/Delaware), the House measure’s sponsor now and then, says she’s optimistic. 
 ”The last time I spoke with the judiciary leader on the House Republican side, they were considering it,” Young said Tuesday.
That would be State Rep. Rob Kauffman (R-Chambersburg). 
As the GOP minority House Judiciary chairman, Kauffman expressed concerns last session during the committee’s discussion that included extending eligibility to people who’d been pardoned and pleaded no contest. 
The current version of the bill states that people can qualify with a pardon or if they pleaded no contest during their original case. 
Kauffman didn’t respond to interview requests for this story. Nor did the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association. 
Those who’d be ineligible include someone incarcerated for a different conviction that wasn’t overturned. 
“It’s hard to imagine a greater injustice than losing decades behind bars for a crime you did not commit,” Young said during her remarks last week in Harrisburg. “You receive no compensation for your time and minimal assistance with the transition back to society without a clear understanding of the world you’re walking back into.”
Young’s office did not respond to requests for comment after the event about the bill language. Organizers hope to meet with her “to tighten up the bill”, said Bill Bastuk, who heads advocacy organization It Could Happen to You.

This story about international students was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education. Sign up for the Hechinger newsletter.
A Black History Month event, canceled. A lab working to fight hunger, shuttered. Student visas revoked, then reinstated, uncertain for how long. Opportunities for students pursuing science careers, fading.
The first six months of the Trump administration have brought a hailstorm of changes to the nation’s colleges and universities. While the president’s faceoffs with Harvard and Columbia have generated the most attention, students on campuses throughout the country are noticing the effects of the administration’s cuts to scientific and medical research, clampdown on any efforts promoting diversity equity and inclusion (DEI), newly aggressive policies for students with loan debt, revoking of visas for international students and more. 
Many of the administration’s actions are being challenged in court, but they are influencing the way students interact with each other, what support they can get from their institutions — and even whether they feel safe in this nation.   
The Hechinger Report traveled to campuses around the country to look at what these changes mean for students. Reporters visited universities in four states — California, Illinois, Louisiana and Texas — to understand this new era for higher education.
LSU:’DEI is being wiped away’
 Last fall, Louisiana State University student A’shawna Smith had an idea for a new campus group to educate students about their legal rights and broader problems in the criminal justice system. Smith, a sociology major, had spent the prior summer interning at a law firm and noticed how many clients didn’t know their rights after an arrest. 
Smith, now a rising senior, called it The Injustice Reform and soon recruited classmates and a campus adviser. They wrote a mission statement and trained as student group leaders. On Feb. 20, LSU’s student government, which awards money to campus groups that comes from student fees, gave them $1,200; Smith and her classmates planned to use the award to recruit members and organize events. 
But on April 8, Injustice Reform’s treasurer received a text message from Cortney Greavis, LSU’s student government adviser. She said LSU was rescinding the money: The group’s mission statement ran afoul of new federal and state restrictions on DEI. Its mission mentions racial disparities and police brutality, but the organizers were never told which words violated the rules. Smith and fellow leaders started chipping in their own money to keep the group going: $10 here and there, whatever they could afford, said Bella Porché, a rising senior on the group’s executive board. 
Canceling awards to student groups is one way students say administrators at LSU, the state’s flagship university, have restricted what they can do and say since the U.S. Department of Education wrote to schools and colleges nationwide on Valentine’s Day. The letter described DEI efforts — designed to rectify current and historic discrimination — as discriminatory and threatened schools with the loss of federal money unless they ended the consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, housing, training and other practices. 
Since the letter, discussion of DEI on campus “has become an anti-gay, anti-Black sort of conversation,” said Emma Miller, a rising senior and elected student senator. “People who are minorities don’t feel safe anymore, don’t feel represented, don’t feel seen, because DEI is being wiped away and their university is not saying anything.” 
In a March 7 report, the university detailed dozens of changes made to comply with the letter’s demands. For example, it ended any preference granted to students from historically underrepresented groups for certain privately funded scholarships; opened membership in school-funded student organizations — like a women-in-business group — to all; and canceled activities perceived to emphasize race, even a fitness class kicking off Black History Month.  
Student government leaders say the restrictions hinder their ability to operate. Rising junior Tyhlar Holliway, a member of the student government’s Black Caucus, said school administrators essentially shut down the caucus’ proposal that the student government issue a statement after the Department of Education letter in support of DEI programs and initiatives. 
LSU public relations staff did not respond to interview requests or to an emailed list of questions, and the school’s civil rights and Title IX division director declined to speak.
Miller said administrators have told student leaders that all their proposed legislation must be reviewed by the school’s general counsel for compliance with the March 7 guidelines. The administration, for example, blocked a student government bill to fund a Black hair care event designed to help students prepare for career and professional opportunities, said senior Paris Holman, a student government member. “We have conferences and interviews and need to know how to take care of our hair,” said Holman, who is Black. 
Students have also tailored the language of other bills to avoid the appearance of support for DEI. Holman said that in one case the student senate changed the language in a bill funding an end-of-year event for a minority student organization to remove any reference to the organization as serving minority students. 
The school also overrode student government decisions about which groups, like A’shawna Smith’s, could be funded by student fees. In February, the student government voted to provide $641 to help a pre-med student, who is Black, attend a student medical education conference, in part so she could share what she’d learn with other pre-med students. A few weeks later, she received an email from Greavis, the student government adviser, saying she wouldn’t be able to attend with university funds because that money could no longer be used for “DEI-related events, initiatives, programs, or travel.” Greavis didn’t respond to requests for an interview.
The email didn’t specify why the medical conference crossed the line. But the sponsoring organization’s mission statement notes its commitment to “supporting current and future underrepresented minority medical students,” and a conference plenary speaker was scheduled to address the “enduring case for DEI in medicine.” Fewer than 6 percent of doctors are Black and research has shown improved health outcomes for Black patients who are seen by physicians of the same race.    
“It doesn’t feel like a democracy,” said Holman of serving in student government at this moment. 
Tell the Hechinger Report how Trump policy is changing life on your campus.
She and other students say the university’s actions are starting to change the broader culture at LSU, which serves nearly 40,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its campus of Italian Renaissance buildings shaded by magnolias and Southern live oaks. About 60% of students are white and 18% are Black, according to federal data. 
Mila Fair, a rising sophomore journalism major and a reporter for the campus TV station, said students tell her they’re afraid to join protests, in part because of LSU’s new anti-DEI rules and the national crackdown on student demonstrations. Those who do attend are often afraid to go on camera with her, she said. 
  LSU Professor Andrew Sluyter (Steven Yoder/ The Hechinger Report
Latin American studies professor Andrew Sluyter said administrators normally listen to the student government — even more than to the faculty government — but now worry about students getting the school into “political hot water.” He had his own run-in with the DEI ban: As part of a February effort to scrub school websites of diversity references, in which the university purged hundreds of webpages referencing DEI-related content, LSU deleted a 2022 press release announcing a prestigious fellowship he’d won that mentioned “higher education’s racial inequities.” 
Students recognize the pressure LSU is under from the federal government, but they want administrators to stand up for them, said graduate student Alicia Cerquone, a student senator. “We want some sort of communication from the university that shows commitment to its community, that they have our backs and they’ll protect students,” she said.

‘Try to stay under the radar’
BERKELEY, Calif. — Since early April, Rayne Xue, a junior at the University of California, Berkeley, has watched with trepidation as the Trump administration has taken one step after another to limit international students’ access to American higher education. 
First came the abrupt cancellation, then reinstatement, of visas for 23 Berkeley students and recent graduates. Then the government cut off Harvard’s ability to enroll international students — a move since blocked by a federal judge — raising fears that something similar could happen at Berkeley. And late last month, as this year’s graduates were celebrating their recent commencements, Secretary of State Marco Rubio paused interviews for all new student visas and announced he would “aggressively revoke” those of Chinese students.
Xue, who is from Beijing and won a student senate seat this past spring on a platform of supporting international students, said the administration’s actions strike at a critical part of campus life at Berkeley.
“College is the opportunity of a lifetime to unlearn prejudices and embrace new perspectives, neither of which is possible without a student body that comes from a wide range of geographic and cultural backgrounds,” she said.
About 16% of UC Berkeley’s more than 45,000 students come from outside the United States to study at the crown jewel of California’s public research university system, where creeks run through campus beneath cooling redwoods and parking spaces are set aside for Nobel laureates. China, India, South Korea and Canada send the biggest numbers. International students pay higher tuition than California residents, boosting the university’s coffers and subsidizing some of their peers. Many of them conduct cutting-edge research in fields like computer science, engineering and chemistry.

Now the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, magnified by the yanking of billions in federal research dollars, has international students worried about their future on campus. Many are changing their behavior to avoid scrutiny: Some canceled travel plans and many said they avoid walking near any campus protests in fear of being photographed.
“It’s difficult for international students to feel secure when they cannot anticipate what the administration might charge against them next — or whether they might be unfairly targeted,” said one global studies major who asked not to be identified for fear of attracting retaliation.
Tomba Morreau, a rising junior from the Netherlands studying sociology, said he stopped posting about politics on social media — just in case.
 That kind of self-censorship troubles Paul Fine, co-chair of the Berkeley Faculty Association, which represents about a fifth of the university’s tenure-track faculty. 
Federal policies are “creating this culture of fear where people start to censor themselves and try to stay under the radar and not show up in their full selves, whether for academic work or activism,” he said.

 International students in Fine’s classes told him they wanted to attend a recent protest against federal threats to higher education but were afraid of the consequences, he said. Others told him they were skipping academic conferences outside the United States that they otherwise would have attended.
 “Berkeley really prides ourselves on being an intellectual hub that convenes people from all over the world to work on the most important problems,” Fine said. Now that identity is at risk, he said, especially as actual and threatened cuts to grants make it harder for faculty to hire international graduate students and postdocs. 
Most poignant, he said, was hearing from demoralized Chinese students who left a repressive government to come to the United States only to see attacks on academic freedom replicated here. 
Xue said she hopes the crisis facing universities would draw attention to the challenges international students face, including limited financial aid and the stereotype that all of them are wealthy. With her colleagues in student government, she is lobbying for Berkeley to spend more on the international office, which provides one-on-one advising on visa issues and employment.

For Lily Liu, a Chinese computer scientist, 2025 was shaping up to be a year of milestones. She graduated with a doctorate last month, has a job lined up at a leading artificial intelligence company and is engaged to be married in November.
But the Trump administration’s changing policies toward international scholars have complicated celebrations for Liu, who’s in a federal program that extends her visa for up to a year beyond graduation so she can gain work experience here. She canceled summer travel plans with her family, concerned she might not be let back into the country. And she’s considering moving her wedding to the United States from China, even though many of her relatives wouldn’t be able to attend.
“For international students, every policy affects us a lot,” she said. So Liu is careful. After the publication of her thesis was delayed, she visited Berkeley’s international office to make sure the setback wouldn’t affect her work permit. Her fiancé has a green card, which should theoretically mean his immigration status is more stable. But these days, she said, who knows?

‘In a hundred days everything was destroyed’
SAN ANTONIO — Growing up here, Reina Saldivar had always loved science — all she wanted to watch on TV was “Animal Planet.” Yet until she applied on a whim to a program for aspiring researchers after her first year at the University of Texas at San Antonio, she assumed she would spend her life as a lab technician, running cultures. 
The program, Maximizing Access to Research Careers, or MARC, was started by the National Institutes of Health decades ago at colleges around the country to prepare students, especially those from historically underrepresented backgrounds, for livelihoods in the biomedical sciences. 
Saldivar got in. And through the program, she spent much of her time on campus in a university lab, helping develop a carrier molecule for a new Lyme disease vaccine. Now Saldivar, who graduated this spring, plans to eventually return to academia for a doctorate.  
“What MARC taught me was that my dreams aren’t out of reach,” she said.
Saldivar is among hundreds who’ve participated in the MARC program since its 1980 founding at the University of Texas at San Antonio. She may also be among the last. In April, the university’s MARC program director, Edwin Barea-Rodriguez, opened his email inbox to find a form letter terminating the initiative and advising against recruiting more cohorts. 
The letter cited “changes in NIH/HHS [Health and Human Services] priorities.” In recent months, the Trump administration has canceled at least half a dozen programs meant to train scholars and diversify the sciences as part of an effort to root out what the president labels illegal DEI. 
In a statement to The Hechinger Report, NIH said that it “is committed to restoring the agency to its tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science” and is reviewing grants to make sure the agency is “addressing the United States chronic disease epidemic.”

With MARC ending, Barea-Rodriguez is searching for a way to continue supporting current participants until they graduate next academic year. Without access to federal money, however, the young scientists are anxious about their futures — and that of public health in general. 
“It took years to be where we are now,” said Barea-Rodriguez, who said he was not speaking on behalf of his university, “and in a hundred days everything was destroyed.” 
UTSA’s sprawling campus sits on the northwest edge of San Antonio, far from tourist sites like the Alamo and the River Walk. Forty-four percent of the nearly 31,000 undergraduate students are the first in their families to attend college; more than 61 percent identify as Hispanic or Latino. The university was one of the first nationwide to earn Department of Education recognition as a Hispanic-serving institution, a designation for colleges where at least a quarter of full-time undergraduates are Hispanic.
When Barea-Rodriguez arrived to teach at the school in 1995, many locals considered it a glorified community college, he said. But in the three decades since, the investments NIH made through MARC and other federal programs have helped it become a top-tier research university. That provided students like Saldivar with access to world-class opportunities close to home and fostered talent that propelled the economy in San Antonio and beyond. 
The Trump administration has quickly upended much of that infrastructure, not only by terminating career pipeline programs for scholars, but also by pulling more than $8.2 million in National Science Foundation money from UTSA. 
One of those canceled grants paid for student researchers and the development of new technologies to improve equity in math education and better serve elementary school kids from underrepresented backgrounds in a city that is about 64% Hispanic. Another aimed to provide science, technology, engineering and math programming to bilingual and low-income communities. 
UTSA administrators did not respond to requests for comment about how federal funding freezes and cuts are affecting the university. Nationwide, more than 1,600 NSF grants have been axed since January.

In San Antonio, undergraduates said MARC and other now-dead programs helped prepare them for academic and professional careers that might have otherwise been elusive. Speaking in a lab remodeled and furnished with NIH money, where leftover notes and diagrams on glass erase boards showed the research questions students had been noodling, they described how the programs taught them about drafting an abstract, honing public speaking and writing skills, networking, putting together a résumé and applying for summer research positions, travel scholarships and graduate opportunities. 
“All of the achievements that I’ve collected have pretty much been, like, a direct result of the program,” said Seth Fremin, a senior biochemistry major who transferred to UTSA from community college and has co-authored five articles in major journals, with more in the pipeline. After graduation, he will start a fully funded doctoral program at the University of Pittsburgh to continue his research on better understanding chemical reactions. 
Similarly, Elizabeth Negron, a rising senior, is spending this summer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, researching skin microbiomes to see if certain bacteria predispose some people to cancers. 
“It’s weird when you meet students who didn’t get into these programs,” Negron said, referring to MARC. “They haven’t gone to conferences. They haven’t done research. They haven’t been able to mentor students. … It’s very strange to acknowledge what life would have been without it. I don’t know if I could say I’d be as successful as I am now.” 
With money for MARC erased, Negron said she will probably need a job once she returns to campus in the fall so she can afford day-to-day expenses. Before, research was her job. 
“Without MARC,” she said, “it becomes a question of can I at least cover my tuition and my very basic needs.”

‘We could potentially lose a generation of scientists’
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — When Peter Goldsmith received notice in late January that his Soybean Innovation Lab at the University of Illinois would soon lose all of its funding, he had no idea it was coming. Suddenly Goldsmith, the lab’s director, had to tell his 30 employees they would soon be out of a job and tell research partners across Africa that operations would come to a halt. The lab didn’t even have money to water its soybean fields in Africa. 
One employee, Julia Paniago, was in Malawi when she got the news. “We came back the next day,” she said of her team, “and it was a lot of uncertainty. And a lot of people cried.”
The University of Illinois’ Soybean Innovation Lab (SIL) was part of a network of 17 labs at universities across the country, all working on research related to food production and reducing global hunger, and all funded through the U.S. Agency for International Development — until the Trump administration shut down USAID.
Soybeans — which provide both oil and high-protein food — aren’t yet commonly grown in Malawi. SIL researchers have been working toward two related goals: helping local farmers increase soybean production and ameliorate malnutrition and generating enough interest in the crop there that a new export market will open for American farmers.
The lab’s researchers work in soybean breeding, economics and mechanical research as well as education. They hope to show that soybean production in Africa is worth further investment so that eventually the private sector will come in after them.
“The people who work at SIL, they like being right at the frontier of change,” Goldsmith said. “It’s high-risk work — that’s what the universities do, that’s what scientific research is about.”

UI, the state’s flagship with a sprawling campus spread between the cities of Urbana and Champaign, is noted for its research work, especially agricultural research.
Labs and researchers across the university lost funding in cuts made by the Trump administration; more than $25 million from agencies including NIH, NSF and the National Endowment for the Humanities was cut, Melissa Edwards, associate vice chancellor for research and innovation, said, a total of 59 grants amounting to 3.6% of their overall federal grant portfolio.
Annette Donnelly, who just received her doctorate in education, is among those affected. Her research focuses on educating malnourished children in Africa and developing courses to help Africans learn how to process soybeans into oil.

In April, SIL was handed a lifeline — an anonymous $1 million gift that will keep the lab running through April 2026. The donation wasn’t enough for Goldsmith to rehire all of his employees; SIL’s annual operating budget before the USAID cuts was $3.3 million (and would have kept things running through 2027). But, he said, the money will allow SIL to continue its research in the Lower Shire Valley in Malawi, a project he hopes will attract future donors to fund the lab’s work. 
The April donation saved Donnelly’s job, but her priorities shifted.  “We’re doing research,” she said, “but we’re also doing a lot of proposal writing. It has taken on a much greater priority.” 
Donnelly hopes to attract more funding so she can resume research she had started in western Kenya, demonstrating that introducing soy into children’s diets increased their protein intake by up to 65%, she said.
The impact that funding cuts will have on researchers at the soybean lab pales in comparison to the impact on their partners in Africa, Donnelly emphasized. There, she said, the cuts mean processors will likely slow production, limiting their ability to deliver soy products. “The consequences there are much bigger,” she said.
The Soybean Innovation Lab was funded through the Feed the Future initiative, a program to help partner countries develop better agricultural practices that began under the Obama administration in 2010. All 17 Feed the Future innovation labs funded through USAID lost funding, except for the one at Kansas State University, which studies heat-tolerant wheat.
The soybean lab’s office is housed on a quiet edge of the Illinois campus in a building once occupied by the university’s veterinary medicine program. Across the street, rows of greenhouses are home to the Crop Science Department’s experiments.
There, Brian Diers is breeding soybean varieties that resist soybean rust, a disease that’s been an obstacle to ramping up soybean production across sub-Saharan Africa. A professor emeritus who is retired, Diers works part-time at SIL to assist with soybean breeding. The April donation wasn’t enough to cover his work. Now he volunteers his time.
“ If we can help African agriculture take off and become more productive, that’s eventually going to help their economies and then provide more opportunities for American farmers to export to Africa,” he said.
Goldsmith drew an analogy between his lab’s work and the state of American agriculture in the 1930s. As the Dust Bowl swept through the Great Plains, Monsanto or another company could have stepped in to help combat it, but didn’t. Public land-grant universities did. 
“That’s where the innovation comes from, from the public land grants in the U.S.,” Goldsmith said. “And now the public land grants still work in U.S. agriculture but also in the developing world.” 
Commercial soybean producers hesitate to dip their toes into unproven markets, he said, so it’s SIL’s job to demonstrate that a viable market exists. “That was our secret sauce, in that lots of commercial players liked the products, the technologies we had, and wanted to move into the soybean space, but it wasn’t a profitable market,” Goldsmith said of the African soybean market.
Diers said federal funding cuts imperil not just the development of commerce and global food production but the next generation of scientists as well. 
“We could potentially lose a generation of scientists who won’t go into science because there’s no funding right now,” he said.

Kennedy Jr. painted a bleak picture of people with autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, that was especially hurtful to some.","Editor’s note: We now offer an audio version of our Sunday features. To access, click on the player above.
Emma McKeever and her mom, Pamela, often do artistic projects together. 
Emma likes to make digital drawings inspired by her favorite songs, and Pamela helps her turn those illustrations into notecards. Sometimes they make floral arrangements that incorporate vegetables: Emma might put carrots in a vase alongside flowers or sculpt a cabbage into a vessel for irises and tulips.
But in May, when mother and daughter decided to turn their sights on another creative project — writing poetry — they weren’t inspired by nature or music. Rather, they were looking for an outlet for their frustration after a press conference by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about people with autism — people like Emma.
At that press conference, Kennedy discussed a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that found the rates of autism are rising, and he announced a significant new investment in research to find the cause of autism. But his remarks were peppered with assertions that experts say are untrue or misleading. He claimed that new research efforts would discover an environmental cause of autism in just a few months, even as scientists say that research overwhelmingly points to autism as primarily genetic.
Kennedy also painted a bleak picture of people with autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, that was especially hurtful to Emma.
“These are kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date,” Kennedy said. “Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”
At the press conference, Kennedy seemed to be speaking about people with ASD who face the most significant challenges, along a broad spectrum. But he didn’t specify that in his remarks, and seemed to paint all people with ASD with a broad brush.
Emma wrote her poem as a kind of rebuke. In it, she wonders about the inner thoughts of the HHS Secretary:
Did RFK Jr ever think?
Did he really think that I, an autistic person, couldn’t write a poem? 
Did he ever stop to listen to himself, to the nonsense he was speaking?
That the false words, the wretched lies he spouts, are something to believe?
Are his words out of greed and selfishness or to better lives?
Did he really believe that it was okay to strip funding from families in need of financial support? Did he ever think that accessing databases violates our privacy about protected health information? 
Did RFK ever think we would just roll over and accept this treatment?! 
His thought that autism is a curse that destroys families IS the tragedy. 
It did not destroy my family, it made my family stronger, more real! 
I have a great mind, maybe sharper than his. 
So, did RFK Jr ever think?  
This is hardly the first time that Kennedy has cast autism as a national scourge with a culprit hiding in plain sight. In 2005, he penned an article then published in Rolling Stone and Salon, titled “Deadly Immunity,” which pointed to research arguing that a preservative in vaccines called thimerosal causes autism. 
In the years since, Kennedy has focused on the specter of climbing autism rates to drum up skepticism about vaccines writ large, even as scientists concluded that there is no link between autism and vaccines. Families impacted by autism who have followed this debate have found themselves riding an emotional rollercoaster: some felt hopeful when a study suggested a causal link between vaccines and autism and then lost trust in scientific research when they learned that the data in that oft-cited study was falsified. Despite overwhelming agreement in the scientific community that there is no link between autism and vaccines, Kennedy has remained a vaccine skeptic.

But Kennedy is no longer voicing his skepticism of mainstream science from the sidelines. As the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, he is now the most powerful figure in public health in the United States. In that role, his view on autism is already starting to have a tangible impact. 
Since Kennedy’s tenure began, the Trump administration has ended vital services for autism and made federal cuts to research funding related to autism. Kennedy also announced the creation of a database or registry, where information about people with autism would be collected to facilitate the search for causation. Parents of children with ASD, and adults with ASD are especially anxious about the registry, saying it would violate their privacy. They say his rhetoric is creating stigma around a community that has worked hard to find acceptance. 
Some parents of people with ASD who require significant caretaking say they’re hopeful that a new burst of energy from the federal government could bring promising advancements. But scientists and health care professionals are concerned that the investments Kennedy has in mind are wrongheaded, and that the loss of valuable programs and rising stigma could have a damaging impact with long-ranging consequences. 
If you’ve met one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism
Emma, who is 28, was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder when she was in seventh grade. Before that, her mom Pamela had gotten Emma help with hearing deficits and speech issues, obstacles with readily apparent remedies. When Emma was finally diagnosed with autism, Pamela was initially devastated; she knew it was a lifelong condition.

“But in the long run, I can’t imagine it any other way — she’s such a gift,” Pamela said. 
That’s part of why Kennedy’s speech stung: he was presenting autism as a scourge. And for Pamela, that couldn’t be further from the truth. 
“I think it’s so important to understand that in Emma’s world, her family, the people around her, we feel so lucky to have her in our lives,” Pamela said.
“I think that autistic people are just people,” Emma said. “I think they shouldn’t be treated like abominations.”
That’s not to say that the journey has been easy for the McKeevers. Emma has some symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and some facial and vocal tics, which she says can make certain situations “a bit awkward.” Pamela is most concerned about Emma’s awareness of what’s going on around her and how that impedes her ability to connect with others. 
“I think that that would be the No. 1 thing I would say that I’m worried about sometimes, is that she’s not in the moment.” 
But to say that Emma is representative of the ASD community is to misunderstand the nature of the spectrum. 
There’s a popular quote from Dr. Stephen Shore, a professor who studies autism: “If you’ve met one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism.” It means the spectrum is wide, and the condition is highly individual. That’s partly because, unlike a condition with a clear genetic marker like Down Syndrome or trisomy 18, ASD encompasses a wide range of conditions that share some characteristics. 
“This category that we call autism is a category based on clinician description of behavior, not on biology,” said Dr. James McPartland, who directs both the Yale Developmental Disabilities Clinic and the Yale Center for Brain and Mind Health. Diagnosticians have historically determined whether a person has autism not by looking at results they can see through a microscope or on a scan, but by observing and testing their behavior — including communication style and sensory sensitivities, he said. 
McPartland is one of many scientists in the U.S. and around the world working to develop brain imaging techniques that might be able to more accurately differentiate between different types of autism in ways that could be useful for recommending therapies or even predicting a person’s long-term likelihood of accomplishing different milestones, like living independently.

For Beth Katten, whose son Gary recently turned 30, Kennedy’s speech didn’t offend. Gary has what Katten terms “profound autism,” or the end of the spectrum at which people require the most assistance with tasks. (ASD is also clinically classified by levels, ranging from Level 1, which requires the least support, to Level 3, which requires the most support.) Gary doesn’t have much social speech, so Katten said she can’t have a meaningful conversation with him. 
Gary can’t cook by himself or be left alone, and that meant Katten had to leave the workforce when he was young. Now, Gary has a caretaker for part of the day, but the question of what will happen when Katten and her husband are gone haunts her. 
Katten has done a lot of research over the years into the causes of autism, and when she heard Kennedy’s speech she was dismissive of some of his ideas, but she also welcomed the renewed burst of attention to the issue from such a high ranking government official. 
She also was hopeful about Kennedy’s effort to look for a cause for people with profound autism — something Kennedy announced would happen by the fall, an extraordinary timeline. “People in the profound community were saying, ‘He’s shedding light on it, and you know what, he’s talking about my kid. He’s not talking about the ones on ‘Love on the Spectrum,’” the popular Netflix reality series. “I can’t even watch that show because it’s too much the other way.” 
Helen Taylor, whose son Chase has ASD, was deeply concerned about Kennedy’s remarks, in part because she thought what she heard revealed a person ignorant of the community’s wants and needs. As the founder of a Waterbury-based nonprofit called The Social Chase, which helps young people on the spectrum find social opportunities, Taylor has a lot of experience with the breadth of the spectrum.  
“To make it seem like, ‘How horrible it is to have a child you were given’ — it was egregious,” she said. “Some parents who have an adult child, who are still diapering their child and have to wash them up, do they want a cure? Yes, they do. Some have a child who is high functioning, and do they want a cure for that child? No.”

For some families, getting to acceptance has been a hard won battle. Anita Cella had her son Nick in 2001 and she noticed that he was completing his milestones later than his older siblings. “​​I kind of had to figure it out on my own, because pediatricians didn’t give a screening or anything,” she said.
Nick started with interventions from a speech therapist before seeing a neurologist who told Cella he likely had autism. At first, Cella was angry, and the doctor told her she should seek a second opinion. 
“I followed up with another neurologist who, in no short order, told me Nick probably should, because of all his disabilities, be in an institution,” Cella recalled. “I mean, it was really a horrible time.” Finally, Cella found a developmental pediatrician who was more optimistic. “She’s like, ‘He’s in there. We’ll find him.’”

Today, Nick is an accomplished musician and performer. He earned his high school diploma and he’s planning to move to Florida to live with his brother and work at the gym that his brother owns. 
Nick taught himself to play the piano by ear, and he shares videos of himself playing on TikTok. His account, @nickcellamusic, is called Autistic Piano Prodigy. For Nick, the line of Kennedy’s press conference that stuck out in his mind was the assertion that autism destroys families. 
“In my opinion, that’s really false, because people who have autism, it’s not about what you have, it’s who you are on the inside, no matter what anyone says,” he said. “Like anyone who has any kind of ability, if you have Down syndrome or whatever they have, they have gifts for what they can achieve in life.”

‘Why track autistic people?’  
Taylor’s concerns about Kennedy’s rhetoric center on his announcement on May 7, a few weeks after his speech, that he would create a “real world platform” that would use insurance claims, medical records from Medicare and Medicaid and even smart watches to search for root causes of autism. 
“I don’t understand. Why track autistic people? What is the point?” Taylor said. “What are they going to do with the data? Now are we gonna have a cancer registry, an Alzheimer’s registry, a Black registry? Are you gonna have a reporter registry? That’s probably next, right? Usually when they have registries, I haven’t seen them do anything positive with it.”
Emma and her mom Pamela are also worried about the database.
“To pull out this particular group of people and really threaten that there is going to be this national database feels like such a violation of their privacy. It’s so disrespectful. There are times I think back and worry, and I wish we didn’t have this diagnosis attached to her. It’s really been stressing me out, just the thought of this database,” Pamela said. 
Kennedy says the database will help researchers quickly determine an environmental cause for autism. But according to McPartland, there is already a large database that provides researchers with information about people with ASD. That information is anonymized, and participants have to give permission for their data to be included at all. Kennedy’s announcement raises questions about how a new database would work and whether people would be able to opt out. 
Currently, it’s against the law to share medical data without a patient’s consent.
“These are things that are laws, and so the presumption is that the same laws would govern everything,” McPartland said. 
Dr. Marianne Barton, who directs the Psychological Services Clinic at the University of Connecticut, focuses primarily on identifying children with autism as early as possible in childhood. 
“What matters is people are more tuned in to this earlier. That means that children can get identified and get evaluated earlier and get intervention services earlier,” Barton said. 
In her research, Barton has followed people with ASD over a decade or two who received interventions early on. 
“We have a number of children that we identified years ago who no longer meet criteria for the diagnosis because they got intensive early intervention, and now they are functioning indistinguishable from other developing teenagers,” Barton said. 
Kennedy has insisted, including in his April speech, that there are many more incidences of autism, especially profound autism, and criticized the public and the media for attributing the rise in autism numbers to improvements in diagnosis. 
“We need to move away from … this ideology, that the autism prevalence increases, the relentless increases, are simply artifacts of better diagnoses, better recognition, or changing diagnostic criteria,” Kennedy said.
Barton, who has focused much of her work at UConn on diagnosis, said the rise in autism cases can be attributed to three components. The first is the change in how the American Psychiatric Association defines autism, particularly in 2013 when their manual did away with subcategories like Asperger’s syndrome and a group of pervasive developmental disorders and instead categorized all of these as “autism,” raising the overall number substantially. 
“It’s not the case that the majority of individuals with autism are nonfunctional, can’t support themselves, can’t hold jobs. In fact, the majority of individuals with autism, and these numbers are increasing, are very high-functioning, and that’s because of the changes in the diagnostic system,” Barton said. 
The autism community has gone to great efforts to decrease stigma to make autism a more visible and accepted kind of diagnosis, and that is, undoubtedly, contributing to the rise as well.Marianne Barton, of the Psychological Services Clinic at Uconn
Increased diagnosis has also played an important role in the rising numbers, which Barton says is a good thing. 
“Fifty percent of pediatricians are now screening for autism in toddlers, which means that we can find kids earlier and get them effective intervention. It means we are finding many, many more kids because we’re systematically looking for them,” Barton said. 
Finally, increased numbers can be attributed to improved awareness, she said. 
“The autism community has gone to great efforts to decrease stigma to make autism a more visible and accepted kind of diagnosis, and that is, undoubtedly, contributing to the rise as well.”
The elephant in the room 
Experts are worried about the potential resurgence of stigma, but Walter Glomb, the executive director of the Connecticut State Council on Developmental Disabilities, said there’s a less visible piece of the Trump administration’s actions that is likely more consequential: cuts to already anemic services for people with ASD.   
“The elephant in the room is the shortage of services and support for people with autism generally, which existed before,” Glomb said. That includes a yearslong wait list for autism services for adults in Connecticut. “My concern is: what’s the material impact of not just this rhetoric, but of the actual budget and program decisions that they’re going to make to get people services? Because we’re already behind the curve.” 
The Trump administration eliminated the Administration for Community Living in March, one of many programs cut by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which had served the elderly and disabled.
But the impact on other resources, from block grants to employment programs for people with disabilities, is still unclear, Glomb said. 
“We’re still waiting for the dust to settle, right? What they’re going to do to Medicaid and the community services types of programs, we don’t know yet,” Glomb said. 
Initial budget requests from President Donald Trump to Congress released last week show that some programs that benefit people with autism may be retained, which had Glomb feeling slightly more optimistic. But he said he was still uncertain how that budget would reconcile with the budget set by Congress.
Even before the budget becomes clear, Glomb said, there’s evidence that Kennedy’s rhetoric and moves by Congress are causing tremendous anxiety. After Kennedy’s speech, Glomb received phone calls from people in the autism community, and he recalled one from the mother of a man in his 20s who had read about Kennedy’s speech. 
“He got very upset — and some individuals on the spectrum, when they get very upset, there’s physical acting out. It’s a bad thing. When he saw the registry, he immediately assumed they were going to be tracking him. That this wasn’t about compiling data, it’s about going after those people. ‘Let’s keep an eye on people with autism.’” 
Like Glomb, Barton is concerned that there may be many more Trump administration cuts that impact people with autism. They range from the possibility that hundreds of millions of dollars from the Department of Education — much of it for special education — will be cut, to already announced cuts to grants for neurodivergent students who process information differently, which had been funded by the National Science Foundation, to cuts to autism research that had been funded by the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health. 
Scores of vaccine-related research projects were also terminated, according to data collected by Grant Watch, as has work that would have studied how early intervention can best be used to benefit young children with ASD. 
“This doesn’t even consider cuts to Medicaid, which will greatly reduce access to services,” Barton said. If that happens, she expects longer wait times for evaluations and higher costs that will disproportionately impact minority and under-resourced communities the most. “It’s not good.”
Dr. Lauren Herlihy, director of autism psychology at the Hospital for Special Care in New Britain, said that she is seeing a renewed skepticism in vaccines among patients, and is deeply concerned about the implications of fewer children getting vaccinated.
Recently, we have seen families saying, ‘I don’t want you to release this to the school. I don’t want to be on some registry of people with autism.Dr. Marianne Barton, director of Psychological Services Clinic at Uconn
“It’s kind of come back in vogue to be concerned about vaccines and autism, and as someone who diagnoses autism in young children, but in folks of all ages, there are very unfortunate situations where a child has not had any of their childhood vaccinations and they can’t get access to school programs through the public school system,” Herlihy said. In Connecticut, vaccinations are mandatory for public school attendance. 
Herlihy has seen patients who were not vaccinated and “then, they are diagnosed with autism anyway, because vaccines do not cause autism,” she said. “That to me is a major public health concern, and it puts a child at risk for some very significant medical complications related to preventable childhood illness. No patient that I’ve ever had has died from having autism, but children have died from preventable disease before vaccination.”
As to Kennedy’s claim that the database will enable researchers to pinpoint an environmental cause of autism within months, Barton said plenty of research has already been done. While many biological markers have been identified and some studies show toxins can increase the likelihood of autism in isolated circumstances, “we’re not going to find a smoking gun that is going to explain the incidence of autism. And it’s certainly not going to be vaccines.”
Barton spends a lot of time talking to parents and even adults as they embark on an autism diagnosis, which can be difficult news to hear, like it was for Pamela McKeever. But over decades of scientific and therapeutic progress and efforts to reduce stigma, the diagnosis is now greeted with relief by many families. 
Suddenly, a parent struggling to find a way to help a child through a behavioral issue, a sleep disorder or a learning challenge might have a new paradigm that allows them to access tools and therapies that can actually help. “They understand why things have been so difficult,” Barton said. 
But in the past few months, something has changed again. 
“Recently, we have seen families saying, ‘I don’t want you to release this to the school. I don’t want to be on some registry of people with autism,’” she said.
Parents who don’t want the diagnosis to be public have asked Barton’s clinic to write a report that explains what the child needs and recommendations for treatment without discussing a diagnosis of autism. 
“They are much more concerned about sharing this information,” Barton said. “That’s a direct effect of the current administration.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AUTISM-IMPACT-0520-SR-14-1024x728.jpg,,,2025-06-15 06:00:18.298691

But even with electric rates dropping this summer, it’s important to remember that when the mercury climbs, energy usage typically does too—and that’s what can cause your bill to spike.
Think of it this way: if you buy more groceries, you’d expect to pay more at checkout. If you drive your car more often than usual, you’d expect to pay more in gasoline. The more you use, the more you pay, and your energy bill is no different, as most of it is based on usage. In Connecticut, the average residential customer uses about 35% more electricity to keep cool during the summer months. Last year, due to a record-breaking summer with multiple heat waves, that increase was even greater, and customers certainly saw the change reflected in their energy bills.
While the significant increase to the Public Benefits portion of the bill in July 2024 was one of the factors that led to higher bills last summer, usage was the number-one reason for the dramatic surge customers saw. If a homeowner used the exact same amount of energy from June to July last year (approximately 700 kWh on average), their Eversource electric bill would have increased by about $8. Even though Public Benefits increased, and Standard Service (the supply rate Eversource purchased from power generators for customers) decreased substantially at the same time, many of us saw an increase far larger than $8 on our summer bills—because of higher usage.
But those are last year’s numbers. What can you expect this year? There are two rate decreases happening. The first started May 1 with the Public Benefits portion of the bill going down. An average Eversource residential customer saw their total bill decrease by approximately $13.50. Energy supply is also going down starting July 1 by about $10 for an average residential customer’s bill, but even with those two decreases, you shouldn’t be surprised to see your bill go up this summer because of increased energy usage.
How much energy you use, and therefore how much your total bill will be, depends on several factors, and weather is a big one. If blistering hot days dominate the summer months, your usage will naturally increase. Even if you keep your thermostat set at the same temperature, on a 95-degree day your system works much harder to keep your home or business cool compared to a 75-degree day, which means your usage has increased.
This may leave you wondering: is there anything I can do to help keep costs down this summer? The answer is yes. Customers can take advantage of energy efficiency measures and programs because it all adds up and makes a difference for your bottom line. Setting your thermostat one degree higher can mean your air conditioner is using one to three percent less electricity. Turning on your major appliances, like dryers and dishwashers, in the morning or late evening hours means you’re not adding heat to your home during the hottest parts of the day. Switching to LEDs means your lights are running cooler and, as a bonus, last a lot longer than incandescent lights. For the windows that get a lot of sunlight shining in, closing the blinds will also help keep your home cooler. In addition, we offer a variety of energy efficiency programs that can help lower your usage and save money on certain products, as well as financial assistance and payment plans that can help you manage your monthly bills. 
We all want to stay cool during the summer months, but that doesn’t mean you can’t stay on budget too. We hope that by sharing these tips, tools, and information about the many solutions available to our customers, we can help you accomplish both.

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)What’s behind the mask?
If you’ve seen news footage of federal immigration raids — and really, who can avoid it these days? — you may have noted how many of the agents doing the raiding are wearing masks.
More often than not, ICE agents have their faces covered with neck gaiters or balaclavas as if they were on a covert mission in Beirut. They’re outfitted in military kit as well, from tactical vests to sidearms in drop leg holsters, which all looks a bit weird when worn over T-shirts and blue jeans. But I suppose they might be going for a kind of undercover cowboy look.
But the image the masked agents convey, more than any other, is secret police.
It’s a distinctly un-American look, one that is likely to terrify the migrants being sought for deportation and just about everybody else who witnesses an ICE arrest. There might be reasons for agents to don masks when pursuing international criminals in the crime-infested back alleys of some movie Gotham, but we’re talking raids on a meatpacking plant in Omaha, a Home Depot parking lot in California, a Mexican restaurant in Kansas City. It’s part of the recent Trump administration push to deport 3,000 migrants a day.
When I heard of that quota I couldn’t help but connect it to the 3,000 deaths per day from COVID-19 at the height of the pandemic, in December 2020. It might be a coincidence, but the pandemic was the last time masks were such a cultural flash point, with conservatives fighting mask mandates as an assault on personal freedom.
Civilians wear masks as well, from anti-police protestors in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, to the white supremacist Patriot Front, which marched last month at the Liberty Memorial. Some people still wear pandemic-era masks to protect themselves from the flu and other communicable diseases. But ICE agents and law enforcement officers operating on American streets should not.
Like most of us, I had limited experience with masks before 2020.
My strongest memory of wearing a mask was when I was a kid, not yet 10 years old, waiting for Halloween to come so I could wear the scratchy plastic Superman mask with the elastic strap that invariably would snap back and sting my neck. The dime store costume was uncomfortable, just a printed plastic sheet, and that damned mask was sweaty even though it was cold outside. But there was a thrill to being somebody else for a while, to being anonymous and demanding tribute of strangers, of running up and down the streets of Baxter Springs with a paper grocery bag filled with loot.
Masks are, of course, subversive. Children know this, as do grown-up Mardi Gras revelers, bank robbers and other outlaws, Ku Klux Klan members, and the creators of comic books. According to Nobel-winning Bulgarian writer Elias Canetti, in his 1960 book “Crowds and Power,” masks are fixed and the things they represent can never change.
“It is a conclusion,” Canetti wrote. “Once the mask is in position there can be no more beginnings, no groping towards something new. The mask is clear-cut; it expresses something which is quite definite, and neither more nor less than this.” 
Everything behind the mask is mysterious, according to Canetti.
“Above all it separates,” Canetti noted. “Charged with a menace which must not be precisely known — one element of which, indeed, is the fact that it cannot be known — it comes close to the spectator, but, in spite of this proximity, remains clearly separated from him. It threatens him with the secret dammed up behind it. Unlike a face, there are no passing changes in it which can be interpreted, and so he suspects and fears the unknown that it conceals.”
In other words, it intimidates. It’s why ICE and other immigration agents have adopted the mask as an unofficial part of their uniform, not for protection but for the fear it provokes. Others in the public sphere — teachers, election officers, federal judges — haven’t resorted to hiding their faces. That’s because those professions rely on the public trust, and that’s difficult to achieve when you’re covering your face, as if in shame.
For years, there’s been a dangerous blurring of the line between law enforcement and the military. Increasingly our cops look less like they belong in Mayberry and more like they’re ready for a combat zone, with assault rifles, helmets, and mine-resistant armored vehicles. Military gear has been flowing from the federal government to state and local agencies for decades, shaping tactics and influencing culture. Federal law prohibits the military from being deployed on American soil for law enforcement duties, but so many cops resemble soldiers now that it’s difficult to tell one from the other. Immigration agents wearing masks and boiling out of unmarked vehicles just makes the situation worse.

Despite politicians who try to scare us into believing there’s an epidemic of crime in our cities, statistics show violent and property offenses have plunged since the 1990s. Instead of endangering us, most migrants are working in slaughterhouses, bussing tables, and cleaning motel rooms. You know, the kinds of jobs many Americans just don’t want. Mass deportations could trigger serious economic consequences, from higher housing prices to a shrinking economy.
In addition to the economic threat, Trump’s war on migrants also poses dangers to American democracy. The speed and manner of the deportations are limiting migrants’ access to legal representation and due process, something I wrote about a few columns back. This might not seem like a problem if you’re not a migrant at risk of deportation, but the erosion of due process won’t stop with immigration enforcement. Like a cancer, it will spread to other areas of our justice system.
Another danger has emerged with the recent immigration raids and protests in Los Angeles, and the Trump administration calling out nearly five thousand National Guard troops and U.S. Marines in response. Remember the federal law that generally forbids the use of the military in civilian law enforcement roles? It’s called the Posse Comitatus Act. The last time the act was suspended and a state’s National Guard was federalized over the wishes of its governor was in Alabama in 1968, when Lyndon Johnson invoked the Insurrection Act to enforce federal law and protect civil rights marchers. Trump has not cited the Insurrection Act, however, and his deployment of 700 Marines to Los Angeles to quell recent immigration enforcement protests adds to our growing constitutional confusion.
The difference between 1968 and today is that Johnson was acting to ensure the safety of civil rights protestors, which Gov. George Wallace refused to guarantee. Now, Trump has federalized the National Guard over the objections of California and called up the Marines not so much to restore order in Los Angeles — the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, despite some oft-repeated footage of Johnny Cabs on fire — but to add players to his chaotic immigration enforcement theater. It’s about the spectacle of power, the demonstration of force, and pushing the narrative of blue states as sanctuaries of anarchy.
The law-and-order mask of the Trump administration disguises more than just an abuse of power. The face beneath the mask is itself grotesque, the kind of racist visage that looks kindly on white South African “refugees” but which has contempt for the lamp, the door, and the brown-skinned masses yearning to breathe free. It is the face of a felon 34 times over, that of a hypocrite who pleads law and order but pardons Jan. 6 insurrectionists, that of someone who dodged the Vietnam draft on a medical pretext but who lusts for massive military parades on his birthday.
Trump turned 79 Saturday. The military spectacle of tanks and helicopters and thousands of troops — ostensibly to celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday — was estimated to have cost up to $45 million. It was an obscene waste of money, especially at a time when Veterans Administration cuts are forcing “crisis” staffing levels.
We always knew what was behind Trump’s mask. But just enough of us suspended our distrust to put him back in office. Trump is the Exxon Valdez of politics, the Typhoid Mary of bad ideas, the patron saint of the grift.

The masked federal agents enforcing Trump’s immigration agenda are a symptom not just of Trump’s political pathology, but of ours. I’m not talking about any bogus buzz phrase like “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — the only one truly deranged here is Trump himself — but of our collective political inability to recognize objective reality. It is so much easier to cast Trump as the agent of our misfortune than to address the conditions that allowed for his rise. Citizens United, for example, gave the wealthy nearly unlimited political influence and the Tea Party movement planted the seeds of today’s psycho populism. We tell pollsters the economy is the top issue but elect candidates who make our lives, fiscal and otherwise, worse.
“The oppressed,” wrote Paulo Freire, the Brazilian educator and philosopher, “having internalized the image of the oppressor and adopted his guidelines, are fearful of freedom. Freedom would require them to eject this image and replace it with autonomy and responsibility.”
Masks are fine for Halloween and Mardi Gras, but they are a poor substitute for self knowledge. I no longer want to be Superman, or any of the pop figures I’ve worshipped in the years since that sweaty and greedy Halloween, but I long now to be myself.
I long for America to be itself.
We must remove our own masks and contemplate the living, hopeful, and changeable human faces beneath. We share the same basic needs — economic security, access to affordable health care, a sense of belonging, meaningful endeavor — and yet we have a remarkable capacity for uniquely expressing those desires. I sometimes fall into the trap of thinking nothing we can do individually will make a difference, yet I forget that collectively we are America, that for good or ill the choices are ours. We can give up. Or we can work together for a better tomorrow.
But first, we must all drop the masks.

Here’s my list of overnight travel options, from worst to first:


DRIVING ALL NIGHT: In my carefree youth I once drove all night from Chicago to New York City.  Tired and wired (on a lot of coffee) I encountered no traffic and made really good time, but arrived exhausted.  Not a good option… and probably not safe.
SLEEPING IN THE AIRPORT: This one doesn’t really count, as you’re not really traveling.  And those not-so-comfy chairs at the gate don’t really allow much sleep.
The good news is that many airports (ATL, DFW, JFK) now offer Minute Suites with daybeds and showers. You can book them for an hour ($48) or for an eight-hour overnight ($175).
SLEEPING ON THE PLANE: It’s not by chance that overnight flights are called “red eyes.”  Sure, flying overnight is fast, but if you’re sitting in coach on a crowded plane, good luck with any shut-eye.  This is why I hate flying to Europe.  You arrive jet lagged, in a different time zone and anxious to just sleep, not go sight-seeing.
Now, if you’re in business class, rest is possible… at a price.  And if money is no object, there are ultra-luxe accommodations like on Air France’s La Premiere, a private suite ten-feet square with three-star gourmet meals curated by Michelin-starred chefs, served on porcelain with Christofle cutlery… and a full bed.  Roundtrip fare JFK-Paris, about $20,000.
TAKING THE BUS: “Riding the dog” (Greyhound) is not my idea of fun anytime, but there are some private companies re-thinking bus travel with much comfier accommodations. In Texas, Vonlane offers “luxury motor coaches” with business class seating.  Similar service between New York City and Washington, D.C. is offered by private carriers, but not on the overnights.
TRAVEL BY SHIP:  Alas, not many options here aside from cruising or crossing the Atlantic.  But in the old days, there were steamboats plying the waters between Hartford and New York City.  As I wrote a few months back, the 14-18 hour journey had both “deck class” and cabin class accommodations.
TRAVEL BY TRAIN: Not surprising that this is my favorite option.  But as with flying, if you’re stuck in coach class your slumber may be less than optional.  Amtrak offers bedrooms… from Roomettes to Bedroom Suites… but they’re always booked weeks in advance and are far too expensive.

There are several start-ups looking to offer much nicer (and affordable) sleeping cars, like Dreamstar which hopes to launch next year between San Francisco and Los Angeles.  And Lunatrain, running New York City to Atlanta and Chicago.
We’ll have to see if either company is successful in its launch, modeled after the highly popular NightJet train service you’ll find throughout Europe. Even in Japan, the country that launched true high-speed rail 50 years ago, there are sleeper trains offering everything from cabins to tatami mats.
So, as you plan your summer travels, check out these options.  You’ll save on hotel rooms and maybe have an adventure!",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/driving-overnight.jpg,,,2025-06-15 04:56:49.021281

Signs and speeches from community advocates condemned the Trump administration as overreaching its power and authority, and called for protecting democracy and equal rights, including for immigrant and transgender communities. The crowd then marched along L Street to the Delaney Park Strip for an afternoon Juneteenth celebration. 
“People are really, really scared, and I think their fear has turned into action,” said Erin Jackson-Hill, an organizer and executive director of Stand Up Alaska, a nonprofit social justice organization. 
“In Alaska especially, we really hold on to our freedoms and our independence, and we’re not gonna bow down to a king,” she said. “And so the ‘No Kings’ march is a way to stand up and say, ‘We don’t have kings in this country, we don’t want a king!’ The country got founded because we didn’t want a king. And we certainly don’t want Donald Trump to be the king.” 
More than 2,000 No Kings protest events were planned on Saturday nationwide. Social media posts show No Kings rallies in at least 24 Alaska communities from Ketchikan to Seldovia to Bethel and a single protester in the village of Emmonak on the Yukon River holding a sign reading “No Kings, only salmon.”
Several protest participants spoke with the Alaska Beacon after events wrapped up on Saturday afternoon, and expressed appreciation for Alaskans showing up to demonstrate and denounce Trump.

In Nome, several dozen people demonstrated under the iconic Burled Arch and finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog race. “We have no place for a monarchy or any king-type of government and you know, people wanted to make their voices heard,” said Hannah Anderson, a participant and 50-year resident of Nome. She said it was especially great to see that sentiment echoed on social media posts from across rural Alaska. 
“Because living off the road system in Alaska, it’s kind of easy to feel forgotten or feel kind of alone out here,” she said. “And by seeing other people expressing their view and opinion is important, and pretty nice.”
In Homer, a large crowd rallied downtown, in one of the biggest protests seen by Ron Keffer, a retired educator and participant. “There was a really big turnout today,” he said, estimating the crowd at well above 1,000.
“I’m not afraid at this moment,” he added. “I think this is a moment when this country has had to examine itself, and it’s found some rotten spots in the apple, some really rotten spots. We have some very unlovely tendencies amongst some parts of our country, more than we realize: the racism, the misogyny, … the antagonism toward immigrants, which is our lifeblood. So it’s a big reckoning. And it’s going to make us better. It won’t feel good for a while. It’s kind of like surgery, it doesn’t feel good for a while, but the outcome is going to be good in the long run.”
In Palmer, where a few hundred people rallied, safety for demonstrators was the top priority, said Dave Musgrave, an organizer with the activist group Mat-Su United for Progress. He said the group came prepared after there were threats on social media of armed counterprotesters. 
“We had 30 peacekeepers who had de-escalation training. We were walking the sidewalks making sure everybody knew what their de-escalation techniques were,” he said. “And guess what? The counterprotesters really didn’t show up in force, in spite of what they put all over social media. So we stood strong and resolute, but we were all very peaceful.”
He said there were about eight counterprotesters there that organizers spoke with amicably, and there was no disruption. “We had beyond just our grannies and grandpas,” he added. “We had some great-grannies and great-grandpas too. But we also had a lot of young people show up, and it was great to see them out there too, fighting for their community and fighting against authoritarianism.”
Well above 1,000 people rallied under rare sunny skies in Juneau, according to organizers there, with a small group of counterprotesters nearby.
Organizers say protests are ongoing, with some groups holding weekly demonstrations, and say they will continue to make their voices heard protesting the Trump administration.

(Courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OMAHA — The bulk of the nearly 80 workers detained in a high-profile June 10 immigration raid at a food plant in Omaha are at the Lincoln County Jail in North Platte, according to a Saturday update from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
More than 60 are at the Lincoln County facility pending further proceedings, a statement said.
Three Mexican natives here without proper legal status signed paperwork to voluntarily return to their home country.
Three workers from Guatemala were transferred to Alexandria, Louisiana, in preparation for their removal from the country. Among them, one has a final order of removal that had been issued in 2019, one has been removed from the country on four previous occasions and another has three DUIs and one illegal reentry conviction, according to an ICE statement.
Mark Zito, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Kansas City, a jurisdiction that covers Omaha, again pushed back on what he called a false narrative — that “these are just hardworking immigrants looking for the American dream.” 
Zito called that “ludicrous.”
“These crimes have lasting effects,” he said, saying the “real victims” may be left to deal with years of frustration trying to restore their identities.
ICE has said the raid at Glenn Valley Foods was predicated on the suspicion that many workers at the plant used stolen or fraudulent identification to gain employment.
The raid was highly publicized, as federal officials also allowed a national news outlet into the plant to video it. 
The raid set off several anti-ICE and Trump administration protests in Omaha, including one Friday near the NCAA men’s College World Series. Organizers of that march and rally, which drew several hundred people, wanted a national backdrop to let their message be heard.
Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa “No Kings” rallies and others across the country protested what they call authoritarian overreach by the Trump administration.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Across Maine and coast-to-coast, people took to the streets on Saturday for a day of action condemning the actions of President Donald Trump, who spent the day celebrating his 79th birthday with a multi-million dollar military parade in Washington, D.C..
More than three dozen “No Kings” events were organized across the state, in small towns and big cities, where thousands turned out to march. 
Starting the day in York, U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree handed out red roses to marchers. 
“People are angry, they want to know what to do, want to do something, they want to fight back,” she said. 
Eighty-eight year old Roberta Herschberg, who said she spent every summer of her life in York, joked about her age, saying, “Personally I’ve been fighting kings since 1775.”
Lyman resident Craig Carscallen was among the crowd lining Main Street in Kennebunk. He said he hopes the widespread protests “influences our elected officials, if they want to get reelected”. 
An estimated 3,000 people rallied outside the State House in Augusta, according to the Press Herald, and in Portland, another 3,000 rallied in Monument Square and Lincoln Park.
Protesters rallied at more than 1,500 sites across the country as of mid-afternoon, according to No Kings national organizers. Many focused on the Trump administration’s aggressive expansion of immigration raids and enforcement, including the deployment of troops to Los Angeles in defiance of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom. 
The day of action was colored by the killing of a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband, who were assassinated in their home in an “act of political violence,” according to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Trump is seeking to militarize the approach of the more than half a million sworn police officers charged with protecting and serving communities across the country.  
The post Making war in US communities: Trump executive order on policing threatens to set public safety back decades   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","PRESIDENT TRUMP’S reckless order to deploy National Guard and Marine forces to Los Angeles, where protests recently broke out over ICE arrests of immigrants, has rightly drawn indignation as well as legal challenge. His unilateral decision to send military personnel into a US city, bypassing the role of the state’s governor in authorizing use of the National Guard, is the latest sign of the creeping authoritarianism taking hold in Trump’s second term.  
But another Trump initiative ostensibly concerned with public safety is ultimately even more troubling than his effort to have military personnel — trained for warfare — deployed to handle domestic law enforcement. Trump is also seeking to militarize the approach of the more than half a million sworn police officers charged with protecting and serving communities across the country every day.  
Amid the nonstop flurry of executive orders Trump has issued since returning to the White House is one related to policing that has received scant attention. It should set off alarms among everyone, starting with dedicated police officers themselves, who is committed to public safety and best practices in law enforcement.  
In the 879-word executive order, issued in late April, Trump practically previewed his recent deployment of military personnel to Los Angeles. The order, titled “Strengthening and Unleashing America’s Law Enforcement to Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens,” is rooted in Project 2025, the omnibus plan of the radical right, published by The Heritage Foundation and aimed at remaking American government and society. 
The executive order calls for a militarized police service in the US, one that essentially operates under martial law. In the order, Trump says the attorney general and secretary of defense, working in consultation with the secretary of homeland security and other agencies, “shall increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement.” It calls on the attorney general and defense secretary to “determine how military and national security assets, training, non-lethal capabilities, and personnel can most effectively be utilized to prevent crime.”  
It further calls on the attorney general to “take all appropriate action to create a mechanism to provide legal resources and indemnification to law enforcement officers who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law. This mechanism shall include the use of private-sector pro bono assistance for such law enforcement officers.” (So, we now know one of the “causes” the Trump administration intends to assign to the high-priced law firms they pressured into offering free legal services.) 
Perhaps most troubling is the order’s effort to undo the crucial role the federal government has played in monitoring troubled local police departments. It orders the attorney general to review, within 60 days, all ongoing consent decrees, a key instrument used by the Department of Justice to remedy systemic civil rights violations in individual police departments, and to “modify, rescind, or move to conclude such measures that unduly impede the performance of law enforcement functions.”  
Far from fulfilling his vow to make a positive difference for public safety, Trump’s order would wipe out four decades of crime-reduction strategies and improvements in the overall quality of policing in US communities. During that time, we have seen dramatic reductions in violent crime across the country. The president bases his actions on the falsehood he continually repeats that crime is escalating in America’s neighborhoods. He portrays US cities, especially those in blue states, as post-apocalyptic, violent fantasy lands. (Historically, violent crime has been highest in the very red South.) 
Many people in public life, including police themselves, have used martial terms as either metaphors or descriptors, however inapt, in discussing policing. For decades we have claimed to be waging a “war on crime,” while simultaneously carrying out a “war on drugs.” Yet, as the late policing scholar George Kelling told me, “so-called ‘crime-fighting’ failed completely to reduce crime, the outcome it promised.” Indeed, crime and martial rhetoric rose in tandem with one another from the 1950s into the late 1990s.  
But the Trump strategy aims to take all the war talk into a new realm, seeking to transform American police departments into something that more closely resembles armed forces units patrolling our neighborhoods.  
The tone and language of the order are angry and threatening. “Unleashing” suggests officers snarling and growling at suspects, necks strained against the leash of what it says are “‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ initiatives that restrict law enforcement activity or endanger citizens.” In the order, the president calls on officers to police more “aggressively,” “tenaciously,” and “firmly,” the clear message being that they should be unchecked by laws and left-wingers. Departments are to be provided war-making equipment and supported in their military approach by undefined “surge resources.”  
The order’s talk of “indemnification” for police threatens local and state elected officials for what the president sees as unfair treatment of police personnel accused of violating laws and procedures. In his telling, officers under investigation for any sort of alleged misconduct or wrongdoing are ipso facto the victims, “wrongly accused and abused by State or local officials.” 
One can readily insert the terms “Massachusetts” and “Boston” into the executive order where he directs the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute state and local officials who, in the view of Trump’s Justice Department, are interfering in some way with law enforcement.  
The order to rescind federal consent decrees overseeing police departments is a grave disservice to, and indeed a threat to the safety of, the hundreds of thousands of good cops who show up each day and night trying to do the right thing. The progress we have made, in Massachusetts and across the country, in operating departments that are responsive to and respectful of the communities they serve is rooted in a commitment to community-police collaboration. Pitting police and communities against one another makes everyone less safe. 
The subject and language of presidential pronouncements are always highly consequential. When it comes to the subject of policing, we have firsthand experience of that in Boston.  
When President Clinton visited Boston in 1997 to highlight the city’s efforts – based on strong police-community collaboration — to reduce youth firearm violence, he said he wanted to “give every community the tools that you have used to make your city safe again so that we can do it everywhere in America.”  
That presidential attention spurred a change in public safety practice across the country, as formerly siloed operations evolved into today’s collaborations among police, clergy, probation officers, and many others. Under the current president’s executive order, these advances will be trampled underfoot by reducing the comprehensive approach to public safety to a single tactic: aggressive enforcement by police, shoulder to shoulder with armed forces units. 
Trump’s words appear designed to remake our understanding of what actually works to reduce and prevent crime and harm in our communities. Decades of experience and research have demonstrated the value of collaborative prevention strategies involving police and many additional stakeholders. Collaboration confers legitimacy, making police more effective, especially in communities with historically poor relationships with law enforcement.  
This call for aggression may have its most immediate, dangerous impacts in the president’s bellicose approach to arresting and detaining undocumented immigrants, as in Los Angeles. ICE activity recently put Worcester police in the middle of a difficult situation, when rough tactics used by ICE agents in an action last month sparked a community backlash. The police had to arrest local citizens in order to protect ICE personnel from the community. More recently, Milford residents protested the arrest of high school student Marcelo Gomes da Silva on his way to volleyball practice. We can expect to see more community reactions of this kind as ICE continues its campaign.   
The great irony of Trump’s muscular call for militarized law and order is that he has long denigrated the very ideas about law and justice that helped to drive the American Revolution and the framing of much of the Massachusetts and US constitutions. He disparages the independent judiciary, attacks the sanctity of trial by a jury of one’s peers, and dismisses the presumption of innocence.  
The police service his order envisions could well be clad in redcoats, rounding up anyone who has displeased the king. As the Boston of the Adamses, Hancock, and Crispus Attucks sorely vexed George III, the Boston of Wu vexes the White House in our time.  
Trump has made an art form of pandering with his words to police officers’ genuine concerns about their safety, but then contradicting himself in deed. His pardon of people who attacked and led to the deaths of US Capitol Police officers on January 6, 2021, is only the most obvious example. More recently, he praises police in speeches for their great work, but sends in the armed forces to make up for their make-believe shortcomings in managing crime and disorder.  
The danger of all this is in the power of the bully pulpit. Falsehoods repeated often enough have a way of becoming not only perceived as facts, but the underpinning for reckless public policy. 
Jim Jordan is the retired director of strategic planning at the Boston Police Department. He has taught police strategy at Northeastern University, the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and in training settings around the country.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Thousands of Kansans rallied Saturday at the Statehouse in Topeka as part of a nationwide backlash to President Donald Trump, hoisting signs, joining in pro-democracy chants and speaking out against immigration raids.
Organizers for the “No Kings” rally repeatedly urged the crowd to remain peaceful as demonstrators filled the south lawn of the Statehouse grounds. A lively contingent on the edge of the rally shouted insults at a small pro-Trump gathering across the street, but the event was otherwise peaceful.
The rally featured speeches from advocates and candidates for office, including Kansas Sen. Cindy Holscher, an Overland Park Democrat who announced she is running for governor, and Christy Davis, a former federal rural development official who revealed she is exploring a run for U.S. Senate.
The crowd sang the national anthem and recited the Pledge of Allegiance, ending with an emphatic “for all.”
And the crowd cheered when Melissa Stiehler and Davis Hammet, prominent advocates for voting and LGBTQ+ rights, made a surprise brief appearance in formal wedding attire before leaving to get married elsewhere in town.

The Topeka rally was among protests all over the country to oppose the president’s plan for a military display in Washington, D.C., on his own birthday, as well as mass immigration arrests. Organizers said more than 5,000 people joined in the Topeka rally. Other rallies were held elsewhere in Kansas.
Mary Smith, of Geary County, held a sign that read: “Elect a rapist expect to be f***ed” and “Donny the quicker f***er upper.”
Smith said she had never protested anything before Trump’s second term in office but that she was concerned about “all the atrocities that Trump is trying to do to us.” She said she was especially concerned about the deportation tactics being used against immigrants.
“It’s getting a little ridiculous,” Smith said. “He’s only four and a half months into his presidency, and I’m afraid it’s gonna get worse from here.”

Lee Boyd, of Lawrence, said she rushed back from an unrelated event in Kalamazoo, Michigan, so she could get to the Topeka rally in time.
She grabbed a seat in the flower garden on the south lawn, holding a small sign that read, “Tax the rich.”
“I feel pretty strongly about this dictatorship that we’re under, and I also am quite concerned about the defunding of National Public Radio and PBS,” Boyd said.
Describing himself as an old hippie, Alan Schmidt, of Hoyt, sported a tie-dyed shirt and carried an upside down American flag.
“Our nation is in distress, and I want to be part of the voice that says this is not OK,” Schmidt said.
Schmidt was one of several people to display an upside-down flag, which caught the attention of the handful of men carrying pro-Trump signs across the street on the south edge of the rally. The men refused to provide their full names.

“I’ve never seen so many ignorant people in my life,” said a man who would only identify himself as Jeff. “Every one of those signs, there’s no facts at all on them. None. Period.”
Another man said: “If you’re just fake news, admit it and move on.”
At one point, a woman carrying two Mexican flags and one reading “F*** Trump” positioned herself directly in front of the men to block their view of the rally.
Meanwhile, a woman carrying a “Viva Trump” sign waded into the rally crowd, where several people physically shoved her and demanded she leave.
Some of the “No Kings” rally-goers taunted the pro-Trump demonstrators with shouts across the street:
“Why are there only five of you?”
“F*** you fascists.”

Back toward the Statehouse steps, Mac Farish, who was visiting from Portland, Oregon, held a large sign that read “we the people outnumber your cabinet 16,513,850 to 1” on one side and showed a picture of a cat toying with a king’s crown on the other side.
The number references the ratio of U.S. residents to the president’s advisers.
“There is so much wrong with what is happening,” she said, “and if I’m completely frank, I went to school to study public policy and political science, and I feel like my degree has completely been wasted because they washed away what I studied for four years.”
She said she spent more than $100,000 on her degree at the University of Alabama, “and all of a sudden the constitution doesn’t matter, nothing matters anymore.”
Farish said she felt joy to see so many people attend a “No Kings” rally in a red state.
“A lot of people here might be lifelong Republicans, but we’re standing here together because there is a line where tyranny shows up,” Farish said.
“It’s really not hard to love other people,” she added. “It’s really not hard to care.”

The protests took place on the same day as a military parade held in Washington D.C. on President Donald Trump’s birthday and the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army and in the wake of the Trump administration’s escalated response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions in Los Angeles. 
‘We will fight joyfully’: Thousands march through downtown Madison to protest Trump 
Thousands of people crowded into downtown Madison Saturday afternoon joining the nationwide “No Kings” protests against the administration of President Donald Trump. 
Protesters waved American flags right side up and upside down (a traditional signal of distress), as well as LGBTQ pride flags, Mexican flags and Ukrainian flags. Signs called for equality, criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement and  compared Trump to dictators of the past. The crowd included trapeze artists, people in drag, Madison protest regulars the “Raging Grannies,” a 15-foot Statue of Liberty puppet and U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia).

The protest started on UW-Madison’s east Campus Mall, where the Women’s March hosted a “kick out the clowns” event. There, Madison resident Amanda G., who declined to give her last name, did hand stands on the grass next to a sign stating “hand stand against facism.” 
“When people engage in a struggle against facism, you need calm, focus and concentration,” she said, adding that those same qualities  are required for holding a hand stand as long as she could. 
A nearby group of protesters performed a  skit featuring giant paper mache heads of Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin debating how to start a dictatorship before they were surrounded by about 15 dancers dressed like the Statue of Liberty. 
When  the protesters began marching from the campus toward the Capitol,  hundreds of people were still flowing in the opposite direction  down State Street.  The combined crowd came together and headed  up the street towards the Capitol as onlookers cheered from the sidewalks. 
Madison police observed the marchers as they gathered at the Capitol from a rooftop across the street.
Cindy Reilly, a Sun Prairie resident who had joined the crowd on the mall, watched and chanted from the patio of a State Street bar. Reilly said the budget bill currently being moved through Congress by Republicans was her biggest reason for protesting on Saturday, saying Republicans are defunding programs that help people who are struggling while funding rich people.

“It’s important for people to tell Trump and Republicans we don’t like what they’re doing,” she said.

When the crowd reached the Capitol square, Nick Ramos, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, emceed a series of performances and speeches.
“We will fight joyfully, we will fight peacefully, in these streets for our democracy” Ramos said.
Georgia Sen. Rafael Warnock, who was in Wisconsin to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s annual convention in the Wisconsin Dells this weekend, spoke from the protest stage and  highlighted the assassination of a Minnesota Democratic lawmaker Saturday morning, the deployment of U.S. troops against protesters in Los Angeles and the detainment of U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-California) at a Department of Homeland Security press conference this week. 
Warnock said that he often talks about the value of nonviolent protests, but it’s not protesters who are being violent. 
“I have said that to the activists,” Warnock said. “But somebody needs to say that to the Trump administration.”

Throughout the first six months of the Trump administration, people have regularly called for more forceful opposition from elected Democrats. Warnock acknowledged those calls, while saying it will take work from people inside and outside the halls of power to fight Trump’s unpopular policies. 
“People like you are asking people in positions like mine to speak up,” Warnock said. “I’m going to do that, but we must work on the outside and the inside.” 
Protests wrap around multiple city blocks in Milwaukee 
More than  12,000 people  marched in the No Kings Day protest in Milwaukee, packing  Cathedral Square Saturday afternoon. Elderly people and military veterans, parents with young children and Milwaukee residents of all ages  turned out to denounce what some event speakers described as a fascist and authoritarian Trump administration. 
Most of the crowd gathered on  the grass at the center of the square in front of  a large stage while  others stood off to the side in the  shade. Law enforcement kept a low key profile during the protest, helping direct traffic and watching from rooftops. Several drones flew over the crowd throughout the protest, including some which legal observers believed were operated by law enforcement due to their size, complexity and because they seemed to land on the rooftops occupied by police.

For nearly an hour, the crowd listened to a procession of speakers including  local activists, community organizers and a retired U.S. attorney. Speakers expressed the grievances of the chanting, cheering crowd about the military parade being held in Washington, D.C.,  the deployment of active duty U.S.troops on American soil, immigration raids  and attacks on the judicial system including the arrest of Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, as well as threatened cuts to reproductive and gender affirming health care, attacks on workers rights, and the ongoing mass slaughter of civilians in Gaza. The crowd observed a moment of silence for Minnesota Democratic legislative leader Melissa Hortman who was the victim of a targeted assassination Saturday in what appeared to be a politically motivated attack.  
The protest march proceeded  east towards Lake Michigan and  past Museum Center Park, winding back into the downtown area to pass the federal courthouse, and restaurant-lined streets before returning to Cathedral Square. 
The march stretched for several city blocksThere was no evidence of property destruction or clashes with police , and counter protesters were nowhere in sight.

The suspect, now identified as Vance Boelter, was still at large as droves arrived at the march’s staging area at St. Paul College. People were sharing updates and making safety plans with each other. Most decided to stay even as the Minnesota State Patrol posted on X that “No Kings” signs were found in the suspect’s car and that the public should not attend the protest.
Amelia Nelson, 22, came to protest with her mother and her grandmother, Joan Nelson, 82. “We’re in such dire times, it feels like the end times for me honestly. But it was important for me to come out, I wanted to experience the community.”
Joan Nelson said today’s movement was only the second protest she’s attended in her life. She said she came away with “hope, some hope. There were a lot of people, a lot of good messages. Fight on, don’t give up. There will be times when there are people we may lose, but still we fight on.”

The rally was suffused with tension. Some people scrutinized law enforcement and discussed among themselves whether their badges and patches were legitimate. Demonstrators alerted press and each other to any vehicles or people they thought might be suspicious. Phones were open to news updates.

Some scheduled speakers, including Gov. Tim Walz and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, did not appear in the wake of the Hortman and Hoffman shootings, but community leaders, musicians, and poets still gave speeches and led the crowd in chants. Several said blessings for the memory of Hortman.

Vermonters unified in one of the largest protests in recent Burlington history to defend democracy, health care and migrant rights.

Vermonters turned out in force around the state Saturday as part of the nationwide “No Kings Day” protests, championing myriad causes but generally united behind opposing President Donald Trump.
As Washington, D.C., geared up for a military parade to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Army and celebrate President Trump’s 79th birthday, 1,800 events unfolded across the country to protest the Trump administration as part of the “No Kings Day” of national mobilization.
Burlington saw one of its biggest protests in recent years. Geri Peterson, lead organizer with the activist network 50501, said 8,000 people signed up to participate in the rally on the Burlington waterfront. But as everyone gathered in front of the stage set up for the event, she said the crowd grew to over 16,000 people based on the group’s drone footage.

People showed up for different reasons: protecting democracy, standing up for immigrants, protesting the Trump administration’s budget and program cuts, showing solidarity with Palestine, upholding LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights and more.
“I’m scared that we’re going to lose democracy and we’re going to be under an authoritarian regime, and I don’t get scared easily,” said Brant Dinkin from Williston.
“I have a pent-up sadness about what’s going on in the country and taking action is the antidote to sadness, so I get up, I stand up and I show up and that’s what we’re all doing here today,” said Dinkin.
Jennifer Overton from West Berlin said she is worried about potential cuts to Medicaid, a government program providing health insurance for people with limited resources, as both her personal health and work as a therapist depend on it. 
“I’m on Medicaid and I will most certainly lose it, and that could be a death sentence for me,” Overton said, explaining that she’s diabetic and most of her clients are on Medicaid, so she would lose a big part of her income if the program was cut.
“I fear for my country. I deeply fear. I fear for her,” said Lorraine Zaloom, a resident of Essex, pointing to her niece. “She’s adopted. She’s done everything right. She has to carry her documents around.”
The protest in Burlington unfolded peacefully Saturday. Around noon, more people marched to the waterfront holding Palestinian flags and chanting “from Palestine to Mexico, those border walls have got to go.” As the lawn filled with people, speakers began taking the stage.
Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University student previously arrested by ICE during an interview to obtain U.S. citizenship, shared his experience growing up in a refugee camp under the Israeli government and witnessing the killing of his best friend. He said the solidarity and love of Vermonters helped him heal from the trauma he experienced.
“We see the fires in California and the violence, and it’s like a spark, and if we don’t put it down, any spark of violence here, the fire will spread,” said Mahdawi. “We have to put it down with love and care. We have to keep guarding our communities.”
Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., Vermont’s lone member in the U.S. House of Representatives, also spoke to the crowd: “Today is an urgent call for every American, no matter who you voted for, no matter if you voted at all,” she said.

Balint referenced how Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., was recently taken to the ground and zip-tied by Homeland Security agents after interrupting a press conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
“He was doing his work — his responsibility to do oversight over Homeland Security,” Balint said. “If they will do that to a man with that much power, what are they doing to the least among us?”
Balint denounced the threats and harassment faced by students, residents and migrant workers and encouraged people to continue organizing and resisting. 
“We, today, are creating community by doing this important work together” she said, “and we will use it to push back against policies that don’t serve us, against politicians who divide us, against people who want to keep us down. That’s why we are out here today.”
Meanwhile, in Montpelier, the Statehouse lawn was teeming with over a thousand people attending the capital city’s “No Kings” protest.Organizers from Montpelier Strong Indivisible and Calais Indivisible substituted speakers for singers and asked the crowd to sing along to protest songs and religious hymns performed by Solidarity Singers, a political music group.The rally remained peaceful throughout as organizers urged the crowd to remain nonviolent and to not engage with any potential hecklers or counter-protesters.
Ron Dufresne, a veteran, said attending the rally was part of his military duty.
“I came to the protest today because we have to reclaim our country. I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution as a U.S. Army officer, and I take that oath very seriously. I see this administration trampling on the Constitution. Our country will only be strong if we, the people, reclaim our devotion to the Constitution and rule of law.”Toward the back of the protest Mackenzie Kovaka had a small easel set up in front of her as she painted a miniature watercolor portrait of the day’s events. 
“I paint a lot. It’s part of being present and here, and it’s the way that I like to experience things… and I’m really concerned about the direction of the country,” Kovaka said.
For Kim Rae, protesting was personal. Her son Ash has used a wheelchair since he was 8 years old. Ash relies on Medicaid dollars to provide a home health aid to help him in his daily life. President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” now making its way through Congress, would cut an estimated $600 billion from Medicaid, according to PBS.“If Medicaid gets cut he won’t be able to survive independently in his own home,” Rae said.
The rally ended with organizers leading a large march toward downtown Montpelier, calling for people to join them later on at the Burlington protest if they could.
More than 40 events were held around the state Saturday, including a border-to-border anti-Trump flag parade that traveled up Route 7 from Massachusetts to Canada. Vermonters honked and waved along the route as the parade passed by. At least 15 communities outside of the parade route held their own anti-Trump protests.

MONTPELIER — A Republican Flag Day gathering in front of the Vermont Statehouse ended in a frosting fiasco Saturday after a cake was destroyed and a man was shoved.The intention of the gathering was to celebrate “Flag Day, the 250th Anniversary of the U.S. Army, (and) President Donald Trump’s 79th Birthday!” according to the Vermont Republican Party’s online calendar. The celebration was scheduled to start just an hour after the anti-Trump “No Kings” protest hosted in the same location. 
The event was hosted by Gregory Thayer, a notable Republican voice in Vermont politics who ran against Lt. Gov. John Rodgers in last year’s Republican primary.

The violence began when Matthew Baker came up to the table as Thayer was speaking and smushed his water bottle into the cake that read “Happy Birthday U.S Flag, U.S. Army + President Trump.” Thayer then turned and shoved the man, as other pro-Trump attendees rushed to Thayer’s aid. Thayer then threw the water bottle, which struck Baker’s chest.
“He smashed the cake with a water bottle. I grabbed him to push him away, and then I walked away ’cause other people converged on him. Then, the water bottle was sitting in the middle of the cake and I gave him back his water bottle. That’s pretty much it,” Thayer said.“I just dipped this in their cake, and then they grabbed the bottom and threw it at me, in the chest,” Baker said. “I wanted to see how they would react, and I got what I expected, violence. I got this bottle thrown at me.”

Security officers separated the men, and police officers showed up promptly after the initial cake-clash.Despite the bottle, the cake was still served, though the event ended about 10 minutes early.The event started peacefully enough, with Thayer and around 30 pro-Trump supporters in attendance gathered around a table with a microphone and the cake.

The peace was short-lived, however, as minutes into the event the first arguments started. A young woman in a pink shirt and a man in a fireman’s jacket holding a Trump 2024 flag began to argue about immigration.Then, a woman holding a “Chinga La Migra” poster who was a stayover from the prior “No Kings” rally ran around to distract pro-Trump speakers, who returned with chants like “Becca Balint get in line, learn to wipe your own behind!”Arguments between event attendees and anti-Trump protesters punctuated the entirety of the event.As tensions escalated between the pro and anti-Trump groups, Thayer made a move toward civility by calling up an older, liberal woman to the microphone.

The woman asked attendees to find someone with whom they disagreed but could have a reasonable conversation with. It appeared neither crowd was listening, though, as both sides shouted over the woman — at one point while she was speaking, someone let off an airhorn — when she asked attendees to put their hands on their head if they thought her proposition was a good idea. Only she and Thayer did so. Tonya Cicio attended the event to celebrate President Trump’s birthday and the 250th anniversary of the U.S. army, as her son is in the Navy. 
“We’ve been supporting Trump since before the election … There’ll never be another president like him again — never,” Cicio said.

The protest and march drew over 1,000 attendees, according to event organizers (Michael Baniewicz/Missourian).Thousands turned out in Columbia, Jefferson City and dozens of towns across Missouri on Saturday to join a nationwide mobilization against the expansion of executive power by the president.
The “No Kings” demonstrations took place in all 50 states, with at least 30 rallies in Missouri, from Columbia to St. Louis, Kansas City to Cape Girardeau, Springfield to St. Joseph, and around the steps of the Missouri Capitol in Jefferson City.
The widespread national movement came after more than a week of demonstrations against federal immigration raids, largely in Los Angeles where President Donald Trump activated the National Guard and U.S. Marines over the authority of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Saturday’s protests were timed to match a military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army and coinciding with Trump’s 79th birthday.
In St. Louis, news outlets reported that thousands participated in at least a dozen rallies in the city and the county, while thousands more marched in Kansas City, 2,000 lined the streets in Springfield and several hundred turned out in Joplin.
In addition to the rallies in U.S. cities, including in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Houston and Los Angeles, there were gatherings in Europe, Africa, Asia and South America.
Gov. Mike Kehoe announced Thursday that he was activating the Missouri National Guard ahead of the planned rallies but indicated they would be mobilized only if “assistance is needed to support local law enforcement.”
But organizers nationwide vowed to keep the protests peaceful, and very little disturbance or police presence was observed in Columbia and central Missouri.
 Around the Courthouse Plaza in Columbia

 Hundreds of people gather for the “No Kings” protest Saturday at Boone County Courthouse in Columbia. The crowd sat in the warm sun as they listened to multiple speeches and chanted slogans (Kate Cassady/Missourian).
The atmosphere at the Boone County Courthouse in Columbia was upbeat Saturday as at least 1,000 people gathered to express their frustrations with the Trump administration.
Friends and neighbors mingled while speeches and live music filled the courthouse amphitheater, making the protest feel more like a block party than a demonstration.
Cars passing on Walnut Street answered protesters’ signs with honks of support. In the shade of the plaza parking garage, a hot dog stand sold food and drinks, while more protesters watched and waved American flags from the top floor of the garage.
Flags, signs and apparel at the protest were representative of the diverse range of people who showed up and the variety of grievances they have with Trump.
Chants in support of women and transgender rights were popular, and a number of signs focused on accusations of sexual misconduct against the president. Many brought American flags, some displayed upside down in an act traditionally used to signal distress.
During the rally, Ken Pearson said he was offended by Trump using his wealth and status to avoid military service.
“But beyond that, I think he’s a real threat to our democratic institutions,” said Pearson, who is a U.S. Army veteran.
Amy Lovelady came with her daughter to the protest to set an example.
“At this moment in our history if we’re silent, then we’re complacent,” Lovelady said.
Her daughter, Laila, added: “I just want everyone to be equal, and I want to have equality for everyone. It’s liberty and justice for all.”
Many people also expressed concerns about the Trump administration’s fiscal policies. Protesters called for the protection of funding for health care, schools, universities, conservation work and the U.S. Postal Service.
Demonstrators began gathering at the courthouse plaza around 11 a.m. for two hours of speeches and music.
For many who were closer to the road than the amphitheater, it was hard to hear, so instead, they chanted and socialized. Law enforcement presence at the event was light. Some officers helped keep people out of the street while others were seen near an ambulance on Ninth Street.
 On the steps of the Missouri Capitol

 Victoria Harris, left, and Kurt Dulle wait for the “No Kings” protest to begin Saturday at the Missouri Capitol in Jefferson City. “I’m seeing the (Trump) administration is very easily, arguably, corrupted and doing things that are blatantly illegal,” Dulle said. ‘“I hope to see people say, ‘Enough is enough'” (Michael Baniewicz/Missourian).
The steps of the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City were packed with more than 1,000 protesters of all ages opposing deportation, restrictions to reproductive rights and federal funding cuts and layoffs.
The protest was organized by We Stand United Missouri, an organization that promotes political activism at the local level.
Speakers included Suzanne Luther, state House District 60 candidate; David Knipp, union and labor advocate; and Jordan Herrera, congressional candidate for Missouri’s 5th District.
Knipp, who goes by “Proud Union Guy,” said he was concerned about right-to-work laws and maintaining prevailing wage regulations.
“We’re the backbone of America,” Knipp told the crowd. “We don’t just build America — we are America.”
After hearing from speakers, protesters marched around the block, passing the Missouri Governor’s Mansion before returning to the Capitol building.
Their reasons for coming included a love of country, a desire to uphold checks and balances, and ensuring funds for state and federal programs.
Arianna Hensley-Parker, a 27-year-old mother who came with her kids, 6 and 3, said she was advocating for their futures, including continued access to health care.
She said her 3-year-old son received medical care and therapy from a program run by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for infants and toddlers with disabilities or developmental delays.
Hensley-Parker said the state-run program “was a huge reason why he can talk today.”
A couple from Lynn, Rob Overly and Kate Wilson-Overly, came to protest funding cuts to Medicaid and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Rob Overly’s mother was on Medicaid, he said, which helped pay for her colon cancer surgery. The procedure wouldn’t have elongated her life, but it did help her in her final days, he said.
“If it was not for Medicaid, that would not have happened,” said Overly, a member of the Osage County Democrats and a retired architect, “so I know how valuable that is.”
Everyone dies, Overly said, “but the question is how.”
Another couple traveled 2½ hours from Unionville to attend the rally. Steve, 64, and Jeanna Grimes, 63, said they were worried about funding cuts to Veterans Affairs programs, Social Security and international aid.
“We have 22 grandkids and three great-grandkids,” Steve Grimes said. “What is the country going to be like for them?”
His wife added that she thinks not just beyond her generation, but beyond U.S. borders, too.
“We really want good for the world. Why would they cut all the aid to other countries?” she said. “That’s soft power. That’s a beautiful thing.”
 On the square in Boonville

 Protesters march down Main Street holding signs and American flags during the “No Kings” protest Saturday in Boonville. The demonstration was part of a national day of action against authoritarianism and political repression (Xiaoman An/Missourian).
At least 100 protestors stood their ground outside the Cooper County Courthouse in Boonville, receiving honks and praise, as well as a few hostile signals from cars passing by on Main Street.
Boonville’s “No Kings” protest attracted people from the nearby communities of Moberly, Blackwater and Glasgow, but most were residents of the town.
Some said they had participated in historic movements before, including Mary Norbury, who held up a sign that read, “Jesus believed in DEI.”
“I think democratic ideals are just being shattered daily,” she said. “I believe in Christian principles, and that’s why I’m here.”
Norbury said she had joined a protest as a student at Duke University on behalf of Black workers who weren’t receiving compensation equal to their white counterparts.
After participating in a number of acts of civil disobedience, she said she believes everyone of any age should be able to voice an opinion, no matter how controversial.
“If they don’t, they have no right to complain about anything that happens,” she said. “You just have to be involved.”
Gaye Perera, former federal employee, helped organize Good Trouble Mid MO, an ad hoc committee in Boonville with more than 100 members. The organization’s mission is to “provide a voice for those concerned about the current direction of the country and how it impacts our community.”
“I do know that some members of our community, our Black neighbors and our LGBTQ neighbors, are more reluctant to come out, understandably, so it’s important that we represent them too,” Perera said.
Tamara and Lynn Lynch, a married couple from Boonville, said they were protesting to “make an impact.” Tamara Lynch is a former special education teacher, and Lynn Lynch is a special education compliance consultant at the University of Missouri.
“We believe the administration right now is continuing to break laws that are constitutional,” Lynn Lynch said. “There’s no reason to make cuts on the backs of people who are seniors, who are disabled, and our children, to give tax breaks to the wealthiest of this country.”
Tamara Lynch said her and her wife felt safe and protected, but she expressed concerns about the future of other protected rights under the Constitution.
“I’m worried that women’s right to vote could be compromised,” she said.
“We already lost the right to make decisions about our own body,” Lynn Lynch added.
 On a corner in Fayette

Between the Howard County Courthouse and the First Baptist Church on Saturday morning in Fayette, protesters stood in clusters, held “No Kings” banners and talked about their perception of a broken democracy.
There were no chants. There were no speeches. The crowd of about 40 aired their frustrations and grappled with the last six months of chaotic change in America’s political system.
The conversations addressed what the protesters saw as threats to the Constitution, cruelty toward others who may not have strong voices and a general “decay of democracy.”
“The way he’s treating our immigrants and being so cruel, it’s just not right,” said Peggy Robb, 71, who had turned out for her first protest.
“I’m a God-fearing woman, and I just can’t believe you could treat other human beings in that way,” she said.
She also spoke as a retired teacher, and said she opposes the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education.
Another protester, Beth Gold, said that in a small town, there is social pressure to respond to your neighbor in a friendly way. So, she said she was trying to spread her message through kindness while waving and smiling at cars passing by.
“I know everybody doesn’t agree with us, but if they can see us as people and not the enemy, that’s good,” Gold said. “We’ve made progress.”
Among a crowd that skewed older, John Tinker and his sister, Hope, were continuing a mission to promote change through protest that began nearly 60 years ago.
In 1968, John was a lead plaintiff in the landmark First Amendment Supreme Court case, Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, which established free speech as a protected right in America’s public schools.
He and another sister, Mary Beth, along with several others, wore black armbands to their public school to protest American involvement in the Vietnam War. After he was suspended, the Tinkers sued, and their case ended up before the Supreme Court.
The majority of Justices determined that students and teachers do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”
On Saturday, John and Hope Tinker held onto the promise that protest can make meaningful change when principles are involved.
“The main thing I think that needs to happen is for society to affirm to itself that it wants to be a democratic society,” he said. “That it wants to be represented in government. That it doesn’t want a government that goes off on its own and does stuff. It wants to be what the American promise was.”
“No kings!” his sister added, as the protesters began to head home in late morning.

The demonstrations were part of “No Kings” protests across the nation on Flag Day and before a military parade in Washington, D.C. over which Trump will preside on his 79th birthday.
In Louisville, crowds hoisting homemade signs gathered in front of city hall and marched through downtown as police blocked traffic. Andrew Schmidt, 46, who identified himself as an Army veteran and retired police officer from Vine Grove, wore his field uniform and carried a U.S. flag. He said he loves the flag and was holding it upside down to express his conviction that the country is in distress.
“It is your duty to honor your oath, and I feel like I’m doing that now as a retired officer and as a veteran,” Schmidt told the Lantern. “That oath is to the Constitution first and foremost, and it is also to defend the American public against enemies, foreign and domestic. Well, I feel we’re at the ‘domestic’ part right now.”

In Lexington, protesters spilled out of the Robert F. Stephens Courthouse Plaza onto sidewalks along Main and adjoining streets, chanting,“No kings. No crowns. We, the people, won’t back down.” Passing motorists joined in with a cacophony of car horns.
Dr. Craig Blair,  a Lexington veterinarian and leader of Peaceful Bluegrass Resistance, estimated the crowd in Lexington at 5,000.
Blair said his group has held 86 small roadside protests since February “to keep the news of the day in front of people” and participated in several larger protests. He said Saturday’s gathering was the largest and most diverse yet. “That’s been the big difference today because we’ve not had immigrant or minority participation in our previous rallies.”
Kim Edwards, a founder of the Lexington group Gathering for Democracy, agreed Saturday’s protest was the most diverse crowd yet, including more young people. Her group handed out information about actions to take as an “antidote to despair” and displayed a copy of the Declaration of Independence.
“It’s really exciting to see so many people who are interested in democracy and who are standing up and fighting for democracy,” Edwards said.

The national “No Kings” organizers, led by the 50501 Movement, say people across the country gathered at more than 1,500 demonstrations Saturday. In Kentucky, protests were planned in multiple towns, including Bowling Green, Owensboro, Frankfort, Hazard, Morehead, Richmond, Madisonville, Shelbyville, Paducah, and Ashland, according to the organizers’ national “No Kings” website.
 ‘A sense of community’
The protests coincided with a military parade in Washington D.C. taking place on the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary and Trump’s 79th birthday. The military parade, featuring thousands of soldiers and dozens of tanks and planes, is expected to cost the Army $25 million to $45 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Sophie Graf, a 50501 Movement organizer, said organizing groups estimated the turnout in Louisville at more than 5,000 people. Louisville police put the crowd at about 4,000.

Among them was Isabella Herrera, 25, who moved to Louisville from south Texas. She said she has friends at home who are afraid to go out during the day for fear of being targeted by immigration enforcement simply for appearing Hispanic. She said it was encouraging to see the large gathering opposing the Trump administration.
“It’s not only me that feels this way, it’s a shared feeling,” Herrera said. “It gives a sense of community.”
Denouncing the recent crackdown by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and advocating for law-abiding undocumented immigrants were common threads.
As a steady but brief rain fell, one of the first Lexington speakers, the Rev. Brian Chenowith, minister of the Unitarian Universalist Church, said “this is a time for truth, for denouncing authoritarianism.” Chenowith decried as “evil”  the Trump crackdown that he said is separating families and deporting without due process immigrants who have worked for decades in service and other jobs.
Chenowith ended his speech by pulling out a Mexican flag, saying, “I defy you, Donald Trump.” Chenowith explained Trump had labeled protesters displaying Mexico’s flag in Los Angeles as insurrectionists.
Afterwards, he told the Lantern “the president and his people were the ones who actually had an insurrection, brought swastikas and Confederate flags into our nation’s Capitol. It’s not an act of insurrection to be proud of your heritage, to be proud of your neighbors’ heritage from Mexico, Canada, the Caribbean or beyond. In Kentucky, we should celebrate Latino and Hispanic folks because a significant part of the industries that make Kentucky what it is rely on immigrants.”
JP Lyninger, a Louisville Metro Council member and Democratic Socialist, told the Louisville crowd that “facism is here and that we have to fight back.”
“We’ve got a political movement in control of the White House that goes after immigrants. We’ve got a political movement in the administration that’s going after union leaders, a political movement that’s against women’s rights and queer rights, a movement that wants to stop us from engaging in civil democracy and expressing our opinion,” Lyninger said.
 Teen’s detention sparks ‘outrage’ in Bowling Green
In Bowling Green, Tom Morris, an organizer with SOKY Indivisible, estimated at least 1,000 people, maybe as many as 2,000, turned out. The detention of a Kentucky teenager, Ernesto Manuel-Andres, by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had sparked community protests in the Warren County seat earlier in the week. 
“There’s a lot of outrage,” Morris said. “From what everyone understands, he was legally here and they had no right to take him. People feel like they were just trying to reach a quota. A lot of people know him; he had just graduated from high school. Adults say he’s a good kid. It really brought it home. It’s dawning on some people, hey, this isn’t far away, this isn’t LA, this is here.”

Louisville resident Kristen Lisanby, 34, told the Lantern the “No Kings” event in Louisville was her first protest. She said friends in Louisville have told her about people who have been “deported” from their workplaces. “We just want to make sure that we’re here, heard here hopefully,” Lisanby said.
Graf, a 50501 organizer, said the plan by the group is to keep demonstrating to show unity in opposition against actions by the Trump administration but to also pressure local officials to stand against “what the federal government is imposing on cities across the U.S.”
Elected officials at the Louisville protest included Democratic state senators David Yates and Karen Berg, both of Louisville, and U.S. Rep. Morgan McGravey of Louisville.
In Lexington, writer Silas House, a former state poet laureate, addressed the crowd.
Blair, one of the Lexington protest organizers, said, “the right tries to paint us as un-American. We wouldn’t be out here if we weren’t patriots. We’re fighting because we love the country.”
Blair said the founding fathers enacted the U.S. Constitution to prevent the rise of autocratic rule in the U.S. “It’s worked for 250 years. I’m not going to let Trump tell me he’s got a better idea.”

In Star Valley, two residents took an uncomfortable stand in their hometown. In Casper and Jackson, hundreds attended larger rallies.
The post ‘No Kings’ rallies come to rural, conservative Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","ALPINE—If history has taught anything, it’s that revolutionary thought often begins at the local watering hole. Paul Revere and the Sons of Liberty organized at Boston’s Green Dragon Tavern. The Founding Fathers frequented Philadelphia’s City Tavern. And on April 5, 2025, Sid Woods and Wayne Noffsinger hatched a plan at Jackson’s Snake River Brewpub.
The two old friends, both Star Valley residents for the better part of three or four decades, hadn’t seen much of each other in a long time. Both are self-proclaimed members of Lincoln County’s batch of “other” — queer folks living in a sparsely populated valley steeped in conservative politics and deep religious tradition. Those who don’t fit the mold tend to find one another.
Co-organizer Sid Woods demonstrates during a “No Kings” protest Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Alpine. “I certainly hold no gripes against people who aren’t coming, especially if their skin color’s a little darker. No gripes at all,” she said. “We have your back. We’re here.”
It seemed serendipitous then, that Noffsinger and Woods would again find one another this spring. He, a 57-year-old artist and medical assistant, had just attended his first protest on Jackson’s Town Square — one of more than 1,000 “Hands Off!” rallies taking issue with President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s cuts to federal programs and jobs. Woods, 62, a writer recently retired following a career with the U.S. Forest Service, has spent her entire life organizing and showing up — calling out everything from controversial nuclear energy projects in New England to the “usual indignities” affecting women and queer people across Wyoming in the wake of the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student, in Laramie.
The two have different recollections of whose idea it really was to organize their own “No Kings” Nationwide Day of Defiance rally in Alpine rather than make another trip up to Jackson. “I think we had been imbibed with beer,” Noffsinger ventured. 
Regardless, their work put the town of Alpine on the map as the smallest of 13 participating Wyoming towns and cities. Nationally, organizers said some 2,000 events drew millions of people to protest against the Trump administration.

Most demonstrations unfolded peacefully. But they occurred hours after another unsettling example of political violence: The shootings of two Democratic state lawmakers and their spouses in Minnesota, leaving two dead and two injured. Police there found “No Kings” flyers in the suspect’s car. Wyoming legislative leaders issued a statement Saturday afternoon calling for civility and mutual understanding as authorities continued to hunt for the suspected gunman. 
“May we come together in this moment of sorrow to reflect on the values that unite us and to work toward a future where such acts of political violence have no place in America,” the Wyoming lawmakers wrote.
Vying for survival
Wyoming was never on Noffsinger’s radar. Originally from Las Vegas, he moved to Los Angeles, where he attended community college and came out for the first time.
“I lived in Los Angeles and I lived in the ‘gay ghetto,’” he said. “I never felt the need to go beat my drum. I’m like, ‘Eh, I’m gay. Big fucking deal.’” 
Jen Slovak and Rob Dyke demonstrate during a “No Kings” protest Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Alpine, Wyoming. We RSVP’d to the Jackson one but then saw Alpine was having one, which is great,” Slovak said. “We wanted to stay local and support our community here. We’re so proud of our community.”
But after returning to Las Vegas and meeting someone, the 22-year-old packed his bags and followed his new Star Valley born-and-raised partner back home in 1990. The two lived and worked together in their home art gallery in Etna — the same place Noffsinger met Woods and her partner for the first time. 
“Back then, in my recollection, it was mostly queer communities that were being targeted,” Woods said. “After Matthew Shepard’s death, Wyoming felt particularly under the gun, kind of like with the wolf incident last year. When people feel particularly under the gun, they just sort of batten down the hatches and get worse.”
One night while at the gallery, the window of Woods’ truck was shot out.
“There was a long period where it was drive-by epithets. Our house was broken into, we had paintballs shot at the house,” Noffsinger said. “The day that they buried Matthew Shepard, they smashed our mailbox with a sledgehammer.”
His new home wasn’t Las Vegas, and he learned quickly that as a gay man in rural Wyoming, he certainly couldn’t maintain anonymity — or even expect apathy from neighbors the way he could in a place like Los Angeles.
He and his partner wrote a letter appealing to the community via the valley’s newspaper, the Star Valley Independent, and later went on the record with the Casper Star-Tribune, which published a front-page story about their experience being targeted as a gay couple in a socially conservative and deeply religious area.
“After you do that, it changes to where you become the activist in your own life, vying for your own survival,” Noffsinger said. “Especially in a very rural place like this where people don’t know you, so they make up stories about you. That’s one of the impetuses for me to be involved in this. They’re making up stories about immigrants that aren’t true.”

That’s what drove Karellina Kiljander, 22, to show up to a “No Kings” rally in one of Wyoming’s biggest cities, Casper. On Saturday morning, she held up a Mexican flag and wore a Mexico shirt to make a point as she and people she knows have been increasingly harassed as anti-immigration sentiment increases.
“It’s affecting my life. I have people in my life who are from the Hispanic community, and it’s bullshit,” she said. “They’re just here trying to live their lives, working hard and supporting their families. People just hate them, but they work so hard.” 
Others who feel the same were too scared to come out, she said.
“Just because of our skin color it doesn’t make us any different,” she said. “We work just as hard as anybody else.” 
Some 600 people showed up at Healing Park for the demonstration in Casper, according to Allyse Taylor, who organizes with the Casper Unity and Solidarity Project. The group has held numerous “Kick out the Clowns” protests in the park and were organizing another one before the “No Kings” wave took off. Other than a handful of critical comments from passing vehicles, and one person who briefly stopped his truck to angrily engage with some of the protesters, the event was otherwise uneventful and cheerful. Many of the protestors were planning to attend a PRIDE celebration at David Street Station later that day in downtown Casper. 
The Casper Unity and Solidarity Project, or CUSP, organized Casper’s rally to voice opposition to the Trump administration as part of the nationwide “No Kings” protests. CUSP’s Allyse Taylor has helped organize past protests in the city’s Healing Park. The June 14, 2025 showing was the largest, with an estimated 660 people participating, she said.

The Casper Pride event was lively and well attended. The Alpine protest, meanwhile, was an opportunity to offer up some visibility in a place where, according to Woods and Noffsinger, being the “other” is often punished. 
They wanted to make sure that people who are part of marginalized communities in Alpine and further up the valley — namely queer people, people of color and immigrants — could see that they didn’t necessarily need to drive an hour north and join the hundreds of people protesting Saturday in Jackson to feel safe and accepted in Wyoming.
“For me, it was what was being said about people that I knew. I have trans friends. I’m watching their rights being eroded,” Noffsinger said. “Nobody wants to be born to be the target of derision for the rest of their fucking life. Nobody chooses that.”
“I come from an ecological background where, hello, ecological diversity is understood as a positive. Why can’t social diversity be understood as a positive?” Woods said. “It’s not about the administration or the issues so much as the idea that, to me, we are a more diverse state than the false image of what this state is.”
A small-town rally
By 10 a.m. Saturday, more than 60 people joined Woods and Noffsinger along the bridge over the Snake River in Alpine. It’s a high-traffic choke point for commuters and tourists heading to Jackson, for locals towing boats out to the Palisades Reservoir — basically anyone moving in or out of the northern valley had to pass through Alpine’s “No Kings” gauntlet.
Demonstrators wave flags at approaching traffic during a “No Kings” protest Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Alpine. The rally drew more than 60 demonstrators in the small western Wyoming town 36 miles south of Jackson.
Pamela Thompson, of Alpine, was nervous to be there and had planned to drive to Jackson or some other nearby rally instead.
“The division and aggressiveness is frightening,” she said. “I feel like as long as I assimilate, everything’s going to be OK. But honestly I don’t even care anymore if I put myself out there because this is bonkers. We have to do something. 
“It just feels good to be with people who recognize this is wrong because you question your sanity sometimes. Does anyone pay attention, does anyone care?”
But supportive honks seemed to vastly outnumber vocal opposition throughout the morning. Plenty of middle fingers were thrown, chants of “Trump! Trump! Trump!” occasionally oscillated by at 35 miles per hour. One motorist yelled “All illegals must go!” as he passed. A couple times, a pickup would slow to a stop while rallygoers seemed to brace for potential trouble.
It’s not uncommon for residents of smaller towns to head to more populous places for political demonstrations. People from Pinedale and Driggs, Idaho, joined hundreds of demonstrators under the antler arches on Jackson’s Town Square.

Rebecca Bercher lives in Shell, population of less than 100. She attended the rally in Sheridan, a nearly two-hour drive northeast, to express her disagreement with how the Trump administration is handling the military. She served eight years in the Army, her husband retired after 23. They have two sons, who both are active duty military. 
“I’m upset about the communistic parade that’s going on that looks like something out of the Soviet Union today,” she said of Saturday’s massive military parade celebrating the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary, an expensive display intended to honor America’s military might. 
“And I do not like federalizing the National Guard above the wishes of a governor of a state,” Bercher added, referring to the federal deployment of National Guard troops to L.A. protests, despite opposition from state and local leaders there.

Bercher and her husband also depend on the Department of Veterans Affairs for their health care, she said, “I hate that they’re cutting it as well.”
Back in Alpine, as the clock hit noon and people began to filter out, Noffsinger and Woods walked along the highway making sure the area was cleaned up. Noffsinger’s nerves from earlier in the morning seemed to have faded after seeing dozens of his friends and neighbors who chose to stay and plant a flag in their own valley rather than drive to another larger city.

Woods was told by some they were disappointed in the turnout, as if they expected better of their hometown.
“We need to really reach out to one another right now, especially in our community so people don’t feel like they’re alone,” Noffsinger said. “That was what hit me up in Jackson, was that idea that there are people like us. It’s like you’re coming out again.”

Mike Cernovich, another right-wing influencer who has 1.4 million followers on X, took Rugg’s post and amped it up, but in the “just asking questions” style of many conspiracy theories:
“Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”
They were deeply ignorant about the MinnesotaCare issue.
Walz and Hortman — who was instrumental in passing legislation allowing undocumented people to sign up for MinnesotaCare as speaker of the House in 2023 — negotiated a compromise with Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature to end eligibility for adults, but keep it for children. They did so to win necessary Republican support in the 67-67 House to pass a state budget. Without it, state government would have shut down on July 1.
Both Hortman and Walz signed the compromise agreement in mid-May. This week, Hortman spoke tearfully about how difficult the vote was for her, but she was bound to vote yes on the issue because of the prior agreement.
Rugg and Cernovich’s posts were shared widely and just the start of the disinformation.
Once law enforcement sources began revealing a suspect, right-wing influencers ran with an insignificant detail: That Vance Luther Boelter was a “Walz appointee.”
Like many states, but even more so here, Minnesota is home to hundreds of nonpartisan and bipartisan boards and commissions, which are composed of thousands of people who typically win the appointment by simply volunteering. There are currently 342 open positions on Minnesota boards and commissions. Boelter was appointed to the Workforce Development Council by Walz’s predecessor Gov. Mark Dayton and reappointed by Walz.
It was the equivalent of calling a Sunday school volunteer an “appointee of the bishop.”
No matter, the Murdoch media machine, specifically the New York Post, had their headline: “Former appointee of Tim Walz sought….”
Cernovich had his greasy foil hot dog wrapper and began constructing a hat:
“The Vice President candidate for the Democrat party is directly connected to a domestic terrorist, that is confirmed, the only question is whether Tim Walz himself ordered the political hit against a rival who voted against Walz’s plan to give free healthcare to illegals.”
Walz had no such plan. He had signed an agreement to end eligibility for undocumented adults.
Joey Mannarino, who has more than 600,000 followers on X, was more crass:
“Rumor has it she was preparing to switch parties. The Democrats are VIOLENT SCUM.”
It was a ridiculous “rumor.” One of the last photos of Hortman alive was an image of her at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor’s big annual fundraising event, the Humphrey-Mondale dinner, which took place just hours before her assassination.
No matter, Cernovich wanted his new friends in federal law enforcement to act:
“The FBI must take Tim Walz into custody immediately.”
Finally, fresh off his humiliating defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump, world’s richest man Elon Musk quote-tweeted someone again falsely alleging Hortman was killed by “the left”  and added:
“The far left is murderously violent.” 
The suspect’s “hit list,” according to an official who has seen the list, comprised Minnesotans who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. CNN reported that it also included several abortion clinics, which doesn’t sound like the work of “the left.”
Right-wing influencers marred Hortman’s death and smeared Walz on a pile of lies.
In a different, saner world, they would be humiliated and slink away. But the smart money is that during the next moment of national crisis and mourning, they will again lie for profit.

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)Demonstrators joined a large “No Kings” protest against Trump administration policies in Grand Junction on Saturday as part of a nationwide movement of demonstrations.
Local organizers estimate that up to 3,000 people attended the protest in Grand Junction — a significant turnout for this predominantly Republican city that voted for President Donald Trump in 2024.
The crowd size peaked at around 10 a.m., when a rally began and before temperatures spiked, said Claire Ninde, of Indivisible Grand Junction, the group that organized the protest. Temperatures in the city were projected to reach triple digits on Saturday.

While 600 people registered for the event, the number of people who come to Indivisible events is typically four times the number who register, said organizer Mallory Martin.
The “No Kings” protest took place at Canyon View Park – in coordination with approximately 2,000 other protests across the county, on the same day as a Trump-planned military parade in Washington, D.C., to mark the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary. It also happens to be Trump’s 79th birthday.
Many Trump opponents claim the parade is about celebrating himself, and refer to it as his “birthday parade.” According to PBS, the parade will cost taxpayers between $25 million and $45 million.
Handful of counterprotesters
Grand Junction resident Caitlin Lyman said she came to the Grand Junction protest because she’s fed up with the Trump administration, and a little scared. She also wanted to be around like-minded people, she added. 
An Indivisible news release called the “No Kings” protest “a mass, nationwide protest rejecting authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.”
In Grand Junction, along the park’s west side, protesters lined up along 24 Road, stretching south to D Road, and north to the Interstate 70 overpass — where some people hung signs facing the eastbound interstate traffic. A handful of counter-protesters drove trucks back and forth. Some were flying Trump, Confederate, Israeli, and American flags.

Organizers encouraged people to watch webinars with instructions on how to deescalate tensions if they arise. A safety team urged protesters to not engage with counterprotesters. Volunteers also worked to keep people safe near traffic, as they left the park and began walking on the sidewalk along 24 Road. 
The local protest remained peaceful, although one counterprotester driving a white truck revved up his engine and veered slightly toward a group standing on the sidewalk. Others made obscene gestures and yelled at the protesters as they drove by. A truck driver emitted exhaust toward protesters. However, the vast majority of motorists signaled they supported the protest.
Lamar R. Edwards and Kevin Arensman, both of Grand Junction, chose to remain inside the park where they found a place in the shade to set up their chairs. Edwards said he was there to protest fascism. 
“I was just telling Kevin the young people don’t realize what fascism is like and what it’s done. In 1958 and 1959 I went to France and the destruction of that country was still there. The effort (the Nazis) went to destroy Europe is incomprehensible,” Edwards said.
Arensman wore a red T-shirt with the words “Jesus era un immigrante” (Jesus was an immigrant). As a white man in America, Arensman said it is his duty to protest Trump’s policies.

“Too many people are afraid to speak up with what’s going on in this country. Since I am able to speak up without fear, I will,” Arensman said. “My immigrant friends are in danger. One friend is supposed to go to his green card appointment in July but he doesn’t know if he’ll come home from that meeting.”
People are disappearing from those kinds of appointments, he added. 
Grand Junction resident Sabrina Roberts carried a sign that said “Honor the Flag.” She said she attended the rally because “I don’t like (the Trump administration) trying to suppress our First Amendment right. We need to be able to peaceably protest and not live in fear.”
Trump told reporters earlier in the week that “those people who want to protest” at the military parade are “going to be met with very big force.”
Standing near Roberts was Jennie Areson, whose sign said “Resist Fascism.” 
“I am totally anti-Trump,” she said. “I want democracy back, and to eliminate fascism. All my friends are here. We’re delighted to see this many people.”
Another protester, Renee Reynolds said “It’s so important to show up to defend democracy. You got to show up.”
Two young women, Jessiqa Montelbano and Lexi Shmalz, together held a sign that read “No! Kings! No! Dictator.”
“I wanted to show my support after hearing about it on TikTok and Instagram,” Montelbano said.

A trio of teenagers carried simple cardboard signs with messages that were important to them. 
“For me, I just couldn’t stand by and not join in,” said Karstyn Dayley, 19. “I feel strongly about Trump. He doesn’t put people’s needs in mind, except for the one percent. Every person counts.”
Her friend Kaysen Rodriquez, 17, said he came to protest Trump’s executive order aimed at ending citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens or legal residents.
As the protest wound down, Ninde praised her peacekeeping team for helping to keep everyone safe. She thanked law enforcement, too, for their presence.

Phil Murphy denounced political violence after a gunman shot two Minnesota state legislators (and their spouses) Saturday, killing one. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin ordered heightened security for public officials and increased patrols statewide Saturday after a gunman shot two state lawmakers and their spouses in Minnesota earlier in the day.
Gov. Phil Murphy said the bolstered security came “out of an abundance of caution,” and that there is no current, credible threat in New Jersey.
“The assassination of former Minnesota State House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark and the attempted assassination of State Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette have sent shockwaves throughout our nation,” Murphy said in a statement. “This terrible act against two dedicated public officials is an attack on our democracy. There is no place for political violence in the United States, and we must all work together to ensure our political differences are settled through debate, not bloodshed.”
Murphy recalled the 2020 attack at U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas’ home in New Jersey, when a gunman targeting the jurist murdered her 20-year-old son Daniel Anderyl and seriously wounded her husband Mark Anderyl. The incident prompted state legislators to pass a law, known as Daniel’s Law, that prohibits the public disclosure of the home addresses of judges, prosecutors, law enforcement officers, and other public officials.
“New Jersey is sadly all too familiar with targeted political violence against public officials and their families,” Murphy said. “We hope the perpetrator is quickly apprehended by law enforcement and swiftly brought to justice.”
The Minnesota shootings came during a day of political division nationally, with President Donald Trump’s supporters flocking to Washington, D.C., for a massive military parade to mark the Army’s anniversary and Trump’s birthday while thousands of demonstrators denounced Trump at “No Kings” protests around the country.

The 79- year-old death row inmate’s defense argues that the set method of execution might constitute “cruel and unusual punishment.”
Jordan is scheduled to be executed on June 25 by injection of a sedative followed by two lethal drugs.
The sedative administered doesn’t prevent the inmate from feeling pain, Jordan’s defense argues. Prisoners can feel suffocation and cardiac arrest.
“Mr. Jordan and all the other people on death row were sentenced to death to have their lives extinguished,” said Jim Craig, Jordan’s attorney at a hearing Saturday  for a preliminary injunction to halt the execution. “They were not sentenced to be tortured before they die.”
Jordan and fellow death row inmate Ricky Chase are lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the drugs used for lethal injection. 
Jordan, at 79 the state’s oldest and longest serving death row inmate, was first convicted in 1976 for kidnapping and killing Edwina Marter in Harrison County. He had four trials until a death sentence stuck in 1998. 
Mississippi Department of Corrections protocol requires execution staff to ensure that inmates are completely unconscious before proceeding with the lethal drugs. The “proposed consciousness check” is a mandated wait time of three minutes between administering the sedative and the lethal drugs.
But the latest two executions in Mississippi – David Neal Cox on Nov. 17, 2021, and Thomas Loden Jr.  on Dec. 14, 2022 – did not follow this protocol: execution staff only waited one to two minutes before injecting the other drugs. Citing a deposition from Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain, the Attorney General’s Office ensured Judge Wingate that protocol would be followed with Jordan.
Execution staff would also rub Jordan’s sternum and monitor his reaction to pressure applied. Wingate asked the Attorney General’s Office how many seconds the test would last, but they could not provide a set answer.
If the sedative fails, no protocol is in place. At that point, the decision to proceed with the execution lies in Cain’s hands.
Wingate floated an idea that Cain would no longer make this call if the sedative fails. In 2022, a state law gave the commissioner sole discretion to decide the method of execution of incarcerated people.
He set a deadline of Monday noon for an answer from Cain.
The U.S. Supreme Court distributed Jordan’s petition for a writ of certiorari at a May 29 conference and is expected to discuss it again at a June 18 conference – a week before the execution.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07041116/judge-Henry-Wingate-e1514409305395.jpg,,,2025-06-14 19:01:34.912065

Melissa Hartman talks to colleagues during a special legislative session Monday, June 9, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Hortman’s husband was also shot and killed, the governor said.
Walz, appearing emotional at a press conference in the north metro, said they were killed in an apparent “politically motivated assassination.”
“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
On Saturday afternoon, authorities asked for the public’s assistance in locating Vance Luther Boelter, the suspect connected with the shootings. They said he was last seen Saturday morning in Minneapolis wearing a dark long-sleeved shirt and a cowboy hat.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list. According to an official who has seen the list, the targets included prominent pro-choice individuals in Minnesota, including many Democratic lawmakers who have been outspoken about their policy positions.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
According to a source close to Walz, the governor spoke to Vice President J.D. Vance about the targeted attacks in Minnesota. The governor thanked the vice president for the coordination between federal law enforcement and Minnesota public safety officials.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

Roger Marshall, who she said is spending his time flattering the “tyrant in the White House” instead of standing up for Kansans.
Davis, a Democrat, made the announcement to the hundreds of people gathered for the No Kings rally at the state Capitol. She served as White House appointee for U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development during the Biden administration and previously lost in the Democratic primary in 2020 when she ran for the U.S. House in the 1st District against Kali Barnett. Republican Tracey Mann won that seat.
Davis and her family live in Cottonwood Falls.
“Unfortunately, the rights Kansans have fought for are being threatened by a tyrant and a Congress that is scared to hold him to account,” Davis said. “This isn’t the America that is the land of the free and the home of the brave. Nothing about this is our values. We didn’t vote for this. We need to stand together, regardless of political parties, and remember who we are — not just Americans, but we’re Kansans, and we deserve better.”
Davis criticized Marshall for failing to protect Kansas and its economy.
“The administration is clawing back funding for our public schools and dismantling the entire farm economy,” she said. “And what is Senator Marshall doing in response? He doesn’t even live here. Not what the Constitution says he’s supposed to. Instead of representing us and checking the power of the tyrant in the White House, he’s trying to flatter him.”
Davis’ words drew chants of “vote him out” from the crowd, which was gathered to protest the Trump administration.
On Saturday, Newsmax posted an interview with Marshall honoring the 250th birthday of the Army. He also sent birthday wishes to Trump.
“It’s been just the honor of a lifetime to work beside him to make America great again,” Marshall said.
In 2016, Marshall, who is a obstetrician and gynecologist, entered politics with a run against incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, defeating him in the primary and later winning the 1st District seat.  In 2019, he announced he would run for the seat that U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts was vacating. He won the primary and eventually the seat, beating out Democrat Barbara Bollier.
Devon Welcher, of Topeka, also revealed her intent to run for office, telling the crowd she plans to run for governor as an independent candidate.
In an interview, Welcher said she is running because “Kansas is in trouble,” and that voters should know, “I’m the real deal.”
“I have enthusiasm, and grace, and I am charismatic,” Welcher said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6140319-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-14 19:01:34.912065

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Thousands of people gathered on the grounds of the Washington state Capitol in Olympia on Saturday for the “No Kings” protest, part of a nationwide day of defiance against President Donald Trump. 
Around the country, similar demonstrations unfolded throughout the day and had been planned in more than 2,000 locations nationwide. The protests coincided with Trump’s birthday and a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C. 
In Olympia, crowds remained peaceful, and the Department of Enterprise Services, which manages the Capitol grounds, said attendance peaked at around 5,000 people.
“When we say no kings, we are rejecting systems that hold power and erase our existence,” said Natalie Coblentz, a speaker at the rally, adding that the gathering was meant to demonstrate protesters’ refusal to be ruled by kings, tyrants, or systemic oppression. 
The protests began at 9:45 a.m. near the Capitol Mall, west of downtown Olympia. There, a crowd of around a couple dozen people began marching toward the Capitol, with people joining along the way. When demonstrators arrived at the Capitol around 11 a.m., the crowd size had grown to around 2,000.
A band played music near the campus’ Tivoli Fountain as people lined Capitol Way, holding up signs as cars honked in support. People also spread out to the steps of the Legislative Building and the Temple of Justice, where the state Supreme Court convenes. 
Attendees could be seen dancing to music, blowing bubbles, and sitting in the sun. Olympia Indivisible, the group organizing the rally, emphasized that participants should remain nonviolent. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson and other elected officials urged people to demonstrate peacefully at a press conference yesterday. 
Those warnings followed Trump’s decision to deploy about 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement that began there late last week.
The band marched to the Capitol steps around noon and speakers took the stage shortly thereafter. They criticized how Trump has handled a range of issues, including immigration, veterans’ affairs and transgender rights. 
“This regime is sowing fear and division to chill our dissent and silence our opposition as they systematically attack the pillars of democracy,” said Lisa Ornstein, Olympia Indivisible co-founder, in a speech. 
Throughout the day, people shouted chants like “no kings, no tyrants” or “land of the free because of the brave.” 
At the top of the steps, a large sign spelling out the word “resist” was held up, each letter was decorated differently with the trans, Ukrainian, and Palestinian flags, among other designs. 
Speeches ended around 2 p.m. and the crowd began to disperse shortly after. Most participants had left the campus by 3 p.m. Counter protesters did not appear to be in attendance.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3557-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-14 19:01:34.912065

Mike Cernovich, another right-wing influencer who has 1.4 million followers on X, took Rugg’s post and amped it up, but in the “just asking questions” style of many conspiracy theories:
“Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”
They were deeply ignorant about the MinnesotaCare issue.
Walz and Hortman — who was instrumental in passing legislation allowing undocumented people to sign up for MinnesotaCare as speaker of the House in 2023 — negotiated a compromise with Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature to end eligibility for adults, but keep it for children. They did so to win necessary Republican support in the 67-67 House to pass a state budget. Without it, state government would have shut down on July 1.
Both Hortman and Walz signed the compromise agreement in mid-May. This week, Hortman spoke tearfully about how difficult the vote was for her, but she was bound to vote yes on the issue because of the prior agreement.
Rugg and Cernovich’s posts were shared widely and just the start of the disinformation.
Once law enforcement sources began revealing a suspect, right-wing influencers ran with an insignificant detail: That Vance Luther Boelter was a “Walz appointee.”
Like many states, but even more so here, Minnesota is home to hundreds of nonpartisan and bipartisan boards and commissions, which are composed of thousands of people who typically win the appointment by simply volunteering. There are currently 342 open positions on Minnesota boards and commissions. Boelter was appointed to the Workforce Development Council by Walz’s predecessor Gov. Mark Dayton and reappointed by Walz.
It was the equivalent of calling a Sunday school volunteer an “appointee of the bishop.”
No matter, the Murdoch media machine, specifically the New York Post, had their headline: “Former appointee of Tim Walz sought….”
Cernovich had his greasy foil hot dog wrapper and began constructing a hat:
“The Vice President candidate for the Democrat party is directly connected to a domestic terrorist, that is confirmed, the only question is whether Tim Walz himself ordered the political hit against a rival who voted against Walz’s plan to give free healthcare to illegals.”
Walz had no such plan. He had signed an agreement to end eligibility for undocumented adults.
Joey Mannarino, who has more than 600,000 followers on X, was more crass:
“Rumor has it she was preparing to switch parties. The Democrats are VIOLENT SCUM.”
It was a ridiculous “rumor.” One of the last photos of Hortman alive was an image of her at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor’s big annual fundraising event, the Humphrey-Mondale dinner, which took place just hours before her assassination.
No matter, Cernovich wanted his new friends in federal law enforcement to act:
“The FBI must take Tim Walz into custody immediately.”
Finally, fresh off his humiliating defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump, world’s richest man Elon Musk quote-tweeted someone again falsely alleging Hortman was killed by “the left”  and added:
“The far left is murderously violent.” 
The suspect’s “hit list,” according to an official who has seen the list, comprised Minnesotans who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. CNN reported that it also included several abortion clinics, which doesn’t sound like the work of “the left.”
Right-wing influencers marred Hortman’s death and smeared Walz on a pile of lies.
In a different, saner world, they would be humiliated and slink away. But the smart money is that during the next moment of national crisis and mourning, they will again lie for profit.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Several thousand people marched across the Broadway Bridge between Little Rock and North Little Rock on Saturday morning in one of 15 protests statewide as part of a national show of dissent against President Donald Trump’s administration.
Many protest signs displayed the name of the event — “No Kings” — while others criticized specific Trump policies and actions since he began his second term in January, including cuts to the federal workforce, health insurance for low-income people and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. American flags were a common theme — on signs, as capes, taped to umbrellas.
“Our democracy is at risk in every form and fashion that I can think of,” said April Hickman, who attended the protest with her daughter, Jayna. “[A journalist] straight up asked Trump, ‘Do you have to follow the Constitution?’ And he said he didn’t know, and that’s in the oath of office.”
Several cars honked at the marchers on the bridge, formally known as the Veterans Memorial Bridge, drawing cheers from the crowd. 
 Organizers led a series of chants, including “Dump Trump” and “This is what democracy looks like.”

Courtney Maxwell, a protest co-organizer and former Democratic candidate for the Faulkner County Quorum Court, said she expected a maximum of 1,000 protesters and was pleasantly surprised to see more. Unofficial estimates of the turnout ranged from 2,000 to 8,000.
The turnout means Arkansans are “ready for change” and “waking up” in the face of injustice, Maxwell said.
Vietnam War veteran Pat Slaughter said he had never attended a protest before Saturday but felt motivated by the “total abomination” of the Trump administration.
“We fought to stop this type of behavior,” Slaughter said. “…I love my country and I want my country to be safe, and it’s not safe with Felon 47 in the White House.”

Others said they have engaged in past protests, such as one Kylie Woodward attended in 2023 against a bill in the state Legislature that would have restricted drag performances similarly to pornography or strip clubs.
Woodward said Saturday’s turnout was impressive, particularly the number of older adults present.
“They’re fighting against what their generation is ultimately putting onto America,” Woodward said.
One family from Camden made the hour-and-a-half trek to Little Rock as first-time protesters, and said it wouldn’t be their last protest because “we’re not going to survive with [Trump],” Mary Frey said.
“A lot of our friends couldn’t even come because they were Black, they were Chinese, Asian.” Frey said. “So we have come for them.”

 ‘Breaking point’

Little Rock and Fayetteville protest organizers told the Advocate that the two cities’ police departments were aware of their plans for nonviolent organizing. The protest in Little Rock stayed peaceful.
The Democratic Party of Arkansas shared via Facebook photos and videos of several other No Kings demonstrations throughout the state, including Texarkana, Jonesboro, West Memphis, Hot Springs and Harrison.
Other protests were planned for Bentonville, Fort Smith, Monticello, Paragould, Benton/Bryant, Russellville, Eureka Springs and Mountain Home. Protesters in Mountain Home said on Facebook that there were about 300 of them compared to a handful of pro-Trump counterprotesters.
Saturday’s nationwide protest effort coincided with recent tensions in Los Angeles over the arrests of immigrants the Trump administration has claimed are in the country illegally. Ensuing protests have seen occasional violence. 
While many of the Little Rock protesters said it wasn’t their first demonstration, others said the gravity of the current times compelled them to show up. One said he hadn’t protested in years due to his responsibilities as a father, but came to today’s protest with his young family in tow because he felt like “democracy is really on the line.”

At least 2,000 people showed up to the Little Rock 'No Kings Day' protest on Saturday, one of at least 1,500 protests taking place across the U.S. in response to Trump administration actions. Hear and see what Advocate reporters witnessed on the ground as protesters crossed Veterans Memorial Bridge.

Nancy Retas of Little Rock was draped in a Mexican flag and holding two American flags while holding a sign that read: “Practice what you preach: Love thy neighbor.” Retas said that “no one is illegal on stolen land,” adding that her mother “has zero felonies, and Trump has 34.”
Retas, a first-time protester, grinned and laughed when asked about the size of the crowd. 
“I was scared that there would be like a hundred people, but I’m so happy that Arkansas is a part of change and hopefully we continue in that.”
One protester’s sign said “Reduce the federal workforce? Fire ICE,” referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Other signs said, “You can’t spell hatred without red hat,” referring to Trump’s supporters, and “regnat populus,” Arkansas’ state motto, which is Latin for “the people rule.”
Another first-time protester, military veteran Mark Magie, said that his prior service compelled him to attend.
“I believe in the Constitution, and I don’t like what’s happening,” he said. “Some church members where I go to church have come to previous ones and talked about it, and you sort of just reach a breaking point, like I’ve got to do something. And if I can add my voice to the people’s voice, then I think that’s important.”
 ‘Commit to making a difference’

Leaders of Arkansas and Pulaski County Democrats handed out voter registration forms to the marchers and encouraged people to register to vote. Arkansas has consistently had lower voter turnout than most other states.
Grant Tennille, chairman of the Democratic Party of Arkansas, was among those trying to get people registered. He said the day was about sending a message that “we don’t have kings in the United States of America.”
“The crowd is encouraging and incredible,” Tennille said. “I truly believe that one of the most important points of protest is that there are people out here in Arkansas who feel like the people in this crowd; who might be too afraid to stand up. And when they see a crowd of people like this, maybe that helps they to say, ‘Okay, if all those people can do it, I can do it too.’”
Marcus Jones, who ran as a Democrat for Republican U.S. Rep. French Hill’s seat in Congress last year, said the “barrage of confusion that’s coming out of  Washington” is “probably the best reason to stay involved” in political activism.
Jones told rallygoers who convened at Margaret Clark Park on the Little Rock riverfront after the march that he hoped they would take their “righteous anger” and “turn it into action.”
“You’ve got to commit to making a difference in your community,” Jones said. “You’ve got to commit to looking out for your neighbor. You’ve got to commit that you will vote, you will run for office, you will stand up and have your voice heard.”
Andrew Cade Eberly, former state House candidate and current vice chair of the Pulaski County Democratic Party, said the protest taught him and other Democrats what motivates community action.
“We’ve realized we don’t need to have meetings where people show up and get talked at,” Eberly said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Here are some photos to give a better idea of crowd size in Little Rock. Protesters stuck to the pedestrian walkway on one side. The group was much longer than the bridge, taking the better part of an hour for full group to walk across. Likely a few thousand people at peak. @arkansasadvocate.com

Trump’s 79th birthday.
Nearly 30 rallies had been officially planned through the “No Kings” organization page in Montana, including in its largest cities as well as other smaller towns, including Hot Springs (population 617) and Eureka (population 1,533). Facebook postings showed nearly 600 people in Livingston, and an estimated 400 in Lewistown.
In Montana’s largest city, Billings, organizers estimated a crowd in excess of 2,000 people, more than had rallied for democracy just months earlier. During the two-hour event, the crowd centered on the Yellowstone County Courthouse lawn, adjacent from the federal courthouse. Crowds holding signs gathered for several downtown blocks as horns blared in solidarity and in protest.
Speakers and singers rallied the crowd, as signs, flags and even pets wearing outfits created a colorful protest on issues ranging from immigration to taxes to groceries. One sign read: “You wanted cheap eggs, you got measles.”
“We are the richest country on earth at the richest point in the nation’s history,” said Bob Struckman of the AFL-CIO. “Then why are we so broke? It’s not the trans community. It’s not the immigrants. It’s the billionaires. But we know that working people are the ones that solve the problems. We build roads, we teach kids. That’s called diversity, brothers and sisters, and when we get together at the ballot boxes, that’s called democracy.”
Struckman said he was rallying for good jobs, rebuilding the middle class, and staying unified.
Many around the state flocked to the rally, including over 3,000 people in Bozeman, and even close to 200 in Havre.

The scene was in Helena was upbeat, as more than 2,000 attendees spread out over the lawn of the state’s capitol. A Ska band performed before and after speeches. Speakers included former Republican Governor Marc Racicot, who has been outspoken about Trump. Racicot was the former head of the Republican National Party.
“It is as predictable as night following day that Donald Trump will ignore and transgress the ethical and legal boundaries of the law and the Constitution at his whim and caprice,” Racicot said to a roaring crowd. “There is virtually no ethical obligation or moral code that guides or confines his actions, his snide accusations, his sociopathic lies or his brutish behavior. Vengeance and extortion are his weapons of choice to enforce his demands and his only boundaries are the limit of what he wants.”
Racicot’s 10-minute speech was blistering and well received by the crowd. He spoke about Trump’s disregard for laws, expressing his utter distaste the president’s attacks on the judicial system, social security nets and how the President’s actions have disrupted the entire world’s economy.
“We the people, quite frankly, have waited too long in the face of overwhelming evidence to draw and act upon numerous inescapable conclusions, to stand up, stand up and speak out,” Racicot said.
Attacks on the education system, as well as Trump’s stated goal of dismantling the federal Department of Education were mentioned throughout the day. Charlie Snellman, a recent graduate of Capital High School, spoke about his frustration with what his education could end up looking like.
He also spoke about attacks on the arts, including Trump taking over as chairman of the Kennedy Center.
“His goal is to install a golden age for American arts that doesn’t sound golden, it sounds controlled, it sounds stifled, but it sounds like a warning,” Snellman said to the crowd. “This is our call to action, because let’s not forget, after becoming German chancellor in 1933, Hitler and his Ministry of Education sought to control education and the arts in every possible way, Nazi ideology was infused into every aspect of social and private life in Germany. So I ask you, what’s different about our president?”

































































































































































































































Luke Ashmore, who was recently elected as a trustee of the Billings Public Schools, said he wasn’t there representing a political campaign.
“I came for the most important job I have, as a neighbor,” Ashmore said. “Day-to-day action starts right now, building on micro-actions. Make sure you’re talking to your neighbors, and you’re having face-to-face conversations.”
Jennifer Lynn, a native of Wibaux who teaches history and politics at Montana State University-Billings, is an expert on 20th Century Germany.
“There are dangerous and real parallels between now and 20th Century Germany,” she said, including dehumanizing immigrants, women and targeting the LGBTQ+ community. “The lessons that I try to teach all of my students is: Beware of the beginnings. Donald Trump has told us who he is and what he wants. This is not inevitable — we can fight, resist and defend our Constitution.”
Pastor Lisa Harmon, who has been a leader in Billings for decades, and works at the First Congregational church in the heart of the downtown, across from the courthouse, said that for her, the moment felt like the biblical story of the Pentecost.
“When people from different backgrounds and different languages felt a wind sweeping over them and a message in their own native language, in that moment, it didn’t flatten their identity, it lifted them up; it lifted each voice. It was about a king, it was promoting peace and justice and today, it feels like that kind of day,” she said. “There is power in and among the people. People are diverse in story and body.
“A complex and complicated people were building something more beautiful and more free. It reminds us that no law and no border can undo our belonging to each other. Liberty is your birthright, and we have something more powerful than a throne — we have each other.”
 



  Protesting the protestors 

Though most of the protestors and rally-goers at the “No Kings” events were there to oppose the military parade in Washington, D.C., and object to President Donald J. Trump, intermingled in the sea of signs were a few people holding “Make America Great Again” signs, and other placards expressing support for the policies of the Republicans.
Pat Curry stood across the street from most of the protesters, wearing his Trump t-shirt, and buttons, including one Trump that had a shock of beige-orange hair.

He admitted he was outnumbered, just like the last time, but showed up, he said, to rally for common-sense and to support the president.
Curry said he’s been pleased with how the second Trump presidency has handled issues, including stopping transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports, as well as keeping bathrooms separate.
“I’m 6-foot, six and 250 pounds. Can you imagine me playing sports with women?” he asked.
He said that he’s also proud that Trump is standing up for freedom, including not being required to get a vaccine.
“The government shouldn’t tell me that I have to get a shot in order to keep a job that I have had for 20 years,” Curry said.
He also said that he’s happy to see the Trump administration return to common sense when it comes to sex.
“People don’t know if they’re a man or a woman, and they’re all focused on sex,” he said. “But then when they do have sex, they want to kill at the babies.”
Nearby, Lucinda Splitstone stood holding a sign supporting Immigration and Customs and “backing the blue.”
“If we don’t speak up for our rights, who will?” she said. “And no one is standing up for them.”
In one minor incident in Helena, a Trump supporter sounded a large horn in a parking lot reserved for legislators during the event.

Mike Cernovich, another right-wing influencer who has 1.4 million followers on X, took Rugg’s post and amped it up, but in the “just asking questions” style of many conspiracy theories: 
“Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”
They were deeply ignorant about the MinnesotaCare issue. 
Walz and Hortman — who was instrumental in passing legislation allowing undocumented people to sign up for MinnesotaCare as speaker of the House in 2023 — negotiated a compromise with Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature to end eligibility for adults, but keep it for children. They did so to win necessary Republican support in the 67-67 House to pass a state budget. Without it, state government would have shut down on July 1. 
Both Hortman and Walz signed the compromise agreement in mid-May. This week, Hortman spoke tearfully about how difficult the vote was for her, but she was bound to vote yes on the issue because of the prior agreement. 
Rugg and Cernovich’s posts were shared widely and just the start of the disinformation.
Once law enforcement sources began revealing a suspect, right-wing influencers ran with an insignificant detail: That Vance Luther Boelter was a “Walz appointee.” 
Like many states, but even more so here, Minnesota is home to hundreds of nonpartisan and bipartisan boards and commissions, which are composed of thousands of people who typically win the appointment by simply volunteering. There are currently 342 open positions on Minnesota boards and commissions. Boelter was appointed to the Workforce Development Council by Walz’s predecessor Gov. Mark Dayton and reappointed by Walz. 
It was the equivalent of calling a Sunday school volunteer an “appointee of the bishop.” 
No matter, the Murdoch media machine, specifically the New York Post, had their headline: “Former appointee of Tim Walz sought….” 
Cernovich had his greasy foil hot dog wrapper and began constructing a hat: 
“The Vice President candidate for the Democrat party is directly connected to a domestic terrorist, that is confirmed, the only question is whether Tim Walz himself ordered the political hit against a rival who voted against Walz’s plan to give free healthcare to illegals.”
Walz had no such plan. He had signed an agreement to end eligibility for undocumented adults. 
Joey Mannarino, who has more than 600,000 followers on X, was more crass: 
“Rumor has it she was preparing to switch parties. The Democrats are VIOLENT SCUM.”
It was a ridiculous “rumor.” One of the last photos of Hortman alive was an image of her at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor’s big annual fundraising event, the Humphrey-Mondale dinner, which took place just hours before her assassination. 
No matter, Cernovich wanted his new friends in federal law enforcement to act:  
“The FBI must take Tim Walz into custody immediately.”
Finally, fresh off his humiliating defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump, world’s richest man Elon Musk quote-tweeted someone again falsely alleging Hortman was killed by “the left”  and added: 
“The far left is murderously violent.” 
The suspect’s “hit list,” according to an official who has seen the list, comprised Minnesotans who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. CNN reported that it also included several abortion clinics, which doesn’t sound like the work of “the left.” 
Right-wing influencers marred Hortman’s death and smeared Walz on a pile of lies. 
In a different, saner world, they would be humiliated and slink away. But the smart money is that during the next moment of national crisis and mourning, they will again lie for profit.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1148108350-1024x812.jpg,,,2025-06-14 19:01:34.912065

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Thousands of South Carolinians who oppose the Trump administration poured onto the Statehouse grounds as part of a national Flag Day protest in all 50 states.
The coast-to-coast “No Kings” protests on Saturday, held on a day celebrating the official adoption of the American flag by the Second Continental Congress, coincided with President Donald Trump’s birthday and a major military parade on the streets of Washington, D.C., to honor the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.

In addition to the rally in South Carolina’s Capital City, thousands attended similar events across the Palmetto State, including Greenville in the Upstate, Charleston and Summerville in the Lowcountry and the Charlotte suburb of Rock Hill, area media outlets reported.
The protests went on with no reports of violence or acts of destruction despite earlier concerns and a warning issued ahead of the events by S.C. Attorney General Alan Wilson.

Protesters in Columbia filled the lawn and lined the street from corner to corner in front of the Statehouse as afternoon temperatures climbed to nearly 90 degrees. They waived American flags and hoisted signs with slogans on a host of issues, including deportation of immigrants, cuts to Medicaid, threats to civil liberties and democracy and attacks on the LGBTQ+ community.
For Tessa Gonzalez, her 8-year-old daughter, Ana Sofia, and concerns over potential cuts to Medicaid were her motivation for attending the demonstration.
The young girl has a rare genetic mutation, known as CASK, and requires a specialized wheelchair and nutritional formula.
“My daughter, 100% depends on Medicaid to provide the medicine, equipment, everything that she needs to lead a happy, healthy life,” said Gonzalez, a pediatrician from Elgin. “So it’s essential.”
With her wheelchair and other equipment, Ana Sofia is able to go to school and attend events in the community. She particularly enjoys swimming and splashing in the water, Gonzalez said. And she loves music. Her favorite song is “APT” by Bruno Mars.
The Gonzalez family carries private insurance to help cover Ana Sofia’s cost of care. But Medicaid covers things private insurance does not, like the $20,000 wheelchair she needs and which has to be upgraded every few years.

Brown said his deepest concerns are transgender rights and immigration. “I think it’s important for us to have a loud voice and be visible because there are so many who can’t speak for themselves,” he said. (Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)
“She would just have to be in the house and never out, never doing anything,” Gonzalez said. “She has a sister and a family who absolutely loves her. I don’t know what we’d do without her.”
Events like the protest on Saturday lets the family know they’re not alone in their concerns, Gonzalez said.
“There are so many of us who are feeling similarly,” she said. “But we have to make our voices heard, whether that’s calling our representatives, coming out to rallies. We can’t just sit by and let all of this happen. We have to take action.”
Kevin Brown, of Columbia, attended the protest Saturday in support of the transgender community.
The 41-year-old business owner said he has friends who are transgender.
“These are people I know and I’m scared for them,” he said. “I think it’s important for us to have a loud voice and be visible because there are so many who can’t speak for themselves.”
A trio of friends from Lexington, Jake Yanity, Sean McCall and Sebastian Albert, said they were angered by the estimated $25 million to $45 million military place taking place at the same time in Washington, D.C. They felt the money would be better spent on improving K-12 education or funding national park operations.
“That’s a lot of money; that could fund a lot of schools,” said Albert, who is 22-years-old and recently graduated from college.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Thousands of North Dakotans in 10 cities joined the national No Kings protest movement Saturday, with organizers saying they saw new faces joining the effort to oppose Donald Trump’s policies.
Kathy Bullinger of Bismarck showed up at the state Capitol grounds with her two sons, including one who has disabilities. She said she worries her son’s care could be affected if proposed Medicaid cuts are implemented. 
Bullinger, a longtime teacher, also is concerned about the elimination of the Department of Education. An organizer estimated the Bismarck crowd to be about 1,700.
“People are nervous and they’re tired,” she said. “They are here today because of that and I’m one of them.”

Organizers estimated about 3,000 gathered at City Hall in Fargo, while smaller protests were held in Grand Forks, Jamestown, Bottineau, Devils Lake, Dickinson, Williston and Minot. A No Kings group also walked in the Valley City Community Days parade on Saturday. 
The movement served as counter-programming to Trump’s military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, which commemorated the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army and also fell on Trump’s 79th birthday. 
In Devils Lake, organizer Julie Schuler said about 80 people joined the protest, double the turnout of two recent local rallies.
“What was so exciting was that there were so many new faces,” said Schuler, who is involved with a recently formed local group known as Voters for Democracy.
Participants gathered outside the Lake Region Heritage Museum and took turns with a microphone sharing stories about why they joined the rally.
“I was so impressed with the stories that were shared, whether it was from a farming situation or whether it was just from pure fear out of what’s going on with our administration,” Schuler said.
In Jamestown, about 180 people met at the top of Mill Hill where they had a moment of prayer before marching with signs and singing “America the Beautiful” and other songs, said organizer Lily Cizadlo.
“I’ve watched the numbers grow in every turnout, so that’s been very exciting,” Cizadlo said.

At the Bismarck event, Cheryll Rush, 79, of Hazen said she was embarrassed to reveal her age because she is the same age that Trump turned on Saturday. Rush said she protested in the 1960s and 1970s and she believes the country is moving backward.
“We’ve become a police state with his ICE,” Rush said. “It’s un-American.”
Rush said Hazen and Bismarck are Republican-leaning towns, but she was reinvigorated by the large crowd of demonstrators pushing back. 
Dyllon Faul of Bismarck attended Bismarck’s Capitol Pride festival Saturday and also stood with the protesters along the roadway.
“With how our commander-in-chief is behaving, we need somebody that is in political office that is going to represent the people in an ethical, moral way, and I don’t see that happening,” Faul said.

At Fargo’s event, which also drew participants from neighboring Minnesota, Jacob Pruneda of Fargo was wrapped in a Mexican flag. 
“We didn’t vote for this,” he said. “The Constitution protects rights for all.”
Lyn Dockter-Pinnick, an organizer for Indivisible Fargo-Moorhead, said the increase in activism recently is noticeable.
“There’s just so many issues and the more people become aware of the fact that this is going to impact me, the more people want to get involved,” she said. “Action is truly the antidote for despair.”
No major incidents were immediately reported at the North Dakota rallies. 
In Bismarck, a handful of counter-protesters assembled on the opposite side of the street as the No Kings demonstrators.

Charles Tuttle, a conservative who was attending the North Dakota Republican Party reorganization meeting across the street from the protest, waved a large American flag with Trump’s face screen printed over the stars and stripes.
“We should always stand up for what we believe in,” Tuttle said. “We should all be able to be out here without being antagonistic to each other.”
A vehicle with Pennsylvania plates sped at least four times past the Bismarck event with a passenger making obscene gestures and screaming a racial slur at the crowd. In Fargo, a truck blared its horn for part of the event in an attempt to drown out the speaker. In Devils Lake, a motorcyclist yelled at the protest group, but participants responded by chanting “USA.”
Elijah Robinson, a Chicagoan spending his summer in North Dakota for an internship, also joined the Fargo rally. He said as Black person, there is a tradition of standing up for one’s rights, though he said it was his first protest. 
“I’m glad they had it. I’m glad it remained peaceful,” Robinson said.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)NEW ORLEANS – Costumes, brass bands and even makeshift floats followed a twisting parade route Saturday in one of hundreds of “No Kings” protests across the country, meant to coincide and counter events in Washington, D.C., for President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday and the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.
Thousands assembled in sweltering heat at a vacant lot in the historic Marigny neighborhood, adjacent to the French Quarter. The city block-sized property slowly emptied as organizers led the crowd down residential streets, with police blocking traffic at intersections along the way to a culminating rally in Washington Square Park. Tourists and locals along Frenchmen Street, including passengers on a mule-drawn carriage, unknowingly became part of the procession.
“No kings! No Trump!” a man shouted from his balcony, drawing cheers from the crowd below.  
More than 30 minutes after speeches began at the rally, elements of the parade were still arriving to the park. Pro LGBTQ+ marchers and their signs were prominent among the anti-Trump displays, with the annual Nola Pride Fest also bringing them to the city for the weekend.   
At the rally, Margaret Woodward, with the group Citizens for the Constitution, held a small copy of the nation’s founding document as she addressed the growing crowd. 
“The president is holding his big ugly display tonight because he is afraid of this, afraid of the constraints that it puts on his power,” Woodward said, gesturing toward her U.S. Constitution booklet. “And he wants to make a military show that frightens you into forgetting about his limitations.”
“Are you gonna forget?” she asked the crowd, prompting a resounding “no” in response.

New Orleans flavor permeated its No Kings event, with Scott and Janet Howard among the many participants who donned costumes for the occasion. Both are well known in New Orleans business and civic circles; he’s a retired bank executive, and she’s the former leader of a local good-government watchdog group. 
The Howards wore cardboard tanks, reminiscent of those set to roll through the nation’s capital later in the day.
“We’re actually able to produce tanks for the government at $68 a piece,” Janet Howard said, crediting her husband’s costume craftsmanship.
Two men in the parade had crafted a small, U-shaped countertop, which they called the Tiny D Diner, towed by a bicycle they took turns riding. They invited paraders to “Smash ICE,” pulling out cubes for them to hammer on the counter’s surface.    
Like most parades in the city – and with no small amount of irony – No Kings had a queen: songwriter-musician Dusky Waters (the stage name for Jenn Jeffers), who told the rally crowd about how her grandmother and aunt desegregated all-white schools in Arkansas. She sang “We Shall Overcome” as the tail end of the parade was just arriving at the square.
Other No Kings gatherings in Louisiana took place in Alexandria, Baton Rouge, Covington, Lafayette, Lake Charles, Leesville, Monroe, Ruston and Shreveport.
Friday night, before the No Kings events and the D.C. celebration took place, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a pro-Trump Republican, posted on social media that she would take a hard line against any protests she determined to cross the line. She referenced ongoing demonstrations in Los Angeles, where the president has wrested control of the California National Guard to quell opposition to federal immigration enforcement.     
“The First Amendment guarantees the right to peacefully assemble and petition the government – it does NOT protect anarchy, vandalism, or rioting,” Murrill wrote. “This isn’t California. I’ll defend constitutionally-protected activity, but I’ll prosecute criminal actions.”
Casting a pall over the No Kings protests and pro-Trump ceremonies were the early morning shooting deaths of a leading Democratic state lawmaker and her husband in Minnesota. State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed at their home, and Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, who live minutes away, were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening, the Minnesota Reformer reports. 
Gov. Tim Walz has called Hortman’s murder a “politically motivated assassination. Authorities have said a 57-year-old man impersonating a police officer is suspected in both shootings.
Murrill and Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry have condemned the killings on social media.

Trump vowed on social media it would occur “rain or shine,” given weather forecasts calling for showers.According to the Army, 6,700 soldiers were expected to march. Crowds could also expect to see 150 tactical vehicles and weapons systems. Together the parade and festival cost between $25 million and $45 million, according to the Army.But tragedy and deep conflict marked the hours and days leading to the event. Early Saturday, a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband were assassinated in their home in an “act of political violence,” said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, while another legislator and his wife were shot and gravely wounded.Late Friday, dozens of veterans breached barricades around the U.S. Capitol in protest of the Army parade. On Thursday, a Democratic U.S. senator from California was handcuffed and forcibly removed from a press conference with the head of Homeland Security.Last weekend, multi-day protests erupted in Los Angeles after immigration raids swept across several Home Depots, typically where undocumented day laborers search for work, as Trump’s mass deportations continue to be carried out.And the president is in a legal standoff with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, after Trump ordered more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to be sent to LA without Newsom’s consent and Newsom sued. A federal appeals court froze a lower court’s order directing Trump to return command of the Guard troops to Newsom.‘Yeah, I wanna be there’In Washington, spectators from across the country began lining barriers along the Army parade route hours before the event's start.Scott Aiken, 59, of Athens, Georgia, drove 10 hours for the parade. Aiken, who told States Newsroom he voted for Trump in the last three presidential elections, said he wanted to support the anniversary of the Army.

“My father was in the Army, and my wife's father was in the Army, and we're a supportive military family. And when I heard the parade was going to happen, I thought, ‘Yeah, I wanna be there.’ So we drove up from Athens on Thursday, and did the Capitol tour yesterday, and here we are.”When asked about the timing of Trump's birthday, Aiken said “whether it's on his birthday or not, I don't care. That's not the purpose of this.”Members of Trump’s Cabinet and other allies on social media posted well wishes and greetings. “Wishing a very happy birthday to our incredible President Donald J. Trump!” Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem posted on X. Trump said on his social media site, Truth Social, “President Putin called this morning to very nicely wish me a Happy Birthday, but to more importantly, talk about Iran,” referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and a recent attack by Israel on Iran’s military leaders.Not everyone at the parade was wishing Trump well. Angelica Zetino, 24, and Shoshauna Brooks, 27, from Rockville and Gaithersburg, Maryland, stood out among the crowd as they carried signs protesting Trump's administration, particularly recent immigration raids.The pair began their morning at a “No Kings” protest in Rockville before heading to D.C.“They (the administration) just want to put on a show, which is OK, but we're here to support the people that can't have a voice for themselves,” Brooks said.Rallies opposing TrumpThroughout Saturday, protests unfolded across the U.S. bearing the theme “No Kings” to decry Trump’s military display on his own birthday and the mass immigration arrests.The “No Kings” national organizers said in a press release that as of 2 p.m. Eastern, protesters had rallied at more than 1,500 sites across the country, with 600 more events scheduled through the rest of the day. “No Kings” was organized by liberal groups and labor unions including Indivisible, the American Federation of Teachers, American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen, MoveOn, 50501, Interfaith Alliance, Stand Up America, Common Defense, Human Rights Campaign and League of Conservation Voters.Approximately 60 protesters were arrested outside the U.S. Capitol Friday evening, according to the U.S. Capitol Police. Veterans for Peace, a group that organized the demonstration, posted photos of the arrests and of several demonstrators wearing “Veterans Against Fascists” t-shirts.Police said 75 people peacefully demonstrated outside of the U.S. Supreme Court.“A short time later, approximately 60 people from the group left the Supreme Court so as a precaution, our officers began establishing a perimeter,” a police spokesperson told States Newsroom in an email. “A few people pushed the bike rack down and illegally crossed the police line while running towards the Rotunda Steps. Our officers immediately blocked the group and began making arrests.”Among those arrested was an elderly Vietnam veteran using a walker, Capitol Police confirmed.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on June 10 that any protests at the military parade “will be met with very heavy force.”Two mules and a dogA trickle of red “Make America Great Again” hats and apparel displaying support for the Army intermingled as supporters shuffled into the parade grounds Saturday afternoon.The parade featured soldiers from every division, 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, 34 horses, two mules and one dog, at a price tag in the tens of millions of dollars, according to the Army.Among the vehicles and equipment that are expected to roll down Constitution Avenue between 15th and 23rd streets NW were Abrams tanks, first used in 1991 for Operation Desert Storm; High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, used to launch multiple rockets at precise aim from far distances; and 9,500-pound titanium M777 lightweight Howitzers that fire 105-pound shells up to 24 miles and are currently in use on Ukraine’s battlefields.

Army Golden Knights were set to parachute down to the White House South Lawn to present Trump with a folded flag.D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed concern in the weeks leading up to the parade about the heavy tactical vehicles causing damage to the city’s streets. The Army Corps of Engineers had installed large steel plates ahead of the event to reinforce the roads.The parade coincided with the Army’s 250th birthday celebration festival, which has been in the works for a year.The parade appears to have been a late addition to the festivities. According to documentation obtained by local D.C. news outlet WTOP, America250 applied on March 31 for a permit for the parade. A May 21 press release about the parade from America250, which describes itself as a “nonprofit supporting organization to the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission,” celebrated Trump’s role in the event.Trump wanted a military parade during his first term, but the idea was dismissed because of cost, NBC reported at the time.The last time the U.S. staged a celebratory military parade was in 1991 under former President George H.W. Bush to recognize the victory in the first Gulf War.Immigration enforcement and military The big Army celebration early in Trump’s second term came as the president has intertwined the U.S. military with his immigration policy, as shown in LA and elsewhere.In his first days in office, Trump signed five executive orders that laid out the use of military forces within the U.S. borders and extended other executive powers to speed up the president’s immigration crackdown.He’s directed the Department of Defense to use a naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to detain migrants. Military planes have been used in deportations – rather than standard commercial airplanes.In April, he signed a proclamation creating a military buffer zone that stretches across Arizona, California and New Mexico just north of the U.S.-Mexico border. It means any migrant crossing into the United States would be trespassing on a military base, therefore allowing active-duty troops to hold them until U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive.National and military experts have raised concerns that giving control over the Roosevelt Reservation to the military could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that generally prohibits the military from being used in domestic law enforcement. A statutory exception in the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, is the Insurrection Act of 1807.Trump has considered invoking the Insurrection Act, but has stopped short. The Insurrection Act is an existing presidential authority that would grant the president access to use all federal military forces, more than 1 million members.The Insurrection Act has only been invoked 30 times, and is typically focused on an area of great civil unrest that has overwhelmed law enforcement.The last time a president used it was 1992, during the Los Angeles riots, after four white police officers were acquitted in the brutal beating of Black motorist Rodney King.In calling in the National Guard in LA last week, Trump cited a rarely used statute known as the protective power –  10 U.S.C. 12406 – to use National Guard troops to protect federal personnel and property, but not for broad law enforcement functions.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-06-14 18:01:27.590312

Among the speakers at the rally was Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), who expressed her support for the Detroit community in resisting the current federal administration.
“When I look at all of you, you don’t have to have a ZIP code in Detroit to understand that fascism hurts all of us. Many of you have your stance in why you’re here,” Tlaib told the crowd “Maybe immigrant rights. Maybe Free Free Palestine. Maybe LGBTQ. Maybe it’s fighting to make sure workers are protected. Maybe saying you will not dismantle education in our country. Whatever issue, the more we are connected, the more dangerous we become to this administration.”

Tlaib emphasized support for immigrant families affected by federal border agents, not only in Michigan but also across the country. She also commented on how tax dollars are contributing to the war in Gaza.
“That’s why you all are doing what you’re doing and resisting. In the streets and demanding that our families stick together, demanding that our rights be protected, demanding that our country come back for the people, by the people. It’s when you all resist.” Tlaib said.
As speakers addressed the attendees, some counter protesters approached, sparking minor clashes involving shoving and insults, which volunteer protesters helped disperse. Detroit Police arrived minutes later, but no arrests were reported. However, individual pro-Trump counter protesters kept walking through the crowd.

The Detroit gathering was one of dozens held across Michigan and more than 1,500 nationally. Other Michigan cities hosting protests included Flint, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Ferndale, and even as far away as Ironwood in the western Upper Peninsula.
In Lansing, several thousand people turned out for a protest in front of the Michigan State Capitol, as protestors held anti-Trump signs and waved American flags. The crowd later marched down Michigan Avenue to Cedar Street and then turned around and returned to the Capitol, where a No Kings carnival was being held.
Small Michigan communities also saw well attended protests, including in Republican-heavy Livingston County.
Approximately 300 protestors gathered in front of Howell City Hall where they were mostly cheered on by passing motorists. One of the protestors, Roni Evans of Howell, told the Michigan Advance she felt compelled to be there.

“It makes me sad. I protested a lot when I was younger and did rallies and campaigns, but I’m feeling so frustrated with what’s going on in this country that I had to come out,” Evans said.
At one point, a large pickup truck stopped on Grand River in front of the protest where the driver began revving its engine. However, a Howell Police officer quickly told him to move on.

The protestors later marched through downtown Howell and were cheered on as they passed by the Historic Courthouse, where a Pride rally was being held by the Pride Alliance of Livingston.
Meanwhile, just down I-96 in Brighton, several thousand demonstrators packed into the city’s Mill Pond area to hear from several speakers, including Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel.

“At the end of the day, there is right and wrong. There is moral and immorality. At the end of all of our lives, the one question we’ll be asked is ‘What did we do in this moment?’ These rallies are important, but they have to lead to action,” Hertel told the crowd to loud cheers.

Melissa Hortman talks to colleagues during a special legislative session Monday, June 9, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Hortman’s husband was also shot and killed, the governor said.
Walz, appearing emotional at a press conference in the north metro, said they were killed in an apparent “politically motivated assassination.”
“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
On Saturday afternoon, authorities asked for the public’s assistance in locating Vance Luther Boelter, the suspect connected with the shootings. They said he was last seen Saturday morning in Minneapolis wearing a dark long-sleeved shirt and a cowboy hat.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list. According to an official who has seen the list, the targets included prominent pro-choice individuals in Minnesota, including many Democratic lawmakers who have been outspoken about their policy positions.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
According to a source close to Walz, the governor spoke to Vice President J.D. Vance about the targeted attacks in Minnesota. The governor thanked the vice president for the coordination between federal law enforcement and Minnesota public safety officials.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

The crowd covered the Capitol steps, filled the section of Jefferson Street in front of the building and stretched deep and wide throughout nearby Cecil D. Andrus Park as people chanted “No more kings” and “Love, not hate, makes Idaho great.”
Tammie Baker was one of thousands who attended the protest. She carried a homemade sign that read “I prefer my ICE crushed” and said her concern over the Trump administration’s policies motivated her to attend her first political protest since the 1970s.
“There is only one reason,” Baker said. “ Enough is enough of everything. This is out of control.”
“There is not much one person can do, but you have to start somewhere,” Baker added.
The “No Kings Day” protest in Boise was one of hundreds of similar protests that took place across the country Saturday. 
Separate “No Kings Day” rallies were planned for Saturday in other Idaho communities as well, including Nampa, Pocatello, Moscow, McCall, Driggs, Coeur d’Alene, Twin Falls and Idaho Falls. 
The “No Kings Day” protests coincided with President Donald Trump’s birthday and a military parade celebrating the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday held in Washington, D.C.
Additionally, a patriotic demonstration voicing support for Trump was also planned for the Idaho Falls area on Saturday, East Idaho News reported.

 Idaho 50501 group helped organize Saturday’s anti-Trump protest

The activist group Idaho 50501 organized Saturday’s “No Kings Day” rally in Boise, saying it sought to peacefully demonstrate against the glorification of individual power over collective liberty. The event included live music and several speeches from local organizers.
“This is about more than one man. It’s about standing against the idea that power belongs to the few,” local organizer Chris Ross said in a written statement before the protest. “We are gathering to defend democracy, dignity and the right to dissent. Remember: when you think for yourself, you are dangerous to tyrants.”

The group is part of the wider 50501 movement, which got its name for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement.
Gretchen Bingea of Garden City attended Saturday’s “No King Day” protest in Boise because she was concerned about ICE raids, the federal budget reconciliation bill, a rise in authoritarianism and the policies enacted by Trump.
Bingea, who said she has been to several similar rallies and protests, carried a sign that read “If there’s money for a parade then there’s money for Medicaid!”
When a reporter with the Idaho Capital Sun asked Bingea if she had a message for any policymakers listening, she said, “Do your job, they are not standing up to Trump.”
Although she is frustrated with Trump and many other elected officials, Bingea said she was heartened by the size of the crowd that filled the grounds surrounding the Idaho State Capitol on Saturday.
“It’s encouraging that people are paying attention; people know how serious this is,” Bingea said. “Power belongs to the people.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Thousands of people flocked to Nashville’s Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park for a “No Kings” protest Saturday despite gloomy skies, clutching signs decrying Donald Trump and his administration, denouncing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and advocating for due process.
The crowd quickly exceeded the capacity of the park’s amphitheater in view of the Tennessee State Capitol and spilled out over much of the park’s grass field. Ultimately, swaths of protesters young and old lined the sidewalks of Rosa L. Parks Boulevard and Jefferson Street near the park, chanting to drivers honking their horns as they drove by.
Chants of “This is what democracy looks like” and “USA, no Trump, no KKK, no racists” filled the park as people carrying signs and American flags made their way toward the streets.
The protest was organized by Indivisible Nashville, a group that supports progressive policies and resists what it calls “the Trump agenda” under the umbrella of Indivisible Tennessee. 
The event was one of thousands planned across the country as part of the “No Kings Day of Defiance,” scheduled to roughly coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C. marking the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary. The controversial military parade also falls on Flag Day and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday. In Tennessee, a total of 24 cities planned to participate.
The Nashville demonstration was peaceful, with some attendees playing music and dancing in the park. Volunteers wearing neon vests directed protesters to stay out of the streets and handed out water bottles to combat the humid weather.
A handful of counter-protesters, some wearing holsters, walked among the demonstrators with their own signs. One man yelled, “Donald Trump is y’all’s president too,” as he walked against the flow of the crowd. Another man near him held a sign that read, “Kamala LOST, Trump WON, JESUS is KING.”
Metro Nashville police arrested one masked counter-protester carrying a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag after people reported that he pulled what appeared to be a handgun out of its holster. 
State leaders spoke of love, hope, determination
Tennessee state Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, was among the speakers who kicked off the event. He nodded to the Army’s 250th anniversary and Flag Day.
“Flag Day is not a day for ceremonial gift wrapping for the President’s birthday. It’s not something that you put on a politician’s lapel while they vote to take away healthcare to give billionaires tax cuts … It’s not just about celebrating the flag; it’s about figuring out what it means, what it stands for,” Yarbro said. 
“And this group, we’re here today for the flag that 250 years ago fought against tyranny, took on and took down slavery, for the flag that liberated Europe from Nazis, for the flag that for generations, has been used to demand that we live up to our highest ideals and not our basest, lowest instinct,” he said.
Luis Mata, a former Democratic candidate who unsuccessfully ran for a Tennessee House of Representatives seat representing Smyrna, spoke as part of the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition, recalling his childhood growing up without legal immigration status in Tennessee before he became a U.S. citizen.
  “We’re here today for the flag that 250 years ago fought against tyranny, took on and took down slavery, for the flag that liberated Europe from Nazis,” said Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat.
“This meant living in a different kind of reality, a reality where our entire being was used to fuel an unpopular anti-immigrant agenda trickling from the White House to our state legislature, and right now, immigrants are being used as pawns in a broader attack on our democracy, with those in power putting themselves above the law, erasing due process, disappearing our neighbors, and silencing anybody who dares to speak up,” Mata said.
He told a cheering crowd in the amphitheater that “social movements are born out of pain, but they are sustained through love.”
“Right now it is dark, and right now it is scary, but one thing that they forget is that we are the recipients of generations of organizers who refused to lose hope … who showed us that the strongest movements are fueled by the hopes of everyday working-class people, the courage to resist and the … unwavering commitment to a long-term vision that demands us showing up each and every day, organizing each and every day, election cycle after election cycle, legislative session after legislative session,” Mata said.
Before protesters made their way to the sidewalks lining the streets, a representative from Indivisible Nashville delivered a call to action: “Call your senators and tell them to kill this big bogus bill, and denounce ICE,” a reference to Immigration and Naturalization Enforcement. The budget reconciliation bill was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives but remains under Senate consideration.
On the outskirts of the park an hour later, Cathy Corley and Heather Argo stood together on a grassy hill overlooking the park and the state capitol building. 
Corley, wearing an “I stand with Ukraine” T-shirt and a glittery Uncle Sam-style hat, said seeing what is happening in the country is painful. 
“It is wonderful to be with like-minded people, and see that there is hope,” she said of Saturday’s protest.
Argo came from Franklin to join Corley at Bicentennial Park, though she questions if protests truly lead to change.  While people continue protesting, she said, President Donald Trump “keeps keeping on.”
“What can we honestly do to make a change?” Argo asked. “I don’t think anybody has an answer for that.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The attacks on two prominent Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses, leaving two wounded and two dead in a “politically motivated assassination,” sent shockwaves across the country, including in Utah.
House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who the Minnesota Reformer called one of the state’s most influential elected officials of the past decade, was shot and killed alongside her husband in their home overnight Saturday by a man impersonating a police officer. 
An emotional Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the deaths a “politically motivated assassination,” mourning Hortman as a “formidable public servant” and a dear friend.
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their home. Walz said that following surgery, there is cautious optimism they will recover.
Minnesota House Democratic leader dead after ‘politically motivated assassination’

In Utah, Democratic legislative leaders said they are “heartbroken and outraged by the targeted political violence” against Hortman, Hoffman and their families.
“As leaders, we had the opportunity to work with Representative Melissa Hortman. Representative Hortman was a strong voice for equity, environmental justice, and the most vulnerable in her state. She was a fierce advocate for reproductive rights and for all Minnesotans. Her loss is immeasurable,” Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla and House Minority Leader Angela Romero, both Salt Lake Democrats, said in a joint statement Saturday.
Escamilla and Romero offered their condolences to the Minnesota lawmakers’ families, loved ones and legislative colleagues, and denounced political violence and hate.
“No one, elected or not, should ever fear for their safety when expressing their beliefs or serving their communities. We urge leaders at every level to recognize the tragedy of this moment and commit to deflating divisive and harmful rhetoric in our communities,” Escamilla and Romero’s statement said.
An additional statement from the Utah Senate Democratic Caucus echoed that message, while honoring the work that Hortman and Hoffman did in office.
“These legislators fiercely advocated for their constituents with a strong and courageous voice for equity, equality and accurate representation,” their statement said.
In a post on X, Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox called the shooting “a heartbreaking reminder of what happens when we allow hatred to replace our shared humanity.”
“In a free society, disagreement is inevitable. Violence is not. We must recommit to the virtues that hold us together—and to the conviction that every person, regardless of politics, deserves our respect,” Cox wrote. 
The message from Utah Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, was similar, saying: “This is a profoundly sad day, not just for Minnesota but for our entire nation. This senseless act of violence is unacceptable. We may not always agree, but violence is never the answer. My prayers are with the families, friends and colleagues affected by this horrific event.”

(Photo by Tom Foley/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Scores of Iowans gathered at the State Capitol Saturday for the No Kings protest to counter President Donald Trump’s  birthday military parade. This demonstration is one of about 1,800 worldwide and one of 35 across the state of Iowa. 
The protest was held in response to Trump’s birthday celebration, which is expected to cost around $25 million to $45 million, according to the U.S. Army spokesperson Heather J. Hagan and the administration’s military response protesters in Los Angeles.
“He’s spending all this money on one day and Iowans are literally starving, losing their health care and dying. And it’s ridiculous,” said Sue Dinsdale, executive director of Iowa Citizen Action Network.

She was joined by disability rights activist Julie Russell Stewart, Iowa Federation of Labor President Charlie Wishman, Ivette Muhammad with Creative Visions, Keenan Crow from One Iowa and Rep. Rob Johnson of Des Moines.
“This my friends, this is power,” Wishman said. “Power doesn’t lie in the government, power lies in you.”
The event began with a statement of community guidelines, where organizers expressed an emphasis on peaceful protest and deescalation. The opening statements were followed by a rendition of “America the Beautiful” by two-time Iowa Blues Challenge winner Tina Findley.
“The rule of law is important to me and our president is trying to push that beyond the acceptable limits and we should be protesting,” said Alison Lemke, a retired speech pathologist from Newton.
Lemke and her husband, John Easley, drove into the Capitol to express their support of the protest. Easley said those who gathered could number anywhere between 5,000 and 10,000.
 The couple was at the first No Kings protest, which Easley said hosted around 3,000 protesters, but “was much smaller.” Dinsdale says around 2,000 signed up but “they just keep coming and coming.”
“No matter who you look like or who you love, everyone has a place here today,” Dinsdale said. “It doesn’t have to happen to you for it to matter to you.”

The event coincided with a military parade in Washington, D.C., ostensibly for the Army’s 250th anniversary, but also for President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday, and in the aftermath of a week that featured military deployment by Trump to Los Angeles immigration protests.
In Santa Fe, crowds swelled as the temperatures rose at the state Capitol, where protesters began the day with multiple speakers and performers. State police estimated — when asked by Source NM — approximately 1,200 attendees in the area, but an accurate head count was hard to come by, as crowds also circled the Capitol, with some protesters marching to the Plaza and back.
As of early afternoon, police said no incidents had been reported, other than a few people “collapsing” from the heat. Fire fighters in the area with medical personnel would not confirm to Source that anyone had collapsed, but said a few medical situations — none emergency-level — had occurred.

Hot or not, attendees held signs embracing the “No Kings” theme of the day, while also holding ones protesting attacks on immigrants; the war in Gaza; and assaults on gay and trans lives, among numerous other issues.
New Mexico’s Raging Grannies provided song sheets once again for a reworking of “We Shall Not Be Moved,” which included the lyrics:
“Racist deportations, Nazi policies
hunting down the people, acting lawlessly
We will be free! We say no to tyranny!
We shall not be moved.”
One of the event organizers, Julie Zimber, who said she works with Santa Fe’s Indivisible groups and is “in touch” with the national 50501 organization behind the national protests, said her main “mission is to do outreach to create a progressive umbrella that really pulls in all of our community partners…and that we learn to build a coalition and trust each other and work together. We need to come together under one very large umbrella that’s about fighting fascism and…believing that all people all over the world need to be treated with dignity and respect.”
E.J. Martinez Elementary teacher Jennifer Lopez carried a sign that read, “I’m here for my students who are living in fear.”
“It’s not only about immigration,” she told Source. “It’s also trans students; students who have gay parents. It’s all women. We’ve had families who are worried about bringing their kids to school when this all started. We’ll see what it’s like when the school year starts again. I’ve had kids who have had a lot of anxiety about the rights for trans kids being taken away.”
What does she tell them?
“We just have to have hope and to fight,” she said.
Albuquerque teacher Doug Mattson’s sign, “It’s officially fascism,” which he displayed prominently from the sidewalk on the Paseo de Peralta side of the Roundhouse ,appeared to be pulling the largest number of honks (in an unscientific assessment). He showed up to the event, he said out of the “need to do something. Right now, there’s no check on Trump’s power, so the people need to do something. Congress has been very weak, so we need to be out here.”
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.), who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District, which includes Santa Fe, rallied the crowd with a speech that emphasized the protest theme: No Kings.
“The last time that this country had a king was 250 years ago,” Leger Fernández said. “And what did we do with that King? We got rid of him. And how did we get rid of him? We got rid of him by organizing, by mobilizing, by talking to our neighbors, because we must always talk to our neighbors and explain why…why we must do what we do, because we know that a government of the people, by the people, for the people, is the best way to prosperity for all the people.”
In comments to Source NM following her speech, Leger Fernández acknowledged the prior week had been a “rough” one for Democratic members of Congress, with events including the indictment of U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey after her May confrontation with officials at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center; the forcible removal and handcuffing of California U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla at a news conference for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem; and the U.S. House approval of a bill that would revoke billions in funding for PBS, NPR and foreign aid programs.
“But then, when you come to a realm like this, when you see the number of people showing up, we are re-energized in our commitment to fight for this democracy,” she said. As I said earlier: We are bound to each other. We belong to each other in this common purpose of securing a diplomacy that gives prosperity to all Americans. That’s what we’re all fighting for. The people here… have shown up. They’ve shown up in the snow, they’ve shown up in the sun. They will keep showing up until we kick those…MAGA Republicans out of office, because it’s both the power of the people and the power of the ballot box.”
‘Hands off everything we love’

In Albuquerque, cars slowed to a crawl for miles on Montaño Road as people streamed in and out of Mariposa Basin Park Saturday for its march, some carrying inverted American flags, and many adorned with paper Burger King crowns. Thousands of people fanned out between the trees and spread across the grass, telling Source NM they were there to protest the Trump administration’s deployment of troops to L.A., the military parade, federal cuts and deportations without due process.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, who represents the 1st Congressional District, addressed the crowd:
“Imagine if our elected GOP officials had even an ounce of bravery that any single one of you in this field today have — we would not be on the precipice of losing everything,” she said. “We will fight, we will march and we will save our democracy,” she concluded, to cheers and applause.

The protests happened on Trump’s 79th birthday – the same day a military parade was planned in Washington to mark the Army’s 250th anniversary.
The protest outside the Mississippi Capitol was largely peaceful. Capitol Police officers quickly stopped two small confrontations. Hundreds of demonstrators carried signs with slogans including “Make racism wrong again” and “Felon 47 is not a king despite SCOTUS.”
Counter-protesters at the Capitol carried signs proclaiming they oppose abortion and support Jesus.
As some of the protests were happening in the state, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves posted a happy birthday wish to Trump, adding: “Make America Great Again!”
In Gulfport, Lea Campbell of the Mississippi Rising Coalition said the protests are a way “to say no to fascism in our streets and to demand dignity, safety, liberty and justice for all,” according to The Sun Herald. Campbell said people of color, the LGBTQ community, poor people, unhoused people and workers “are not our enemy.”
“I know that fascism and white nationalism are the enemy of our democracy,” Campbell said.
Protesters gather at the State Capitol in Jackson for the No Kings event June 14, 2025.
The Sun Herald also reported a few Trump supporters stood across the street from the rally. One of them, retired Seabee Robert Charles Hall Sr., held a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag and said he was carrying a pistol. He said he brought the gun in case police needed help and would use it to defend anyone in the crowd if the protest turned violent.
In Oxford, slogans on signs included: “This is the government our founders warned us about,” “Democracy dies when we stay silent” and “Hate never made any nation great.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/14152555/No-Kings-protest-1.jpg,,,2025-06-14 17:00:53.297429

Mike Kehoe announced on May 27 that he will call a special legislative session to consider disaster relief, stadium funding and spending items (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A $1.5 billion stadium funding plan aimed at convincing the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals to stay in Missouri was signed into law Saturday afternoon by Gov. Mike Kehoe shortly before his trip to France on a trade mission.
Kehoe signed two other bills on Saturday: one providing $125 million in aid for communities hit by severe weather and another spending around $200 million on various construction projects across the state.
The bills were the product of a two week special legislative session called by Kehoe last month designed, primarily, to counter an offer by Kansas to fund up to 70% of the construction costs for new stadiums for the Chiefs and Royals if they moved across the state line. That deal expires at the end of the month.
Missouri’s counter offer would allocate state taxes collected from economic activity at Arrowhead and Kauffman to bond payments for renovations at Arrowhead and a new stadium for the Royals in Jackson or Clay counties.
The cost is estimated at close to $1.5 billion over 30 years.
Both teams have expressed interest in leaving Missouri when the lease on their current stadiums expire in 2030.
“We called legislators back to Jefferson City because the stakes were too high to wait,” Kehoe said in an emailed statement announcing he signed the stadium funding deal.
The disaster relief provisions in the legislation address both the devastation of the May 16 tornado in St. Louis and the damages suffered by other Missourians in storms and flooding earlier in the year. The aid was required due to uncertainty about the federal response to the tornado.
Kehoe asked President Donald Trump for a federal disaster declaration for the tornado on May 25 and for April 29 storms in Scott on May 19. The president didn’t officially declare a disaster, opening the door for federal aid, until June 10.
The governor was expected to quickly sign the bills, which passed earlier this week, because he will be in Paris on Monday for his first international trade mission. During Kehoe’s absence, Lt. Gov. David Wasinger will serve as acting governor.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052725_kehoe3-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-06-14 17:00:53.297429

Democratic Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed early Saturday in their Brooklyn Park home. Hortman was Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives from 2019 through the end of the 2024 legislative session, leading the push for universal free lunches in the state’s public schools, legalization of recreational cannabis, and expanded gun safety laws.
Minnesota House Democratic leader dead after ‘politically motivated assassination’

A second state lawmaker, Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot multiple times and injured in their Champlin home. The Hoffmans were in a stable condition after being rushed to the hospital, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Saturday’s shootings were part of what appears to be a “politically motivated assassination,” according to news reports.
Gov. Dan McKee expressed sympathy in a social media post Saturday afternoon.
“Our hearts break for Minnesota today,” McKee posted on X. “Political violence is a threat to democracy — it has no place in our country.”
Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in a statement he was “heartbroken” by the death of Hortman, who he knew from attending national conferences. The two had dinner last December, Shekarchi said.
He described Hortman as a warm, kind, and intelligent lawmaker who cared deeply for her state.
“There is no place for senseless violence in our political system,” Shekarchi said.
Senate President Valarie Lawson also posed the tragedy as a call to action. “In the United States, we settle our differences at the ballot box, and we share a common commitment to peace, justice, and the rule of law,” Lawson said in a statement. “No one should have to worry that their willingness to enter public service has made them a target.”
Rhode Island Democratic Party Chairwoman Liz Beretta-Perik singled out President Donald Trump, who she urged to call for a “more civil discourse.”
“There is a sad inevitability about this tragedy in a time marked by elevated rhetoric and vitriol,” Beretta-Perik said in a statement. “Our political culture must change.”
Members of Rhode Island’s Congressional delegation also shared public sympathies on social media.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo posted on X that he was saddened to hear of Hortman’s assassination, along with the attempt on the Hoffmans. He called on all Americans to denounce politically motivated violence, which he said endangers the nation’s democracy and public servants.
U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner said he was monitoring the targeted shootings, which he called “horrific.”
“As Homeland Security Ranking Member for Counterterrorism, I will ask for a full briefing once the facts are known, and urge everyone to remain calm this weekend,” he posted on X.
Authorities suspect 57-year-old Vance Boelter as the shooter, according to news reports. He remained at large as of Saturday afternoon.

In Tallahassee, several groups came together four weeks ago to organize the protest that drew thousands to the Florida Historic Capitol, said Claudia Sperber, one of the co-organizers and the president of the Leon County Chapter of the Democratic Environmental Caucus of Florida. 
Organizers emphasized safety training in their preparations for Saturday, in light of the warnings earlier this week from state and local officials promising to quash violent protests by any means necessary.

“We wanted to be careful, but we refused to be bullied,” Sperber said. “We know it is a classic playbook from a dictator to make people feel afraid, and we refused to be afraid.” 
Approximately 5,000 protested in Tallahassee, according to the organizers. That number is not independently verified.
During a Thursday press conference with Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey warned protesters that disobeying or hurting law enforcement would lead to arrests and death. 
“If you throw a brick, a fire bomb, or point a gun at one of our deputies, we will be notifying your family where to collect your remains at because we will kill you, graveyard dead,” he said. 
The Tallahassee event was unfolding as news flashed about a shooting in Minnesota where a Democratic legislator and her husband were killed, and another legislator and his wife were seriously injured. That prompted authorities in that state to warn people against attending the rallies.
However, the demonstration in the state capital, which started at 10 a.m., remained peaceful. There was a group of four Trump supporters in the crowd. 
Chants, songs, and speeches filled the air for four hours. “Stand up, fight back. Stop the madman now,” a group of women sang. 
Even as the official programming ended, crowds remained in front of the Florida Historic Capitol and lining up along Monroe Street, one of the city’s main roads. Among those who attended the event were Nikki Fried, the chair of the Florida Democratic Party, and Rick Wilson, the famed anti-Trumper and co-founder of the Lincoln Project.
Brizeida Patiño, 19, said she came to the protest to stand up for her parents, who immigrated from Mexico, and the immigrant community in Tallahassee. More than two weeks ago, federal immigration officials and Florida Highway Patrol conducted the largest raid in the state so far to crack down on illegal immigration, targeting a construction site near the Florida State University campus. 
“My parents immigrated from Mexico, trying to seek a better life for me, my siblings, and they’ve done a great job, and they’ve done no harm to this country,” she said. “Matter of fact, they’ve definitely made it better. They’re hard-working people, the same way all these other Hispanic, Latino, people of color.”

St. Petersburg
There were protests all over the state, including one near Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach resort and home of Trump. Meanwhile, in St. Petersburg, more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered on the street corners of three different intersections.
Many of the protesters’ signs in St. Pete expressed anger about the unprecedented number of raids of undocumented immigrants performed by the U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) in recent months. Public protests against one such raid last week in Los Angeles compelled President Trump to call up 2,000 soldiers from California’s Guard against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom, which has few precedents in U.S. history.
“He’s deporting people unlawfully,” said St. Petersburg resident Neil Pajwa. “They’re not getting proper due process. He’s using the military, which has almost never been used before.  I think he’s setting himself up to basically be a dictator.”
Pajwa said he was particularly disturbed by a speech that Trump gave at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, this week where uniformed soldiers cheered the president’s political comments. “I’ve never seen the military vocally supporting such statements,” he said. “That was very scary.”                  
Rhonda Keller said she’s not confident that protests bring about change but said it was important for her to participate in Saturday’s No Kings Event. She noted that in the past 48 hours, Trump has told ICE to pause raids and arrests in the agriculture industry, hotels, and restaurants. For Keller the reversal of policy shows that Trump is a “masterful manipulator.”
“I don’t believe he’s a bright human being, but he is a masterful manipulator and for him to control the narrative and to say, ‘Oh, we need to not hurt our farmworkers this way or our hospitality industry this way.’ Like dude, you were literally the one who is hurting them and now the MAGA people are going to be able to say, ‘See, he doesn’t want to hurt farmworkers,’ even though we are actively hurting them,” Keller said.
Several people in the crowd said to date they have been disappointed with the Democrats, who are in the minority.

Ruth Liss, a senior citizen, walked through the crowd with a sign that read, “Congress: Sale on Balls – you need ‘em!”
“I’m just surprised that he has people who keep kowtowing to him,” she said. “I’m sick and tired of having to hide under the sofa and that’s exactly what Congress is doing. That’s what everybody in a suit seems to be doing,” she said. “I feel that the country is frightened. I think that the country is fed-up, and we don’t know what to do and this is the only way we can start.” 
While most in the St. Petersburg rally expressed optimism about the future, none thought that the political situation in Washington would immediately course correct anytime soon.
“It’s going to get worse before it’s going to get better but it starts here, right?” said Keara Kersey. “It just brings awareness, and we’re getting a lot of support here. Maybe it changes some minds.”
Kearsey said she had been uncertain about attending Saturday’s event because of fears of violence breaking out. She said she was disturbed to hear Gov. Ron DeSantis say this week that drivers who feel threatened by protestors should hit them with their cars.
“It’s our right to free speech to protest,” Kearsey responded. “You don’t see any violence around here.”

Melissa Hartman talks to colleagues during a special legislative session Monday, June 9, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Hortman’s husband was also shot and killed, the governor said.
Walz, appearing emotional at a press conference in the north metro, said they were killed in an apparent “politically motivated assassination.”
“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said. The Associated Press, citing law enforcement sources, reported Saturday that the suspect being sought is 57-year-old Vance Boelter.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Minnesota Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)A crowd that appeared to number in the thousands packed the lawn in front of the State House and lined North Main Street in Concord Saturday, joining a nationwide protest against President Donald Trump.
Concord’s demonstration was one of more than 30 planned throughout the Granite State. On the Seacoast, protesters gathered at Market Square in Portsmouth. Additionally, an anti-ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) protest in Manchester Friday drew hundreds, and protesters returned for another rally in the city on Saturday. No Kings, the national group organizing the event, also advertised protests in Nashua, Enfield, Dover, Littleton, and Milford. Protests took place in all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and Canada, according to No Kings.
Protesters in Concord held signs, participated in chants, and listened to speakers denouncing ICE raids, threats to curtail the rights of trans Americans, and Trump’s efforts to consolidate power, among other actions. A podium was also set up where protest organizers, activists, politicians, candidates, and others spoke.
The event was scheduled to coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C., that Trump organized on both the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army’s founding and his own 79th birthday. Trump said parade protesters would be met with “very heavy force.” Saturday’s demonstrations also come amid tense protests that have been taking place for over a week in Los Angeles against Trump’s deportation raids. Trump has mobilized the National Guard to Los Angeles to respond to the protests, which have at times gotten violent, and to protect immigration officials as they carry out deportations, according to press reports from California.
Earlier Saturday, two Minnesota Democratic state lawmakers and their spouses were shot by someone posing as a police officer. State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, and Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were seriously injured. In the wake of the assassination, New Hampshire House Democratic Leader Alexis Simpson sent an email to her colleagues, which was obtained by the Bulletin, warning them to “consider keeping a lower profile today than we might normally keep,” encouraging them “to not identify ourselves as state reps,” and “pay attention to your surroundings and trust your instincts.”
“This tragedy does not exist in a vacuum,” Simpson wrote. “We are living in a time of rising political violence and it is incumbent upon us to make sure that not only are we calling it out, but that we are protecting ourselves appropriately. It is a good idea to be in touch with your local law enforcement and let them know of the situation especially if you are having a rally in your town or city.”

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Repeated bursts of drenching rain didn’t scare away the thousands of Hoosiers amassing at the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to protest the policies and actions of President Donald Trump, who celebrated his 79th birthday in Washington D.C. today.
Trump’s birthday coincided with the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. Both were honored with a military parade in the nation’s capital as protesters gathered across the country for “No Kings” protests.
“I want to be on the right side of history,” said Fiona Betts, of Marion County.
Upwards of 3,000 Hoosiers attended Saturday’s protest, according to the Indiana State Police, who monitored the event from the perimeter and detained at least one participant after a scuffle with an opposing protester. 
Attendees marched nonstop around the Indiana Statehouse for a few hours, chanting about democracy to a constant stream of car horns down Capitol Avenue.
Organizers repeatedly emphasized a nonviolent approach, distributing whistles to alert security of any counterprotesters “that may try to cause trouble” and advising the crowd not to engage with them.

Mother-daughter duo, Rhonda and Donna Clair, came because “we’re worried about our democracy.”
“Our immigrants are not getting their due process and people are being snatched out of their schools and workplaces. We’re worried that equality is not (getting) attention too,” continued Rhonda Clair. “We just want people to be treated with dignity and respect and we’re not seeing that.”
Rhonda Clair, who decorated crowns for her and her mother, also mentioned international affairs as a concern, specifically whether America was alienating longstanding allies. 
Several signs likened Trump’s actions with those of dictatorship, with one Hoosier comparing raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement with Adolph Hitler’s Gestapo. Other common themes were “FDT,” a curse for the president, No Kings pictograms and tacos. 
Saturday’s event coincided with Indianapolis’ Pride celebration and the Indiana Pacers’ appearance in the 2025 NBA Finals, with all three crowds intermingling in the streets of downtown Indianapolis. 
Many attendees went to both the Pride parade, which started at 10 a.m., and the No Kings protest, including husbands Brad and Doug Cope-Barnes. 
“We have to show up. We need to see that there are other people who care and who think like we do,” said Doug Cope-Barnes. “It’s not all grim and hopeless; we need hope.” 
State Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, also spoke of hope, encouraging the crowd to build a better future and vote against the state’s Republican supermajority in future elections.
“This country was built on the radical idea that power comes from the people. And we the people still hold that power today,” Hamilton said. “… let’s take back our democracy! Let’s get to work!”
A few hundred protesters lingered as the event wound down at 3 p.m. and organizers struck their tents. Many of the remaining attendees held sodden pieces of cardboard with barely legible writing or left their signs to adorn the southern Statehouse lawn. Others vowed to come back, buoyed by the large crowd and optimistic spirit — and hopeful that the weather would be better next time.

The rally Thursday was the first of at least 14 similar protests scheduled around the state and among thousands taking place around the country. The protests also rejected a planned military parade Saturday coinciding with Trump’s birthday and Flag Day. 
Those who gathered at the Alabama Department of Archives and History, across from the Alabama State Capitol, said they were concerned the administration was not following the law, particularly on applying due process to immigrants facing deportation.
Brenda Andrade, a Montgomery resident, said her mother, a naturalized citizen who immigrated to the United States before her birth, is scared by those policies. 
“We don’t think it’s fair that we are being pushed away in such violence when we created and built this country, alongside every other immigrant, every other person,” she said.

The “No Kings” protests across the nation come amid protests in Los Angeles pushing back against immigration raids, where protesters have clashed with ICE and deployed troops. 
The protests in Montgomery were peaceful. A group of about 10 counter-protesters, some covering their faces, tried to interrupt the speakers, but their march lasted less than 15 minutes as their chants were drowned out by “No Kings” protestors.

Standing across the Alabama Capitol, Ryan Burgener held an upside-down American flag signaling distress and said that his main priority was protecting his friends and neighbors who are U.S. permanent residents, as he sees the “pain and anguish” they are feeling. He said he is also concerned about the economy and the potential negative impacts of the proposed reconciliation bill that is currently being considered by the Senate.
“This is going to put us trillions of dollars further into debt, and we can presume it’ll benefit those in the top end of the tax bracket, and that’s really concerning to me,” he said.
Debora Summerlin, an Elmore County resident, said that she came out to protest the “fascism” and “cruelty” of the current administration.
“I hope we ruin his parade. I hope we piss him off, and I hope we show other people in Alabama about how passionate we are about protecting the Constitution,” Summerlin said.
Jessica Campbell, who came out with her husband and two daughters, said that it was important for them to come out “for family” and “anybody who’s different, who doesn’t have a voice. She said if they don’t speak up, things won’t get better, and “everybody needs to see the country say he needs to go.”
Reverend E.K. Daufin, an advisor at the National Organization for Women, Campus Action Network at Alabama State University, encouraged the crowd to speak up and “fight back against the fascist regime” by attending protests, contacting elected officials and voting.
“We are an example of people trying to fix the lies people are telling about those of us whose ideas and principles don’t align with those of this current administration,” she said.
JaTaune Bosby Gilchrist, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, encouraged people to push back against what she called chaos “that is sent to confuse us and to exhaust us.”

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Hundreds of U.S. flags fluttered in the air of Nebraska’s capital city in protest of the Trump administration. 
The protests in Lincoln and at least 11 other Nebraska cities were part of planned national protests against the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts, cuts to federal services and a military parade to celebrate the U.S. Army’s anniversary and Flag Day in Washington, D.C., a date that overlaps with Trump’s 79th birthday.  
A reporter-estimated crowd of roughly 2,000 protesters in Lincoln stretched across O Street, the main road through downtown, chanting “no kings” and “Donald Trump got to go.” Protesters held signs criticizing the Department of Government Efficiency’s cuts, the administration’s immigration approach and stating that the nation has “no kings,” while holding U.S. flags, including some flown upside-down, a step often used as a signal of distress. 
Some also held Mexican flags. Others, a Palestinian flag.

Cars passing by honked in support of the protesters. Trenton Morales, 17, said he came out to protest against the workplace immigration raid in Omaha this week and other similar raids nationally. 
“My grandpa recently got deported,” Morales said. “That’s one reason why I’m out here.” 
Like most protests this week in Nebraska, this one was peaceful, though federal officials announced this week that they had arrested four protesters from the site of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement-led raid site, Glenn Valley Foods, alleging the four had behaved aggressively and damaged federal property. A duty commander with the Lincoln Police Department said officers had made no protest-related arrests.
Organizers of the Omaha-area protest in Council Bluffs estimated the crowd at Tom Hanafan Park at roughly 10,000 people, including overflow that reached the Bob Kerrey Bridge. Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive independent, called in and elicited cheers when he spoke by phone briefly during the event.
In more rural parts of Nebraska, about 150-200 people protested in several cities, Lincoln-area CBS affiliate KOLN/KGIN reported. 
Before the planned protests this weekend, Gov. Jim Pillen activated the Nebraska National Guard for immediate deployment if needed. Pillen and Nebraska joined other states with conservative governors, such as Texas and Missouri, that activated the Guard in advance. 
“Free speech will be respected and protected in Nebraska,” Pillen said. “But the lawlessness, chaos, and rioting seen in other cities in past weeks will not be tolerated here.” 
On Friday, several hundred protesters marched in downtown Omaha during the opening of the College World Series against the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics. Protest organizers also gathered people in Nebraska’s largest metropolitan area on Saturday at Council Bluffs, Iowa. 
Democrats, nonpartisans and some Republicans who oppose Trump have used the protests as a political rallying cry or organizational tool.
The heartland protests come against the backdrop of larger, tenser protests in Los Angeles as a result of ICE raids there over the past week. Los Angeles has sparked similar protests in Democratic-leaning parts of the country and purple and blue pockets of conservative-led states. 
The Trump administration seemed to acknowledge some of the public pushback nationally and perhaps industry-level pushback from farmers, meatpackers and food processors with new guidance this week pausing some immigration raids and arrests in the agriculture and hospitality industries, according to a Friday report in the New York Times. 
In Nebraska, some industry groups have warned of risks of cracking down too hard on certain industries and businesses without addressing the root cause of illegal hiring, lack of workers, and the need for a clearer path to legal immigration. 
Organizers behind the nationwide ‘No King’ protests include Indivisible, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the 50501 Movement. Some branded Saturday as a “day of defiance” against what they call authoritarian overreach by the Trump administration.
Nebraska State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, appeared at the downtown protest, saying he didn’t expect this much turnout.
“It shows just how angry people are … [and] it’s good for people to see that there’s this much opposition to all the bad stuff that’s happening right now,” Dungan said.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)Metro Nashville Police officers arrested a masked counter protester carrying what appeared to be a handgun and a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag at the “No Kings” protest at Bicentennial Park during Saturday’s “No Kings” protest in Nashville.
No shots were fired.
Kase Cosgrove, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and safety volunteer attending the protest, said he approached the man after other protesters told him the man was armed and spitting and shoving people while walking through the crowd.
Cosgrove said he walked toward the man and saw him tapping on what appeared to be a handgun and pulling it out of its holster to show people he was armed. Cosgrove approached him and attempted to talk to him but three police officers quickly arrived, retrieved the weapon and put the man in handcuffs.

Cosgrove said the protest — part of a nationwide protest against the Trump administration — has been peaceful and fittingly musical, being in Music City.
Thousands of people attended the protest, lining the sidewalks along Jefferson Street and Rosa Parks Blvd. and walking through Bicentennial Park after a brief gathering at the park’s amphitheater. Cheers, musical instruments and car horns echoed up and down the street.
Protesters ranged in age from young adults to the elderly, and many people brought children and dogs.
“Everybody else is being chill,” said Cosgrove. ”  . . . He was trying to cause problems.”
Protesters yelled at the man as police put him into an MNPD golf cart. Cosgrove was among them, shouting, “You got tread on!”
The man, still masked, responded by showing the crowd his middle finger.
As police drove away protesters turned toward the officers and said, “thank you for keeping us safe.”
A spokesperson for Metro Police told the Lookout they did not yet have the man’s name.

Melissa Hortman talks to colleagues during a special legislative session Monday, June 9, 2025, at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. (Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)ST. PAUL, Minn – House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Hortman’s husband was also shot and killed, the governor said.
Walz, appearing emotional at a press conference in the north metro, said they were killed in an apparent “politically motivated assassination.”
“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

Josh Shapiro called on leaders across the country to speak and act with moral clarity in the wake of the “politically motivated assassination” of a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota.
The governor posted a statement on the social platform X, formerly called Twitter, just before noon. It came about 90 minutes after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz held a press conference announcing the death of House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman. She and her husband were shot and killed Saturday morning in her Brooklyn Park home by a man impersonating a police officer.
“Leaders across our country must speak and act with the moral clarity this moment demands,” Shapiro said. “This is unacceptable — we all have a responsibility to stand up and work to defeat the political violence that is tearing through our country. America is better than this.”

Democratic Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
“We are praying for the family of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, and all of their loved ones who have suffered an immeasurable loss. We’re praying for the full recovery of Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, and for their families, loved ones, and communities at home and in Saint Paul.” Shapiro said. “I communicated with Gov. Walz this morning to offer my prayers and support. To the people of Minnesota: Pennsylvania stands with you.”
The shooter is still at large. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams in Minnesota are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
Law enforcement said when officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer. In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
The governor said he spoke with state Senate President Pro Tem Kim Ward and state House Speaker Joanna McClinton and offered the administration’s support in the aftermath of the Minnesota shootings.
Shapiro said he and his wife, Lori, were pained by the news of yet another act of political violence. In April,  Shapiro and his family were evacuated from the governor’s residence after a firebombing damaged part of the first floor of the building. It happened after Shapiro celebrated the first night of Passover. 
38-year-old Cody Balmer of Harrisburg was charged in connection to what police say was a “targeted attack.” Police said Balmer admitted hatred toward Shapiro and planned to beat him with a hammer if he encountered Shapiro inside the home.
The Minnesota shootings occurred on the same day thousands of non-violent demonstrations are being held across Pennsylvania and the country that were organized by a partnership of labor, Democratic and anti-Trump organizations.

Another 3,000 people demonstrated outside Liberty Plaza, according to a police estimate. A small number of counter protesters were present, but no incidents or arrests were reported.
The demonstration was one of about two dozen protests against the administration of President Donald Trump in Georgia. Nationally, about 2,000 events were planned Saturday under the banner of “No Kings” day.
“It fills my heart. I’m so glad that people are here,” said Adam Zarett, an IT professional from Atlanta. “I’m glad to see so many people here standing up for our constitutional rights, making our voices heard. Like John Lewis, good trouble.”
Zarett said he wasn’t much for protests until recently.
“I didn’t even care about politics before Trump came into office the first time, and it stung then, and it is so much worse now,” he said. “It has just ignited a fire inside me that says you can’t just sit behind a keyboard and complain on Facebook all day. That just doesn’t do much. Sometimes it feels good, but it doesn’t do much.”
Now, Zarett says he’ll be back.
“I absolutely will. As many protests as there are, as many gatherings as there are, the people need to be heard,” he said.
Converting keyboard warriors to sign-wavers was part of the goal for “No Kings” organizers like Ezra Levin, cofounder of the progressive Indivisible organization.
In a streamed planning session Thursday, Levin said planning for the nationwide series of protests began when Trump announced a military parade in Washington, before protests in Los Angeles and a crackdown from the federal government became a national flashpoint.
The Washington event, which has come under fire for its projected cost of up to $45 million, coincides with the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States Army and Trump’s 79th birthday.
“Trump can have his pathetic little party in D.C. We’re everywhere else,” Levin said. “We are flying American flags everywhere. We’re featuring veterans on stage. We’re showing up with patriotic zeal. Most importantly, we are showing up in force in red, blue and purple communities in defense of our constitutional rights.”
There was plenty of red, white and blue on display in Atlanta – some came dressed in patriotic colors, and others waved mini American flags handed out by volunteers. Some faces in the crowd turned red as well as the triple threat of sun, humidity and tightly packed bodies raised the temperature in the plaza. Volunteers handed out bottles of water and paper fans to help fight off the worst effects of the heat.
  Several protesters and speakers made reference to Martin Luther King Jr., who they characterized as the only good “king” in the United States. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The name of the event is a reference to what opponents say is Trump’s desire to subvert democracy and rule as an autarch, but many signs made reference to a different kind of King – civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., who called Atlanta home. Several protesters held signs saying King is the only king recognized in Atlanta.
Another genre of popular hometown signage paid tribute to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Firings at the public health agency became the local symbol of federal job cuts opponents characterize as harmful and chaotic.
Anna Yousaf, an infectious disease doctor who works with vaccines at the CDC, stood near the front of the crowd with members of Fired But Fighting, a coalition of terminated workers. Yousaf said she came out to oppose Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who she said is undermining public trust in vaccines to deadly effect.
“Disinformation used to be coming from non-governmental sources,” she said. “Now, RFK Jr. is hijacking political organizations like the CDC, like the FDA, and using our name brand, if you will, to spread disinformation. And so people who would ordinarily go to a CDC resource for trusted information, now they’re going to get disinformation from the health secretary of the United States.”
“If he succeeds in his crusade to undermine vaccine confidence and restrict access, we will see thousands of people die, mostly children,” she added.
Yousaf and thousands of others listened and cheered as speakers took the stage to criticize the White House on policies ranging from mass immigration raids to laws targeting transgender Americans to U.S. support for Israel’s actions in Gaza.
Protesters dispersed peacefully around noon, with some lingering to bop along with a small marching band. Organizers encouraged participants to walk to an early Juneteenth celebration a few blocks away.
“Joy is also resistance in times like these,” said organizer Laura Judge. “So we’re encouraging people to move on down to the Juneteenth parade, support Black liberation, the purpose of Juneteenth, to be an ally to other people that are being marginalized.”
Other protests not affiliated with “No Kings” were scheduled for Saturday, including one at a plaza in northeast Atlanta.
“It’s good to get out and show that I don’t stand with the fascist pigs in power,” said Greg Drummond, an archivist from Gwinnett County who attended the “No Kings” protest at Liberty Plaza. “My main issue that I normally come out for is anti-capitalism. Unfortunately, I’m here with a bunch of capitalists, but I’m doing what we have to do here. I think actions later in the day will be more my speed.”
“The leftists and the liberals have to be allies until the revolution’s over, then we can hash out our differences,” he added. “But until then, we all have to stand strong against the fascism. If we let them rip us apart, then we’re all doomed, and we must stand up to it.”
  Organizers said 5,000 people filled Liberty Square, and police estimated about 3,000 more listened from outside the gate. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder

Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)Demonstrators were expected to gather at Lincoln Veterans Memorial Park near the Colorado Capitol on Saturday afternoon during one of over 40 protests planned across the state to coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C., and President Donald Trump’s birthday.
The Colorado demonstrations are part of a “nationwide day of defiance” by the organizers of the movement, dubbed “No Kings.” The national call for mass demonstrations is in response to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts, federal funding cuts, defiance of judges in immigration cases and the planned military parade, which could cost up to $45 million. The administration says the parade is to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the creation of the Continental Army, also known as Flag Day.
There has not been a military parade in the nation’s capital since 1991 to mark the end of the first Gulf War. Trump critics characterize Saturday’s parade as a theatrical display similar to ones hosted by authoritarian leaders abroad.
There were similar protests in Grand Junction, Montrose, Alamosa, Lamar and along the entire Front Range.

The protest comes after multiple demonstrations in Denver against deportation efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including a march to an ICE detention center in Aurora on Monday and a large gathering at the Capitol on Tuesday evening. Law enforcement deployed smoke and pepper balls against a group of protesters that marched near the interchange of Broadway and Interstate 25 on Tuesday and made 18 arrests related to the demonstration.
Early Saturday, two Democratic state lawmakers and their spouses were attacked in targeting shootings, leaving Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband dead, according to Minnesota authorities.
The official website of the “No Kings” protest expresses a “commitment to nonviolent action.”
Tension across the country has escalated since last weekend when ICE agents undertook raids at restaurants and workplaces in Los Angeles and the surrounding area. That prompted protests in the city, where there were some clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. Trump then sent Marines and California National Guard troops, against state and local leaders’ wishes, into L.A.
Groups including Indivisible Denver Action and the Colorado chapter of 50501 organized a fair alongside Saturday’s protest to host a food drive, music, games and showcase the work of various local activist groups.
The “No Kings” demonstration and fair is scheduled until 4 p.m. A separate protest, specifically against ICE, is scheduled for 4 p.m. at the Capitol.

Protestors of all ages cheered speakers while holding handmade signs: “Americans Against King Trump,” “Stop the Steal of our Democracy,” “Democracy Not Oligarchy.” Protesters also pointed to recent detentions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including recent detention of CT residents in Southington, Meriden and New Haven.
“Connecticut is not exempt, it’s not safe, families are being torn apart in our neighborhoods, and it’s time to say, ‘not on our watch,’” said Tabitha Sookdeo, executive director of CT Students for a Dream. Sookdeo led the crowd in a chant that nearly rose to a scream: “ICE out of Connecticut!”

“We’ve got to keep bobbing and weaving and shaking and baking until justice is achieved by every one of us in this land,” Bishop John Selders told the crowd.
The crowd, estimated by Capitol Police to be in the thousands, was animated. In the midst of the crowd, a small of group of counterprotestors briefly attempted to interrupt the event but were quickly silenced. Shouts of “shame!” could be heard as a trio of men, including one wearing a Make America Great Again hat, ran away from the protest.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal told the fired-up crowd that they needed to keep in one word over the next months: “elections.” “When we fight,” Blumenthal said, “we win.” The crowd responded. Blumenthal thanked Trump for the invitation to his parade, but said, “I’d rather be here.”
Rep. John Larson then addressed the crowd: “No kings is the appropriate theme. Why?” Larson then turned to U.S. history and Thomas Paine’s pamphlet, “Common Sense.” “It’s not going to be the current United States Congress that will change things,” but rather the people, he said. “Rise up America!”
The protests in Hartford and across the country serve as a counter to Trump’s military parade, which is scheduled to begin later today and will commemorate both the president’s 79th birthday and the Army’s 250th year.
The parade faced criticism in recent days, particularly from veteran and military-related organizations frustrated at Trump’s embrace of military imagery and symbols.
“At a time when the world is on edge, with escalating conflict between Israel and Iran and other serious threats abroad, we should be laser-focused on military readiness and defense,” Janessa Goldbeck, a Marine Corps veteran and CEO of the Vet Voice Foundation, a national group encouraging veterans to become civic and policy leaders, said in a statement provided to CT Mirror ahead of the weekend events.
“I served to protect our nation, not to see the military turned into a prop for domestic theater,” she said.

Standing across the street from the Capitol days after leaving the hospital, former Army platoon leader and Vietnam War veteran Richard Foster agreed. 
“If he succeeds in politicizing the military, this country may never get it back,” Foster, who lives in West Hartford, said. “The military is supposed to be nonpolitical, and he’s turning it into a political body loyal to him.”

Protests across the nation
Demonstrators began gathering in cities and towns across the U.S. Saturday to rally against Trump as officials urged calm and mobilized National Guard troops ahead a military parade to mark the Army’s 250th anniversary that coincides with the president’s birthday.
Atlanta’s 5,000-capacity “No Kings” rally quickly reached its limit, while intermittent light rain fell as early marchers carrying signs gathered for the flagship rally in Philadelphia’s Love Park.
A woman there wearing a foam Statue of Liberty crown brought a speaker system and led an anti-Trump sing-along, changing the words “young man” in the song “Y.M.C.A.” to “con man.”
Karen Van Trieste, a 61-year-old nurse who drove up from Maryland, said she grew up in Philadelphia and wanted to be with a large group of people showing her support.
“I just feel like we need to defend our democracy,” she said. She is concerned about the Trump administration’s layoffs of staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fate of immigrant communities and the Trump administration trying to rule by executive order, she said.
Protests in nearly 2,000 locations are scheduled across the country, from city blocks and small towns to courthouse steps and community parks, organizers said, but no events are scheduled in Washington, D.C., where the military parade will take place in the evening.
The 50501 Movement orchestrating the protests says it picked the “No Kings” name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration. The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement.
The demonstrations come on the heels of protests that flared up across the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire.
Calling out the National Guard
Governors and city officials vowed to protect the right to protest and to show no tolerance for violence.
Republican governors in Virginia, Texas, Nebraska and Missouri are mobilizing National Guard troops to help law enforcement manage demonstrations.
There will be “zero tolerance” for violence, destruction or disrupting traffic, and “if you violate the law, you’re going to be arrested,” Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin told reporters Friday.
In Missouri, Gov. Mike Kehoe issued a similar message, vowing to take a proactive approach and not to “wait for chaos to ensue.”
Nebraska’s governor also signed an emergency proclamation Friday to activate his state’s National Guard, a step his office called “a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.”
Organizers say that one march will go to the gates of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis warned demonstrators that the “line is very clear” and not to cross it.
Some law enforcement agencies announced they were ramping up efforts for the weekend. In California, state troopers will be on “tactical alert,” which means all days off are canceled for all officers, while West Virginia’s governor put the state police and National Guard on standby.
Governors urging calm
On social media, Washington state Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, called for peaceful protests over the weekend, to ensure Trump doesn’t send military to the state.
“Donald Trump wants to be able to say that we cannot handle our own public safety in Washington state,” Ferguson said.
In a statement Friday, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, urged protesters “to remain peaceful and calm as they exercise their First Amendment right to make their voices heard.”
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said his administration and state police are working with police in Philadelphia ahead of what organizers estimate could be a crowd approaching 100,000 people.
Philadelphia’s top prosecutor, District Attorney Larry Krasner, warned that anyone coming to Philadelphia to break the law or immigration agents exceeding their authority will face arrest. He invoked civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as a guide for demonstrators.
“If you are doing what Martin Luther King would have done, you’re going to be fine,” Krasner told a news conference.
Philadelphia
Several hundred people gathered in Love Park, with organizers handing out small American flags and many people carrying protest signs saying things like “fight oligarchy” and “deport the mini-Mussolinis” as they waited for the march to start.
Some signs bore immigrant-rights messages, including “The wrong ice is melting” and “Unmask ice.”
A handful of people wore gas masks or balaclavas to cover their faces.
One man in Revolutionary War era garb and a tricorn hat held a sign with a quote often attributed to Thomas Jefferson: “All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.”
Tallahassee, Florida
About a thousand people gathered on the grounds of Florida’s old Capitol, where protesters chanted, “This is what community looks like,” and carried signs with messages like “one nation under distress” and “dissent is patriotic.”
Organizers of the rally explicitly told the crowd to avoid any conflicts with counterprotesters and to take care not to jaywalk or disrupt traffic.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Hortman’s husband was also shot and killed, the governor said.
Walz, appearing emotional at a press conference in the north metro, said they were killed in an apparent “politically motivated assassination.”
“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

Minnesota House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Hortman’s husband was also shot and killed, the governor said.
Walz, appearing emotional at a press conference in the north metro, said they were killed in an apparent “politically motivated assassination.”
“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.

Measles outbreaks starting in May have grown to 34 cases in North Dakota, giving the state the highest rate in the country, followed by New Mexico and Texas. (Photo courtesy of Visit Fargo-Moorhead)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”










Now they’ve seen measles in their community so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’


– Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas


In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
Outbreak moves north
In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
Mobile clinics aim to boost rural health care, measles vaccinations amid outbreak

“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”
Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas
According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 13, there are 1,197 confirmed cases affecting 34 states. Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 21 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
‘I question it myself’: South Dakota vaccination rates fall amid mistrust and misinformation

That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife. 
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said.

Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250609_0089-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-14 12:05:28.214633

Kurtis Gregory warned about the potential hit to jobs and tax revenues if the state were to lose a team.
But on the floor of the Senate last week, he acknowledged that pride was also a prime motivator in his efforts to make hundreds of millions of dollars available to the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs and MLB’s Kansas City Royals, both of which are being courted to move several miles away into neighboring Kansas.
A former University of Missouri football player, Gregory pointed to the Missouri-Kansas rivalry that dates back to the Civil War and characterized Kansas as “kind of an archrival.”
“We just let the state of Kansas poach, you know, really the pride and joy of the western side of the state, and I would say the entire state of Missouri?” he said in his floor speech. “And then I would also say, what’s next? What’s the next thing the state of Kansas is going to try and take from us?”
Days after the 2025 legislative session ended in May, Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called a special session for lawmakers to consider stadium funding and disaster relief bills. Last week, the state Senate approved Gregory’s stadium incentives bill in the middle of the night by a 19-13 vote. On Wednesday afternoon, the state House approved the measure by a 90-58 vote, sending it to the governor’s desk.
The bill would fund up to 50% of construction or renovation costs and is estimated to cost about $1.5 billion over 30 years, the Missouri Independent reported.
Stateline was unable to reach Gregory for comment.
Economists have panned the ongoing stadium bidding war between Missouri and Kansas — which has offered to pay up to 70% of new stadium costs — as a waste of taxpayer dollars. But Gregory’s comments highlight the emotional undercurrents frequently at play in sports stadium funding debates across the country.
Experts nearly unanimously agree that public subsidies for stadiums are a poor investment, but that hasn’t slowed a wave of local and state spending for billionaire team owners.
Washington, D.C., could spend more than $1 billion to move the Washington Commanders some seven miles from a suburb in Maryland to a new facility planned for the old RFK Stadium site, described by the team’s controlling owner as the “spiritual home” of the NFL franchise.
Geoffrey Propheter, an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who studies stadium deals, said these kinds of arguments ignore the economic reality of stadium subsidies.
“You’re not talking economics. You’re talking pure emotion,” he said.
Despite mounds of evidence showing the public does not fare well on stadium investments, he said lawmakers and mayors still tout the potential for jobs and new tax revenues with stadiums and arenas.
Oftentimes, teams and politicians stir fears about the possibility of losing franchises to another market to increase pressure, he said. But three of the most prominent stadium subsidy deals under consideration now — in Chicago, Kansas City and the district — involve teams looking to move within the same metro area.
“I would appreciate it if lawmakers were that transparent, and they’re like, ‘I don’t care how much this costs, there’s no price that’s too high for us to pay to keep them here,’” Propheter said.
 
‘Generations to get past’
But cities and states have more at stake than raw economics, said Irwin Kishner, a New York attorney who has represented pro teams in multiple stadium deals.
He likened the stadium debate to those surrounding the Olympics: Research has found that host cities generally spend well in excess of the revenue generated by the games. But cities and nations still fiercely compete for the chance to host the high-profile event.
“It elevates the status of venues,” Kishner said. “And I think it’s very much the same thing with stadiums and arenas.”
He said cities also face potential economic consequences of lost jobs and tax revenues if teams leave altogether.
Oakland, California, for example, lost both its pro football and baseball teams to Nevada after local stadium talks fell apart. The NFL’s Raiders now play in Las Vegas and MLB’s A’s are playing temporarily in West Sacramento, California, before moving into their under-construction stadium on the Vegas strip.
“What happened in Oakland is a classic example of what happens when a team doesn’t get their building in the way they want it,” Kishner said.
And those sorts of relocations can leave lasting marks, he said, pointing to the sour feelings that still persist in Brooklyn decades after MLB’s Dodgers left for Los Angeles. Other cities have similarly iconic teams, such as the NFL’s Chicago Bears.
“When push comes to shove, municipalities would be embarrassed to lose a team. I mean, could you imagine the Bears playing in St. Louis as an argument?” Kishner said. “I think Chicago would have something to say about that in a very emotional way. And by the way, these things take generations to get past.”
Currently, Chicago’s stadium discussions are more localized.
After first sharing plans to build a new stadium along Lake Michigan’s shore in Chicago, the Bears are now pursuing a massive football stadium development in suburban Arlington Heights. Despite introducing various tax measures aimed to benefit megaprojects such as stadiums, Illinois lawmakers ended their session on May 31 with no action on the matter.
Democratic state Rep. Kam Buckner, whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side, said lawmakers have little appetite to invest heavily in stadiums.
The MLS’ Chicago Fire just announced plans to privately finance a new $650 million professional soccer stadium in the city’s South Loop — the same area the MLB’s White Sox are also eyeing as they explore a new baseball stadium.
“The days of widespread public money for private stadiums without public benefit — those days are over, and that is not just a sentiment in the state of Illinois. I think this is a sentiment across the country,” Buckner said.
Still, he acknowledged the sway emotions can have in the matter. While the Bears leaving the city limits likely would not affect the region’s economy, he said, it would still prove a blow to morale.
“My brain tells me it’s not that big of a deal,” he said, “but my heart and soul as a Chicagoan doesn’t want them to leave.”
 
Money matters
Missouri’s stadium debate has been simmering for years now: The Royals first announced plans in 2022 to move downtown from their stadium on the outskirts of the city. And the Chiefs — who share the sprawling stadium complex with the Royals — quickly followed with talks of wanting a new or renovated stadium.
After voters in a county election last year soundly rejected extending a stadium sales tax to fund those plans, lawmakers across the border in Kansas passed legislation that would fund up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums. That measure expires at the end of June, pushing Missouri legislators to act.
Neil deMause, a journalist who has written extensively about stadium subsidies, said such deadlines are arbitrary and meant to exact political pressure.
While politicians once had plausible deniability about the pitfalls of stadium subsidies, the research is now overwhelmingly clear and well covered in the media, he said. (It’s been nearly a decade since HBO’s John Oliver dedicated an episode of his satirical news show to the folly of stadium finance.)
But politicians on both sides of the aisle continue to push stadium subsidies — whether they’re touting the potential for wider real estate development or intangibles such as team pride and fears of losing franchises.
“It’s this prescribed dance, where everybody sort of pretends to be doing due diligence, but at the same time, everybody knows it’s going to happen,” deMause said.
He said that appears to be the case in the nation’s capital.
In April, city and team officials for the Washington Commanders announced plans for a 65,000-seat stadium. The proposed deal, which must be approved by the full city council, would cost taxpayers some $1.1 billion over eight years.
But deMause’s analysis of the plan determined the public will be spending well in excess of that figure because of billions in free rent and hundreds of millions in property tax breaks. He estimates taxpayers will pay or forgo at least $7.5 billion on the deal.
“Everybody in and around the D.C. Council seems to be saying, ‘Yeah, it sure is a lot of money, but the mayor really wants it, so it’s going to happen. It’s just a matter of whether or not we can improve it some,’” he said. “It’s a little bit like saying, ‘World War II is going to happen — just try and keep the death toll down.’”
Last week, Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office released a report it commissioned that projected the stadium would create billions in new economic output and local tax revenue in the coming decades — figures that were quickly disputed by skeptical economists and academics.
Still, much of the district’s stadium conversation has centered on intangibles such as hometown pride and nostalgia. Even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell waxed about his childhood memories attending games at the old RFK Stadium at an April event announcing the deal.
Sitting in front of a “WELCOME HOME” banner at that event, the mayor said the RFK site was “where they belong.”
“I want to start by saying welcome home,” she said.

When Joe Lemnah’s savings ran dry, VEDA’s support let BBCo.’s beer flow. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Burlington Beer Co.: Where fermentation meets imagination .","“VEDA is creating business and jobs in Vermont — it’s very noticeable and appreciated, so when we were growing over the years, we went back to VEDA” – BBCo. Founder, Joe Lemnah

After home-brewing back in 2006, Joe Lemnah moved around the areas where the breweries were hopping, including to Delaware, the home of Dogfish Head. At Dogfish Head, Lemnah converted his love of home-brewing to the art of commercial brewing. 
His goal, though, was always to bring his talent back to Vermont. After completing the 10,000 or so hours it takes to master the skill, that’s exactly what he did by starting Burlington Beer Company in 2014. 

The company has a 22,000-square-foot production facility in Williston and a brew pub-slash-event-space-slash-hip-hangout in Burlington’s South End, which opened in 2021. 
Lemnah said that with his family’s savings tapped to start the brewery, it was a struggle to find a lender willing to take the leap, particularly a decade ago when the brewery market was quickly becoming saturated. 
“I just went all in,” Lemnah laughed. “It was a pretty rough business plan. I was a brewer by trade and have had to become a business person” 
Thankfully, he said, VEDA and its partners at the National Bank of Middlebury believed in what he wanted to do. 
“VEDA taking chances on people that have that passion means a lot, after getting so many ‘nos’ from the bank,” he said. “VEDA is creating business and jobs in Vermont — it’s very noticeable and appreciated, so when we were growing over the years, we went back to VEDA.” 
This has included the brew house, more tanks, a canning line and so on. It makes for great conversation, Lemnah said: sharing the need for new equipment and projecting the revenue that will come in return.

Plus, Burlington Beer Co. gives back to the community in myriad ways, including special brews for important causes, like the Vermont benefit beer, created in response to major flooding in 2023. 
“We were doing a lot of things through the years that I think the more traditional and even some of the up-and-coming breweries that are making some different styles of beer looked down upon like, ‘Oh, what do you put it in your beer? That’s gross. That’s not beer anymore’” he said. “But it’s fun. Beer was meant to be fun.” 
For Lemnah, it’s important for his personality, his artistic spirit to come through in the taste, the look and the feel of the brand. 
“We’re making liquid art, we’re making label art; we’re just trying to have fun at the end of the day,” he said. 
Without the low-interest financing available through VEDA, Lemnah said, his incredibly capital-intensive small business may have never gotten started.

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/06/la-area-medical-clinic-immigration-agents/,Fear of immigration raids is driving Southern California patients to cancel health care.

Fear of immigration raids is driving Southern California patients to cancel health care. A third of medical appointments and half of dental appointments at St. John’s 28 clinics were cancelled this week.



California hospitals and clinics are on high alert as immigration raids continue and their patients — both legal residents and undocumented immigrants — afraid to step out are increasingly canceling medical appointments.One Los Angeles-area clinic system, St. John’s Community Health, told CalMatters about a close encounter with officials who appeared to be immigration agents. Staff said armed officers wearing tactical gear tried to enter a parking lot in Downey, about 10 miles southeast of Los Angeles, where doctors and nurses in a mobile health clinic were seeing patients, many of them walk-ins from the community. 
Alfredo Contreras, the driver of the mobile clinic, said five unmarked SUVs and vans on Wednesday evening pulled up to a gate in the parking lot where they had set up, located at a drug and alcohol recovery center. Contreras and a security guard stood in front of their vehicles, blocking the entrance.  
Contreras said he and the guard “held our ground, we did not move” and the officers didn’t get out of their vehicles.
“I told (the security guard) ‘Don’t worry, they can’t come in without a warrant,’ so I’m sure they (agents) could hear us because their windows were down,” Contreras said. 
Both of them started walking back as the center’s gate slowly closed in front of them. The agents eventually left after a few minutes, Contreras said.

Peggy Hernandez, the mobile clinic coordinator who also was at the scene, said while Contreras and the security guard dealt with the agents, her staff calmly alerted patients who were waiting in line. None identified themselves as being at risk because of their legal status, but still, she said both patients and staff were shaken up.
“That’s the first time they (immigration officials) have ever come that close to the clinic or to us providing health care services,” said Jim Mangia, CEO of St. John’s Community Health. Staff at the clinics, he said, have been training for this type of situation. 
Growing fear and cancelled health appointments
One of President Donald Trump’s first orders upon taking office in January was to rescind a Biden-era rule that protected “sensitive locations” — places of worship, hospitals, clinics and schools — from immigration operations. 
In an email response to CalMatters, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, did not address whether U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents visited any LA-area medical clinics this week.
But asked why ICE would target such locations, McLaughlin said the administration is protecting “Americans who attend” these sensitive locations “by preventing criminal aliens and gang members from exploiting these locations and taking safe haven there because these criminals knew law enforcement couldn’t go inside under the previous administration.”
“ICE will be using the ‘common sense’ standard for any enforcement actions at these locations, relying on the discretion of the law enforcement officer.”TRICIA MCLAUGHLIN, DEPT. OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
“Officers would need secondary supervisor approval before any action can be taken in locations such as a church or a school. We expect these to be extremely rare,” McLaughlin said in the email.
Trump’s directive “gives our law enforcement the ability to do their jobs…ICE will be using the ‘common sense’ standard for any enforcement actions at these locations, relying on the discretion of the law enforcement officer,” she said.
Government data and news reports show that ICE is increasingly detaining people without criminal convictions. The same day that immigration agents tried to enter the Downey parking lot where St. John’s mobile health van was stationed, some also showed up outside two nearby churches where they apprehended people, including one elderly man, according to local news reports.
Health advocates and providers say that rather than protecting people, ICE is scaring people from seeking basic medical care.
That fear is expected to grow, especially after, as the Associated Press first reported Friday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shared Medi-Cal data, including people’s immigration status, with the Department of Homeland Security. California officials, including the state’s Department of Health Care Services which oversees Medi-Cal, have long reassured undocumented immigrants that their personal information would not be shared with federal agencies for immigration enforcement. 
At St. John’s, which has 28 sites across Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire, Mangia estimates that roughly a third of medical appointments and half of dental appointments were cancelled this week.
People have been skipping care out of fear for months now, but recent raids have increased the no-shows and cancellations. When possible, his clinics are turning people to telehealth and a recently-launched home visitation program, he said.
The Hospital Association of Southern California said on Thursday that it was not aware of any immigration enforcement activity inside or directly outside any Southern California hospital campus, but that the chilling effect was noticeable in some emergency waiting rooms.
“Some hospitals have reported a decline in emergency department volume, which raises our concern that individuals may be delaying necessary care out of fear,” Adam Blackstone, a spokesperson for the association, said in a written response. 
“Fear of going outside or being picked up by ICE…can create worse outcomes, such as ending up on my operating room table with an amputation or a ruptured appendix.”SANDY REDING, CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION 
Sandy Reding, an operating room nurse at Bakersfield Memorial Hospital and president of the California Nurses Association, said anecdotes of similar patterns were reported in Bakersfield following January raids there.
The consequences of putting off care are never good, especially for people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, she said.
“Not having the optimal care because of fear of going outside or being picked up by ICE creates delays in care, which can create worse outcomes, such as ending up on my operating room table with an amputation or a ruptured appendix,” Reding said. 
“My concern right now is that we take care of everybody in a timely manner, and that they feel that the hospital is a safe place to go to get care,” she said.
Many patients seeking virtual care
For non-emergency care, patients have more options. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services has published resources for remote care. Included are phone numbers and portals where county clinic patients can call a nurse advice line and request medication drop-offs. The department encourages people who would rather stay home to call their clinic and change their appointments to virtual or phone visits. Officials with the county health department said immigration agents have not entered any of their county health facilities. “However, the mere threat of immigration enforcement near any medical facility undermines public trust and jeopardizes community health,” they wrote in an unsigned email.
People without a preferred clinic may also seek services from organizations such as Zócalo Health, which provides virtual-first care, including mental health visits. The group was created to boost culturally competent care in Latino communities, said CEO Erik Cardenas. Services are available for people throughout California, including those covered by certain Medi-Cal plans. People can call the group’s main line to check insurance eligibility and book appointments online. 
“Having a virtual network of physicians and therapists that look like you, talk like you, think like you, is a really good tool to have right now because it augments access,” Cardenas said. 
Since the pandemic, most clinics and doctors’ offices across the state now offer virtual care. 
‘A devastating contradiction’
The immigration raids are coinciding with major proposed rollbacks in Medi-Cal for undocumented people.
As the state tries to offset a projected $12 billion deficit, Gov. Gavin Newsom last month put out a budget proposal that freezes enrollment and reduces services for this population. State health officials have said the state is spending more on medical coverage and prescription drugs for undocumented enrollees than they anticipated. 
The Legislature, in its own version of the budget, on Friday accepted most of Newsom’s freezes and cuts for immigrants with some modifications. For example, lawmakers want to charge undocumented immigrants $30 a month for their Medi-Cal insurance instead of the $100 that Newsom proposed. Legislators also want a six-month grace period for people to re-enroll if they fall off coverage for missing payments.Lawmakers and Newsom face a June 27 deadline for agreeing on a final budget.
Republican lawmakers say the governor and Democratic lawmakers are responsible for a Medi-Cal expansion that has become unsustainable. “We committed spending to something we can’t afford,” Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican from Roseville and vice chair of the Senate budget committee, has told CalMatters.

Meanwhile, health and immigration advocates are pushing the state to keep immigrants covered, especially in this time of fear.  
Mar Velez, director of policy at the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California, said it doesn’t make sense for Democrats to defend immigrants in the face of the federal immigration raids and at the same time go after their health coverage.
“They’ve been very clear that we need to protect immigrant communities, and so why isn’t the state budget reflecting that?” she said.
Mangia at St. John’s said his clinics’ staff have been getting questions from patients almost daily about the future of their Medi-Cal coverage.
“Our patients are very worried about it,” he said. “And I think it’s a devastating contradiction, on the one hand to have the governor and elected officials say we support immigrants, but when it comes to making sure that they have health care, they’re willing to kind of cut those services away.”

Despite the curfew, people are still coming to downtown LA to participate in immigration protests. Local residents are living with around-the-clock law enforcement and experiencing vandalism.


Days of volatile immigration protests and demonstrations in downtown Los Angeles led to an 8 p.m. area curfew imposed this week by Mayor Karen Bass.   
But even with the local night time movement subdued, helicopters continued to roar overhead at all hours. Law enforcement vehicles blazed through streets en masse — blue and red headlights flashing, sirens piercing.
Demonstrators from other parts of the city and throughout the state still made their way into downtown during the day. They headed toward the federal complex where National Guard and Los Angeles police stood ready for action — along with large congregations of media personnel.
Now, in the communities adjacent to the government center — nearby neighborhoods like Little Tokyo — shops and businesses sit shuttered. Plywood panels cover their windows, and their owners either plan to close early or don’t even bother opening up.
It’s a new and yet familiar reality for those who live and work in downtown L.A. It’s also not clear when it will end, with large protests expected this weekend and troops stationed there indefinitely.
Here’s a look at how the week played out for protesters, shop owners and locals.
‘It’s hard to tell what’s really going on’
At Apple’s Tower Theater store a mile and a half away from Alameda and Temple streets, a heavy wooden barricade now protects the large panoramic glass of the repurposed movie house. Usually abuzz with customers who can be seen from the street, the tech community gathering space sits empty and dormant.
Lisa H. drives into downtown from South Central three or four days a week for her work as a legal consultant. Through hypervigilant eyes, she scanned the sidewalks on the way to her Prius.
“I just hope everyone stays safe out here,” she said, reluctant to give her last name to a reporter. “It’s hard to tell what’s really going on right now. I think folks are coming here with the intention to just stir things up. Doesn’t this feel like it’s all being set up or staged?”
She remembers the 1992 Rodney King riots. “That really was civil unrest. This is something else.”
Meltem Karakova has lived downtown with her husband and toddler for three months.
“It seems safe right here in this neighborhood,” said Karakova, as she pushed her child in a stroller several blocks from the Apple store. “But the noise at night from all the sirens and helicopters gives me a bit of anxiety.” 
Then she gestured in the direction of the federal buildings. “We don’t go over there where it gets crazy.”
LA businesses brace for recurring vandalism
Less than half a mile away in Little Tokyo, business owners said they lost customers and suffered vandalism through the days of protests.
“I’m a Japanese immigrant myself,” said Ryota Sakai, who runs a retail shop on 1st Street. “I have my green card, but I understand the stakes — what others must go through just to be here.”
Sakai said his sales have plummeted since last weekend’s protests. With hardly any retail traffic on Wednesday, he did not know whether he would open his doors again until things returned to normal. Still, he felt fortunate that his storefront had not been vandalized.
“I feel for my neighbors, all down this street and around me,” said Sakai. “The taggers hit their shops for no reason — just because we’re here, I guess. They broke some windows and lit fires, too.”

Joyce Leung has co-owned her clothing and accessories store on 1st Street since 2009. She said her business hasn’t experienced any vandalism or problems with protesters in the area over the years until Tuesday night, right after the curfew went into effect.
“We all hung around out front of our stores along this street, keeping an eye out together as a community until almost 11 p.m.,” said Leung. “But right after we locked up and went upstairs, we heard glass breaking.”
“Yeah, a truck pulled up and shot something at our front door window,” explained employee Sam Du. “I think it was like a BB or pellet gun.”
Du and Leung cleaned up all the shattered glass. A black curtain blew in the breeze as a makeshift cover, and behind the other glass door, a painted “Closed” sign sat propped on a chair.
Leung spoke about the last handful of days downtown compared to her previous experiences with protests and civil unrest, like the 2020 Black Lives Matter demonstrations: “This is bad, different,” she said. “It feels more violent. These people are so ballsy and brazen now.”
Du concurred. “We’ve never seen it like this before so close to home, right on our street,” he said. “A lot of these restaurants, our neighbors, had tent setups for outdoor dining, and protesters were turning them over to use as barricades. They used some as barriers and others they left burning.”
Leung said she plans to shut the store down until after what she described as riots subside — especially in consideration of this weekend’s expected “No kings” protests.

Demonstrators converge
Raul Gomez drivesup from Torrance every day and sells large flags for $20 a pop — Mexico, California, the U.S., El Salvador, Venezuela, Honduras, etc. He stood with his cart on a corner right across the street from the federal buildings. He’s sold around 200 flags per day.
“It’s been a little quiet today,” Gomez said on Wednesday afternoon. “I’ll pack up and move as soon as I see trouble. Most folks are out here to be peaceful. These are my people, mi gente. But you can see the other kind coming a mile away. They’re just here to start shit.”
Six Los Angeles Police Department officers stood casually around parked cars on the opposite corner. “They never bother me,” said Gomez.
Grace Martinez and her 16-year-old daughter, Raylene, stopped by Gomez’s stand on their way to the federal building. Grace wanted to buy a flag that is split diagonally down the middle — half American stars and stripes, half Mexican green, white and red.
“We came to support our people — immigrants,” said Grace, who drove downtown from her suburban home 40 miles away. “My father came here from Mexico years ago. If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t be here. So I’m very thankful and blessed for that, and I want to defend the people that can’t defend themselves.” 
When asked how she feels about bricks being thrown at law enforcement and street vandalism all around the courthouse, Martinez said, “I’m a little nervous about it, but I’m trying to think positive that that’s not going to happen to us.”
Raylene said she’s ready. “Not everything’s gonna be peaceful. A lot of protests in L.A. from years and years ago weren’t all peaceful. Violence is never the answer, but violence gets more people to notice.”
She held a large “Who would Jesus deport?” sign she made herself.

Another demonstrator, J, didn’t want to give his full name. He’s been riding the Metro from South Los Angeles out to the downtown protest blocks with his 50/50 U.S./Mexico flag every day since Saturday. “The news — they kinda lie about everything, in my opinion,” said J. “There’s only like a few bad things that happen, but they make it like a big thing. We’re all being peaceful out here.”
With his flag draped over his shoulder, J bumped his fist against his chest as passing drivers honked their horns at him in support.
“The news makes it worse for us,” he said. “Respectfully, those guys over there and those guys down there,” he gestured toward LAPD officers grouped across the street and pointed at the National Guard soldiers farther down the block. “They make it worse for us.”

(Photo provided by ConocoPhillips)The multiagency group that coordinates oversight of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System needs an update to better operate in changing conditions, said a federal report released on Thursday.
The Joint Pipeline Office, a consortium of federal and state agencies with various regulatory duties, has scaled back its operations over the past several years, leading to possible gaps in oversight of the system that has delivered North Slope crude oil since 1977, said the report, issued by the Government Accountability Office, an independent nonpartisan agency that conducts audits and investigations for Congress.
To meet current conditions, the joint office should clarify its desired outcomes and resume what was once communication with the public about regulation, enforcement and other issues, the GAO report said.
“Redefining and documenting the intended outcomes of JPO’s oversight activities, including those aiming to inform the public of its oversight efforts, would enable JPO agencies to work toward shared goals and ensure accountability,” the report said. It is important to document the expectations, the report said. “Clarifying roles and responsibilities would enhance coordination among JPO agencies and help JPO identify any potential gaps in oversight.”
The GAO report was requested by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.
The JPO, led by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Alaska Department of National Resources, was established in 1990 in response to the prior year’s Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster. The purpose was to better regulate the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, which comprises the 800-mile pipeline that carries crude oil from an intake station at Prudhoe Bay and the Valdez Marine Terminal, where the oil is loaded onto tankers.
Other agencies participating in the JPO are the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development.
Much has changed since the JPO’s startup, the GAO report points out.
North Slope oil production has dwindled. Pipeline throughput that averaged nearly 1.8 million barrels per day in 1990, close to the peak of 2 million barrels a day hit in 1988, is at an average daily flow of 482,495 barrels for the year to date, according to Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium that operates the system.
Lower oil volume affects Alyeska operations because the oil flowing through the line cools faster, moves slower and drops more solids, leading to more corrosion risks, the report noted.
Permafrost thaw, which undermines infrastructure through much of Alaska, has also affected the system’s integrity and prompted Alyeska to do some special maintenance and protective projects in slumping areas.
Alyeska in the early 2000s launched what it called a “strategic reconfiguration,” later renamed as “electrification and automation,” that increased automation, consolidated facilities — notably for pump stations along the 800-mile line and at the Valdez marine terminal — and relocated workers.
The agencies that are part of the JPO have also changed over time, with shifts in responsibilities and structure.
The JPO agencies continue to communicate with each other and continue to engage together in spill drills and other activities, the GAO report said. But since 2004, there has no longer been a common physical office, and JPO staffing has been reduced. The JPO no longer issues regular activity reports to the public; Its last Comprehensive Monitoring Program report was issued in 2007 and its last annual report in 2005, the GAO report said.
There are now concerns about oversight gaps, particularly at the Valdez terminal. The report cited one example of a troubling incident, the 2022 discovery of vapor leaks at 12 of the thermal’s 14 oil storage tanks. That event led to a report commissioned by the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council that criticized the safety culture at the terminal.
The GAO has issued other reports in the past about TAPS regulation and the JPO. A 1995 report lauded the joint office for improving oversight of the pipeline and terminal.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)A budget plan is taking shape and the clock is ticking.
Maine Morning Star will have regular updates as the committee tasked with setting that plan, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, takes straw votes on what to include ahead of a final vote on the budget proposal to be sent to the Maine Senate and House of Representatives for consideration.
Legislative leaders have said the intention is to complete all work by June 18, what had been the statutory adjournment date for the first regular session. Though, the Legislature is now in a special session, without a formal deadline.
In March, the Democratic majority pushed through a roughly $11.3 billion, two-year budget plan without Republican support and formally adjourned in order to start the clock for those funds to become available in 90 days. 
Senate Republicans refused to back an alternative short-term plan that would have immediately filled the current deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, because it did not include structural reform to the program.
The budget that did pass continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing one-time funding for MaineCare and other urgent needs. But it didn’t include any of the policy changes Gov. Janet Mills proposed, such as tax increases and program cuts, to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
These proposals and others from lawmakers are now being weighed by the appropriations committee as it crafts the next iteration of the budget.

Committee sets budget plan


By: Emma Davis - Saturday June 14, 2025 9:06 am


















In a party-line vote with Republicans opposed, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee set a budget plan just after 1 a.m. on Saturday, after convening for its final work session at 6:25 p.m. on Friday while the House was still in session. 
Some notable final actions included rejecting Gov. Janet Mills’ proposed cuts to low-income food assistance and upping ongoing funding for General Assistance, which helps municipalities pay for basic necessities for those who can’t afford them. 
Regarding health care, the committee added cost-of-living adjustments for direct care workers, though at lower than expected rates, as well as funding for family planning services, but also at a lower amount than providers say they need. 
Several bills currently pending were also worked into the budget plan, including proposals to alter the child tax credit and real estate transfer tax.
The budget bill now heads to the House of Representatives and Senate for approval. 
General Assistance
One of the last additions to the budget that the committee added early Saturday morning was increasing the baseline for General Assistance.
With an 8-4 vote, the committee added $2 million per year ongoing, $4 million in 2025-26 and back payments for 2023-24 to be distributed to municipalities based on their share of overall state reimbursement costs.
Republicans argued against the added spending, noting that most will go to Portland. The state’s most populous city receives the most funding for this program, disproportionate spending that the city’s elected leaders have argued is by design, given that most homeless shelters, and mental health and substance use treatment centers are located in or near Portland. 
“That’s not the way General Assistance is supposed to work,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said, noting that, for the most part, in order to get funds through the program you have to live in the municipality in which you’re receiving it. 
But that’s how it is working currently, said Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), who introduced this amendment.
Gattine said he’s heard a saying ever since he’s been involved in municipal government work that the General Assistance program is “a ticket to Portland.”
SNAP
The majority of the committee rejected Mills’ proposed reductions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. 
Maine is one of five states that provide a state-funded benefit to noncitizens not eligible for federally funded SNAP. Mills proposed eliminating what is referred to as the “Hardship D” exemption of the state program, which grants benefits for people who have received their work authorization but are unemployed.
Instead, the committee added $2.5 million for the program in each year of the biennium.  
“When we’re facing certain federal cuts in SNAP benefits to Mainers [and] we know that one in five children in the state goes to bed hungry every night, I can’t think of anything more critical than feeding Maine families,” Rep. Holly Stover (D-Boothbay) said. 
Health care
The committee included 1% cost-of-living adjustments, known as COLAs, for direct care workers for people on MaineCare who are due to receive rate adjustments starting in July, but this is not a fully funded COLA under the current statute. 
The Mills administration started withholding expected COLAs in January. The biennial budget passed in March back paid funding for a 1.95% increase, though more had been expected. 
“As we try to balance all the important things that we need to do, I don’t think we’re ever going to, I’m never going to walk out of here and feel that I’ve done enough,” Gattine said, adding that he hopes when lawmakers return in January for the second regular session that the Legislature can do more. 
Rep. Mark Blier (R-Buxton) pushed back on that, arguing, “If we really want to find the money to fund these people, we can find it,” however he also pledged, “Come January, let’s re-look at this. Let’s give these people the wage increases that they deserve and that we promised.”
However, the committee later rejected Mills’ proposal to restructure that rate setting, with members saying they didn’t fully understand it. Instead, that proposal is now expected to return as a department bill next year. 
Meanwhile, the committee further delayed — to the next Legislature — another health care-related initiative. It removed Mills’ proposal to decrease hospital reimbursement rates but then voted in those reductions starting after the 2027 fiscal year, essentially allowing it to return as an option when the next Legislature sets the biennium budget for 2028-29.
“So we’re making sure we’re taking care of the hospitals,” Fredette said, referring to this item, “but the direct care workers are taking it on the chin,” he added, referring to the COLAs.
The majority of the committee also voted to include a $3 million appropriation for family planning services, which include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions. 
This amount is half of what providers requested in a bill this year, which currently sits on the appropriations table.  
Bills
The committee included in the budget funding for a number of bills that had already passed both chambers but were awaiting funding. 
One was a bill sponsored by Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick), LD 1294, which would double the Dependent Exemption Tax Credit, Maine’s version of a child tax credit, for children under six years.
Another was a bill from Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford), LD 1082, to increase the real estate transfer tax on property valued at more than $1 million and requires 30% to be distributed to a new fund in the Maine State Housing Authority, which supports affordable housing.
While there is minimal cost associated with LD 1018, the committee opted to add the initiative to the budget. It prohibits discrimination by pharmaceutical manufacturers, health insurance carriers, pharmacy benefits managers and their agents against pharmacies and health care providers based on their participation in the federal 340B prescription drug discount program.
While most other initiatives were party-line votes, this addition was supported by one Republican, Rep. Jack Ducharme of Madison, who co-sponsored the bill. 
The committee also included funding to the Office of Aging and Disability Services for community-based services such as Meals on Wheels, essentially an initiative to help mitigate the fact that the Older Americans Act is no longer funded by the federal government. 
The committee also backed $3 million for each year of the next biennium to replace current and anticipated reductions in grants administered under the Victims of Crime Act. It also added certain mental health workers under the 1998 Special Plan for Retirement.

Committee yet to convene


By: Emma Davis - Friday June 13, 2025 5:30 pm


















As of 5:30 p.m. on Friday, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee has yet to meet on microphone to set the budget plan, after scheduling a work session for 9 a.m.

Adding streaming tax, upping cannabis tax and continuing free community college


By: Emma Davis - Thursday June 12, 2025 10:23 pm


















Returning on microphone after 9 p.m. Thursday night, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee voted to include several additional taxes proposed by Gov. Janet Mills in the budget, including a tax on streaming services and increasing the sales tax on cannabis. However, the committee included a smaller amount than the governor suggested to continue funding free community college. 
The committee voted 7-4 to include Mills’ proposed new 5.5% tax on streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. 
The committee also voted 8-4 to increase the sales tax on adult use cannabis from 10% to 14%, while reducing the cannabis excise tax rates by one-third. This was not a party-line vote. Rep. Kristen Cloutier (D-Lewiston), who co-chairs the Taxation Committee, said she was not in favor of this initiative.
“I’ve been in contact with some folks who are in the cannabis industry in my district and they have really advocated loudly against this,” Cloutier said. 
With these decisions made, the committee has now decided on what to include, and not include, out of Mills’ major tax proposals. 
In addition to the streaming and cannabis taxes, earlier Thursday the committee rolled back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes and increased the cigarette excise tax at an even higher amount than Mills requested. However, the committee rejected her suggested taxes on ambulances and pharmacies.
Most debate surrounded including funding to continue Maine’s Free College Scholarship, which the committee decided to fund but at a reduced amount. 
Rather than include the $12.5 million per year sought by the governor, the committee voted 9-3 to fund the program at $10 million per year through the next biennium. 
“We’ve had to make hard decisions about what we think we can afford, not afford, and we’re supportive but we believe that they’ll be able to address a need with $10 million a year,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.
However, to help guide decisions about continuing the program beyond that, the committee will be writing a letter to the community colleges requesting recommendations on eligibility requirements, out-of-state student funding, economy of scale and estimated future funding. 
“We had promised nights that would not be long,” committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said at 10:10 p.m. “We have just a little bit to finish up, but we will do that in the morning.” The committee is scheduled to reconvene at 9 a.m.

Budget gets bump from a “large and unusual” payment


By: Emma Davis -  5:33 pm


















The Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee announced Thursday afternoon the state has come into more cash that can be added to the budget. The additional funds are from some state agencies seeing unexpected surpluses this fiscal year. It also comes from two significant estate payments.
The majority of the committee moved all of this funding into the budget plan with 8-4 votes. 
Since the most recent revenue forecast in May, Maine received two “large and unusual” estate payments, Kirsten Figueroa, commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, told the appropriations committee Thursday afternoon. This now puts the estate tax line well above what was initially expected.
“Does that mean two people passed and this is where this money came from?” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) asked.
“I do,” Figueroa responded.  
The way this funding, $24 million, will be added to the budget is also unusual, because technically the money isn’t real until the fiscal year ends on June 30. But ultimately it will be used to pay for part of the $122 million in MaineCare funding for fiscal year 2027 that the committee voted into the budget on Wednesday. 
The majority of the committee also voted into the budget millions of dollars that various departments are not planning to use up by the end of the fiscal year. Among those funds are $4.5 million from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Behavioral Health and $5 million from the Office of Disability Services.
“I would rather keep the money in the account and have it be used for what it should be used for, rather than going to the general fund, which by going into the general fund, is essentially funding MaineCare,” Fredette said.

Committee saves money by rolling back funding for mental health programs, pensions


By: Emma Davis -  12:27 pm


















While not sticking to its stated start time, the appropriations committee returned Thursday morning to take more straw votes to work toward a complete budget plan. The committee plans to return throughout the day for more votes.
Mental health
Following the deadliest mass shooting in Maine history in 2023, the state put significant resources into bolstering mental health support. However, faced with the current deficit, the appropriations committee opted to reduce some of those programs.
On Tuesday, the committee approved funding for crisis receiving centers in Penobscot and Androscoggin counties but on Thursday voted out money for these centers in Kennebec and Aroostook counties.
In the supplemental budget last year, the governor signed into law funding to develop these crisis receiving centers following the Lewiston shooting. When presenting her two-year budget plan back in January, Mills argued it was not financially feasible to build all of the centers she had hoped. 
Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison raised concern about walking back on these commitments and said the centers were a point of rare bipartisan agreement last year, though the overall budget was passed mostly along party lines with Democrats in favor. 
“As someone who actually voted for the funding for this in the previous budget, this is a difficult cut for me to accept,” said committee co-chair Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook). 
Regarding Aroostook County in particular, Gattine said he spoke with the Department of Health and Human Services, whose representatives think that this specific model might not be the best for that rural area, so they may suggest an alternative crisis model in the future. 
The committee also removed funding for 24 mental health law enforcement liaisons to support mental health crisis intervention, and mobile response services.
The majority of the appropriations committee also voted to make cuts to various mental health services.
The committee voted 7-5 to provide county jails $4 million for medication assisted treatment to address drug dependency in fiscal year 2026, but did not include funding for the following year, which Gattine explained could be revisited in a supplemental budget next year. The committee also reduced funding for employee recruitment and retention of staff that provide medication management services within the Office of Behavioral Health.
Mills proposed a number of reductions to the overall state budget, focusing on new programs  that had not yet been fully started. While Gattine again reiterated the cuts are not something he takes lightly, he said, “I really came back to the fact that the baseline of MaineCare, everything that we have funded, provides millions and billions of dollars of support for behavioral health needs. I don’t think we support those needs enough. I’m hoping we can continue to do things to support the needs of people with behavioral health needs.”
Pensions 
Another area where the majority of the committee proposed to save money is rolling back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes.
The committee voted 8-5 to incorporate Mills’ proposal to phase-out a current deduction offered for nonmilitary pensions, though changed the thresholds. 
Mills proposed a phase-out beginning with income over $100,000 for individuals, $150,000 for heads of households and $200,000 for married individuals filing jointly. But the committee backed phase outs starting at $125,000 for individuals, $187,500 for heads of household, and $250,000 for joint filers. 
“The money that we’re taking belongs to them,” Rep. Mark Blier (R-Buxton) said in protest. “It doesn’t belong to us.”
Paid Family and Medical Leave 
The committee voted 7-5 to include funding the governor proposed to help cover the costs of the community college system, Maine Maritime Academy and the University of Maine System for the state-supported positions related to the new Paid Family and Medical Leave Program, which took effect on Jan. 1. 
However, the committee reduced the allocations Mills suggested for the university system, which Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, said it was because the system negotiated with a company that is allowing them to get premiums to cover some of the cost. 
Amid the voting, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) wanted to specify that this is one-time funding to cover the initial cost of the paid family leave program, after Republicans raised concerns about the state being on the hook. The committee ultimately incorporated that note.
“So you are going to take the lollipop away from the baby,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “I’m anxious to see that. Thank you.”
Additional decisions
The majority of the committee also approved an increase from $5 to $7 for fishing license fees. 
Also, following the request of the Legislative Council, which is made up of the ten elected members of leadership, the committee agreed to incorporate several temporary legislative positions, though did not go so far as to make them permanent.

Increased cigarette tax, rejected child care cuts, funded MaineCare


By: Emma Davis - Wednesday June 11, 2025 10:50 pm


















The budget took more of a shape Wednesday night, though, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said, “we are determined to get this budget done in the daylight,” so the committee is reconvening at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. 
Substantial decisions were made Wednesday night when the committee reconvened, including increasing Maine’s cigarette tax more than Gov. Janet Mills’ had proposed, rejecting Mills’ proposed cuts to child care worker stipends and Head Start, and adding funding for MaineCare. 
When Mills first proposed her budget in January, a key component she highlighted to address the deficit was her plan to raise revenue through a $1 increase in the cigarette excise tax — from $2 per pack to $3 — and corresponding increases to the excise tax on other tobacco-related products.
The majority of the appropriations committee voted 8-4 to increase it by $1.50.
Since Mills released her proposal, Republicans have been steadfast about their opposition to raising this tax, and to tax increases of any kind. On Wednesday those in the minority party on the committee again made that stance clear.
“I was shocked when the governor came out with the original proposed tax increase on the cigarettes of a buck,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said, “and now to throw it up to a buck and a half. I see in my opinion, with all due respect to everyone around this horseshoe, a lack of ability to make tough decisions on where we’re going to spend money in this state.”
When Mills presented her proposal back in January, she touted it as a way to help generate revenue while simultaneously reducing public health costs in the long-term by disincentivizing people to smoke. Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln) highlighted that goal in voicing her support for upping the tax, stating that her stepfather recently died of cancer caused by cigarettes.
But Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester) countered, “I don’t feel like it’s responsible to base our budget on revenue that we hope will go down.”
The majority of the committee, voting 7-5, subsequently approved about $122 million for MaineCare, filling a gap left in the initial two-year budget passed in March that did not include MaineCare funding for the second year of the biennium. 
“I do believe we should pay our bills, but we also had reforms to hopefully reduce that amount that we’re paying,” Arata said, referring to proposals to implement work requirements and other reforms to the program that failed to be included in the supplemental budget for the current fiscal year. “Therefore, I can’t support this motion.”  
The majority almost entirely rejected the governor’s proposed cuts related to child care programs, with one exception. 
Voting 7-5 again, the committee removed from the budget plan Mills’ proposal to reverse the state’s recent investments in child care by reducing worker stipends by $30 million to bring them back to 2022 levels. With the same vote breakdown, the committee also rejected Mills’ proposal to cut funding for Head Start by $7 million. 
That same majority also rejected a proposed $2.5 million cut in fiscal year 2026 to the child care employment award program, which includes child care staff in the Maine Child Care affordability program, however the committee chose to remove funding for the award program in 2027. 
“This was styled as a two-year pilot program, so our intent is to continue the pilot program in 2026, not provide funding for it in fiscal year 2027 at this time,” said Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “We’ll have a chance to evaluate that next year when we reconvene.”  
Although a budget-neutral move, one decision Wednesday night received praise from Republicans. 
Mills proposed elevating the current Governor’s Energy Office to a cabinet-level department in her budget plan but the committee removed that change Wednesday, in light of a separate bill moving through the Legislature that seeks to do that. 
“I appreciate the fact that we are letting this kind of an initiative be debated as it should be in the policy committees and brought to the floor for a vote,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison.

Preserving Maine State Grant Program


By: Emma Davis -  3:58 pm


















Wednesday morning the appropriations committee made a number of reductions to the governor’s proposed funding for various departments. Returning briefly just after 3 p.m., the majority of its members chose to again reject a proposal from Mills, following requests from private higher education institutions. 
Currently, all Maine public and private universities, colleges and technical schools that administer federal financial aid, such as the Pell Grant and Direct Loans, are eligible for something called the Maine State Grant Program, which provides need-based assistance.
The governor proposed cutting Maine’s private colleges from the program, which educators and students pushed back on during the public hearing. The Education and Cultural Affairs Committee also requested the change be rejected. The appropriations committee followed suit Wednesday voting the change out of the plan 8-2. 
“Stay tuned,” appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said after the afternoon votes. “We will be back later. I’m not quite sure when but we will be back.”

Mobile home program funded while judiciary requests pared down


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 10, 2025 6:50 pm


















Indicative of the lack of sleep and long hours legislators are working, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) accidentally called a vote as unanimous as the committee met while the Senate was still in session Tuesday afternoon. 
The mishap was met with laughs as it was bookended by votes on a number of items — none of which were unanimous. 
The majority of the committee backed one-time funding — a transfer of $3 million from the unappropriated surplus of the general fund to the Maine State Housing Authority — for the manufactured and mobile home park preservation and assistance program. This was a request in a bill that passed the chambers but was placed on the appropriations table. 
There are currently more than 100 bills on this table, which is managed by the appropriations committee. Bills that cost money that hasn’t already been allocated are placed here to vie for remaining unappropriated funding — or, as evidenced by this case, could instead be included in the budget plan. 
After the committee sets the budget, one of its final acts will be to “run the table” and decide which of the remaining bills will receive funds.
Other items added into the plan include one-time funding to upgrade courtrooms with video conferencing technology. However, the committee also moved out numerous other proposals related to the judiciary, such as funding for new positions, resources and ​​increasing the number of jurors called to jury duty.
“I think we’re shortchanging the judiciary,” said Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport). 
Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee, said he believed many of the items the committee ultimately voted out were important. 
“I think by the time we’re done here, there will be over $20 million in new funding approved for them, and I hope the process is that they’re able to come back and we’re able to do more for them over time,” Gattine said.

A move to maximize federal match for free school meals


By: Emma Davis -  11:34 am


















Amid chamber work Tuesday morning, the majority of the Appropriations Committee voted in favor of a change aimed to maximize federal dollars for free school lunches in order to save the state an expected $2 million. 
After the COVID-19 pandemic, Maine became one of a handful of states to pass legislation making school meals free.
“[That] took away that stigma and took away that paperwork that was associated with individual families and individual students, so now everybody in the school district does qualify,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. “But we do have some school districts that have not enrolled in the program, so we’re not able to maximize the federal funding that’s available.”
After the committee voted to pay the difference between the federal reimbursement and full price of meals for schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program, Brennan introduced an amendment to require that in order for schools to get this state funding they must first enroll in the free meal program in a way that makes them eligible for the maximum money available at the federal level. The committee approved the change with a 9-2 straw vote. 
Much of the committee’s work has been approving, or rejecting, a number of state government positions. Republicans have continued to raise objections to expanding state government personnel. 
“I think one thing we can agree on is that it’s all a balance,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “And, maybe we balance things in different places, but finding the right balance is part of what this is all about.”

Another of Gov. Mills’ proposed taxes removed from plan


By: Emma Davis - Monday June 9, 2025 4:53 pm


















Monday morning at the State House began with more talk about taxes as the Appropriations Committee continued its line-by-lines votes on what to include in the budget. 
The majority of the committee voted to remove Mills’ proposed tax on ambulance services, which is one of several tax increases the governor proposed as a means to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
The tax on non-municipal ambulance service providers would have been equal to 6% of their net operating revenue, which the Mills administration said it would have used to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements.
While Republicans on the committee said they supported removing the tax — as the minority party has made clear it will not support tax increases of any kind — they questioned how the state will deal with those shortfalls and pay for additional spending the committee has approved. 
One example from Monday was reallocating the cost of an emergency coordinator position that is partially funded through federal expenditures to being completely supported by the general fund. 
“We’re moving positions and costs into the general fund, and my only question is, where is that money coming from?” Sen. Sue Bernard (R-Aroostook) asked. “Is it coming from more tax increases? Is it coming from cutting other programs that we haven’t gotten to yet, or what?”
Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin), who co-chairs the committee, responded, “As we build this budget, we will take care of that in one way or another so that the budget will balance at the end.” 
It is not yet clear whether the committee will support some of Mills’ other proposed taxes or the cuts she proposed to health and child care programs. So far, the committee also voted out a proposed pharmacy tax. 
Implications from federal funding cuts were also top of mind. 
The coordinator position was one of several that the committee readjusted to be more reliant on state funding, though Mills made those recommendations before President Donald Trump’s administration began rescinding congressionally appropriated funds. 
“We have talked about the fact that if federal funds disappear, positions disappear,” Rotundo said. 
But some concerns about federal funding predated Trump’s second term. During the public hearing for the budget bill, the Maine Emergency Management Agency said budget deficits related to federal funding had already resulted in the agency leaving two positions vacant. 
The committee voted to fund two positions fully with the general fund, after they’d previously been supported solely by federal dollars. 
“It was important to make sure that these positions were preserved and that it was worth the investment in additional general fund dollars,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), the other co-chair of the committee.

With less than two weeks left, lawmakers still debating budget plan


By: Emma Davis -  4:51 pm


















During the committee’s last meeting on Thursday, the majority of its members rejected a tax on Maine pharmacies the governor had proposed, while voting in favor of additional funding and rate reform for nursing homes. 
The pharmacy tax would have imposed a 70-cent tax on every outpatient prescription filled by Maine pharmacies, the revenue from which the Mills administration said it would use to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements. 
“I haven’t voted for any items,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison on Thursday. “Yet, this will be my first, because I believe that we already collect too much taxes.” 
With a 10-2 vote, other Republicans backed removing the tax too, though the holdouts noted that their opposition was because of a lack of clarity about the overall budget plan. 
“I applaud the work of the majority in terms of removing this,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “However, I will be consistent in reviewing the overall global budget in determining whether or not I will support it.” 
That sentiment was also shared ahead of the committee voting 9-3 in favor of $20 million in additional funding for nursing homes over the biennium. This includes a $6.5 million investment for rate reform to support the direct care workforce and incentivize permanent staff, which would in turn unlock $12.2 million in funding from the federal government. 
“Nursing home rate reform is very important to us, however at this particular time we have not had a discussion about where additional general funds come from that we’re going to need,” Ducharme said. “In order for me to support this, even though I would historically support something like this, I want to know where the money’s coming from.”
Other Republicans had a different take. While Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata of New Gloucester would also like to know where the funds are coming from, “I feel right about supporting this,” she said. “I might not support the entire package, but I feel better knowing that this is in there, ultimately.”

Photo contributed by Chattahoochee RiverkeeperThe U.S. Geological Survey’s South Atlantic Water Science Center in Norcross will remain open following backlash over the Department of Government Efficiency’s proposal to terminate the lease.
The U.S. Department of the Interior announced this week that the center will not have its lease terminated in order to continue critical water quality testing along the Chattahoochee River, which supplies drinking water to millions of Georgians.
Interior Acting Assistant Secretary Tyler Hassen sent letters this week informing the Georgia U.S. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of the decision. Earlier this year, the Elon Musk-led DOGE listed the property among 164 Interior buildings and offices under consideration for closure as part of its campaign to reduce government spending. The DOGE website previously projected the federal government would save $1.3 million by not renewing the lease for the Norcross center.
This spring, Warnock and Ossoff urged the feds not to eliminate vital work that includes monitoring E. coli bacteria and flood levels throughout Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
“In some cases, the department took action to reverse a termination due to the critical nature of the mission, unavailability of alternative, cost-effective solutions, or the specialized nature of the facility,” Hassen wrote. “You will be pleased to know that the GSA rescinded the termination of the USGS lease in Norcross, Georgia.”
Hassen, a former Texas oil executive, served on Musk’s DOGE team and is awaiting Senate confirmation for his new role with the Department of the Interior.
For several years, the Norcross water science center has worked with Chattahoochee Riverkeeper on the BacteriALERT program, which provides live updates to the public of the amount of E. coli contamination in the river.
“Chattahoochee Riverkeeper is pleased that the Department of the Interior has reversed the termination of the lease for the USGS South Atlantic Water Science Center,” Chattahoochee Riverkeeper Jason Ulseth said Friday. “We thank Senators Ossoff and Warnock for their leadership and are grateful for their work to ensure this vital resource remains in place for all who depend on it.”

SPARTAN 151 RIG, COOK INLET — Deep below the ocean floor outside Anchorage this spring, a huge drill bit chewed through multi-million-year-old sandstone, sending crushed bits of rock back to the surface through a mile-long hole.
The hunt for natural gas, to keep Alaska warm, had resumed.
Here, on crowded platforms perched above the icy waters of Cook Inlet, a small army labors to keep up the extraction of fossil fuels from Alaska’s oldest producing oil and gas basin. After a half-century of extraction, the gas is still there. But it’s gotten harder and costlier to produce — and fewer companies are participating in the search.
Just one large mobile drilling rig, the Spartan 151, still works offshore in Cook Inlet. This week, its five-dozen workers were hustling to finish two new wells for a small oil and gas firm, Furie. 
 

  The Spartan 151 is what’s known as a “jackup rig,” allowing operators to use its three legs to lift it above shorter oil and gas platforms. (Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)
 

	They’re well-paid and well-fed, with cooks dishing out ample servings of gumbo and fish tacos. On sunny days, they can gaze off the rig at the snow-blanketed volcanoes that ring the Inlet. 
But the pressure is on: Urban Alaska’s utilities, some of which have warned of the potential for rolling blackouts amid a gas supply crunch, are counting on Furie’s production. 
“I’m scared to death every day,” said Michael Duncan, Furie’s drilling manager. “It’s like, ‘We’ve got to get this.’”

	Furie’s drilling effort this year is as close to a glimmer of hope as you’ll find in Cook Inlet these days. But it also underscores the challenges that continue to plague operators there. 
Purchased out of bankruptcy five years ago by an Anchorage oil and gas veteran, John Hendrix, Furie is budgeting $38 million to drill its wells this spring — cash that will help keep the Kenai Peninsula’s shrinking oil and gas service industry at work.
But before sinking its drill bit into the seabed, Furie needed help from Alaska’s government. One agency granted it a steep reduction in the 12.5% share of its gas production that the company would otherwise be required to give to the state; another agency approved $50 million in loans.
And earlier this spring, Anchorage’s electric utility and a pipeline company jointly announced a project that could create new competition for Furie: a facility that could receive huge quantities of liquefied natural gas shipped into Alaska from afar. Ironically, the project would convert a Kenai Peninsula facility used during Cook Inlet’s boom days to export excess gas to Asia — repurposing it to handle imports from Canada or the Gulf of Mexico.
Urban Alaska’s electric utilities say that importing LNG appears to be the only way for them to ensure firm supplies of gas for years to come, given the risk, uncertainty and cost that comes with drilling in declining basins like Cook Inlet.
The appeal of a consistent supply of hydrocarbons from global commodities markets is undeniable for locally elected utility boards charged with producing electricity for members at the lowest price. But that argument doesn’t resonate with some of the hardworking hands on the Spartan, and at Furie’s gas handling facility on shore.

	Imported LNG “does no good for the state, and now we’re not energy independent any more,” said Furie Operations Superintendent Ben Christianson, 35, who grew up on the Kenai Peninsula and has watched its oil and gas industry shrink as he’s built his career in it. 
Producing gas locally, Christianson said, “is good for Alaskans.” Furie employs some 20 people, 90% of whom are residents, according to Hendrix, the owner; the company’s hard hats sport a label: “Home grown energy.”
A declining basin
Furie this week allowed me to visit its offshore platform and witness its spring drilling campaign — which showed how a storied Alaska industry is hanging on in Cook Inlet, while also illustrating the challenge of producing fossil fuels from the increasingly depleted basin.
Production in Cook Inlet began in the 1950s and peaked in the 1970s, when the industry extracted more than 200,000 barrels of oil a day — more than 1% of America’s consumption at the time. Some of the oil was produced from onshore fields, but companies also sunk more than a dozen offshore platforms in the Inlet, which had to be reinforced against huge tides and winter ice floes.
 

  The Monopod platform was built in Washington state during the 1960s for oil companies Marathon and Unocal. It then had to be floated down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean and nearly 2,000 miles to Alaska. Once in Cook Inlet, its pontoons were flooded and it was sunk into place.

	Today, six of those platforms are shuttered, and daily Cook Inlet oil production has fallen below 10,000 barrels, according to state data. Much of the industry’s investment flows instead to Alaska’s North Slope, where companies have discovered huge new fields and are spending billions to develop them.
 
This oil platform stopped pumping 30 years ago. Alaska still won’t make the owner tear it down.

	In Cook Inlet, work is now centered largely on extracting natural gas, which is sold to urban Alaska utilities for power generation and also used by residents and businesses for heating. Vacant, dilapidated buildings line the Kenai Spur Highway, where many of the remaining Cook Inlet oil field supply and service companies have offices and warehouses. The former gas export facility sits shuttered, as does a huge manufacturing plant that once produced fertilizer from natural gas.
“I believe Alaskans have given up on Cook Inlet,” said Hendrix, 67, the Furie owner, who grew up on the Kenai Peninsula and remembers it “just bustling” with oil and gas activity.

	All the contracting companies, Hendrix said, “went to the North Slope.”
Interest in Cook Inlet has waned, in part, because of the small size of urban Alaska’s market: Companies say that even if they found a huge new gas field, they wouldn’t have customers to buy up all of their production.
The oil industry’s decline in the Inlet has forced Hendrix into a partnership with a competing firm that now controls the vast majority of the basin’s production: Hilcorp, a privately owned business co-founded by Texas billionaire Jeff Hildebrand.
The helicopter that Furie used this week to get out to its single offshore Cook Inlet platform? Operated by a Hilcorp affiliate, which uses the aircraft to access Hilcorp’s 15 different platforms. The huge dock that, during the winter, hosts the rig Furie is using to drill its wells? Also a Hilcorp property.
The rig itself? It’s owned by Hilcorp, too; Furie is paying hefty sums to rent it, and it has to be returned soon so that Hilcorp can drill wells from its own offshore platforms in the Inlet later this year. 
“They’ve made everything available. They’re working with us,” Hendrix said of Hilcorp. “They want us to succeed.”

	If Furie’s spring drilling takes longer than expected, though, it could cost the company $2 million to keep the Spartan rig for the additional time, according to Hendrix. That’s in part because the tugboats required to move it are only available on certain days, as they’re also needed in Anchorage to help maneuver the cargo ships that bring in the city’s food supply.
In a prepared statement, Hilcorp said it’s pleased to see the Spartan rig “hard at work in Cook Inlet this summer, supporting efforts to ensure a stable and reliable gas supply” for urban Alaska. The company says it charges Furie the same price to use the rig as Hilcorp charges itself internally.
“We wish Furie great successes as they wrap up their current drilling operations, and we look forward to deploying the Spartan 151 to our own platforms later this summer,” said Hilcorp spokesman Matt Shuckerow.
Tight real estate
Getting to the Spartan drilling rig is a 12-minute helicopter ride, with all passengers required to don drysuits and lifejackets that could keep them alive in the event of a crash into the water.
Flying out with a Furie official Tuesday were two representatives of their biggest customer, the natural gas utility Enstar, including President John Sims. It was Sims’ first trip offshore, and seeing the huge stacks of pipe and other equipment in such a remote setting made an impression.
“When I walked out and just saw that stuff, it’s like ‘holy cow’ — an interruption in operations out there means they’re now trying to bring down equipment from the North Slope, which they have to put on a boat,” Sims said a day later. “You appreciate the cost that they have on a daily basis to try to make gas flow to our system.”

	Furie’s drilling operation involves two separate pieces of expensive infrastructure that are temporarily linked for the project, each with their own crew.
One is Furie’s gas production platform, the Julius R — a smaller, single-legged structure that’s permanently placed in the Inlet’s waters.



The other is Hilcorp’s hulking, four-legged, Spartan drilling rig, a mobile platform with its own cafeteria and living quarters. Earlier this spring, the Spartan was floated out from a dock and fixed above the Julius R — an intricate operation that involves tugboats pushing it into place.
The helicopter carrying the visitors this week landed gently on a pad extending out over the ocean from the Spartan. Some 60 people, working three-week shifts, staff the rig — dwarfing the handful of Furie employees that staff the Julius R.

	The Spartan was originally shipped to Cook Inlet from the Gulf Coast years ago, and it still employs many of the same workers. While some are Alaska residents, it’s rare to find one without a Texas or Louisiana accent.
“These are good people, taking care of each other,” said Duncan, Furie’s drilling manager. “We’re in the middle of the ocean.”
Drilling an oil well from an offshore rig involves representatives from multiple companies, choreographing the movement of enormous quantities of steel on a worksite where space is at a premium. The Spartan’s drill bit descends through its own deck, then passes through slots on the Julius R below before sinking into rock; Duncan says the experts guiding the drill bit could hit your car if you buried it a mile deep and half a mile out.

	One of the big challenges on Cook Inlet’s offshore platforms is finding space for new wells. It’s an extremely tight fit for all of the necessary exploration and production infrastructure — not to mention equipment upgrades that could help boost flow rates into the Julius R’s 15-mile pipeline to shore, if only there was room to install them.
“It’s like, ‘You can’t do that — where are you going to put it?’” said Christianson, Furie’s operations superintendent. “There are all these different challenges and struggles that we have with real estate.”
‘You gotta hope’
As of this week, the Spartan had finished drilling to the bottom of its two new wells — the most sensitive and expensive part of the operation. But there were still more steps left before the rig’s job was done, and on Tuesday, mud-spattered workers on the floor of the Spartan helped maneuver lengths of pipe and other equipment.
“We don’t measure in pounds. It’s, really, tons that we’re lifting here in the air,” Duncan said. “It’s a really critical operation — these guys pay very close attention to what’s happening.”



Finishing new wells is a weekslong process; Furie hopes to wrap up and move the Spartan off the Julius R before the end of the month.
But Hendrix, who said he’s invested at least $13 million of his own cash in this year’s drilling program, won’t know if his efforts will pay off until a couple of weeks later. That’s when Furie will blast holes into the sides of the well — a step known as perforation that should, finally, start the natural gas flowing.
“Until we perforate it, we don’t know,” Hendrix said. “You gotta hope.”
The customers who burn the gas from Hendrix’s company will end up paying significantly more than historical prices in Cook Inlet. Enstar, under a new contract recently approved by state regulators, is paying nearly $13 per thousand cubic feet of Furie’s gas.

	That’s some 50% higher than the roughly $8 it pays under its contract with Hilcorp — which was inked before the gas shortage arrived.
In past contract negotiations, Enstar pushed suppliers hard “to get the lowest cost with the most reliability for our customers,” said Sims, the company’s president. In retrospect, he added, Enstar may have pushed too hard, negotiating provisions that hurt producers — like Furie under its past, pre-bankruptcy ownership — when they ran into problems and couldn’t deliver promised gas.
“When you think about that risk and that massive expense of drilling — the market’s changing, and I think people are becoming more aware that this is dangerous for a company, and we can’t put all the risk just on the producer,” Sims said, pointing to the need for the state-sponsored loan to Furie.

	In the meantime, the work continues. On the Spartan, crews are staffing round-the-clock shifts to finish up Furie’s wells before moving on to Hilcorp projects. 
Hendrix, who once served as an oil and gas advisor to former Gov. Bill Walker, recalled his old boss’ description of the industry as Alaska’s “silent economy” — largely invisible to those who don’t work in it.
“If this was in downtown Anchorage and someone was spending $38 million, everyone would know about it,” he said. “But hopefully, everything will work out, and we’ll get our gas.”

The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party organized a one-mile silent march, starting at Morning Star Baptist Church and ending at the Mississippi Capitol, where lawmakers were contemplating changes in voting laws. 
Jackson police arrested the marchers, more than half of them students from Lanier High School. Over the next few weeks, more than 1,000 were arrested and held in livestock pens at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds. 
During the protest, 5-year-old Anthony Quin waved a U.S. flag outside the Governor’s Mansion. Matt Herron’s photograph of state trooper Huey Krohn trying to wrestle the flag from Quin’s hands ran in The New York Times and other newspapers across the U.S. Quin later said that his mother had told him to hold onto that flag for dear life — and he did. 
On June 30, a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the release of those arrested and barred the city of Jackson from making any further arrests. 
Despite Quin’s young age, this wasn’t his first brush with the civil rights movement. A month before this photo was taken, his family’s home was firebombed in McComb because of their work in the movement. He and his sisters went on to become the first students to integrate McComb public schools. 
From those days of fighting racism on a day-by-day basis, Quin learned to care for students. He became a principal of several different elementary schools before becoming an administrator over the schools.

(Photo courtesy of Visit Fargo-Moorhead)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”













Now they’ve seen measles in their community so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’


– Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas





In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
 Outbreak moves north

In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”

Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
 ‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas

According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 6, there are 1,168 confirmed cases affecting 33 states. Texas reported two more cases June 10, and Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 17 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Getty image)Each June, we pause to celebrate fathers. We share cards, fire up the grill, and scroll through social media posts honoring fathers near and far. But when the smoke clears and Monday rolls around, how often do we stop to ask: What do fathers really need to thrive — and are we, as a community, truly supporting them?
For too long, the story of fatherhood has been told in extremes — either lionized as stoic protectors or vilified in the absence. What’s missing is the middle: the everyday father who’s trying, stumbling, learning, and growing. The father who wants to break harmful and oftentimes generational patterns, to love better, to be present. The father who — like all of us — needs support, not judgment.
We often say it takes a village to raise a child. But let’s be honest — most of that village has been built around motherhood. Parent groups, baby showers, parenting blogs — these are cultural scaffolds that help mothers feel seen, heard, and supported. And they should. But where is that scaffolding for fathers?
Nationwide, fewer than 1 in 5 community-based parenting programs are designed specifically with fathers in mind. The gap is even wider when it comes to programs that address fatherhood in the context of trauma, domestic conflict, or behavioral health/conflict resolution. And yet, engaged fathers are linked to better outcomes in nearly every measure of child development — from higher school achievement to lower rates of incarceration, mental illness, and substance use.
Too many fathers — especially those who have made mistakes — are navigating parenthood without a map or a hand to hold. They face shame, isolation, and often don’t have a safe space to reflect, grow, or reconnect with their children.










Parent groups, baby showers, parenting blogs — these are cultural scaffolds that help mothers feel seen, heard, and supported. And they should. But where is that scaffolding for fathers?


One example of what’s possible when we invest in fathers is the Family Service of Rhode Island program, Caring Dads. The 17-week program doesn’t just teach parenting skills — it fosters self-awareness, empathy, and accountability. Participants learn how their actions have impacted their families and are equipped with practical strategies to build healthy, child-centered relationships. This isn’t about excusing harm — it’s about transforming it. Each cohort is supported with group sessions, individual check-ins, and connection to foster community services. Mothers are also engaged in parallel, ensuring transparency and safety. In many cases, fathers in the program are able to reestablish trust, increase positive communication and create more stable environments for their children.
We know from decades of research that children do better when both parents are positively engaged. Yet our systems often write off fathers too quickly — especially Black and Brown fathers, who are twice as likely to be in the child welfare system and face greater barriers to reunification. If we are serious about equity, we must dismantle the narrative that fatherhood is expendable. We must challenge ourselves to ask: How are we making space for dads to show up — messy, honest, and human?
Supporting fathers isn’t just a feel-good gesture for Father’s Day. It’s a year-round commitment to community well-being. When we support fathers, we interrupt cycles of trauma, and longstanding stereotypes that impact fathers ability to be present and engage,  strengthen families, and create safer, more nurturing environments for children to grow.
This Father’s Day, let’s expand our idea of celebration. Let’s reach out — not just with praise, but with partnership. Let’s build father-friendly spaces. Let’s ask dads what they need, and listen with compassion.
Because when fathers thrive, families heal. And when we embrace dads as a vital part of the village, everyone wins.

In the suit, Attorney General Dana Nessel alleges Tribar Technologies Inc. and Adept Plastic Finishing Inc. had violated the Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act on multiple occasions, including Tribar’s 2022 discharge of toxic hexavalent chromium into the Huron River through Wixom’s Wastewater Treatment Plant.
The suit further alleges the companies failed to comply with permitting requirements, and repeatedly violated water and air pollution standards.

While the two companies have since closed their Wixom facilities, Nessel’s suit argues stormwater laden with PFOS, another contaminant, continues to discharge from the two sites.
“Michigan’s environmental laws exist to protect the air we breathe and the water we use from toxic chemicals,” Nessel said in a statement. “When companies cut corners or violate these protections, my office will use every tool available to hold them accountable and ensure proper cleanup and compliance.”
Alongside civil penalties, Nessel aims to require the companies to clean up the contamination. She is also seeking penalties under the Michigan Business Corporation Act, arguing Tribar lacks the necessary certificate of authority to operate in Michigan.

Pregnant patients and their infants are vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. In the letter to payers and insurance companies released this week, ACOG stressed the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations and how they protect babies and pregnant people. It was signed by prominent professional groups including the American College of Physicians, Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Public Health Association.
The letter follows U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy children and healthy pregnant patients, sidestepping an established decision process by scientists. Kennedy, who has made false claims questioning vaccine safety, earlier this week fired all 17 experts on the federal vaccine advisory committee panel, replacing them with eight new members, four of whom have spoken out against vaccines.
The Trump administration’s moves have alarmed health experts, who worry about coverage and access to the shot amid the agency’s dismissal of science.
“We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” the letter reads. “Given the historic gaps in research, investment, and support for women’s health, it is essential that all aspects of obstetric and gynecologic care — including COVID-19 vaccination — be grounded in the best available scientific evidence.
Studies have shown babies born following a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have a higher risk of low birth weights, stillbirth and respiratory distress, and data demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
Pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are also at higher risk of complications such as blood clots, are more likely to be hospitalized in intensive care units or to need ventilators, and are at a higher risk of death, the letter notes.
Payers should make the vaccine available to “pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” the letter reads. Without insurance, a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 shot can cost roughly $140 for adults.
Following the recommendation rollback, public health officials in some states have emphasized their support of COVID-19 vaccines.
The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, for example, said it “continues to recommend the current COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older,” noting that newborns “depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection.” Wisconsin Medicaid will also continue to cover the shot, the department said in a media release.
Officials in Georgia also said they expect continued coverage of the shot.
In Washington, a spokesperson for the state health agency told local media that the department is advising pregnant people to speak with their provider “to determine if receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is best for them.”
During this year’s legislative sessions, at least seven states introduced legislation aiming to ban or limit mRNA vaccines. Instead of using a weakened or dead version of the actual virus to stimulate an immune response, mRNA vaccines use a genetic code created in a laboratory to tell the body’s cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology.
“The COVID vaccines were a remarkable scientific accomplishment, and they remain the best tool that we have to prevent severe outcomes associated with COVID infection,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, ACOG president, wrote in a statement. “Ob-gyns know that COVID infection during pregnancy can be incredibly dangerous for our pregnant patients — and we know that the vaccine can protect both them and their infants after birth.”
When patients are “forced to pay out of pocket, or to cover high cost sharing,” he wrote, “they are less likely to be able to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)On a summer night in 2023, an explosion at one of Louisiana’s biggest petrochemical complexes sent a plume of fire into the sky. More explosions followed as poison gas spewed from damaged tanks at the Dow chemical plant, triggering a shelter-in-place order for anyone within a half mile of the facility, which sprawls across more than 830 acres near Baton Rouge.
For more than a year, a little-known government agency has been investigating the incident. But the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board will likely shut down before completing its probes of the Dow explosion and other such incidents across the country. President Donald Trump’s administration has quietly proposed shutting down the board, an independent federal agency charged with uncovering the causes of large-scale chemical accidents.
Near the end of a 1,224-page budget document released with little fanfare on May 30, White House officials said shutting down the agency, commonly called the CSB, will help “move the nation toward fiscal responsibility” as the Trump administration works to “redefine the proper role of the federal government.” The CSB’s $14 million annual budget would be zeroed out for the 2026 fiscal year and its emergency fund of $844,000 would be earmarked for closure-related costs. The process of shutting the agency down is set to begin this year, according to CSB documents.
Eliminating the CSB will come at a cost to the safety of plant workers and neighboring communities, especially along the Gulf Coast, where the bulk of the U.S. petrochemical industry is concentrated, said former CSB officials and environmental groups.
“Closing the CSB will mean more accidents at chemical plants, more explosions and more deaths,” said Beth Rosenberg, a public health expert who served on the CSB board from 2013 to 2014.
“This shows that the Trump administration does not care about frontline communities already burdened with this industry,” said Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project, an environmental justice group in Lake Charles. “We’re the ones who have to shelter in place or evacuate whenever there’s an explosion or (chemical) release, and now there will be less oversight when these things happen.”
The CSB did not respond to a request for comment.
The proposed closure of the CSB follows several other moves by the Trump administration to slash staffing levels at the Environmental Protection Agency and ease federal health and safety regulations.
Founded in 1998, the CSB investigates the causes of petrochemical accidents and issues recommendations to plants, regulators and business groups. The CSB doesn’t impose fines or penalties, instead relying on voluntary compliance or on enforcement by other agencies, such as the EPA, to mandate safety improvements.
Of the more than 100 investigations the CSB has conducted, Texas leads the country with 22 cases, followed by Louisiana with eight.
“Those numbers tell us that Louisiana and Texas really need the Chemical Safety Board, and there will certainly be negative impacts here if it closes down,” said Wilma Subra, an environmental scientist with the Louisiana Environmental Action Network.
Along with the Dow chemical explosion, the agency has four other active investigations of incidents in Texas, Kentucky, Georgia and Virginia. CSB investigations often take several months to complete.



In an update of the Dow explosion investigation last year, the CSB hinted at “several events of concern” at the chemical complex between Baton Rouge and the town of Plaquemine – an area that forms part of the industrial corridor known as “Cancer Alley.” Among the targets of the investigation were at least two mechanical problems, multiple smaller explosions after the initial blow-up, and the release of more than 30,000 pounds of ethylene oxide, a colorless gas the agency noted is a cancer-causing substance.
The CSB’s last completed investigation was focused on a fatal 2024 explosion at a liquid nitriding facility in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The CSB identified several safety failures and at least three other dangerous incidents involving similar hazards at other facilities owned by the same company, HEF Groupe of France.
HEF “failed to ensure that information about those incidents and lessons learned from them were shared and implemented organization-wide,” the CSB investigation, released early this month, found.
A chain reaction of mishaps at the Chattanooga facility resulted in an eruption of “hot molten salt” that killed a worker, according to the investigation.
On average, hazardous chemical accidents happen once every other day in the U.S., according to Coming Clean, an environmental health nonprofit. Coming Clean documented 825 fires, leaks and other chemical-related incidents between January 2021 and October 2023. The incidents killed at least 43 people and triggered evacuation orders and advisories in nearly 200 communities.
Trump called for the CSB’s closure during his first term but settled for leaving many investigator and agency leadership positions unfilled. Slowing the agency’s work resulted in a backlog of 14 unfinished investigations by the time Joe Biden took office in 2021.
Under the first Trump administration, investigations were hampered by staffing shortages and months-long conflicts between the board and the agency’s Trump-appointed director, according to a federal inspector’s report.
In the new budget proposal, the Trump administration indicated the CSB’s duties could be handled by other agencies.
“The CSB duplicates substantial capabilities in the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to investigate chemical-related mishaps,” a CSB budget proposal said. “This function should reside within agencies that have authorities to issue regulations…”
This justification is “a lie,” said Jordan Barab, a former deputy assistant secretary of OSHA and a former CSB recommendations manager.
While OSHA and the EPA are limited to assessing specific violations of their existing standards and regulations, the CSB can look far more broadly and at the “deeper causes” of accidents, including worker fatigue, corporate budget cuts and lax oversight, Barab said.
Even when other federal agencies appeared to ignore CSB recommendations, community groups and local governments could cite them when pushing for improved safety standards, Ozane said.
“It was scientific evidence we could all use to pressure the state or the federal regulators to do something about pollution and safety in the places we live,” she said. “This is just another tool and another resource that’s been taken away from us.”

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13 before Abrego Garcia’s arraignment on federal charges. (Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation to an El Salvador prison sparked national debate over Trump administration immigration crackdowns, entered not guilty pleas on Friday to two federal human smuggling charges.
Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and seated next to attorneys with the federal public defender’s office, Abrego Garcia spoke only once, through a translator. “I understand,” he said in response to the judge’s reading of the charges.
The charges against Abrego Garcia, 29, are “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.”
Friday’s hearing, in a downtown Nashville federal courtroom, turned primarily on the question of whether Abrego Garcia may be denied the opportunity to be released from jail pending trial.
Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes said she would take the matter under advisement. She said she will issue a written ruling on the prosecution’s motion to keep Abrego Garcia detained “sooner rather than later.”
The criminal charges stem from a federal investigation opened into a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. Abrego Garcia was not arrested or charged in the incident.
‘ICE out of Baltimore!’: Recent immigration raids prompt Baltimore protest

But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop gave rise to the charges he now faces, testimony in court Friday revealed.
The investigation relied on cooperating witnesses, analysis of license plate readers to track Abrego Garcia’s movements and a review of the Tennessee traffic stop evidence.
Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire alleged that Abrego Garcia was a danger to the community and a member of the MS-13 gang who, for nine years, engaged in an illegal smuggling operation that included transporting children, gang members and guns. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with gun crimes or crimes involving child victims.
Attorneys for Abrego Garcia said the government’s case should be looked at through a “lens of suspicion and skepticism” and questioned why it took three years to bring.
“The United States government from D.C. to Tennessee has exaggerated” allegations against Abrego Garcia, said Dumaka Shabazz, one of Abrego Garcia’s public defenders.
“This is a house of cards built on the unverified credibility of unreliable corroborators,” he said. “The only reason they’re calling him dangerous now is to justify denying him due process and subjecting him to cruel and inhuman punishment they have to cover up,” said Shabazz, referencing Abrego Garcia’s imprisonment for nearly three months in a notorious Salvadoran prison.
McGuire countered that the charges against Abrego Garcia arose from following the facts. “Since I’ve learned about this case, all I’ve tried to do is the right thing,” he said. “The facts are I didn’t … whip up witnesses and tell them to commit perjury.”
“I understand there are strong feelings about this case on both sides,” he said.
The day-long hearing focused on the government’s arguments to detain Abrego Garcia until trial.
Evidence that minors were present, and potentially placed at risk during Abrego Garcia’s alleged illegal acts could trigger legal justification for detaining Abrego Garcia and prosecutors presented allegations involving the safety of minors. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with crimes related to minor victims.
But prosecutors said a Department of Homeland Security investigation into the circumstances behind the 2022 traffic stop uncovered evidence that Abrego Garcia transported minor children, including his own, in part to provide cover for his allegedly illegal activities.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Abrego Garcia, McGuire alleged, acted as the driver in a human smuggling operation that involved transporting migrants already in the country illegally to different points around the nation over a nine-year period.
McGuire cited a witness who said that Abrego Garcia engaged in sexual, but not physical, exchanges with her several years ago when she was a teen and referenced a list of passengers the Tennessee Highway Patrol obtained during the 2022 traffic stop. One of the passengers listed his age as 15.
“Migrant transportation is inherently dangerous,” McGuire said. “The defendant transported his own children in an unsafe manner.”
McGuire argued that Abrego Garcia is a flight risk, and that his newfound notoriety could give him access to resources provided by those opposed to Trump administration immigration policies.
Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes, who presided over the case, called the flight risk argument largely “academic.”
Immigration officials have already placed a hold on Abrego Garcia, giving them the authority to take immediate custody should he be released from jail, she noted.
‘A stain on the Constitution’: Abrego Garcia lawyers refuse to drop his case against U.S.

The sole witness at Friday’s hearing was Peter Joseph, a Department of Homeland Security special agent who said he was first assigned to investigate Abrego Garcia on April 28, three years after the Tennessee traffic stop.
By then, Abrego Garcia was incarcerated inside the Center for Terrorism Confinement prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court had, on April 10, ordered the federal government to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States.
Joseph testified that he had reviewed License Plate Reader software in multiple states that contradicted Abrego Garcia’s statements about his movements to troopers at the time of the Tennessee traffic stop.
He also testified that five confidential witnesses, including co-conspirators in the alleged years-long human smuggling operation, had implicated Abrego Garcia in the scheme.
Richard Tennant, another of Abrego Garcia’s defense attorneys, noted that some of the cooperating witnesses have their own liberty at stake.
Three of the witnesses entered cooperation deals that could aid their ongoing criminal and immigration cases. Four of the five witnesses are from the same family, testimony revealed.

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)As a veteran parent leader and advocate for six years in Prince George’s County, I’ve seen my share of politically motivated nonsense. The mistreatment of Superintendent Millard House II over the past several weeks is easily the most shameful.
Put simply, the Prince George’s County Educators’ Association (PGCEA) and Board of Education got this wrong and should be ashamed of the role they played in his departure. They unfairly attacked a good man who was the right leader for PGCPS and making real progress.
Superintendent House earned my complete confidence over the past two years, which is why I remain willing to unequivocally publicly defend his record today. And I equally defend the dedicated department heads and PGCPS professionals who deserve full credit for their successes.
By every metric, PGCPS should have been negotiating a contract extension. Under Superintendent House, graduation rates rose above 80%, including a 15-point increase for English learners. Major transportation reforms led to significant improvements, with on-time performance now above 80% and a new tracking app and electric buses on the way. School safety investments resulted in a 46% drop in student incidents. And PGCPS had a highly successful Annapolis advocacy effort this year that helped save Community Schools funding and about two-thirds of funding originally at risk of being cut.

Let’s be clear what happened. Some county politicians, board members and special interests would rather play political games and undermine our students’ future than allow major PGCPS successes and any credit for the superintendent. They staged a leadership coup behind closed doors, with no opportunity for public input, while putting a $2.9 billion school system at risk of turning into a patronage system for political appointments.
Past is prologue, as we already saw similar shenanigans at the Board of Education level several years ago as board staff positions were used to hire political allies at taxpayer expense, with many hires ending in controversy.
That is the historical context for this moment, and yet even knowing the professional risk of refusing to play along with unseemly and inappropriate demands, Superintendent House displayed true character, serving as the bulwark who bravely said, “No,” and attempted to keep PGCPS from chaos.
I’ve been through six years of PGCPS battles and seen these games too many times before. Past board members attempted to play politics and micromanage former CEO Dr. Monica Goldson on COVID-19 policy and other issues. She also pushed back, and even on the rare issues where we didn’t agree, we shared mutual respect, and I could always trust her to do the right thing and act in PGCPS’ best interest.
Now, it’s the same playbook, next chapter for Superintendent House. The same politicians who worked to undermine PGCPS accomplishments the past few months had the audacity to blame the superintendent for their own sabotage. And some of the same characters central to this coup did the same thing early in his tenure, nearly derailing more than $800 million in new school construction. Parent leaders called out their games then, and won’t be silent now.
Despite daily PGCPS successes, one constant continues to threaten our school system: Too much political interference in what should be administrative operations. To truly succeed, we must allow administrative leadership to be immune from politics. Hire a qualified education expert as superintendent, give them a four-year term, then stay out of the way.
That doesn’t exclude important oversight on policies, budget and key appointments. But short of serious malfeasance, any superintendent must have the security to do the job we hired them to do. What sane, qualified superintendent would want to work in Prince George’s County after the disgraceful behavior of the past few months?
Finally, we have created chaos at a moment PGCPS can least afford it. With a likely legislative special session in October and challenging state budget situation, good luck trying to win much-needed resources as Prince George’s County proves incapable of governing ourselves responsibly.
If PGCEA leadership had taken a fraction of the energy they spent attacking the Superintendent and used it to truly fight for protecting Blueprint funding, perhaps PGCPS could more easily meet their contract demands.
Instead, now some other school district will gain a highly qualified and successful Superintendent while PGCPS searches for our fourth leader since 2018. That is no way to run a world-class school district, and like always, it will be the students of PGCPS who pay the price. And once again, the same old Prince George’s politics to blame.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pgcps-1-1024x768-1.jpg,,,2025-06-14 05:00:37.615098

(Prostock-Studio/Getty Images)Like it or not, artificial intelligence has become part of daily life. Many devices — including electric razors and toothbrushes — have become “AI-powered,” using machine learning algorithms to track how a person uses the device, how the device is working in real time, and provide feedback. From asking questions to an AI assistant like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot to monitoring a daily fitness routine with a smartwatch, many people use an AI system or tool every day.
While AI tools and technologies can make life easier, they also raise important questions about data privacy. These systems often collect large amounts of data, sometimes without people even realizing their data is being collected. The information can then be used to identify personal habits and preferences, and even predict future behaviors by drawing inferences from the aggregated data.
As an assistant professor of cybersecurity at West Virginia University, I study how emerging technologies and various types of AI systems manage personal data and how we can build more secure, privacy-preserving systems for the future.
Generative AI software uses large amounts of training data to create new content such as text or images. Predictive AI uses data to forecast outcomes based on past behavior, such as how likely you are to hit your daily step goal, or what movies you may want to watch. Both types can be used to gather information about you.
How AI tools collect data
Generative AI assistants such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini collect all the information users type into a chat box. Every question, response and prompt that users enter is recorded, stored and analyzed to improve the AI model.
OpenAI’s privacy policy informs users that “we may use content you provide us to improve our Services, for example to train the models that power ChatGPT.” Even though OpenAI allows you to opt out of content use for model training, it still collects and retains your personal data. Although some companies promise that they anonymize this data, meaning they store it without naming the person who provided it, there is always a risk of data being reidentified.
Predictive AI
Beyond generative AI assistants, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok continuously gather data on their users to train predictive AI models. Every post, photo, video, like, share and comment, including the amount of time people spend looking at each of these, is collected as data points that are used to build digital data profiles for each person who uses the service.
The profiles can be used to refine the social media platform’s AI recommender systems. They can also be sold to data brokers, who sell a person’s data to other companies to, for instance, help develop targeted advertisements that align with that person’s interests.
Many social media companies also track users across websites and applications by putting cookies and embedded tracking pixels on their computers. Cookies are small files that store information about who you are and what you clicked on while browsing a website.
One of the most common uses of cookies is in digital shopping carts: When you place an item in your cart, leave the website and return later, the item will still be in your cart because the cookie stored that information. Tracking pixels are invisible images or snippets of code embedded in websites that notify companies of your activity when you visit their page. This helps them track your behavior across the internet.
This is why users often see or hear advertisements that are related to their browsing and shopping habits on many of the unrelated websites they browse, and even when they are using different devices, including computers, phones and smart speakers. One study found that some websites can store over 300 tracking cookies on your computer or mobile phone.
Data privacy controls — and limitations
Like generative AI platforms, social media platforms offer privacy settings and opt-outs, but these give people limited control over how their personal data is aggregated and monetized. As media theorist Douglas Rushkoff argued in 2011, if the service is free, you are the product.
Many tools that include AI don’t require a person to take any direct action for the tool to collect data about that person. Smart devices such as home speakers, fitness trackers and watches continually gather information through biometric sensors, voice recognition and location tracking. Smart home speakers continually listen for the command to activate or “wake up” the device. As the device is listening for this word, it picks up all the conversations happening around it, even though it does not seem to be active.
Some companies claim that voice data is only stored when the wake word — what you say to wake up the device — is detected. However, people have raised concerns about accidental recordings, especially because these devices are often connected to cloud services, which allow voice data to be stored, synced and shared across multiple devices such as your phone, smart speaker and tablet.
If the company allows, it’s also possible for this data to be accessed by third parties, such as advertisers, data analytics firms or a law enforcement agency with a warrant.
Privacy rollbacks
This potential for third-party access also applies to smartwatches and fitness trackers, which monitor health metrics and user activity patterns. Companies that produce wearable fitness devices are not considered “covered entities” and so are not bound by the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act. This means that they are legally allowed to sell health- and location-related data collected from their users.
Concerns about HIPAA data arose in 2018, when Strava, a fitness company released a global heat map of user’s exercise routes. In doing so, it accidentally revealed sensitive military locations across the globe through highlighting the exercise routes of military personnel.
The Trump administration has tapped Palantir, a company that specializes in using AI for data analytics, to collate and analyze data about Americans. Meanwhile, Palantir has announced a partnership with a company that runs self-checkout systems.
Such partnerships can expand corporate and government reach into everyday consumer behavior. This one could be used to create detailed personal profiles on Americans by linking their consumer habits with other personal data. This raises concerns about increased surveillance and loss of anonymity. It could allow citizens to be tracked and analyzed across multiple aspects of their lives without their knowledge or consent.
Some smart device companies are also rolling back privacy protections instead of strengthening them. Amazon recently announced that starting on March 28, 2025, all voice recordings from Amazon Echo  devices would be sent to Amazon’s cloud by default, and users will no longer have the option to turn this function off. This is different from previous settings, which allowed users to limit private data collection.
Changes like these raise concerns about how much control consumers have over their own data when using smart devices. Many privacy experts consider cloud storage of voice recordings a form of data collection, especially when used to improve algorithms or build user profiles, which has implications for data privacy laws designed to protect online privacy.
Implications for data privacy
All of this brings up serious privacy concerns for people and governments on how AI tools collect, store, use and transmit data. The biggest concern is transparency. People don’t know what data is being collected, how the data is being used, and who has access to that data.
Companies tend to use complicated privacy policies filled with technical jargon to make it difficult for people to understand the terms of a service that they agree to. People also tend not to read terms of service documents. One study found that people averaged 73 seconds reading a terms of service document that had an average read time of 29-32 minutes.
Data collected by AI tools may initially reside with a company that you trust, but can easily be sold and given to a company that you don’t trust.
AI tools, the companies in charge of them and the companies that have access to the data they collect can also be subject to cyberattacks and data breaches that can reveal sensitive personal information. These attacks can by carried out by cybercriminals who are in it for the money, or by so-called advanced persistent threats, which are typically nation/state- sponsored attackers who gain access to networks and systems and remain there undetected, collecting information and personal data to eventually cause disruption or harm.
While laws and regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act aim to safeguard user data, AI development and use have often outpaced the legislative process. The laws are still catching up on AI and data privacy. For now, you should assume any AI-powered device or platform is collecting data on your inputs, behaviors and patterns.
Using AI tools
Although AI tools collect people’s data, and the way this accumulation of data affects people’s data privacy is concerning, the tools can also be useful. AI-powered applications can streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks and provide valuable insights.
But it’s crucial to approach these tools with awareness and caution.
When using a generative AI platform that gives you answers to questions you type in a prompt, don’t include any personally identifiable information, including names, birth dates, Social Security numbers or home addresses. At the workplace, don’t include trade secrets or classified information. In general, don’t put anything into a prompt that you wouldn’t feel comfortable revealing to the public or seeing on a billboard. Remember, once you hit enter on the prompt, you’ve lost control of that information.
Remember that devices which are turned on are always listening — even if they’re asleep. If you use smart home or embedded devices, turn them off when you need to have a private conversation. A device that’s asleep looks inactive, but it is still powered on and listening for a wake word or signal. Unplugging a device or removing its batteries is a good way of making sure the device is truly off.
Finally, be aware of the terms of service and data collection policies of the devices and platforms that you are using. You might be surprised by what you’ve already agreed to.

Steny Hoyer thanks friends and fellow Democrats Friday at his 44th annual bull roast at Newton White Mansion in Prince George's County. A cake was brought out to celebrate his 86th birthday, which is June 14. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)For almost an hour, the speakers at Rep. Steny Hoyer’s (D-5th) 44th annual bull roast took turns heaping praise on the long-serving Democrat and heaping scorn on President Donald Trump (R).
When it finally came time for him to speak, Hoyer mostly followed that script. And then he danced.
Despite humid temperatures and threatening skies, and the prospect of a military parade Saturday on what happens to be Trump’s 79th birthday, the overall mood was light among the hundreds who turned out to honor the dean of Maryland’s congressional delegation — who turns 86 Saturday on the birthday he shares with Trump.
“We’re gathered here today before Donald Trump is spending millions and millions of dollars of taxpayer money to have a parade to feed his ego on Donald Trump’s birthday,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md).
“I can tell you, I’m not going to be anywhere near President Trump tomorrow, but I am very proud to be here to celebrate the birthday of a great American who didn’t choose to have his birthday the same day as Donald Trump,” Van Hollen said.
Bashing Trump and praising Hoyer served as part of the main theme Friday at the bull roast at Newton White Mansion in Prince George’s County. Lawmakers including Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th) and Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), all of whom took a turn at the microphone.
Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) chastised the Trump administration one day after U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) was forcibly removed by federal law enforcement officials at a press conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The secretary held it amid multiday protests in Los Angeles against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.
“The garbage that is being thrown at us [by the administration] where a group of goons threw a United States senator to the ground. It is unprecedented,” Elfreth said.

“What gives me calm on that House floor is, I can turn to Steny and sit down and say, ‘This is just bulls— and what are we going to do about it?’” said Elfreth, who served long ago as an intern in Hoyer’s office. “And without a doubt, he has an answer.”
One thing Hoyer didn’t have the answer for Friday is whether he plans to seek a 24th term in Congress — a question that always seems to be lingering in the background of recent bull roasts.
“It’ll be time for that,” Hoyer said in a brief interview after the bull roast celebration.
Hoyer has been prominent in Maryland politics since before his tenure in Congress, winning a seat in the state Senate at age 27 and becoming its youngest president nine years lalter. He was elected to the House in 1981 to represent the district that currently includes portions of Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties and all three Southern Maryland counties.
During that time he has risen to serve as No. 2 Democrat in the House. He has been credited with helping former President Joe Biden (D) get the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed and is seen as the quarterback behind an on-again, off-again push to relocate the aging FBI headquarters from Washington, D.C., to a site in Greenbelt in Prince George’s County.
After getting General Services Administration clearance for the Greenbelt site, the FBI effort has recently shifted to defense, after the Trump administration said it wants to relocate the FBI to Alabama. Hoyer has emerged as a leader of that fight
Gov. Wes Moore (D) highlighted how Hoyer was instrumental in getting the Americans with Disabilities Act passed in 1990.
“The reason that I love Steny Hoyer is time and time again when it was hard, Steny stood up,” Moore said to an applause from some attendees.
‘Rest of his life’
Even with all the accolades, Hoyer has at least one Democratic challenger for the 2026 primary election.
Harry Jarin, 35, an emergency services consultant and volunteer firefighter who resides in Edgewater in Anne Arundel County, officially launched his candidacy for the seat May 29.
“We don’t need more career politicians who can’t really connect with voters and don’t really understand what people go through on a daily basis just to live in this country,” Jarin said in an interview Friday afternoon.

	“If we put someone like Steny Hoyer back up for office for a 24th term, we’re sending a message to the rest of the country that we’re all about the status quo and that Democrats aren’t offering anything different,” he said. “Voters made it very clear back in November that they want something different.”
Jarin didn’t shy away from the age differential between him and Hoyer, noting the death last month of Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who was 75. Connolly was the third House Democrat to die in office this year.
“I don’t think we should be reelecting people where we need to consult an actuary to determine whether or not they’re going to survive another two-year term,” Jarin said.
But for attendees at Friday’s bull roast, there was no question about whether Hoyer deserves to remain in office.
Prince George’s County resident Henrietta Holiday recalled when she met Hoyer in 2002 at Joint Base Andrews. Holiday is an Air Force veteran.
“His relationships are genuine. When you’re dealing with Steny Hoyer, you never feel like you’re dealing with a politician,” Holiday said. “I can see him running for another term. I would love to see him do what he loves for the rest of his life.”
Most of the three-hour event was spent socializing between elected officials and friends, bottled water in hand on a humid day, and even some chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches for the fortunate ones.
Minutes before the bull roast ended, Hoyer was presented a birthday cake. Then he decided to do a little dance.
“Ladies and gentlemen: Tomorrow, I want you to do something for me. When that parade comes on, you say, ‘That parade for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army — and Steny Hoyer,’” he said. “God bless you.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Steny-Hoyer-6-13-2025-1024x602.jpg,,,2025-06-14 03:58:45.643677

The demonstration in downtown Omaha was sparked by organizers including Juan Elizondo, in the wake of Tuesday’s high-profile worksite enforcement raid on a food plant in Omaha that led to the detention of nearly 80 workers.
“We hope to gain attention to our despair,” Elizondo, 32, said of the protest on opening day of the nationally televised NCAA men’s baseball tournament. “All of us know somebody affected. They are people of the community. We are the product of our community, and we feel it’s our duty to step up and have our voices heard.”
 ‘No Kings’

On the heels of Friday’s protest is another planned midday Saturday across the Missouri River, at Tom Hanafan River’s Edge Park in Council Bluffs. That rally, separately organized, brings together Omaha and Bluffs residents to join the national “No Kings” protests calling out what organizers describe as authoritarian overreach by the Trump administration.
Organizers behind the “No Kings” protests have branded Saturday as a “day of defiance.” According to their website, 13 protests are planned throughout Nebraska, including in Lincoln.
“Our nation is our combined effort,” said Kevin Gibbs, chair of Indivisible Nebraska. “No one person owns it. … We Nebraskans and Iowans take this opportunity to stand in this moment together and defend America’s shared vision against those who would cut it down to serve themselves.”
Gov. Jim Pillen, a public supporter of the president’s actions, on Friday issued an emergency proclamation that activated the Nebraska National Guard and prepared state law enforcement resources for immediate deployment, if needed.
Friday’s immigration enforcement-related demonstration in downtown Omaha — which played out largely on the corridor between the CHI Health Center and Charles Schwab Field, where CWS teams play — appeared peaceful. Elizondo estimated that more than 1,000 people participated.

Earlier in the day, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which led the Tuesday raid, announced that it had arrested four protesters on Thursday for “aggressive” actions during and immediately after the raid at Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha.
ICE officials said the agency targeted Glenn Valley because of suspected use of stolen or fraudulent identification by workers to gain employment — and described “victims” of the situation as those whose personal information was fraudulently used or stolen.
Demonstrators at the Friday anti-ICE march had a different message. They held placards with messages such as “Decriminalize Immigration,” “ICE is bitter cold,” “Keep Families Together,” “Hands off our community” and “Irony: a 34-count felon calling immigrants criminals.” 
 ‘To be heard and seen’ 

Among those protesting were Stephanie Campos, Gustavo Campos and Antonio Mendoza of the Omaha area. They said they were surprised but glad to see the large number of supporters who gathered first at a riverfront volleyball court and walked several blocks to the CWS area, which was bustling with activity.

“It’s good to see all the different ethnicities come together,” said Mendoza, 25. “Whatever background we come from, we know right from wrong.”
Gustavo Campos, 21, hoped protests nationally against immigration tactics will make a difference. But he said that in any case, he wanted to show support “for families, my community.” 
Said Mendoza, 25: “Just to be heard and seen is huge — showing up.” 
The Trump administration seemed to acknowledge some of the public pushback nationally and perhaps industry-level pushback from farmers, meatpackers and food processors with new guidance this week largely pausing immigration raids and arrests in the agriculture and hospitality industries, according to a Friday report in the New York Times.
 Los Angeles and elsewhere

The heartland protests coincide with larger, mostly peaceful but tenser demonstrations in Los Angeles as a result of recent ICE raids there.
The Trump administration and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have been butting heads as the president deployed 4,000 California National Guard and 700 Marines to the second-largest U.S. city in response to the protests — but without permission from the state’s Democratic governor. 
  Protesters marched from riverfront toward Charles Schwab Field, where the College World Series is played. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
Newsom responded by accusing Trump of choosing “theatrics over public safety” and escalating the “chaos.” The California governor sued the Trump administration over the federalization and deployment of the National Guard.
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and 18 other Republican attorneys general joined a legal brief in support of Trump’s deployment of the National Guard, arguing that Trump has the “authority” to do so. 
“We stand with law enforcement, we support President Trump’s action, and we will not let chaos take hold in our states,” Hilgers said in a joint statement. 
The events in Los Angeles have sparked similar protests in Texas, New York, Illinois and other parts of the country. More protests are planned this weekend as Trump plans a military parade to celebrate the Army’s anniversary in Washington D.C. this Saturday.  
 Violence not tolerated

Omaha Mayor John Ewing, a Democrat who took office earlier this week after unseating three-term Republican Mayor Jean Stothert, said the city is thankful for “how peacefully” protesters in Omaha so far have handled the ICE raid.
He said acts of violence or vandalism will not be tolerated and “frankly hurt any message protesters want to give.”
“Omaha Police have plans in place to let peaceful protests occur without obstruction to the game,” he said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)OWENSBORO — Kentucky Democrats brought a national leader to their statewide dinner Friday evening — but the party wants to focus on “everyday issues.”
At a sold-out event in the Ohio River town of Owensboro, the Democrats’ keynote speaker was Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin. 
But first Gov. Andy Beshear spoke, laying  out a case against Republican President Donald Trump and his “big beautiful bill.”
“The best way to push back against Trump is to show that when Democrats win, we stay focused on the issues that matter most to our people,” the governor told the crowd. “And then do something the Republican Party has shown it can’t — we govern well.”
Democrats from across the commonwealth were receptive to the message, cheering the governor on and giving him standing ovations. 
The party’s Forward Together Dinner, which sold 475 tickets, preceded the Kentucky Democratic Party state convention when party faithful decide who will lead the executive committees for the next year. Friday’s dinner was the largest Kentucky Democratic Party dinner since 2012. 
The enthusiasm follows setbacks for Democrats in recent years; the party has lost ground in the state legislature and statewide offices. A couple weeks ahead of the convention, Sen. Robin Webb, a longtime Democrat from Eastern Kentucky, joined the Republican Party. She said the party’s dismissiveness of rural issues led her to make that decision.

Much of the Democratic speakers’ comments throughout the night focused on the party’s need to re-focus on small town America. 
Beshear told reporters ahead of his remarks that political parties need to compete everywhere. Kentucky has no elections in 2025, but a slew of races next year — including U.S. Senate, congressional seats and legislative seats. 
“I want to see as many candidates as possible, but I’m also always going to be honest with candidates that sign up to run,” he said. He then recalled sitting with his father, former Gov. Steve Beshear, after election losses and said he knows what that disappointment “feels like.”
“So as long as people have reasonable expectations and know what they are getting into, know that oftentimes flipping a seat can take one, two or three elections, I want to be as encouraging as I can, but I’m a human being, and I always want to make sure we’re talking about how tough races can be,” Beshear said. “But, yes, I want to see Democratic candidates in as many races as possible.”

Beshear will be the chair of the Democratic Governors Association next year, putting him in a place to rally Democratic support for midterm elections nationally. He’s also being eyed as a possible contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. 
For this year, he said he is optimistic about Democrats’ chances in the New Jersey and Virginia governor races. He added that “we’re going to have some really exciting possibilities next year in places that people aren’t expecting right now.”
Martin told Kentucky Democrats that the Democratic National Committee (DNC)  under his leadership is focusing on getting “the DNC out of D.C.” He led the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and has a history as a labor and union organizer.
“When we organize everywhere, we can win anywhere,” Martin told the crowd. “That means we don’t give up on red states. That means we don’t give up on rural counties. We take our message everywhere.”
He expanded on that strategy with reporters afterwards. He said he doesn’t believe that “red states” or “blue states” stay that way over time. 
“This new DNC has to invest everywhere so we can build not just to win this moment but to win the future,” Martin said.
Kentucky Democratic Party Chairman Colmon Elridge told reporters state parties are excited about more dollar investments from the party’s national committee and that may help Democrats build back their grassroots campaigns. 
“I feel really great about our potential for 2026. I believe we’re going to contest a heck of a lot of races that we did not contest in the last election,” Elridge said. “And of course our goal in ’26 and beyond is to contest every race.”
Cherlynn Stevenson, the former chair of the state House Democratic Caucus, said ahead of the dinner that Democrats need to focus on “everyday issues,” including how Kentuckians are impacted by federal policies under the Trump administration. One big policy Democrats at all levels have been pushing back against is Trump’s budget reconciliation bill that includes cuts to Medicaid. 
She is seeking election in the 6th Congressional District, held by Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr who is now running for U.S. Senate. 
“If our people aren’t fed, and they’re not healthy, then our children can’t learn and our workers can’t produce when they go to work everyday,” Stevenson said. “So, we’ve got to get back to the meat and potatoes of what it means to take care of everyday Kentuckians and not kowtow to billionaires and succumb to the chaos that’s coming down from Washington.”

(Photo by Jacob Boomsma via Getty Images Plus)With temperatures forecast to soar as high as 89 degrees in Interior Alaska, the National Weather Service has issued its first-ever heat advisories for the state.
The advisories, which started Thursday and are in effect through Sunday, warn residents in the Fairbanks area and a wider swath of Interior Alaska to be careful about outdoor activities over the weekend.  
“Take extra precautions when working in the sun. Wear sunscreen and lightweight, loose fitting clothing. Try to limit strenuous activities to early morning or evening. Take action when you see symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke,” the National Weather Service said Friday in its special statement.
For context, the normal June high temperature in Fairbanks is 72 degrees.
While Alaska has occasionally had such high temperatures before, the practice of issuing heat advisories is new in the farthest-north state, said Brian Brettschneider, a National Weather Service climate scientist.
The service officially added heat advisories to its list of Alaska warnings earlier this year, Brettschneider said. The decision stems from the state’s experiences in 2019, when an ultra-hot summer was marked by long-lasting wildfires that poured smoke into populated areas and a record 90-degree temperature in Anchorage, the state’s largest city.
“We kind of realized, ‘Whoa, maybe extreme heat is something that we need to think more about.’ And even though we’ve had occasional extreme heat in the past, it really kind of brought to the forefront that we need to think about it as part of our mission for protecting life and property,” he said.
Temperatures in the 80s might not seem extreme in the Lower 48 states, but they can have big impacts on Alaska residents, Brettschneider said.
Part of that is because the homes and other elements of the built environment are structured for a cold climate, he said. “In Alaska, our homes are built to retain every molecule of heat, basically, and we have 20 hours of daylight,” he said. And part of that is because at Alaska’s high latitude, the angle of the sun is low, “so the solar energy is penetrating deep into the houses” and is otherwise unrelenting nearly around the clock, he said.
“What might be considered pleasant weather in the Lower 48 really has an outsized impact on our comfort and our health here,” he said.
Research led by the University of Alaska Anchorage has found that 70 degrees is generally the threshold at which Alaskans begin to suffer heat-related health problems.
Brettschneider said the current heat baking Interior Alaska is the product of a big ridge of high pressure. That has replaced what was a persistent low-pressure system that previously kept parts of the state unseasonably cool.
Fairbanks’ record high temperature was 96 degrees, recorded in 1969, Brettschneider said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A federal appeals court on Friday upheld the Biden administration’s approval of a major oil development on Alaska’s North Slope, even though it identified one flaw with the action.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a divided decision, said the U.S. Bureau of Land Management largely abided by federal laws when it granted approval to ConocoPhillips to develop the huge Willow project.
Despite one problem that the ruling characterized as “minor,” the approval shall stand, said the majority opinion, written by Judge Ryan D. Nelson.
The ruling allows ConocoPhillips to keep developing Willow, which holds about 600 million barrels of reserves and is slated to produce up to 180,000 barrels per day and be the westernmost operating oil field on the North Slope. And it rejects arguments from environmental and Native plaintiffs who said the BLM approval violated requirements for considering the cumulative and climate impacts of the huge development, impacts to endangered species and other issues.
The identified flaw stems from the BLM’s decision to approve a Willow development plan with three drill pads rather than the five ConocoPhillips had proposed. The scaled-back plan approved in 2023 also required ConocoPhillips to give up leases on about 68,000 acres, almost all of that in the ecologically sensitive Teshekpuk Lake area.
During the environmental study process that led to the approval decision, the BLM had expressed the position that it needed to consider full field development rather than piecemeal development, the ruling said. “And then when it came time to issue the final approval, it never explained whether its adopted alternative satisfied the full field development standard,” the ruling said.
But that was a “at heart, a procedural, not a substantive violation,” the ruling said. The development approval is to remain in place, the decision said. Overturning the approval is “unwarranted because the procedural error was minor and the on-the-ground consequences (of vacating it) would be severe,” the decision said.
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Gabriel Sanchez said the flaw was serious enough to justify overturning the permit. “BLM’s errors were more fundamental than simply failing to explain how it applied the full field development standard among the alternatives it reviewed,” he said. The agency wrongly excluded consideration of smaller alternatives when it was deciding whether to allow “the largest domestic oil drilling project on federal public lands,” he said.
Willow has been the subject of heated national debate. The discovery, on federal leases that date as far back as 1999, has inspired other exploration in the area, as well as hopes for state officials for a development renaissance on the North Slope. Oil production in the region is now less than a quarter of the 2 million-barrel-a-day peak hit in 1988.
Environmental activists, however, have described the project as a “climate bomb” that will pour substantial new amounts of planet-heating carbon gases into the atmosphere.
Friday’s ruling is the latest in a yearslong series of legal challenges that have created roadblocks to Willow development. In 2021, U.S. District Court Sharon Gleason overturned a prior approval of Willow. She ordered the BLM to complete a formal supplemental environmental impact statement to better analyze climate impacts and impacts to threatened polar bears. The 2023 project approval is the product of that supplemental study.

	ConocoPhillips, which is already well into Willow construction and plans to spend at least $7 billion on development, described Friday’s ruling as good news.
“ConocoPhillips welcomes the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision, which allows construction on the Willow project to continue. We recently completed another significant winter construction season, and the project remains on track for first oil in 2029,” company spokesperson Rebecca Boys said by email.
“We look forward to continuing the responsible development of Willow, which will enhance American energy security while expanding local employment opportunities and providing extensive benefits to Alaska Native communities and the State of Alaska.”
Over the past winter season, crews delivered modular structures and worked on road, pad, bridge, work camp and pipeline construction, Boys said.
That work was allowed to proceed because the 9th Circuit Court in December denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a restraining order blocking it.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case had mixed responses to Friday’s decision.
Some were highly critical.
“This decision is bad news for the planet and anyone who cares about the impacts of industrialization on communities now and in the future,” Bridget Psarianos, an attorney with the environmental law firm Trustees for Alaska, said in a statement.
“The bureau is required under the law to protect the western Arctic’s sensitive ecosystem and the subsistence users who rely on them. But the agency did not minimize the harm from this project on the Arctic’s people, animals, habitat, and the planet in a real way, in violation of the law. There is too much at stake to gloss over the harm this project will do,” said Psarianos, who is representing some of the plaintiffs.
It will probably be fairly simple for the BLM to address the court-identified flaw, Psarianos said in a follow-up email. The agency could submit a report or a memorandum explaining its reasoning, leaving the approval unaffected, she said.
Other plaintiff representatives portrayed the ruling as a vindication, albeit a partial one.
“Today’s ruling is a significant step forward for Alaska’s North Slope,” Hallie Templeton, legal director for plaintiff Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. “We hope that this will push BLM to heed the significant risks that Willow poses and deny it for good. While this should be the final straw for the doomed Willow Project, we will continue fighting to prevent this carbon bomb project from destroying one of our last remaining wild places.”
A spokesperson for the BLM declined to comment, citing the agency’s policies on litigation.

That experience helped shape his life goals then, and now that he’s 25 years old, he also holds that memory as a crucial lesson on resilience and the importance of family support. But, at the same time, the trip was a reminder of disparities prevailing along the Wasatch Front, where I-15 has historically been a divider that has dictated where investment is located.
That’s about to change with the incoming Eccles Hospital and Health Campus, an 800,000-square-foot University of Utah project that’s set to bring the institution’s largest off-campus medical facility to the west side of the valley, with room for a multi-specialty health center offering 200 exam rooms and an emergency department, in addition to an in-patient hospital with 130 rooms. The campus also means that Menjivar will have the chance to serve his own community as a doctor. 
“First and foremost, it’s a place of healing, but it will be more than that,” Menjivar said during a groundbreaking ceremony for the facility on Friday. “This hospital is going to bring us closer to health care. It’s going to bring access to our community, more opportunity for jobs, for increased representation and for trust.”

Combined, West Valley residents travel over 12 million miles a year for treatment since specialty health care isn’t much available in their communities. Nine out of 10 in-patient beds in Salt Lake County are also on the east side of I-15, according to Gina Hawley, chief operating officer for University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics.
“Studies have shown that where you don’t have health care closer to a community, that’s easily accessible, that’s provided by providers and staff members that are from that community, that know that community well, you actually have worse outcomes in the long term, which is why it’s so important for us to have a hospital and clinic out in West Valley,” Hawley said. 
West-siders face health disparities, including life expectancies 10 years lower than their east-side counterparts, as well as a 44% greater prevalence of diabetes and a 38% higher prevalence of stroke, according to a U. report.

“The biggest thing is it’s disconnected. There’s not one big health care system, like we have systems there, but nothing really feels like one big, interconnected system that has a lot of resources and a lot of access,” Menjivar told Utah News Dispatch. “It’s not to say that the hospitals (on the west side) are bad necessarily, or they’re not trying, but they just don’t have as much capacity as a place like the University of Utah does.” 
The project had been a couple of years in the making, but Friday marked the official start of the building that promises to breach gaps in health care access in the valley. The multi-specialty center phase is scheduled to open in late 2028 and the in-patient hospital by 2029.
The hospital campus’ name was coined after a $75 million gift from George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Foundation. But, the hospital is expected to fund most of its estimated $855 million budget with $800 million in bonds allocated by the Utah Legislature.

Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, who grew up in Taylorsville said during the ceremony that, as a west-sider, she understands the importance of such a feat. 
“U.S. News and World Report just ranked Utah the best state in the nation for the third year in a row. Now these are things that we love to brag about as leaders of the state, and they’re things we should brag about. They’re things to be very proud of,” Henderson said. “And in terms of health care, we are ranked high as well. Health care outcomes, we’re in top 10. But in health care accessibility, we’re 35 of 50. We can do better. We need to do better. We are going to do better.”
Apart from the accessibility solutions, the hospital is also meant to be a place reflective of the area, the most diverse in the state. 
Community committees have repeatedly met, helping shape the vision for the campus — one that includes providers that look and sound like their neighbors, and place a special emphasis on different cultural sensitivities in the area.
During the event, University of Utah President Taylor Randall reflected on the community that has made time to connect with their new neighbors and help make this new facility a substantial asset for the area, and potentially, an important part of Utah doctors’ educational journey.
“These are the types of projects that, to me, are the reason I like to lead an educational institution, because they are projects that bring people together,” Randall said. “They are projects that make us wrestle with the hard problems of society, but they give us momentum and hope that what we will see in the future is something better than what we see today.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation to an El Salvador prison sparked national debate over Trump administration immigration crackdowns, entered not guilty pleas on Friday to two federal human smuggling charges. 
Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and seated next to attorneys with the federal public defender’s office, Abrego Garcia spoke only once, through a translator. “I understand,” he said in response to the judge’s reading of the charges. 
The charges against Abrego Garcia, 29, are “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.” 
Friday’s hearing, in a downtown Nashville federal courtroom, turned primarily on the question of whether Abrego Garcia may be denied the opportunity to be released from jail pending trial. 
Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes said she would take the matter under advisement. She said she will issue a written ruling on the prosecution’s motion to keep Abrego Garcia detained “sooner rather than later.”

The criminal charges stem from a federal investigation opened into a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. 
Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. Abrego Garcia was not arrested or charged in the incident. 
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop gave rise to the charges he now faces, testimony in court Friday revealed.
The investigation relied on cooperating witnesses, analysis of license plate readers to track Abrego Garcia’s movements and a review of the Tennessee traffic stop evidence. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire alleged that Abrego Garcia was a danger to the community and a member of the MS-13 gang who, for nine years, engaged in an illegal smuggling operation that included transporting children, gang members and guns. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with gun crimes or crimes involving child victims.
Attorneys for Abrego Garcia said the government’s case should be looked at through a “lens of suspicion and skepticism” and questioned why it took three years to bring.

“The United States government from D.C. to Tennessee has exaggerated” allegations against Abrego Garcia, said Dumaka Shabazz, one of Abrego Garcia’s public defenders.  
“This is a house of cards built on the unverified credibility of unreliable corroborators,” he said. “The only reason they’re calling him dangerous now is to justify denying him due process and subjecting him to cruel and inhuman punishment they have to cover up,” said Shabazz, referencing Abrego Garcia’s imprisonment for nearly three months in a notorious Salvadoran prison. 
McGuire countered that the charges against Abrego Garcia arose from following the facts. “Since I’ve learned about this case, all I’ve tried to do is the right thing,” he said. “The facts are I didn’t … whip up witnesses and tell them to commit perjury.”
“I understand there are strong feelings about this case on both sides,” he said. 
The day-long hearing focused on the government’s arguments to detain Abrego Garcia until trial. 
Evidence that minors were present, and potentially placed at risk during Abrego Garcia’s alleged illegal acts could trigger legal justification for detaining Abrego Garcia and prosecutors presented allegations involving the safety of minors. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with crimes related to minor victims.

But prosecutors said a Department of Homeland Security investigation into the circumstances behind the 2022 traffic stop uncovered evidence that Abrego Garcia transported minor children, including his own, in part to provide cover for his allegedly illegal activities.
Abrego Garcia, McGuire alleged, acted as the driver in a human smuggling operation that involved transporting migrants already in the country illegally to different points around the nation over a nine-year period. 
McGuire cited a witness who said that Abrego Garcia engaged in sexual, but not physical, exchanges with her several years ago when she was a teen and referenced a list of passengers the Tennessee Highway Patrol obtained during the 2022 traffic stop. One of the passengers listed his age as 15.  
“Migrant transportation is inherently dangerous,” McGuire said. “The defendant transported his own children in an unsafe manner.”
McGuire argued that Abrego Garcia is a flight risk, and that his newfound notoriety could give him access to resources provided by those opposed to Trump administration immigration policies.  
Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes, who presided over the case, called the flight risk argument largely “academic.” 
Kilmar Abrego Garcia arraignment in Nashville

Immigration officials have already placed a hold on Abrego Garcia, giving them the authority to take immediate custody should he be released from jail, she noted.
The sole witness at Friday’s hearing was Peter Joseph, a Department of Homeland Security special agent who said he was first assigned to investigate Abrego Garcia on April 28, three years after the Tennessee traffic stop.  
By then, Abrego Garcia was incarcerated inside the Center for Terrorism Confinement prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court had, on April 10, ordered the federal government to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States. 
Joseph testified that he had reviewed License Plate Reader software in multiple states that contradicted Abrego Garcia’s statements about his movements to troopers at the time of the Tennessee traffic stop.
He also testified that five confidential witnesses, including co-conspirators in the alleged years-long human smuggling operation, had implicated Abrego Garcia in the scheme. 
Richard Tennant, another of Abrego Garcia’s defense attorneys, noted that some of the cooperating witnesses have their own liberty at stake. 
Three of the witnesses entered cooperation deals that could aid their ongoing criminal and immigration cases. Four of the five witnesses are from the same family, testimony revealed.

(Photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)The University System of Maryland’s Board of Regents voted Friday to approve a fiscal 2026 budget that is 7% smaller than last year’s allocation, as well as tuition increases of up to 5% and fee hikes up to 10%.
The almost $8 billion budget, already approved by Gov. Wes Moore and the General Assembly, will trim operating costs while aiming to increase revenue to make up for $155 million in reduced funding. These reductions follow an almost 4% cut to the University System last year.
“At this extraordinary time, our universities must make some difficult decisions as they close their budget gaps,” University System Chancellor Jay Perman said Friday.
On Thursday, Perman took the unusual step of sending a video message to more than 40,000 faculty and staff members across the system, apologizing for the coming budget cuts but telling staff to brace for them. He replayed that video for the board on Friday.
While university administrators will first seek to generate new revenue and will protect employees from cuts as much as possible, the “sheer size of the cut we’re absorbing means that, for some universities, personnel actions cannot be taken off the table,” Perman said in the video.
At their previous meeting in May, the regents approved a resolution that allows presidents of individual campuses to implement furloughs and temporary salary reductions as part of their budget plans.
Universities told they should brace for the coming year’s 7% budget cut

Senior Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance Ellen Herbst said 60% of the system’s operating costs are personnel-related. Two-thirds of the system’s employees are funded by state support, Herbst said, while about a quarter are funded by federal grants and contracts.
She said though universities are looking to low-impact actions to address personnel costs first, such as eliminating vacancies and allowing “natural attrition” to reduce payrolls, those actions alone may not be enough.
“We will take these actions with great care, but we will need to take some further actions,” Herbst said. “We cannot address the shortfall in state funding without addressing personnel costs.”
Patrick Moran, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Maryland Council 3, which represents more than 6,000 University System employees, said the union and system need to work together to defend their shared values and protect employees as they face “very real and critical threats.” Moran said the system must evaluate its use of costly vendors, reduce reliance on contractual employees, and listen to feedback from staff on how things can be better run.
“All of these things can be done before deciding to make devastating cuts to your personnel, especially those on the front lines,” he said.
Katherine Wasdin, a representative of the University of Maryland, College Park’s American Association of University Professors chapter, expressed the importance of shared governance as the system makes its budget decisions.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Faculty and university senates must be involved in making these difficult budgetary decisions, as well as in how to respond to changing federal policies on education and research,” Wasdin, an associate professor of classics, said. “It is thus imperative that all parts of the USM system promote the involvement of faculty in university management, rather than trying to thwart it.”
Under the budget plan, the University System will receive 29% of its funding from state appropriations, while 27% will come from tuition and fees. The next largest contribution comes from restricted funds, which consist mostly of federal contracts and grants, and will cover about 24% of the budget.
In addition to the reduction in state funding, the system estimates that the federal government’s significant cuts to research grants and contracts could cost up to $150 million across its campuses, Herbst said.
To increase revenue to offset the losses in funding, tuition will increase across the system by 2-4% for in-state residents. The University of Maryland, College Park will see the highest increase at 4%, while the rest will see increases of 3% or less.
Tuition for nonresident undergrads will increase by 5% at Towson and UMBC, and 2% at the system’s other institutions.
Regents committee calls for OK of $69 million for time to pull back spun-off businesses

Student fees, such as housing, dining and parking, will see bigger increases. Housing will see increases from 2% at Towson to 10% at Bowie State University, while board fee increases range from 2.2% at Salisbury University to 10.5% at College Park.
Bowie State University and the College Park campus will also raise parking fees by 3.8% and 5%, respectively.
The regents also voted Friday to approve extending the University of Maryland Global Campus’s contract with UMGC Ventures, the university’s former in-house information technology services unit which it turned into an independent business.
The online university will spend $69 million on the 18-month contract extension while it works to reintegrate Ventures and AccelerEd, a subsidiary of Ventures, back into the university. The reintegration comes after an August 2024 audit from the state’s Office of Legislative Audits that found the spin-offs were too costly and appeared to bypass the school’s normal procedures.
Herbst said that staff across the University System are continuously drawing up contingency plans for budget scenarios they could face later in the year, such as lower-than-expected enrollment, further federal funding cuts or change to eligibility for federal financial aid.
Pell Grants, the system’s largest source of financial aid, covered more than $204 million in aid for about 45,000 students in fiscal 2024. More than 58,000 students in total received some form of federal student aid, Herbst added, and any significant eligibility changes could potentially impact enrollment numbers.
“All we know for sure about budgets is they’re simply a plan, and then the year starts and we have to actually manage,” she said. “This year will probably prove to be more challenging than many.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file-8466-1024x690.jpg,,,2025-06-14 00:57:55.783031

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)One day after Gov. Mike Dunleavy made a precedent-setting veto by cutting funding for the state’s public school education formula, a group of city and borough leaders denounced the decision during a joint news conference, with some saying that they expect a lawsuit to challenge it.
“Everybody needs to start talking about what a lawsuit looks like,” said Rozlyn Grady-Wyche, a member of the Mountain View Community Council in Anchorage. 
Caroline Storm, of the Coalition for Education Equity, has been talking about a lawsuit for more than a year. On Friday, she said the coalition “will file or be a partner in a lawsuit before next session, because it doesn’t seem that between the Legislature and the governor, that they are capable of meeting their constitutional obligation to adequately fund public education.”
State lawmakers this year voted for a bill that increases the base student allocation, core of the state’s per-student funding formula, by $700 per student, overriding a Dunleavy veto in the process.
But that formula is subject to the state’s annual budget process, in separate legislation. If the formula is a bucket, the budget decides how full that bucket is.
Until now, lawmakers and the governor have filled that bucket to capacity each year. This year, one of Dunleavy’s vetoes took $200 per student from that bucket, cutting about $50.6 million statewide.
For municipal officials, it’s a significant problem because the ordinary local budget process is over, meaning that they will have to reopen their budgets and make additional cuts to public education. 
In some cases, those cuts will come atop school closures — including in Fairbanks, Anchorage, Kodiak and the Kenai Peninsula Borough — and other cuts that were already planned.
“It’s a crisis for our state, and that’s why we’re all here today,” said Fairbanks North Star Borough Mayor Grier Hopkins during the joint news conference.
On Thursday night, the Anchorage School Board voted to implement an immediate hiring freeze while it addresses the veto. 
The board had budgeted for a $560 BSA increase, thinking it was being cautious. Now that there’s a $500 increase instead, ASD facing a $4.3 million budget gap.
“I cannot even imagine where $4.3 million is going to come from,” said Margo Bellamy, vice president of the ASD board.
Kenai Peninsula Borough Mayor Peter Micciche, R-Soldotna, said the veto has a “fairly significant impact” in his borough, where voters may be asked to pick up the slack.
“This is essentially a tax shift. It’s the state not meeting a constitutional expectation requirement, if you will,” he said. 
Penny Vadla, treasurer of the Kenai Peninsula Borough school board, said the impacts in her area will be largest in sparsely populated places.
“We’re closing theaters, we’re losing library aides in some places where that means that library in a small school will close down,” she said. “The impact on larger schools is that they might become larger without the capacity to put more students in that building.”
State legislators could override Dunleavy’s cuts, but Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, and Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, said they don’t expect that lawmakers will be available until the 2026 Alaska Legislature begins in January.
“I’ll certainly be getting on my phone and hitting the streets to urge our legislators here, in the borough, the Interior delegation, to override the veto,” Hopkins said.
Micciche was critical of legislators’ slow pace. 
Before becoming mayor, Micciche served as Senate president. Lawmakers, and particularly the presiding officers of the House and Senate, should have already scheduled a special session to consider a veto override, he said.
“You knew that there was going to be a second swipe by the governor,” Micciche said. 
If the Legislature stays on the sidelines, that would leave legal action as the only recourse for Alaskans seeking a quick reversal of the governor’s action.
Any legal argument is expected to revolve around the question of whether or not the governor’s veto violates the Alaska Constitution’s education clause.
“The Alaska Constitution clearly states that the legislators shall, by general law, establish and maintain a system of public schools open to all children of the state, so that language creates a constitutional obligation to provide adequate and equitable public education,” said Grady-Wyche. 
“If the state fails to meet this obligation by consistently underfunding schools, closing essential programs and/or making access inequitable across regions, it can be legally challenged in court,” she said.
Storm, of the Coalition for Education Equity, has been watching the governor and Legislature closely for years and talking with other education groups in the meantime. The coalition is a nonprofit that has successfully sued to increase state school funding in the past.
Storm said she sees a national pattern at work, with conservative and limited-government groups and officials attempting to favor charter schools over traditional public schools.
“This is a coordinated attack on public education as a whole, as part of a national trend, or as Project 2025 — one hundred percent — and parents need to really start thinking about what’s going to happen when public education goes away, and what that means for their kid, because it’s not going to be pretty,” she said.
Storm wasn’t in the news conference with municipal officials, who focused on the local consequences of funding — or not — public education.
Micciche, who said he’s “not a courtroom guy,” cautioned that any lawsuit comes with risks: What happens if the plaintiffs lose?
“You can get a ruling; it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re going to get an outcome,” he said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a hearing June 20 on the use of Alaska Department of Corrections facilities to house and supervise federal detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The announcement comes following news of DOC holding 42 people arrested and detained by ICE from out of state over the weekend, housed at the Anchorage Correctional Complex, amid a nationwide immigration crackdown. 
DOC is currently housing 39 ICE detainees, according to a department spokesperson on Friday. 
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, chair of the judiciary committee, said the goal is to gather information on the terms and conditions of detention for the state detaining people for ICE.  
“It’s really more a fact-finding hearing just to make sure that we understand exactly what’s happening in a situation that, to my knowledge, hasn’t happened before,” Gray said in a phone interview Thursday.
“Some of the concerns that we have that we’re just curious to learn more about are how much contact they have with their families, with legal representation, and access to medical care,” he said. “Those sorts of things are things that we want to make sure that they have.”
The hearing is planned for June 20 at 1 p.m. at the Anchorage Legislative Information Office, and will be streamed live on the Legislature’s website and Gavel Alaska. The committee has invited officials with the Department of Corrections, Department of Law, the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska and attorneys representing several of the men to present.
Gray pointed to immigration status as a civil legal issue, and not a criminal one. “And my limited understanding of what’s happening in DOC right now with these detainees is that they are not being afforded those additional rights and freedoms that would come to someone who would be at an ICE detention facility,” he said.
ICE has not responded to multiple requests for comment, including on what criminal or civil charges are being brought against the men.
One man being held in Alaska custody, Albert Khamitov, was granted asylum by an immigration judge for “’clear evidence of state sponsored persecution’ of LGBTQ+ people in Russia,” the Seattle Times has reported. The U.S. government appealed that asylum decision and he has remained in detention while fighting the case.

Gray said he’s been speaking with several attorneys representing the men currently detained, who have raised the issue of whether they are receiving adequate translation services while in Alaska custody. Gray said he’s been told DOC staff are using Google Translate to communicate with detainees, which he said is inadequate. 
“​​I want to hear from DOC, I want them to talk about how they’re handling this issue. But the fear is that folks have been removed to Alaska, cannot communicate with the people who are, you know, managing them, and have no way of contacting their friends and family from where they came,” he said. “I just can’t imagine what that must be like for them. So I hope that my fear is unfounded.”
DOC spokesperson Betsy Holley said Friday via email that the department is using translation services. “We have long had, and utilize professional translation services: Language Link, Language Line Services, Alaska Interpreting Alliance, and Big Language Solutions,” she said. “Additionally, we have many bilingual staff members. The facility chooses the service based on availability at the time the need arises.”
The department did not respond to requests for comment on the concerns around conditions of detention, access to communication with families and attorneys, as well as access to medical care, by Friday at 4 p.m. 
Gray said he’s also concerned about the state’s risk for potential litigation around standards of detention. 
“Our facilities were not designed for this. Our personnel were not trained for this,” Gray said. “My fear is that there’s going to be some very well-founded litigation about these folks being here that the state is going to have to pay for. It is not going to break even. This is going to end up costing Alaska a lot of money, is my fear.”
Questions remain around why the men were transferred to Alaska from the Tacoma ICE Detention Facility, as two men were transferred back to Washington state within one day, according to the Department of Corrections. 
“There are rights that are guaranteed to people in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, a person cannot be incarcerated without knowing what the charges are against them, without the right to legal representation, without the right to defend themselves,” Gray said. “I have fear that these folks aren’t being awarded these rights as they should be, but I will reserve judgment.”

Jim Pillen activates National Guard ahead of statewide immigration protests,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/06/13/nebraska-gov-jim-pillen-activates-national-guard-ahead-of-statewide-immigration-protests/,"Pillen and Nebraska joined other states with conservative governors, such as Texas and Missouri, that have activated their National Guard in advance of planned protests","Pillen formally declared a state of emergency to activate the Guard so it can assist local law enforcement should any demonstrations escalate. (Courtesy of the Governor's Office)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen has activated the Nebraska National Guard ahead of scheduled protests this weekend. 
Late Friday, the governor issued an emergency proclamation that activated the Guard and prepared Guard and state law enforcement resources for immediate deployment if needed, a governor’s spokeswoman confirmed. 
Typical National Guard activation can take up to 24 hours, but the proclamation shortens that time.
Nebraska has seen several protests in recent days over a federal immigration raid that hit an Omaha food plant, in what immigration officials said was the largest Nebraska enforcement operation since President Donald Trump took office.
Most of the protests have been peaceful – though federal officials arrested four protesters from the original raid site, Glenn Valley Foods, alleging “aggressive” behavior damage to federal property. 
Pillen and Nebraska joined other states with conservative governors, such as Texas and Missouri, that have activated their National Guard in advance of planned protests. Texas has deployed 5,000 Guard members.
Pillen formally declared a state of emergency to activate the Guard so it can assist local law enforcement should any demonstrations escalate. 
“Free speech will be respected and protected in Nebraska,” Pillen said. “But the lawlessness, chaos, and rioting seen in other cities in past weeks will not be tolerated here.” 
Pillen said he took the steps to boost “security and order” for the visitors of the College World Series in Omaha, the NCAA’s baseball championships, and across the state. 
“Any person who poses a threat to life, health, or property will be arrested,” Pillen wrote in his emergency proclamation.
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, in a post on Facebook, called the Governor’s emergency declaration an “extreme overreach” and an attempt to silence dissent.” 
“This is not leadership,” Spivey said. “It’s fear-mongering.” 
The heartland protests come against the backdrop of larger, tenser protests in Los Angeles as a result of ICE raids there over the past week. 
The Trump administration and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have been butting heads as Trump federalized and then deployed 4,000 members of the California National Guard and 700 Marines to the second-largest U.S. city in response to protests without the permission from the Democratic governor. 
Newsom responded by accusing Trump of choosing “theatrics over public safety’ and escalating the “chaos.” The California Governor sued the Trump Administration over the deployment of the state National Guard. 
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers this week joined 18 other Republican attorneys general in a brief in support of Trump’s deployment of National Guard, arguing that Trump has the “authority” to do so. 
“We stand with law enforcement, we support President Trump’s action, and we will not let chaos take hold in our states,” Hilger said in a joint statement. 
Los Angeles has sparked similar protests in Texas, New York City, Chicago, and other Democratic-leaning parts of the country. More protests are planned nationally against Trump this weekend, including in Nebraska, part of the ‘No King’ protests, as Trump plans a military parade to celebrate the Army’s anniversary in Washington D.C, and Flag Day on Saturday, both of which overlap with his 79th birthday.  
Organizers behind the nationwide ‘No King’ protests include Indivisible, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the 50501 Movement. Organizers have branded Saturday as a “day of defiance” against what they call authoritarian overreach by the Trump administration. 
There are 13 planned protests around Nebraska, including Lincoln,  Omaha and Hastings.

Complaint argues that the state funding private education violates the Wyoming Constitution in two key ways.
The post Wyoming Education Association files lawsuit to stop school voucher payments appeared first on WyoFile .","Nine parents of school-aged children and the Wyoming Education Association, which represents more than 6,000 of the state’s public school employees, filed a lawsuit Friday challenging the constitutionality of the state’s education savings account program instituted by the Wyoming Legislature.
The program, which lawmakers created in 2024 and significantly expanded during their time in Cheyenne this year, will give up to $7,000 per K-12 student to Wyoming families annually to pay for private education costs.
The WEA’s complaint argues that the program violates the Wyoming Constitution in two key ways. One for directing public dollars to private enterprises, which the lawsuit says is clearly prohibited. The second for violating the constitution’s mandate that Wyoming provide “a complete and uniform system of education.” 
The program puts kids at risk of falling behind while wasting tax dollars on unqualified operators, Kim Amen, president of WEA, told WyoFile in a phone interview Friday. 
Proponents of the education savings accounts, also known as a voucher program, argue it gives parents more choices in educating their children and offers the smallest rural communities options to bring schools in if they don’t qualify for public school investments by the state.
The constitutional arguments in the lawsuit echo those made repeatedly by the program’s opponents during recent statehouse debates over its expansion — one of the most controversial topics of the 2025 legislative session. The debate also brought interest and action from national school choice organizations to Cheyenne.
“They were told over and over that this was unconstitutional and they chose to pass it anyway,” Amen said.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder and State Treasurer Curt Meier are named as defendants alongside the state. Meier is named because WEA is seeking a court injunction to stop the disbursement of funds by the treasurer. Degenfelder supported the program and is failing to uphold the state’s public education system, Amen contended Friday. A department of education spokesperson did not immediately respond to a voicemail seeking comment on the lawsuit late Friday afternoon.
House Education Chairman Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie, a chief proponent of the school voucher legislation, told WyoFile on Friday he did not think the lawsuit would succeed, based on similar cases in other states. 
“Legal challenges like this are expected whenever bold school choice programs are implemented,” he said. “Wyoming’s ESA program was crafted carefully to withstand this kind of scrutiny, and we’re confident it will stand.”
The new lawsuit opens a second major front in legal battles between public schools and the increasingly conservative legislature, which has constrained public education funding while promoting the growth of privately run charter schools in Wyoming. The lawsuit directly challenges the Legislature’s expansion this past session of its voucher program, which provides public funds to cover private education costs. 
But in Friday’s complaint, the WEA’s attorneys linked that voucher program to what they called lawmakers’ failure to fund public education to the high standards Wyoming’s constitution dictates. Educators notched a sweeping legal victory in February — during the legislative session — in a lawsuit over that case, when a district court judge ordered lawmakers to reexamine the public school funding model.
“While the ink was still drying on the District Court’s decision, the Wyoming Legislature … greatly expanded the existing Voucher Program to all students in Wyoming,” the complaint reads. 
The state has appealed the school funding case to the Wyoming Supreme Court, which has not yet taken up the matter. 
The WEA will continue to challenge the Legislature in court if lawmakers pass bills that the organization considers unconstitutional and detrimental to public schools, Amen said. 
“The voucher school program disproportionately benefits wealthy families,” she said. “We remain committed to defending our public educators, students and families. Public dollars belong in public schools.”

CHICAGO — The number of years former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan spent in Springfield has often been used as shorthand to explain his outsized impact on state government and politics.

CHICAGO — The number of years former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan spent in Springfield has often been used as shorthand to explain his outsized impact on state government and politics. His political career spanned 50 years in the General Assembly, 23 years chairing the Democratic Party of Illinois, and 36 years as House speaker — the longest tenure of any state or federal legislative leader in U.S. history.

But on Friday, a new term was added to the former speaker’s list of legacy-defining terms when U.S. District Judge John Blakey sentenced Madigan to 90 months, or 7 ½ years, in federal prison.

The sentence, which also includes three years’ probation after his prison term and a $2.5 million fine, follows a jury’s split verdict in February. After a marathon two weeks of deliberation, jurors convicted him on 10 of 23 corruption charges, including bribery, but acquitted him on seven and deadlocked over another six.

As Friday afternoon’s hearing passed the three-hour mark, Madigan accepted Blakey’s invitation to make a statement to the court. After taking a drink of water, putting on his glasses and blowing his nose as he approached the bench, the former speaker addressed the judge for less than two minutes, reading from a prepared script.

“I’m truly sorry for putting the people of the state of Illinois through this,” he began, noting that he “tried my best” to serve the people of Illinois. “I am not perfect.”

Later, when explaining how he was weighing Madigan’s continued insistence in his innocence, Blakey repeated Madigan’s words.

“The defendant says he’s sorry for putting the people of Illinois through this,” the judge said. “I guess that’s as close as we’ll get to remorse.”

Blakey spent a long time audibly weighing what he called “a tale of two different Mike Madigans,” calling the former speaker “a dedicated public servant” and “a good and decent person.”

“He had no reason to commit these crimes,” the judge said. “But he chose to do so.”

Blakey took particular umbrage with Madigan’s performance on the witness stand in January after he made the stunning decision to testify in his own defense. In siding with the government’s argument that the former speaker’s sentence should take into account his perjury on the witness stand, Blakey cited several examples of times Madigan’s statements conflicted with either evidence, the sworn testimony of others, or even his own testimony.

“The defendant’s testimony was littered with obstruction of justice and it was hard to watch,” Blakey said. “To put it bluntly, it was a nauseating display. ... You lied, sir. You lied. You did not have to.”

Madigan, who was described by many witnesses throughout his four-month trial as difficult to read — and who attempted to explain the familial origins of his reserved personality as a defense while on the witness stand — was characteristically stoic as Blakey handed down his sentence.

After conferring with his attorney, he hugged and kissed his adult children in the front row of the courtroom gallery. A few minutes later, he and his entourage of lawyers and family quickly made their way out of the Dirksen Federal Courthouse, trailed by cameras.

True to form, the former speaker also made no statement to reporters, though he smiled slightly before getting on the elevator down to the courthouse lobby. Across the street, a man yelled to Madigan and his group, “You going to jail, buddy?”

Madigan was ordered to report to a yet-to-be-named federal prison on Oct. 13.

Prosecutors had urged a 12 ½-year sentence and a $1.5 million fine, while Madigan’s lawyers asked for five years’ probation, the first on home detention. After hearing arguments from attorneys earlier in the week, Blakey calculated the sentencing guidelines for Madigan’s convictions and other factors would dictate a prison term of 105 years, but the judge was under no obligation to follow that directive.

‘I’m not a target of anything”

One of the last times the famously media-averse Madigan ever deigned to answer questions from journalists was in the fall of 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic afforded the speaker an even larger buffer than usual from those outside his closed circle of staff and advisors.

The previous several months had yielded near-weekly developments in the public’s understanding of an unfolding federal corruption probe, including revelations about FBI searches executed on the homes of close Madigan allies. The intrigue only intensified after the indictment and midday FBI raids on two different Democratic state senators and the arrest of a member of Madigan’s own House Democratic leadership team on a charge that he bribed another Democratic senator, who happened to be cooperating with the feds.

Despite his name showing up on subpoenas for some of those search warrants, Madigan made a bold declaration that he was not in the feds’ crosshairs.

“No, I’m not a target of anything,” he told a gaggle of reporters in a crowded and noisy hallway of the state Capitol in Springfield in late October 2019.

Within the year, however, Madigan would be proven wrong as prosecutors filed the first in a series of bombshell charges alleging the longtime speaker had been the beneficiary of a yearslong bribery scheme from electric utility Commonwealth Edison. Prosecutors alleged ComEd officials agreed to hire Madigan allies, including a handful on no-work contracts, to grease the wheels at key times when the company was pushing for big and ultimately lucrative legislation in Springfield.

In that July 2020 filing, Madigan’s status as a target of the feds’ widespread corruption investigation was marked by a new moniker: “Public Official A.”

But it wasn’t until March 2022 — more than a year after Madigan resigned from his biggest public roles after pressure from within the Democratic power structures he’d built over decades — that the former speaker was indicted.

Receiving top billing among the original 22 counts in the indictment, which was later bumped to 23, was racketeering. Prosecutors accused Madigan of using his positions as House speaker, chair of the state’s Democratic Party and as partner in his real estate law firm as a “criminal enterprise” meant to maintain and increase his power while enriching his allies.

The indictment rehashed what had been already made public in July 2020 and again several months later when four former ComEd executives and lobbyists were charged with orchestrating the utility’s bribery scheme aimed at Madigan.

But it also revealed that former Chicago Ald. Danny Solis had worn a wire on the speaker and alleged the speaker had agreed to get him appointed to a lucrative state board position in exchange for introductions to real estate developers to woo them as potential clients of Madigan’s firm.

A final charge added later in 2022 alleged a tacit bribery agreement between Madigan and telecommunications giant AT&T Illinois like the ComEd scheme, albeit smaller — involving one no-work contractor hired in the months before AT&T-backed legislation passed in Springfield.

Jury delivers a split verdict

On the witness stand, Madigan repeatedly claimed that he was ignorant of the fact that the collective $1.3 million his allies earned from their ComEd contracts was for performing no work. Instead, the former speaker and his lawyers framed those contracts as the result of mere job recommendations, which they argued was a component of Madigan’s job as speaker.

Madigan’s attorneys, along with some of the government’s own witnesses, argued the ComEd-backed legislation passed after years of strategic and expensive lobbying efforts, and not because the speaker’s allies had gotten jobs and contracts with the utility.

But after a slew of witnesses, including a ComEd exec-turned-FBI cooperator and one of the former contractors, in addition to secretly recorded videos and wiretapped phone calls shown at trial, the jury was ultimately convinced on most ComEd-related charges. Madigan was convicted on seven of those charges, including four counts of bribery and conspiracy, though he was acquitted on two charges related to an effort to get his ally appointed to the utility’s board.

The so-called “ComEd Four” were convicted in their own trial in 2023 and are scheduled to be sentenced this summer. They include Madigan’s formerly close friend and longtime Springfield lobbyist Mike McClain, who was also the speaker’s codefendant in the most recent trial. But after roughly 65 hours of deliberations over two weeks beginning in late January, the jury deadlocked on all six charges that named both the former speaker and McClain, including the feds’ marquee racketeering allegation.

The jury also deadlocked on the single count alleging Madigan’s participation in the alleged bribery scheme with AT&T, forcing Blakey to declare a mistrial on that count.

It was the second time in five months that charges alleging a bribe between AT&T and Madigan resulted in a hung jury; weeks before Madigan’s trial began, former AT&T Illinois President Paul La Schiazza’s bribery case ended in a mistrial on all five counts against him. He faces retrial in January 2026.

Charges involving Solis, the former Chicago alderman, ended in a mix of convictions, acquittals and deadlock from the jury. While jurors convicted the former speaker on wire fraud and Travel Act violation counts related to the alleged scheme to help get Solis appointed to a state board, they acquitted him of the bribery charge pertaining to the same alleged scheme. As laid out in trial, Madigan never ended up recommending Solis to newly elected Gov. JB Pritzker.

The former speaker was also acquitted of attempted extortion and three related counts related to a real estate developer to whom Madigan wanted an introduction from Solis, who served as chair of the Chicago City Council’s powerful Zoning Board. Prosecutors alleged Madigan understood and tacitly approved of Solis’ made-up story that he’d condition the approval of a zoning change sought by the developer on whether it agreed to hire the speaker’s law firm.

At the FBI’s direction, Solis told the speaker ahead of the July 2017 introduction meeting that the developer understood “how this works, you know, the quid pro quo” — insinuating the company was under the impression that it would not get the zoning approvals it needed unless it hired the speaker’s law firm, though it wasn’t true.

A few weeks later, Madigan admonished Solis before the developer meeting, telling the alderman, “You shouldn’t be talking like that.”

The feds argued Madigan was urging Solis to not speak so brazenly about their alleged bribery agreement. But on the witness stand, the former speaker said the alderman’s use of the term “quid pro quo” caused him “a great deal of surprise and concern” to the point that he decided he needed to confront Solis about it face-to-face.

In Madigan’s contentious cross-examination, the lead prosecutor attempted to poke holes in the former speaker’s explanation of that key moment, but Madigan maintained Solis seemed to have recognized he’d “made a serious mistake” and that he considered the matter settled because “I was not going to connect a request for an introduction with anything else.""

The jury also deadlocked on four other bribery, wire fraud and Travel Act charges concerning a plan to get state-owned land in Chicago’s Chinatown neighborhood transferred to the city for eventual development into a mixed-use apartment building.

Prosecutors alleged Madigan intended to have his firm contract with the Chinatown developer in accordance with hints Solis had dropped on secret recordings. But Madigan’s former law partner and testimony from two former top lawyers in the speaker’s office indicated the law firm had strict conflict-of-interest rules that would have prohibited the developer from ever becoming a client.

Sentencing factors

In the four months post-verdict, a period nearly as long as the grueling trial itself, Madigan turned 83 — a mitigating factor his defense attorneys noted in a pre-sentencing memo late last month, which asked for five years’ probation, including one on home confinement.

In another filing last week, Madigan’s lawyers painted a bleak picture of the sentence sought by prosecutors, accusing them of arguing in bad faith that ComEd’s investor profits should be considered as part of sentencing.

“The government seeks to condemn an 83-year-old man to die behind bars for crimes that enriched him not one penny,” defense attorneys wrote. “They demand that Mike Madigan spend his final years in a cell, though he spent decades as the consumers’ shield against ComEd’s predations.”

But much more emphasized was his role as caretaker to his wife, Shirley, who suffers from “a severe lung disease,” per a letter filed with the court last month from Madigan’s daughter, former Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan.

Instead of writing a letter, Shirley Madigan recorded a video pleading for leniency in sentencing. Clad in purple latex gloves with a medical mask hanging from her neck, Shirley praised her husband’s character as a father and grandfather but also detailed how Madigan has become her caretaker, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

Shirley detailed her chronic lung disease has made her medically fragile and forced her husband to take on the role of caretaker.

“I really don’t exist without him,” she told the camera as B-roll of Madigan helping her up from a couch played over her testimonial. “I don’t know what I would do without Michael. I would probably have to find some place to live, and I’d probably have to find care.”

The former speaker and his lawyers echoed Shirley’s pleas Friday, with attorney Dan Collins telling Blakey that for Madigan, “mercy is justice,” and Madigan himself asking the judge that “you let me take care of Shirley and that you let me spend my final days with my family.”

Blakey said Madigan’s age was a factor, but said arguments that “any sentence” for an older defendant is tantamount to a life sentence are “not particularly helpful.”

But the judge said he carefully considered the nearly 250 character reference letters filed on Madigan’s behalf late last month, saying he “placed significant weight” on the support of the former speaker’s family and friends.

He even got emotional when discussing Madigan’s role as a husband, father and grandfather.

“Whatever his crimes — and he did do things wrong — but his relationship to his family? He got that right,” Blakey said, echoing words the former speaker told Solis during a secretly recorded meeting between the two in 2018.

Aside from family, other notable letter-writers on Madigan’s behalf included former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun; former Illinois Supreme Court Justice Tom Kilbride; Democratic mega-fundraisers Michael Sacks and Fred Eychaner, and Chicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf. While many former Democratic allies of Madigan penned appeals to Judge Blakey, only a few currently hold office — among them state Reps. Marcus Evans, D-Chicago, and Curtis Tarver, D-Chicago, along with Auditor General Frank Mautino.

In determining sentencing guidelines, Blakey agreed with prosecutors’ contention that the value of the ComEd bribes should be based on testimony from utility leader Scott Vogt during trial. Vogt cited projections that the continuation of the “formula rate” contained in the first piece of ComEd-backed legislation passed during the eight-year bribery scheme was worth $400 million in increased shareholder value for the company.

The judge also agreed with smaller sentencing enhancements, for defendants who orchestrate bribery schemes, and for lying under oath while testifying in their own defense.

Blakey gave several examples of times in which Madigan perjured himself during his four days on the witness stand, including the former speaker’s attempt to “falsely minimize the close and regular relationship he had with McClain.”

“Other witnesses testified to their unique and close relationship, which spanned decades,” Blakey said. “In short, the evidence produced at trial showed McClain was one of Madigan’s most-trusted operatives, not merely one of many, as he falsely testified.”

Ultimately, though, the judge’s ruling in favor of sentencing enhancements for perjury and other factors is mostly symbolic, as the parties already agreed to a sentence far below the complicated calculation that would advise a 105-year prison sentence.

Sentences handed down to other convicted politicians in Illinois’ long history of elected officials caught up in corruption have varied widely.

Last year, a federal judge sentenced Madigan’s pseudo-counterpart in the Chicago City Council, five-decade Ald. Ed Burke, to two years in prison after his bribery conviction that also involved Solis’ FBI cooperation in bringing potential clients to Burke’s real estate law firm. The judge noted the number of character letters she received on the former alderman’s behalf were a strong mitigating factor in her sentencing decision.

On the other end of the spectrum, Gov. Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison after his 2011 bribery convictions related to attempting to sell then-President-elect Barack Obama’s soon-to-be-vacated U.S. Senate seat in 2008. President Donald Trump commuted his sentence in 2020, and in February pardoned him completely — just two days before Madigan’s conviction.

(Photo by Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)Estimates from the Sierra Club found Iowa utilities would be allowed to release 26 million tons of carbon emissions annually, if the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized a proposal to repeal carbon pollution standards. 
In its explanation for the proposal, EPA claims greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired plants “do not contribute significantly” to dangerous air pollution and that removing pollution standards set by the agency under previous administrations would save $19 billion in regulatory costs over two decades. 
The Sierra Club, which is an environmental organization with chapters across the country, said the power sector is the largest stationary source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. and that exposure to these air pollutants are linked to a higher risk of heart disease, respiratory diseases, pregnancy complications and cancer.

“The Trump Administration continues to put the American people at risk by stripping away environmental safeguards proven to clean up the air we breathe and improve public health,” Pam Mackey Taylor, director of the Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club, said in a statement. 
The proposal would repeal regulations put in place in 2015 and in 2024 that put emission guidelines and standards on coal-fired power plants, via Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. 
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s proposal argues the Clean Air Act requires the agency to determine, before it issues regulations, that pollutants emitted by fossil fuel-fired power plants “causes, or contributes significantly to, air pollution” that is “anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” 
The current administration argues EPA in the past created regulation standards without this determination. 
EPA data shows that 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 came from the power sector, which was just slightly less than the transportation sector which accounted for 28% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. 
In an EPA presentation explaining the rules which were finalized in July 2024, the agency estimated the additional carbon pollution standards would have cut 617 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and other “harmful air pollutants that are known to endanger public health.” 
Sierra Club charted the impacts these regulations would have had, state-by-state based on operating coal-powered plants and their estimated closure dates.
EPA regulations around carbon pollution standards for the power sector have been challenged in the past, most recently with a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court case that repealed part of the 2015 Clean Power Plan emission guidelines. 
The proposal to repeal the most recent rules alleges Biden-era EPA leadership did not change course following the Supreme Court ruling, but created similar, rules with expanded regulations. 
Acting under a handful of executive orders from President Donald Trump, and Zeldin’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative, the agency seeks to repeal “all” greenhouse gas emission standards on the power sector, or alternatively, just the “most burdensome set of requirements.” 
The notice said this will “ensure affordable and reliable energy supplies and drive down the costs of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing while boosting our national security.” 
The proposal will have a public hearing 15 days after it is published in the Federal Register, where EPA will also accept public comments on the proposed rules 45 days after it is published. Those interested can search for the docket in the federal register with Docket ID number: EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0124. 
“During the public comment period, we will continue to fight for clean air and protect our communities being harmed by Trump’s shortsighted actions,” Mackey Taylor said.

After a week of stalled negotiations between House and Senate members over private school funding, compromise prevailed. But the bill — a generational transformation of Vermont’s education system — still requires a majority vote in both chambers.

MONTPELIER—After days of stagnated negotiations, a group of lawmakers and Gov. Phil Scott reached a compromise on the year’s landmark education reform bill. 
Loaded with caveats, the proposal would consolidate school districts, create a new education funding formula, impose class-size minimums and reimagine income-sensitive property tax relief. Those changes, however, would take place over many years and only if a number of contingencies are met.
While Friday’s compromise represented a significant breakthrough, the legislation still requires a majority vote in the House and Senate — far from a done deal on what’s become a proposal filled with policies that are unpopular for some Democrats and Republicans. 
“I’m happy to say we’ve reached an agreement,” Scott said at his weekly press conference Friday afternoon, adding that his team would work with legislative Republicans over the weekend to explain the legislation. 
The three senators and three representatives who’ve spent weeks negotiating a compromise shook hands soon after Scott’s announcement, eliciting applause from legislative leaders and staff looking on.
“All of us compromised a lot to get here,” Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, chair of the Senate Education Committee and chair of the conference committee, told his fellow conferees. 
The Legislature will return Monday, when it intends to wrap up the year’s business — including voting on the changes to the education reform bill proposed by the conference committee.
In the meantime, lawmakers are in for a busy weekend. Democratic and Republican leadership, as well as the Scott administration, will need to explain the 155-page bill to their colleagues and attempt to build support. 
With such a wide-ranging proposal, there’s lots for lawmakers to dislike. Some have argued the bill spends too much. Others say it underfunds schools. Some fear it will gut rural school districts and shutter small schools. Still others argue it shifts too much power out of local hands and into Montpelier. 
Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, who leads the Senate Republicans, said he’d start calling his colleagues tomorrow. 
“I think the conversation will definitely start with a lot of ‘no’s,’” he said in an interview. “There are things in this bill I don’t like. I would have certainly done it differently. But there are tax savings in here for Vermonters.”
Scott too acknowledged the challenge ahead in getting a majority behind the proposal. 
“I don’t believe this is a slam dunk by any stretch,” he said. “There will be Republicans that won’t vote for it, and there’ll be Democrats who won’t vote for it as well.”

The details
The bill, H.454, referred to by the governor and lawmakers as the “education transformation proposal,” is replete with unknowns and contingencies, and requires years of phase-ins and -outs before it takes full effect. 
After last year’s double-digit average increases in education property taxes, both Scott, a Republican, and the Legislature’s top Democrats vowed to reform Vermont’s education system. But while agreement existed in the abstract, the details proved far harder to hash out. Even after more than five months of work, coming out with a bill that both chambers and the governor could support never looked certain. 
Friday’s compromise, a product of hours of public meetings and even more backroom negotiations, lays the groundwork for generational change to the state’s public education and property tax systems.
In the broadest terms, the proposal would consolidate Vermont’s more than 100 school districts into larger, regional bodies, and move the state to a new education funding formula, a combination that Scott’s team says will save hundreds of millions after fully implemented. 
The state will gradually pivot to funding its education using a foundation formula. The method — used in most states across the country — moves primary authority over how much school districts can spend from the local to the state level. Districts receive money based on the number of students enrolled, with additional dollars for students who are more expensive to educate, such as English learners and students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. 
To ease the whiplash of transitioning to the new formula, lawmakers designed a gradual transition. In effect, that would phase in tax increases for districts that currently spend well below average, and slowly pull back funding from districts that spend well above average now. Plus, lawmakers hope a new property tax break structure will moderate the impact for most Vermont resident homeowners.
As written, H.454 would allow districts to spend more — but not less — than the foundation formula provides. That supplemental spending, which would need to be approved by school district voters, would start at a maximum of 10%, phasing down to 5% over time. 
The bill’s biggest unknown is what future consolidated school districts could look like. A task force will hash out not more than three possible configurations this summer that the legislature would need to vote on as soon as next session. 
Those districts, as well as the new funding formula, would take effect in 2028. 
Other key, outstanding details include how to handle existing district debt and different teachers contracts in new, consolidated districts. Lawmakers also need to figure out how to pay for — and bring down the cost of — special education, and how money would be allocated to career and technical education and pre-kindergarten. 
Without fulfilling future requirements, the transformation self-destructs. The foundation formula is contingent on creating consolidated school districts. Several aspects rely on future studies and the outcomes of those analyses.
The bill would put into effect class-size minimums in first grade through high school. But the enforcement of those minimums involve several caveats, and districts would need to be out of compliance for three years before facing even the possibility of repercussions. Plus, a waiver process would allow schools to petition for an exemption. 
Though the future school districts remain a huge unknown, the bill instructs the redistricting task force to compose districts of 4,000 to 8,000 students, though that range is approximate and only to “the extent practical.” Currently, only the Champlain Valley School District has more than 4,000 students.
The proposal would move Vermont away from a system of income-adjusted property tax credits. Instead, the framework would pivot to a homestead exemption that would allow homeowners making $115,000 or less to exempt up to $425,000 in property value from taxes. The exemption creates a sliding scale, with lower-income homeowners eligible for bigger exemptions. 
Negotiations stall, then a breakthrough 
Conferees spent the bulk of their time this week squabbling over issues around Vermont’s version of school choice, which allows students in towns that don’t operate public schools for some or all grades to use taxpayer money to attend either a public or private school. 
Up for debate: which private schools would be allowed to keep receiving public money, and how much control they would have over their tuition rates. 
Though private school regulations made up a tiny fraction of the bill — and only roughly 5% of Vermont’s publicly-funded students attend private schools — public versus private debates have long divided Vermont politicians.
At times, the conferees appeared legions apart. Thursday, as the House put forward a new proposal, its Democratic conferees appeared to draw a line in the sand.
“We have with this gone as far as we can and still have the support of our caucus,” Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, told Senate conferees.
She and Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, chair of the House Education Committee, called for strict controls on which private schools can receive public money and how much money they can receive, arguing that private schools should face similar restrictions to those the bill proposes for public schools. 
At times, that line of thinking appeared a nonstarter for Senate members, mainly Bongartz and Beck, who argued in some cases for maintaining the status quo for Vermont’s most prominent private schools. 
Both senators have longstanding ties to those schools. Bongartz served as the board chair at Burr and Burton Academy. Beck works as a teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy. 
In particular, the senators pushed for a provision that would allow high schools that enroll publicly-funded students — both public and private receiving schools — to receive more money per student than lower-grade schools, arguing high school is more expensive. Some of the state’s private schools, like St. Johnsbury Academy and Burr and Burton, serve as the primary high school for local students, and Beck and Bongartz suggested that private high schools could cease to operate without the extra dollars. 
Both sides also failed for days to find compromise on how many private schools would still be eligible to receive public funds. The Senate had proposed regulations that they said would have cut the number more than in half, but the House conferees pushed for tighter restrictions. 
But in the end, lawmakers managed to meet in the middle. The bill proposes a significant winnowing of which private schools can receive public money. Those schools must meet a multipart test. First, they must exist in a school district that does not operate public schools for some grades, or in a supervisory union with school districts that fit that description. Next, the private school’s student body must have consisted of at least 25% publicly-funded students as of last year to continue to be eligible. 
The goal, lawmakers said, was to narrow eligibility only to those private schools that have functioned for years as a popular option in areas where no public school existed. 
Asked about how the Senate conferees ultimately found compromise, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, said in an interview that the House had met his chamber “more than halfway” on the issue of private schools. 
He described the state’s persistent fights over public money going to private schools as an “infected wound.”
“The wound, such as it is, is tiny, but the pain and the outrage and the way that people get worked up over it comes from this infected quality of the debate,” he said.

Anti-Trump rallies, under the ""no king"" banner are scheduled across the country Saturday, with dozens set for Maryland. (Photo by Sophie Park/Getty Images)For Ellie Rosenstock, the “No Kings” protest she is helping organize in Baltimore’s Patterson Park is as much about activists showing their support for each other as it is about showing their opposition to President Donald Trump and his policies.
“We want people to know that they are not alone, that they are represented, and even if we’re not all the same, we’re a broad coalition, and we’re going to be there for each other,” said Rosenstock, who was motivated to found Indivisible Baltimore last fall after Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump.
On Saturday, Rosenstock’s chapter of Indivisible — a national organization dedicated to opposing Trump and his policies — will be hosting one of an estimated 2,000 No Kings events that have been organized in communities across the U.S. More than 40 are planned across Maryland, from Friendsville to Elkton to Salisbury.
The protests come in response to rising numbers of warrantless immigration raids, Trump administration cuts to federal funding and jobs, reductions to health care spending and more, many of which Trump has tried to enact by executive order, circumventing Congress and the courts. In a statement Thursday, “No Kings” organizers said the protests aim to “reject authoritarian overreach.”
Rosenstock said the Baltimore event will be nonviolent and consist of speeches from local politicians, comedians, performances from singers and a peaceful march. It will be a “lovely, beautiful, beautiful day,” she said.
Organizers say thousands of Maryland residents are expected to gather across the state Saturday at dozens of these protests. Sites include Annapolis, Columbia, Bethesda, Silver Spring and Frederick, and the events will range from large protests to small gatherings to wave signs at highway overpasses.
Tanks, choppers descend on D.C. in prep for Army anniversary parade, Trump birthday

The date of the “nationwide day of defiance” was chosen to coincide with Trump’s planned military parade in Washington, D.C. to mark the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army’s founding. Saturday also happens to be Trump’s 79th birthday.
There will be no protest in Washington, D.C., organizers said, because they want to draw attention away from the city and the controversial parade. What is considered the flagship No Kings event is scheduled for Philadelphia.
Ruben Amaya, president of the Young Democrats of Maryland, said Trump’s military parade this Saturday is no way to honor democratic values.
“There’s better ways for us to show you know how great our country is than through a display of military force,” he said.
The planned demonstrations come just days after Trump deployed 700 Marines and mobilized more than 4,000 California National Guard troops to crack down on protests in downtown Los Angeles against an increase of ICE raids throughout the city.
The Maryland Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative state lawmakers, issued a statement Friday urging state and local leaders to take measures to ensure that the protests on Saturday do not “devolve into the same kind of chaos,” as in Los Angeles.
“What began as protests around ICE actions in Los Angeles has spiraled into riots, assaults, and destruction,” Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County), the caucus’s vice chair, said in the statement. “We support the right to protest peacefully, but no Marylander should have to fear for their family’s safety or their livelihood because of mob violence.”
In a statement on Wednesday, the Maryland State Police said it is in “constant contact” with other law enforcement partners regarding potential demonstrations this weekend, and will work to “address any public safety concerns while respecting the public’s First Amendment rights.”
No Kings organizers say they are dedicated to nonviolence. Weapons of any kind are banned from the events, and it says attendees are expected to  “seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events.”
Several organizers said that since the beginning of the second Trump administration, they’ve seen an uptick in grassroots activism.
Rosenstock said that since founding Indivisible Baltimore with just five people in January, the organization has grown to more than 2,000.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Tom Glancy, a co-organizer for the Baltimore County-based Allies for Democracy, said that “doing nothing is not an option.”
“We can’t cede the field to Trump and his allies, because they’ll just push things as far as they can,” Glancy said. “We need to step up, and one of the ways we do this is with these marches.”
Glancy, a retired attorney, said that over time, he thinks the movement’s message of anti-authoritarianism will prevail.
Amaya said in-person demonstrations, like “No Kings” protests, are often when people realize the power of community. Voices are stronger when they’re united, he added.
“The people have the power,” he said. “Not just one man who has a big ego.”
The Annapolis “No Kings” protest, according to Chesapeake Indivisible facilitator Eric Burg, had more than 250 people signed up as of Thursday, but attendance is usually two to five times greater than how many people are registered.
The protest, which Burg said will be held at the Annapolis Mall so attendees can be safe and spread out, is not going to be civil disobedience in “any way, shape or form. This is just us expressing our First Amendment rights.”
“The most important thing we can do is not relinquish our humanity, not relinquish our compassion, not comply in advance,” he said.
Burg said many people may be unable or unwilling to go out and protest, but the goal is to make it part of the national conversation.
“Protest has been a part of America before it was a country,” he said. “We’re keeping it peaceful, and we want to make sure that it’s accessible, and, most importantly, force people to have that conversation.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2210417859-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 19:05:35.703960

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Four new film productions are headed for Utah and will receive a tax credit under the state’s film incentive program, including a “Yellowstone” spinoff and a new season of “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch.” 
That’s according to the Utah Film Commission, which made the announcement on Friday. The four productions will generate an estimated economic impact of about $57.4 million and more than 380 jobs, with filming set to take place in Salt Lake, Summit, Wasatch and Uintah counties. 
The “Yellowstone” spinoff — titled “Y: Marshals” — is the latest addition to the popular series that drew millions of viewers and was partly filmed in Utah. But after filming three seasons in the Beehive State, the production packed up and relocated to Montana, where it was offered a better tax break. That loss contributed to lawmakers expanding the state’s film incentive for rural productions. 
“Y: Marshals” will star Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton, continuing the arc of his “Yellowstone” character as a member of the U.S. Marshalls. Production will begin in Summit County this fall, and the show has a $52 million budget. 
“Utah is such a draw for film and television because of its diverse landscapes, fantastic crews, and amazing, knowledgeable film office,” said Adam Morra, vice president of planning and finance for Paramount Global, in a statement. “There is no doubt, though, the film incentive is a vital and necessary part of the package.”

The seventh season of “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch” will also receive a tax credit under the state’s rural film incentive program. Focused on the notorious Skinwalker Ranch in Uintah County, the History Channel show follows researchers who explore the ranch’s reported paranormal activity. It has a $3.2 million budget. 
Filmed in Wasatch and Summit counties with a $1.8 million budget, “Keep Coming Back” is the third production to receive incentives under the state’s rural film program. It’s an independent film from director and producer Mark Rosman, who said the tax incentives, experienced film crews and proximity to Los Angeles made Utah a draw. 
“When it came to picking a state to shoot the film, it was natural to look at Utah,” Rosman said in a statement. 
And the new competition show “Freshman Inventors” will receive a rebate under the Utah Community Film Incentive Program. With plans to film in Salt Lake County with a $300,000 budget, the Netflix show highlights Gen Z inventors. 
The Utah Motion Picture Incentive Program currently offers a refundable tax credit up to 25% for funds spent in the state, with different sums of money set aside for productions that meet certain criteria. The rural film incentive — which “Y: Marshals,” “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch” and “Keep Coming Back” qualified for — sets aside $12 million per year for projects that spend at least 75% of production days in a rural county. 
The community film incentive program is a 20% post-performance cash rebate for projects that originate in Utah. It’s aimed at helping smaller productions with budgets between $100,000 to $500,000, and is meant to promote up-and-coming local filmmakers, according to Utah Film Studios.

The shared information, including names, addresses, and social security numbers, is from California, Illinois and Washington D.C., on top of Washington state, according to the Associated Press. This comes as the Trump administration seeks to ramp up deportations.
Washington provides benefits that mirror Medicaid to immigrants in the U.S. without legal authorization. Enrollment is capped based on available funding, and only state dollars are used to pay for the program. The other states with data handed over offer similar benefits.
The agency that runs Washington’s Medicaid program, known as Apple Health, wasn’t sure “what information was disclosed or how it may have been used.”
“We’ve seen the reports and are deeply concerned about the potential misuse of personal health information belonging to Washington Apple Health clients,” state Health Care Authority spokesperson Katie Pope said in an email on Friday. 
“We are currently working closely with the Governor’s Office and the Attorney General’s Office to understand the scope of what occurred, including what data from Washington has been shared and how many individuals may have been affected,” Pope continued.
As of this spring, nearly 2 million Washington residents were enrolled in Apple Health, including over 850,000 children.
Medicaid, primarily funded by the federal government and run by the states, provides health insurance to low-income residents. 
Federal law prohibits noncitizens from accessing Medicaid, but states can shell out money for programs that cover immigrants. Washington state lawmakers this year earmarked $150 million for this purpose, enough to continue coverage for about 13,000 people. 
California and Illinois have moved to freeze or shut down their similar programs. Republicans in Congress have proposed reductions in federal Medicaid reimbursements for states that provide this kind of coverage to immigrants.
In a statement, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said, “President Trump consistently promised to protect Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries.”
“To keep that promise after Joe Biden flooded our country with tens of millions of illegal aliens CMS and DHS are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans,” McLaughlin continued.
In light of a February executive order from President Donald Trump, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services late last month announced it was reviewing state Medicaid data to ensure federal funds weren’t being used on immigrants without legal status. 
“Medicaid is not, and cannot be, a backdoor pathway to subsidize open borders,” Mehmet Oz, the agency’s administrator, said in a statement at the time. “States have a duty to uphold the law and protect taxpayer funds.”
California, Washington and Illinois shared information about noncitizens receiving health coverage, according to the AP, citing a June 6 memo.
“Protecting the privacy of our Apple Health clients is core to our mission, and we take these concerns very seriously,” said Pope, of the Health Care Authority. “We’ll continue to coordinate with state and federal partners to determine the facts and will take appropriate action as we learn more.”
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are within the Department of Health and Human Services, run by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose advisers ordered the Medicaid data shared with the Department of Homeland Security, the AP reported Friday. They reportedly shared the information despite pushback from federal Medicaid officials.
The sharing came as federal immigration agents conducted immigration raids in California that led to protests.

Lawrence McClure, left, and Senate budget chief Sen. Ed Hooper, right, answer budget questions on June 13, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Amid looming federal cuts, legislators finalized the state spending plan for the next fiscal year Friday, announcing they expect to take a final vote on the budget Monday evening.
As of Friday evening, the budget had not been printed, but Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ed Hooper, R-Clearwater, told reporters the spending plan is about $500 million less than what Gov. Ron DeSantis’ proposed $115.6 billion budget for state fiscal year 2025-26.
Friday marked the 102nd day of this year’s legislative session, which was extended because of the legislative leaders’ failure to pass a budget. Disagreements over the size of the budget and what approach to take on tax cuts created a rift that pushed lawmakers to come back to Tallahassee to pass a budget before June 30 to avoid a government shutdown.
House Budget Committee Chair Lawrence McClure, R-Dover, said the debate took longer than it should have, but put the blame in part on special sessions on immigration called prior to the start of the 2025 legislative session.
“That took a lot of bandwidth from both chambers, membership and staff. So I’m not excusing that we’re delayed in getting this budget done, but there were contributing factors that largely were out of the control of either chamber,” he said. “I’m glad we did the work on immigration. It was important work. But I’m thankful we were as thorough as we were,” on the budget.
Preparing for Congress fallout
McClure also stressed the leaner budget. He emphasized the $1.5 billion set for reserves over the next two fiscal years, which the GOP-led Legislature is touting as an answer for a potential recession. 
“For starters, it’s a smaller supplemental list than many years prior,” McClure said, adding, “we’ve put a bunch of recurring money in reserve stabilizing the long-term future.”
Lawmakers last dipped into the Budget Stabilization Fund, which currently has $4.4 billion, during the Great Recession.
Still, President Donald Trump’s plan to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Agency after this year’s hurricane season worried Hooper, he said. The Senate agreed to provide $23 million for the Florida State Guard — DeSantis had requested $62 million — keeping in mind the civilian volunteer force’s role in responding to emergencies. 
“We heard yesterday that, from our friends in Washington, after this hurricane season, there may be no more FEMA,” Hooper said. “We may be on our own someday, and that would not be the time to start thinking about what should we plan ahead. … Just the state guard is an important part of making sure our state has the resources because the National Guard; it could be called anywhere.”
The Florida State Guard has mainly been part of DeSantis’ messaging against illegal immigration, particularly in sending troops to Texas’ southern border.
Hooper also expressed concerns about the multi-billion-dollar cut to Medicaid that Congress could enact. About 44% of federal funds coming into the state are for Medicaid. 
“We hope they never change the formula of the Medicaid reimbursement,” he said. “We’re in trouble if they do.”

Legislators earmarked nearly $560 million for local projects important to members. The supplemental funding was included on so-called sprinkle lists the chambers released Friday.  But those hundreds of millions went to more than local projects.
The powerful nursing home industry was able to secure significant Medicaid rate increases for long-term care facilities on both the House and Senate sprinkle lists. In the aggregate, the chambers agreed to a $176 million hike, of which about $18 million is recurring.  That’s on top of a near $110 million rate increase the chambers had already agreed to put in the budget.
The increase in funds is expected to be coupled with new requirements on nursing homes that will be addressed in separate legislation, known as the conforming bill. It will be one of a spate of issues contained in SB 2514 the health care conforming bill.
The House targeted $23.3 million in state and federal funds to a Medicaid managed care program for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The program is a priority of House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, who pushed this year to take the small pilot program available in two Medicaid regions statewide.
Farmers Feeding Florida
Republican Senate President Ben Albritton, of Wachula, had to give up his dreams for a $200 million “Rural Renaissance” to invest in the state’s underdeveloped and economically challenged communities. But he managed to keep most of the money for tackling food insecurity. 
Before budget negotiations fell apart earlier in the year, the Senate’s budget included two grant programs through the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services: $12 million to expand the infrastructure of food banks in rural communities, and another $38 million to help food banks buy products from Florida farmers. 
In this final deal, Albritton gets to keep $10 million for food bank infrastructure and $28 million for farmers to feed communities. Food bank networks across the state counted on this investment following the loss of millions in federal funds they used to buy fresh produce.
Education
The Senate included in its sprinkle list $300,000 for an “Intellectual Freedom Survey,” half for the State University System and half for the Florida College System. The survey is meant to “compile and analyze the annual intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity survey.”
The House included $7.5 million for Florida Polytechnic University to increase its enrollment to 3,000 students. Its fall 2024 enrollment was more than 1,770. 
The chambers agreed to fund $42.4 million to Florida State University for operational funding, the most of any institution. Florida International University would receive $35 million under the proposed budget for operation enhancement. 
Between the two chambers’ sprinkle lists, $10 million has been allocated to security for Jewish day schools.
In its Friday offer, the Senate rejected a House proposal to require private universities to meet performance metrics to accept scholarships for in-state students. 
The House included in its sprinkle list $4 million for Florida State University, half for the newly created Institute for Pediatric Rare Diseases and half for Sunshine Genetics Pilot Program. 
Delivering for DeSantis
In the sprinkle list, the Senate was more amenable to DeSantis’ requests. 
Aside from including funds for the State Guard, the upper chamber also included $25 million for the Florida Job Growth Grant Fund, an initiative to encourage public infrastructure projects. In total, the budget includes $50 million out of the $75 million in DeSantis’ proposed budget. 
Cancer funding has been a priority for the DeSantis administration which pushed this year for a number of changes to how the state funds cancer research. 
While the DeSantis administration fell short on its efforts to redirect $127 million in cancer funds it did succeed on other fronts. The Legislature agreed to appropriate $50 million for a research incubator for cancer and another $60 million increase in innovation funds awarded by the First Lady Casey DeSantis as part of her cancer initiative.
More work to do
The budget is complete but the tax reduction plan is not.
Legislators are also expected to hammer out a tax cut package that will include a reduction in business rent taxes as well as other changes designed to assist Florida families.
While the chambers have agreed to spending levels and the fine print that goes along with how the money should be spent they still haven’t finalized the conforming bills. The Legislature is using budget conforming bills to pass substantive policy. Unlike the budget, which expires in a year, conforming bills change statutes.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Democratic members of the Colorado congressional delegation criticized a recent proposal by U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, to allow the federal government to sell off more than 2 million acres of public land. The proposal covers 11 Western states, including Colorado.
Introduced Wednesday, the proposal would target “underused” public lands to sell for housing development, roads, water infrastructure and other projects, according to Lee. During a remote news conference Friday, the proposal drew disapproval from U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, as well as Reps. Joe Neguse of Lafayette, Jason Crow of Centennial and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood. 
“(This proposal) is a five alarm fire for hunters, for fishermen, for conservationists, for recreationists and for everyday Colorado folks who enjoy these lands and who are committed to preserving them for future generations,” Neguse said. “The fact that they are potentially trying to auction off these lands to pay for President (Donald) Trump’s reckless tax agenda, tax cuts for billionaires and large corporations, in my view, is shameful.”
Neguse represents Colorado’s 2nd Congressional District, 60% of which is made up of public lands.

Lee’s proposal would insert the public lands sell-off measure into the GOP “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill, which was passed by the House and is now before the Senate. Under the proposal, state and local governments would have priority to purchase the federal lands, and areas that already have a designation — like national parks, national monuments and mining claim sites — would be safe from sale. 
Public lands advocates fear for Colorado’s national parks under Trump budget proposals

Colorado is home to 23 million acres of federal public lands, which play a significant role in many local economies. Sarah Shrader, the president of the Grand Valley Outdoor Recreation Coalition in Grand Junction, called on Congress to save Colorado’s public lands from sale.
“These lands must remain protected, accessible and managed for the benefit of everyone, not just a few,” Shrader said. “It’s an economic imperative, an environmental responsibility and a moral commitment to future generations.”
Tony Prendergast, a hunting guide and rancher based in Crawford, pointed to the widespread support of his community for the protection of public lands, regardless of their political affiliation.
“There’s nothing like this issue that will fire up people like me to get involved politically,” Prendergast said. “The depth of the anger I feel, and the disappointment in those elected officials who are putting this proposal forward and those who will support this, is intense for me.”
After bipartisan opposition to a recent public land sale proposal in the House, the plan was axed. Bennet said he hopes there will be enough common ground to defeat the Senate proposal through continued negotiations. 
“Public lands make Colorado, Colorado,” Bennet said. “They make the West, the West. They’re the foundation of our economy, and they represent treasured parts of our culture, our geography and our history.”

What’s next?,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/wildlife-outdoors/sunday-hunting-proposal-passes-pa-house-whats-next/,Sen. Greg Rothman is expecting a debate and discussion on the topic in the Game and Fisheries Committee in the near future.,"A hunter walks across a field. (Getty Images)For the second year in a row, a proposal to repeal Pennsylvania’s Sunday hunting prohibition passed the state House in bipartisan fashion this week. After Wednesday’s vote, a bevy of organizations have weighed in with some arguing it’s past time to end the ban, while others say it would be a step backwards for the outdoor experience in Pennsylvania.
As the debate moves to the Senate, a key committee chair told the Capital-Star he’s still evaluating House Bill 1431, but the legislation advancing seems like good news. Senate Game and Fisheries Committee Chairperson Greg Rothman (R-Cumberland) said he expects to have a debate and vote on it in the near future.
“I think it’s an idea that’s time has come,” Rothman told the Capital-Star on Thursday. “Other states allow it. What we want to be doing as a state government is to promote hunting and make it as accessible as possible, especially to working families and to younger people.”
“And I think Sunday (hunting) gives them more opportunities,” he added. “So the more opportunities to hunt gets more hunters, and helps us keep this great tradition alive in Pennsylvania.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The sale of hunting licenses generated more than $59 million in revenue for the Game Commission last year.
Rothman said he supports Sen. Dan Laughlin’s (R-Erie) proposal to end the ban and believes that proposal would have the support in the chamber. Rothman said state Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny) assured him the language in her proposal is the same in Laughlin’s. While the bill proposed by Laughlin also has the support of Sen. James Malone (D-Lancaster), the minority chair of the Senate Game and Fisheries Committee, Rothman wants to go over the details of Steele’s proposal to see if it can also pass the chamber. 
An ‘archaic’ law
Steele described the state’s ban as “archaic” and “not based in the reality of today.”
Pennsylvania expanded Sunday hunting in 2019 when Gov. Tom Wolf signed a law to allow hunting on three Sundays each year: One during archery season, one during rifle season, and one Sunday selected by the Game Commission. Laughlin also led that effort.
Prior to the 2019 expansion, hunting had been mostly illegal on Sundays for over 200 years under the state’s Blue Laws, which stem from the Quaker foundations of the commonwealth and barred certain activities on the sabbath.
“It’s a law that most states have eliminated long ago,” Steele said during debate on the House floor, noting that with a Monday to Friday workweek, most people only have Saturday to hunt. “Not being able to hunt on Sundays creates major hurdles for busy families. It’s a significant barrier for working people.”
Steele described herself as “not a typical hunter” and someone who did not grow up learning to hunt. But she spent a lot of time outdoors and later picked it up as an adult and mother of four children. She said she’s been welcomed into the hunting community wholeheartedly.
“It has been a gratifying experience,” Steele said.
Her proposal is backed by the Pennsylvania Game Commission, Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen and Conservationists, Hunter Nation, Hunters United for Sunday Hunting, and Backcountry Hunters & Anglers.
The Game Commission celebrated the bill advancing Wednesday, issuing a statement referencing a number of reasons that it backs the measure.
“Though hunters play an active role in helping to manage wildlife populations through the purchase of their licenses and other revenue they generate, they also fund wildlife conservation at a larger scale, for all species,” Game Commission Executive Director Steve Smith said. “For those reasons and others, it’s important to keep hunters engaged and providing the valuable service they do. These bills would help accomplish that.”
“One of the biggest reasons hunters stop hunting is a lack of time,” he added. “While no one can add hours to the day or days to the week, removing the prohibition on Sunday hunting holds the potential to add significantly more time to the hunting calendar and keep hunters hunting.”

The Pennsylvania Farm Bureau said expanding hunting could help reduce crop damage across the state by better managing deer populations. The bill would require at least one member of the Game Commission’s Board of Commissioners to have an agriculture background.
The bill passed by a 131-72 vote on Wednesday, with support from most Democrats. Republicans were more divided on the matter.
The House unanimously approved an amendment to H.B. 1431, to restore the hunting rights of people charged with trespassing immediately upon their acquittal or dismissal of the charges. Other amendments were rejected, including one defeated along party lines that would move the first day of deer hunting season to the Monday after Thanksgiving.
The debate around Sunday hunting in Pennsylvania is far from new.
Last session, the House passed Steele’s bill to repeal the Sunday hunting ban by a 129-73 vote. That bill did not advance in the Senate.
Concerns remain among some lawmakers and organizations
Rep. David Maloney, minority chairperson of the House Game and Fisheries Committee, opposed H.B. 1431 and argued that it is “not a simple Sunday hunting piece of legislation.”
Touting his experience with hunting from a young age, Maloney said the bill would have “unintended consequences.” The problems Maloney had with the proposal included the language regarding trespassing penalties, the requirement for a member of the agriculture community to be on the Game Commission Board, the power given to farmers to hunt deer, and negative impacts on waterfowl hunters.
He also said he doesn’t buy the supporters’ argument about free time. Maloney said since he began hunting at age 12, the opportunities to hunt throughout the year have more than doubled.
Maloney also said he believes the bill is unconstitutional because it violates the requirement that legislation must be limited to a single subject. For that reason, Maloney said he doesn’t believe the Senate would consider it or Gov. Josh Shapiro would sign it.
Rep. Greg Vitali (D-Delaware), one of the three Democrats who did not vote in support of H.B. 1431, said the Pennsylvania chapter of the Sierra Club, the Keystone Trails Association, and the Pennsylvania Parks and Forest Foundation oppose the bill.
Jen Quinn, legislative and political director for the Pennsylvania Chapter of the Sierra Club, told the Capital-Star the organization supports hunting and effective management of the deer population, but cited a number of concerns she has with the proposal.
“Our concern is that when people know there are hunters in the woods, are they going to stay out?” Quinn said.
She noted that it is relatively safe to be in the woods with hunters, but there are people who may decide to stay home instead of enjoying the outdoors when hunters are out.
Quinn also said she doesn’t think the legislation would address the problem of deer overpopulation and the decline in hunting licenses.
“I doubt adding one more day will fix this, because the state did add three Sundays a few years ago, and it didn’t reverse that trend,” Quinn said. She also said that the organization supports phasing out lead ammunition, arguing that it is harmful to wildlife.
Brook Lenker, executive director of the Keystone Trails Association, said the organization was disappointed that H.B. 1431 passed the House, even though it anticipated it might move on to the Senate. He’s holding out hope that the Senate won’t pass the bill.
“We just feel that additional Sundays open to hunting has the potential to erode quality hiking opportunities on Pennsylvania’s trails … a lot of hiking occurs on weekends,” Lenker told the Capital-Star.
What’s next? 
Steele or Laughlin’s proposal would have to receive a vote in the Senate Game and Fisheries Committee before it could advance to a full vote in the chamber.
The Senate is slated to return to session on Monday, June 23. 
Earlier this year, both Steele and Laughlin, who are leading the efforts in their respective chambers again this session, told the Capital-Star that they were optimistic the bill could get across the finish line.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hunter-field-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 18:01:22.721956

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)A budget plan is taking shape and the clock is ticking.
Maine Morning Star will have regular updates as the committee tasked with setting that plan, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, takes straw votes on what to include ahead of a final vote on the budget proposal to be sent to the Maine Senate and House of Representatives for consideration.
Legislative leaders have said the intention is to complete all work by June 18, what had been the statutory adjournment date for the first regular session. Though, the Legislature is now in a special session, without a formal deadline.
In March, the Democratic majority pushed through a roughly $11.3 billion, two-year budget plan without Republican support and formally adjourned in order to start the clock for those funds to become available in 90 days. 
Senate Republicans refused to back an alternative short-term plan that would have immediately filled the current deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, because it did not include structural reform to the program.
The budget that did pass continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing one-time funding for MaineCare and other urgent needs. But it didn’t include any of the policy changes Gov. Janet Mills proposed, such as tax increases and program cuts, to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
These proposals and others from lawmakers are now being weighed by the appropriations committee as it crafts the next iteration of the budget.

Committee yet to convene


By: Emma Davis - Friday June 13, 2025 5:30 pm


















As of 5:30 p.m. on Friday, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee has yet to meet on microphone to set the budget plan, after scheduling a work session for 9 a.m.

Adding streaming tax, upping cannabis tax and continuing free community college


By: Emma Davis - Thursday June 12, 2025 10:23 pm


















Returning on microphone after 9 p.m. Thursday night, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee voted to include several additional taxes proposed by Gov. Janet Mills in the budget, including a tax on streaming services and increasing the sales tax on cannabis. However, the committee included a smaller amount than the governor suggested to continue funding free community college. 
The committee voted 7-4 to include Mills’ proposed new 5.5% tax on streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. 
The committee also voted 8-4 to increase the sales tax on adult use cannabis from 10% to 14%, while reducing the cannabis excise tax rates by one-third. This was not a party-line vote. Rep. Kristen Cloutier (D-Lewiston), who co-chairs the Taxation Committee, said she was not in favor of this initiative.
“I’ve been in contact with some folks who are in the cannabis industry in my district and they have really advocated loudly against this,” Cloutier said. 
With these decisions made, the committee has now decided on what to include, and not include, out of Mills’ major tax proposals. 
In addition to the streaming and cannabis taxes, earlier Thursday the committee rolled back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes and increased the cigarette excise tax at an even higher amount than Mills requested. However, the committee rejected her suggested taxes on ambulances and pharmacies.
Most debate surrounded including funding to continue Maine’s Free College Scholarship, which the committee decided to fund but at a reduced amount. 
Rather than include the $12.5 million per year sought by the governor, the committee voted 9-3 to fund the program at $10 million per year through the next biennium. 
“We’ve had to make hard decisions about what we think we can afford, not afford, and we’re supportive but we believe that they’ll be able to address a need with $10 million a year,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.
However, to help guide decisions about continuing the program beyond that, the committee will be writing a letter to the community colleges requesting recommendations on eligibility requirements, out-of-state student funding, economy of scale and estimated future funding. 
“We had promised nights that would not be long,” committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said at 10:10 p.m. “We have just a little bit to finish up, but we will do that in the morning.” The committee is scheduled to reconvene at 9 a.m.

Budget gets bump from a “large and unusual” payment


By: Emma Davis -  5:33 pm


















The Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee announced Thursday afternoon the state has come into more cash that can be added to the budget. The additional funds are from some state agencies seeing unexpected surpluses this fiscal year. It also comes from two significant estate payments.
The majority of the committee moved all of this funding into the budget plan with 8-4 votes. 
Since the most recent revenue forecast in May, Maine received two “large and unusual” estate payments, Kirsten Figueroa, commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, told the appropriations committee Thursday afternoon. This now puts the estate tax line well above what was initially expected.
“Does that mean two people passed and this is where this money came from?” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) asked.
“I do,” Figueroa responded.  
The way this funding, $24 million, will be added to the budget is also unusual, because technically the money isn’t real until the fiscal year ends on June 30. But ultimately it will be used to pay for part of the $122 million in MaineCare funding for fiscal year 2027 that the committee voted into the budget on Wednesday. 
The majority of the committee also voted into the budget millions of dollars that various departments are not planning to use up by the end of the fiscal year. Among those funds are $4.5 million from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Behavioral Health and $5 million from the Office of Disability Services.
“I would rather keep the money in the account and have it be used for what it should be used for, rather than going to the general fund, which by going into the general fund, is essentially funding MaineCare,” Fredette said.

Committee saves money by rolling back funding for mental health programs, pensions


By: Emma Davis -  12:27 pm


















While not sticking to its stated start time, the appropriations committee returned Thursday morning to take more straw votes to work toward a complete budget plan. The committee plans to return throughout the day for more votes.
Mental health
Following the deadliest mass shooting in Maine history in 2023, the state put significant resources into bolstering mental health support. However, faced with the current deficit, the appropriations committee opted to reduce some of those programs.
On Tuesday, the committee approved funding for crisis receiving centers in Penobscot and Androscoggin counties but on Thursday voted out money for these centers in Kennebec and Aroostook counties.
In the supplemental budget last year, the governor signed into law funding to develop these crisis receiving centers following the Lewiston shooting. When presenting her two-year budget plan back in January, Mills argued it was not financially feasible to build all of the centers she had hoped. 
Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison raised concern about walking back on these commitments and said the centers were a point of rare bipartisan agreement last year, though the overall budget was passed mostly along party lines with Democrats in favor. 
“As someone who actually voted for the funding for this in the previous budget, this is a difficult cut for me to accept,” said committee co-chair Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook). 
Regarding Aroostook County in particular, Gattine said he spoke with the Department of Health and Human Services, whose representatives think that this specific model might not be the best for that rural area, so they may suggest an alternative crisis model in the future. 
The committee also removed funding for 24 mental health law enforcement liaisons to support mental health crisis intervention, and mobile response services.
The majority of the appropriations committee also voted to make cuts to various mental health services.
The committee voted 7-5 to provide county jails $4 million for medication assisted treatment to address drug dependency in fiscal year 2026, but did not include funding for the following year, which Gattine explained could be revisited in a supplemental budget next year. The committee also reduced funding for employee recruitment and retention of staff that provide medication management services within the Office of Behavioral Health.
Mills proposed a number of reductions to the overall state budget, focusing on new programs  that had not yet been fully started. While Gattine again reiterated the cuts are not something he takes lightly, he said, “I really came back to the fact that the baseline of MaineCare, everything that we have funded, provides millions and billions of dollars of support for behavioral health needs. I don’t think we support those needs enough. I’m hoping we can continue to do things to support the needs of people with behavioral health needs.”
Pensions 
Another area where the majority of the committee proposed to save money is rolling back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes.
The committee voted 8-5 to incorporate Mills’ proposal to phase-out a current deduction offered for nonmilitary pensions, though changed the thresholds. 
Mills proposed a phase-out beginning with income over $100,000 for individuals, $150,000 for heads of households and $200,000 for married individuals filing jointly. But the committee backed phase outs starting at $125,000 for individuals, $187,500 for heads of household, and $250,000 for joint filers. 
“The money that we’re taking belongs to them,” Rep. Mark Blier (R-Buxton) said in protest. “It doesn’t belong to us.”
Paid Family and Medical Leave 
The committee voted 7-5 to include funding the governor proposed to help cover the costs of the community college system, Maine Maritime Academy and the University of Maine System for the state-supported positions related to the new Paid Family and Medical Leave Program, which took effect on Jan. 1. 
However, the committee reduced the allocations Mills suggested for the university system, which Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, said it was because the system negotiated with a company that is allowing them to get premiums to cover some of the cost. 
Amid the voting, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) wanted to specify that this is one-time funding to cover the initial cost of the paid family leave program, after Republicans raised concerns about the state being on the hook. The committee ultimately incorporated that note.
“So you are going to take the lollipop away from the baby,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “I’m anxious to see that. Thank you.”
Additional decisions
The majority of the committee also approved an increase from $5 to $7 for fishing license fees. 
Also, following the request of the Legislative Council, which is made up of the ten elected members of leadership, the committee agreed to incorporate several temporary legislative positions, though did not go so far as to make them permanent.

Increased cigarette tax, rejected child care cuts, funded MaineCare


By: Emma Davis - Wednesday June 11, 2025 10:50 pm


















The budget took more of a shape Wednesday night, though, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said, “we are determined to get this budget done in the daylight,” so the committee is reconvening at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. 
Substantial decisions were made Wednesday night when the committee reconvened, including increasing Maine’s cigarette tax more than Gov. Janet Mills’ had proposed, rejecting Mills’ proposed cuts to child care worker stipends and Head Start, and adding funding for MaineCare. 
When Mills first proposed her budget in January, a key component she highlighted to address the deficit was her plan to raise revenue through a $1 increase in the cigarette excise tax — from $2 per pack to $3 — and corresponding increases to the excise tax on other tobacco-related products.
The majority of the appropriations committee voted 8-4 to increase it by $1.50.
Since Mills released her proposal, Republicans have been steadfast about their opposition to raising this tax, and to tax increases of any kind. On Wednesday those in the minority party on the committee again made that stance clear.
“I was shocked when the governor came out with the original proposed tax increase on the cigarettes of a buck,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said, “and now to throw it up to a buck and a half. I see in my opinion, with all due respect to everyone around this horseshoe, a lack of ability to make tough decisions on where we’re going to spend money in this state.”
When Mills presented her proposal back in January, she touted it as a way to help generate revenue while simultaneously reducing public health costs in the long-term by disincentivizing people to smoke. Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln) highlighted that goal in voicing her support for upping the tax, stating that her stepfather recently died of cancer caused by cigarettes.
But Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester) countered, “I don’t feel like it’s responsible to base our budget on revenue that we hope will go down.”
The majority of the committee, voting 7-5, subsequently approved about $122 million for MaineCare, filling a gap left in the initial two-year budget passed in March that did not include MaineCare funding for the second year of the biennium. 
“I do believe we should pay our bills, but we also had reforms to hopefully reduce that amount that we’re paying,” Arata said, referring to proposals to implement work requirements and other reforms to the program that failed to be included in the supplemental budget for the current fiscal year. “Therefore, I can’t support this motion.”  
The majority almost entirely rejected the governor’s proposed cuts related to child care programs, with one exception. 
Voting 7-5 again, the committee removed from the budget plan Mills’ proposal to reverse the state’s recent investments in child care by reducing worker stipends by $30 million to bring them back to 2022 levels. With the same vote breakdown, the committee also rejected Mills’ proposal to cut funding for Head Start by $7 million. 
That same majority also rejected a proposed $2.5 million cut in fiscal year 2026 to the child care employment award program, which includes child care staff in the Maine Child Care affordability program, however the committee chose to remove funding for the award program in 2027. 
“This was styled as a two-year pilot program, so our intent is to continue the pilot program in 2026, not provide funding for it in fiscal year 2027 at this time,” said Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “We’ll have a chance to evaluate that next year when we reconvene.”  
Although a budget-neutral move, one decision Wednesday night received praise from Republicans. 
Mills proposed elevating the current Governor’s Energy Office to a cabinet-level department in her budget plan but the committee removed that change Wednesday, in light of a separate bill moving through the Legislature that seeks to do that. 
“I appreciate the fact that we are letting this kind of an initiative be debated as it should be in the policy committees and brought to the floor for a vote,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison.

Preserving Maine State Grant Program


By: Emma Davis -  3:58 pm


















Wednesday morning the appropriations committee made a number of reductions to the governor’s proposed funding for various departments. Returning briefly just after 3 p.m., the majority of its members chose to again reject a proposal from Mills, following requests from private higher education institutions. 
Currently, all Maine public and private universities, colleges and technical schools that administer federal financial aid, such as the Pell Grant and Direct Loans, are eligible for something called the Maine State Grant Program, which provides need-based assistance.
The governor proposed cutting Maine’s private colleges from the program, which educators and students pushed back on during the public hearing. The Education and Cultural Affairs Committee also requested the change be rejected. The appropriations committee followed suit Wednesday voting the change out of the plan 8-2. 
“Stay tuned,” appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said after the afternoon votes. “We will be back later. I’m not quite sure when but we will be back.”

Mobile home program funded while judiciary requests pared down


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 10, 2025 6:50 pm


















Indicative of the lack of sleep and long hours legislators are working, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) accidentally called a vote as unanimous as the committee met while the Senate was still in session Tuesday afternoon. 
The mishap was met with laughs as it was bookended by votes on a number of items — none of which were unanimous. 
The majority of the committee backed one-time funding — a transfer of $3 million from the unappropriated surplus of the general fund to the Maine State Housing Authority — for the manufactured and mobile home park preservation and assistance program. This was a request in a bill that passed the chambers but was placed on the appropriations table. 
There are currently more than 100 bills on this table, which is managed by the appropriations committee. Bills that cost money that hasn’t already been allocated are placed here to vie for remaining unappropriated funding — or, as evidenced by this case, could instead be included in the budget plan. 
After the committee sets the budget, one of its final acts will be to “run the table” and decide which of the remaining bills will receive funds.
Other items added into the plan include one-time funding to upgrade courtrooms with video conferencing technology. However, the committee also moved out numerous other proposals related to the judiciary, such as funding for new positions, resources and ​​increasing the number of jurors called to jury duty.
“I think we’re shortchanging the judiciary,” said Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport). 
Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee, said he believed many of the items the committee ultimately voted out were important. 
“I think by the time we’re done here, there will be over $20 million in new funding approved for them, and I hope the process is that they’re able to come back and we’re able to do more for them over time,” Gattine said.

A move to maximize federal match for free school meals


By: Emma Davis -  11:34 am


















Amid chamber work Tuesday morning, the majority of the Appropriations Committee voted in favor of a change aimed to maximize federal dollars for free school lunches in order to save the state an expected $2 million. 
After the COVID-19 pandemic, Maine became one of a handful of states to pass legislation making school meals free.
“[That] took away that stigma and took away that paperwork that was associated with individual families and individual students, so now everybody in the school district does qualify,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. “But we do have some school districts that have not enrolled in the program, so we’re not able to maximize the federal funding that’s available.”
After the committee voted to pay the difference between the federal reimbursement and full price of meals for schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program, Brennan introduced an amendment to require that in order for schools to get this state funding they must first enroll in the free meal program in a way that makes them eligible for the maximum money available at the federal level. The committee approved the change with a 9-2 straw vote. 
Much of the committee’s work has been approving, or rejecting, a number of state government positions. Republicans have continued to raise objections to expanding state government personnel. 
“I think one thing we can agree on is that it’s all a balance,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “And, maybe we balance things in different places, but finding the right balance is part of what this is all about.”

Another of Gov. Mills’ proposed taxes removed from plan


By: Emma Davis - Monday June 9, 2025 4:53 pm


















Monday morning at the State House began with more talk about taxes as the Appropriations Committee continued its line-by-lines votes on what to include in the budget. 
The majority of the committee voted to remove Mills’ proposed tax on ambulance services, which is one of several tax increases the governor proposed as a means to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
The tax on non-municipal ambulance service providers would have been equal to 6% of their net operating revenue, which the Mills administration said it would have used to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements.
While Republicans on the committee said they supported removing the tax — as the minority party has made clear it will not support tax increases of any kind — they questioned how the state will deal with those shortfalls and pay for additional spending the committee has approved. 
One example from Monday was reallocating the cost of an emergency coordinator position that is partially funded through federal expenditures to being completely supported by the general fund. 
“We’re moving positions and costs into the general fund, and my only question is, where is that money coming from?” Sen. Sue Bernard (R-Aroostook) asked. “Is it coming from more tax increases? Is it coming from cutting other programs that we haven’t gotten to yet, or what?”
Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin), who co-chairs the committee, responded, “As we build this budget, we will take care of that in one way or another so that the budget will balance at the end.” 
It is not yet clear whether the committee will support some of Mills’ other proposed taxes or the cuts she proposed to health and child care programs. So far, the committee also voted out a proposed pharmacy tax. 
Implications from federal funding cuts were also top of mind. 
The coordinator position was one of several that the committee readjusted to be more reliant on state funding, though Mills made those recommendations before President Donald Trump’s administration began rescinding congressionally appropriated funds. 
“We have talked about the fact that if federal funds disappear, positions disappear,” Rotundo said. 
But some concerns about federal funding predated Trump’s second term. During the public hearing for the budget bill, the Maine Emergency Management Agency said budget deficits related to federal funding had already resulted in the agency leaving two positions vacant. 
The committee voted to fund two positions fully with the general fund, after they’d previously been supported solely by federal dollars. 
“It was important to make sure that these positions were preserved and that it was worth the investment in additional general fund dollars,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), the other co-chair of the committee.

With less than two weeks left, lawmakers still debating budget plan


By: Emma Davis -  4:51 pm


















During the committee’s last meeting on Thursday, the majority of its members rejected a tax on Maine pharmacies the governor had proposed, while voting in favor of additional funding and rate reform for nursing homes. 
The pharmacy tax would have imposed a 70-cent tax on every outpatient prescription filled by Maine pharmacies, the revenue from which the Mills administration said it would use to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements. 
“I haven’t voted for any items,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison on Thursday. “Yet, this will be my first, because I believe that we already collect too much taxes.” 
With a 10-2 vote, other Republicans backed removing the tax too, though the holdouts noted that their opposition was because of a lack of clarity about the overall budget plan. 
“I applaud the work of the majority in terms of removing this,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “However, I will be consistent in reviewing the overall global budget in determining whether or not I will support it.” 
That sentiment was also shared ahead of the committee voting 9-3 in favor of $20 million in additional funding for nursing homes over the biennium. This includes a $6.5 million investment for rate reform to support the direct care workforce and incentivize permanent staff, which would in turn unlock $12.2 million in funding from the federal government. 
“Nursing home rate reform is very important to us, however at this particular time we have not had a discussion about where additional general funds come from that we’re going to need,” Ducharme said. “In order for me to support this, even though I would historically support something like this, I want to know where the money’s coming from.”
Other Republicans had a different take. While Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata of New Gloucester would also like to know where the funds are coming from, “I feel right about supporting this,” she said. “I might not support the entire package, but I feel better knowing that this is in there, ultimately.”

(Courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) OMAHA — Federal authorities on Friday announced the arrests Thursday of four protesters outside of an Omaha immigration raid conducted earlier this week, alleging that the four were “aggressive” and captured on video damaging federal property and threatening to assault law officers in relation to the raid at Glenn Valley Foods.
The statement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided no names. It said the protesters arrested are expected to face felony charges of “assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating or interfering with a federal officer while engaged in the performance of their official duties, as well as damaging government property.”
Video of a few people throwing rocks and others blocking law enforcement cars at the Tuesday raid site were widely circulated on social media.
“Many of these protesters claim to be fighting for justice, but instead they damaged property, threatened federal officers and agents and attempted to obstruct a lawful operation aimed at arresting individuals who exploited stolen identities to work illegally,” Todd Lyons, acting ICE Director, said in a statement.
Federal immigration raid hits Omaha plant

During the enforcement operation at Glenn Valley, immigration agents detained nearly 80 workers. It was the largest immigration enforcement operation in Nebraska since President Donald Trump took office with a pledge to carry out massive deportations.
Of the workers detained, ICE has said some had active local warrants, prior DUI convictions or had been previously deported. The agency said in a statement that many may now face additional federal charges: fraud and misuse of visas, permits and other documents; assaulting a federal officer; resisting arrest; illegal reentry; and/or misuse of Social Security numbers.
The investigation was conducted by ICE Homeland Security Investigations, with support from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the FBI, and a fraud unit from the Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles.
“Peaceful protest is a right protected under the Constitution, and our agents are proud to defend that right every day,” said Mark Zito, Special Agent in Charge of ICE HSI Kansas City, which covers Omaha. “But threats, violence and property damage by criminal actors claiming some kind of vigilante justice will not be tolerated.”

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Legislation that would prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use passed with bipartisan support in the Maine Legislature Friday, winning over many Republicans who generally were less supportive of  previous attempts to provide the Wabanaki Nations greater sovereignty. However, initial votes show that support may not be enough to override an expected veto from Gov. Janet Mills. 
With 11 Republicans joining the Democratic majority, the Maine House of Representatives voted 86-60 on Friday in favor of the bill, preceded by ample debate. The Senate followed suit with a 20-12 vote but no discussion. 
However, a two-thirds vote in both chambers would be needed to override a veto. 
LD 958, which has bipartisan co-sponsors and received a favorable committee vote, would prohibit the state from exercising something called eminent domain on current trust and reservation land.
“This is an issue that small government conservatives and civil justice liberals can agree on,” bill sponsor House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) told Maine Morning Star. 
However, others in his caucus spoke against the bill during floor debate, highlighting that their opposition to this issue is attached to their overall opposition to tribal sovereignty efforts. 
“I cannot support this measure because I believe the issue is an issue to some degree less about eminent domain than it is about tribal sovereignty,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. Fredette went on to compare the Wabanaki Nations to states and municipalities. 
Governor opposed to latest change to Settlement Act backed by Wabanaki Nations

“Our states are not absolute sovereign from our federal government,” Fredette said. “Our towns are not absolute sovereign from the state in and the reality is that the tribes are not absolutely sovereign from the state of Maine.”
Most other federally recognized tribes are already afforded protection against states being able to seize tribal land for public use. However, the Wabanaki Nations are not, due to repercussions from the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. 
This land settlement agreement has resulted in the tribes being treated more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations like other federally recognized tribes. Overhauling this act in its entirety is the Wabanaki Nations’ broader goal for greater recognition of their sovereignty.
What would this bill do?
The U.S. government can seize private property for public use, a principle known as eminent domain, however that authority is restricted by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which requires just compensation for land taken, as well as some federal laws. 
In 1834, the federal Indian Nonintercourse Act prohibited land transactions with tribes unless authorized by Congress, but the Settlement Act specified that that federal law was not applicable to the Wabanaki Nations.
“As an ardent supporter of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights I stand opposed to the government taking people’s property through eminent domain,” Faulkingham said. “It is even more egregious to threaten seizure of property from sovereign tribes who have suffered from historic injustices of land seizures in the past.”
LD 958 would amend the Settlement Act to prohibit the state from exercising eminent domain on trust and reservation land, which is protected under federal law, though fee land — or private property for which the owner owns the title — would still be subject to the state taking.
The bill would also amend the 2023 Mi’kmaq Nation Restoration Act to make this change for the fourth Tribe of the Wabanaki Nations, the Mi’kmaq Nation, which wasn’t included in the Settlement Act.
“I feel like this is a no brainer,” Executive Director of the Wabanaki Alliance Maulian Bryant told Maine Morning Star. “We should have tribal land protected from state seizure, just like other tribes around the country.” 
Throughout committee consideration of the bill, it was amended to incorporate a proposed change from the Maine State Chamber of Commerce that the prohibition would only apply to current reservation and trust lands, and not land that may be put into trust in the future.
Each of the Wabanaki Nations are eligible to acquire up to 150,000 acres of trust land in specific areas identified in the Settlement Act. Several tribes have already acquired most of that. 
While the Judiciary Committee accepted that amendment, Passamaquoddy Tribal Rep. Aaron Dana, who is on the committee, told Maine Morning Star that some tribal leaders believed that compromise shouldn’t have been made. 
“We don’t want to keep negotiating away everything,” Dana said. “We’ve been negotiating everything away since the 1980s.” 
  People from across the state gather at the State House on May 14 to lobby for legislation that would prevent the state from seizing Wabanaki land and provide the Wabanaki Nations with exclusive rights to operate internet gaming. (Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)
Opposition 
“What we don’t know is what we don’t know,” Fredette said on the floor. “Would we, as a state, for the best interest of the state, require a sliver of a piece of land? I don’t know the answer to that.”
Fredette repeated many of the same talking points that the governor’s counsel, Jerry Reid, told the Judiciary Committee during a work session in which he shared that Mills is opposed to the bill.
After not testifying during the bill’s public hearing, Reid said on April 9 that Mills is concerned the bill could prevent the state government from addressing unpredictable future infrastructure needs, an issue also raised in written testimony from the Maine Department of Transportation. 
When pressed by committee members, Reid said he didn’t have a specific example of an infrastructure project that would warrant seizing tribal land but that, “We need to write the law mindful of the potential for problems.” 
Republican Sen. David Haggan of Penobscot, who was one of four committee members to vote against the bill in committee, invited Reid and Tim Woodcock, attorney with Eaton Peabody, to provide a question and answer session about the bill, which was only attended by Republican legislators on May 8. 
A handout from that meeting listed similar key points, pointing to uncertain future needs and arguing that the state needs to be mindful of the interests of the 1.4 million non-tribal Maine citizens, as well. 
“Informational sessions like this are not unusual,” the governor’s press secretary Ben Goodman said when asked why the session was held. 
So far, sweeping changes to the Settlement Act have failed due to opposition from Mills, though an omnibus sovereignty bill has been carried over into next year. Instead, the governor, lawmakers and Wabanaki leaders have successfully made some targeted adjustments, including expanding tribal authority to prosecute crimes last year. 
Craig Francis, a tribal attorney and Passamaquoddy citizen, told Maine Morning Star that the Wabanaki Nations hadn’t expected the eminent domain issue to garner the pushback from the Mills administration that it has.
“We’re trying to approach change that way because of what the governor has laid that out as a path forward,” Francis said, referring to the piecemeal approach. “We didn’t really see eminent domain as that big of an issue as her office is making it out to be.”
The state has not exercised eminent domain over tribal lands since the Settlement Act, a point Fredette also made on the House floor. This also means that, currently, the state’s ability to exercise eminent domain over tribal lands is not actually clear.
“I suspect that even if the state were going to attempt to take a piece of tribal land by eminent domain, it would be sufficiently litigated frankly for years before that were to happen,” Fredette said on the floor, “and so I think this is a bill that’s in search of a problem.”
Meanwhile, Francis said the likelihood of litigation is a reason to clarify rights now in the bill. 
“It leaves open legal questions that ultimately will end up having to be resolved by a court,” Francis said. “We’re trying to resolve it amicably because there’s always room for conversation in the future if [the state] needed land.”

(MDT graphic)A large-scale transportation study is now underway in central Montana, and the state Department of Transportation is looking for public input.
The Central Montana Transportation Study is looking for ways to improve access around Great Falls and Lewistown. Parts of nine counties in total will be part of the study, including Cascade, Choteau, Fergus, Judith Basin, Lewis and Clark, Pondera, Teton, Toole, and Wheatland Counties.
Increased development, as well as expansion of Malstrom Air Force Base, are expected to add traffic to the area. In one example, the average rate of traffic growth has increased west and south of the airbase by an annual rate of 1.3% since 2004.
“Malmstrom Air Force Base is preparing for construction, including on base improvements, as well as off base upgrades related to missile facilities and associated utility corridors, additionally, workforce hubs and temporary lay down areas are anticipated in surrounding communities to support off base construction,” a video for the project said.
An access management plan, which is part of the study, noted a number of car crashes in the area near the airbase and cutting those down is one of the focuses of the work. Other focus areas of the project near Great Falls include the intersection of Old Havre Highway and U.S. Highway 87.

In Lewistown, the “Sentinel Project” which will decommission Minuteman nuclear missiles and replace them with upgraded weapons, is likely to spark activity and traffic in the town, a MDT presentation said.
“Understanding the immediate and long-term transportation impacts of these developments is crucial for the city’s sustainable growth,” the presentation said. “This analysis will focus on traffic, safety, and infrastructure needs, considering both current conditions and anticipated growth.”
Other focuses include a seven-mile section of Armington Junction area east of Belt to the Cascade-Judith Basin county line. The primary route connecting Great Falls and Lewistown has a couple issues, state transportation said.
“Safety concerns in this area have been raised due to the narrow road width, poor roadside conditions, and limited passing opportunities,” the presentation said. “These issues are compounded by the nearby railroad tracks, Otter Creek, and the challenging terrain.”
MDT will be having two open houses on the plan, with the first to be hosted in Lewistown at Fergus High School on Tuesday, June 17 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. The second will be in Great Falls at the Civic Center’s Gibson Room on Wednesday, June 18 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.

UPDATE:3:20 p.m., Friday, June 13, 2025 
A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement told Source New Mexico on Friday that Carrero-Marquez has been deported to his home country of Venezuela.
According to spokesperson Leticia Zamarripa, Carrero-Marquez “has been deemed a threat to the community due to his suspected affiliation with the foreign terrorist organization Tren de Aragua.” 
His wife, Daniela Marina Diaz-Ortiz, denied in an interview that her husband is a criminal or gang member, and a search of federal and state court records shows only a traffic ticket. The New York Times also recently reported that Trump administration officials have a low bar for deeming someone a Tren de Aragua member, including tattoos and clothing. 
As for the arrest itself, Zamarripa said Carrero-Marquez “passively resisted arrest and complained of having a medical condition.” Zamarripa said,“Emergency services were called,” to take him to the hospital and, upon being released from the hospital, and released to ICE custody. 
On Tuesday, June 10, Carrero-Marquez, ICE “removed him to his home country,” Zamarripa said. 





	Last Saturday around 8 a.m., as she followed her husband to a mechanic in Albuquerque’s South Valley, Daniela Marina Diaz-Ortiz says she and her 5-year-old daughter watched, terrified, as federal immigration agents leapt out of four SUVs and pulled her husband to the ground.
“They stopped him and took him out of the car. They didn’t ask him for any identification. They didn’t tell him he was under arrest or anything like that,” she told Source in Spanish in an interview outside her home Monday afternoon. “They just pulled him out of the car, threw him on the ground, putting their feet on his back and head. At that moment, they also lifted him up by his neck and forced him into the truck.”
Jesus Jose Carrero-Marquez, 30, was hospitalized at the Presbyterian Hospital emergency room for hours, potentially due to injuries sustained in the arrest, his wife and others told Source NM. 
Agents who waited outside Carrero-Marquez’s room told hospital workers that the detainee was a violent gang member, according to New Mexico Rep. Eleanor Chavez (D-Albuquerque), who advocates on behalf of working conditions for healthcare workers across the state. Chavez said she learned of the arrest from a hospital worker and relayed to Source what the worker told her. 
Diaz-Ortiz adamantly denied her husband is violent or a criminal or in a gang. Source’s review of state and federal criminal records for Carrero-Marquez showed only a local traffic ticket in January. 
Instead, Diaz-Ortiz said he is a father and husband who makes a living as a Doordash delivery driver, while seeking asylum on behalf of himself and his family after being injured in a protest against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro several years ago. The lawyer representing his appeal did not respond to requests for comment.
Diaz-Ortiz showed Source photos the family is using in its asylum appeal that show what appear to be injuries to Carrero-Marquez’s leg and back, which left him with a punctured lung and a limp, she said.
Source could not determine why federal immigration authorities arrested Carrero-Marquez on May 31; why they purportedly took him to the hospital; where he is being detained; or whether he’s been deported.
ICE offers Albuquerque immigrant reprieve — for now

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to questions from Source about Carrero-Marquez’s arrest, their alleged use of force or his current location. A spokesperson said the agency would respond but had not as of publication time after multiple requests. Source will update the story as necessary*. 
Advocates, including Chavez and immigration lawyers, have tried since May 31 to find him, including enlisting the help of U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office. A Heinrich spokesperson said the office had made efforts to find him but that “ICE is not providing timely or helpful responses to our inquiries.”
A recent change to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention policies has made it difficult to determine whether someone is in jail and, if so, at which detention center, said Sophia Genovese, a lawyer for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center who joined efforts this week to find Carrero-Marquez.
Following his arrest, Carrero-Marquez called his wife from detention somewhere in El Paso, Diaz-Ortiz said, and described severe pain in his head and back from the arrest, she said. 
The last time she spoke to him,  on Sunday, her husband “told me that they were taking him away, that he didn’t know where they were going, that he hadn’t seen a judge to decide whether he would be ordered to leave the country or not.” 
When she hadn’t heard from him again on Tuesday, Diaz-Ortiz told Source she felt certain he was gone.
“I believe my husband has already been deported,” she said, because otherwise, “I believe he would have called me.”
On Wednesday morning, Diaz-Ortiz said she woke up after a long night of making deliveries to check ICE detention records for updates, which she’s done multiple times a day since his arrest.
She discovered, and Source confirmed, he was no longer listed in custody as of Wednesday morning. And he still had not called her, she told Source.
“I still don’t know anything about what happened to him,” she said. 
“It just says, ‘Texas’”
Carrero-Marquez’s arrest follows the pattern of recent ICE detentions, which leave little trail for lawyers or advocates to follow, said Genovese with the Immigration Law Center.
After being arrested and hospitalized, Carrero-Marquez called his wife from his hospital bed, she said. But hospital workers would neither confirm he was there nor allow her to see or speak with him in the emergency room, she said. 
While the hospital would not confirm that Carrero-Marquez was hospitalized, a spokesperson said it has “Do Not Announce” protocols as part of federal patient privacy regulations and that patients may be under that protocol “for many reasons.” 
The hospital staff had no choice but to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, the hospital worker told Chavez, the state representative. A spokesperson for Presbyterian told Source that, while it cannot discuss specific patients, it is legally required to cooperate with all law enforcement agencies.
“We do not have policies designed to help or hinder any law enforcement or other governmental agencies,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday. 
Confusion reigns in New Mexico’s militarized border zone

The officers took Carrero-Marquez to jail, likely to the Torrance County Detention Center in Estancia, Genovese said, though jail records never showed him being held there.
Diaz-Ortiz was the first person to hear from him, a few days after the arrest, when he called from El Paso, she said. 
Before Wednesday, when his name disappeared completely, ICE records didn’t say where he’s being held, and instead only said “Texas,” instead of a facility name and address. According to Genovese, he could have been held at either the El Paso Service Processing Center or at a nearby former Border Patrol holding facility intended for short-term use that ICE recently took over. 
The ICE takeover of the holding facility has resulted in confusion and difficulty for lawyers seeking to speak to their clients. It also means no one knows where detainees are being held. 
“This is like a new trend, where we’re seeing a lot of people have the exact same situation where… it just says, ‘Texas.’ It doesn’t provide a detention facility,” Genovese said.
‘Thousands’ of arrests per day
As for why he might be in jail in the first place, Genovese said ICE agents increasingly have less discretion about detaining people who, like Carrero-Marquez, are appealing denials of asylum claims. 
According to online records and a document provided by Diaz-Ortiz, a judge denied Carrero-Marquez’s asylum request in February. Records also show he is appealing that denial, and that the appeal is pending. 
While he has not yet received a final removal order, ICE has discretion to detain him during “removal proceedings,” his current status., Genovese said. 
That said, given the sheer number of people currently in “removal proceedings” with pending appeals, ICE typically would not find and detain people until a final removal order is issued, Genovese said. 
New Mexico sheriffs respond to federal ‘sanctuary’ list

ICE, “for very real capacity reasons, given the limited number of beds nationwide and the millions of cases pending at immigration court, frequently exercised discretion in the form of releasing people on their own recognizance pending their removal proceedings,” Genovese said
But President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportation has removed ICE’s choice about when and where to arrest people, she said. 
“It’s changed now under the Trump administration, where there is a mandate, a requirement, that ICE make thousands of arrests per day,” she said. “And they are targeting people with active removal proceedings, many of whom do not have any sort of interaction with law enforcement which would trigger mandatory detention.”
‘We came here for a better future’
Carrero-Marquez’s daughter recently celebrated graduation at a South Valley school. His wife shared a picture showing the three of them smiling, with her in a graduation gown. 
Since witnessing her father’s arrest, the girl is depressed, Diaz-Ortiz said, and afraid of anyone who looks like a police officer. 
Diaz-Ortiz doesn’t know whether ICE will come next for her or her daughter, whether she should enroll her daughter back in school or what to do next. But she still has to work. 
On Tuesday, she took her daughter along with her as she made deliveries for DoorDash, she said, suddenly the sole caregiver and sole income earner in her family. 
Amid the confusion and uncertainty about her husband’s whereabouts, Diaz-Ortiz said she is terrified about the prospect of him being deported back to Venezuela due to his injuries and the government’s repressive policies.
“In Venezuela you can’t speak freely or say what you want because they attack you,” she said. “We came here for a better future.”

(DNRC photo)A fire near Helena is now 77% contained and was found to be human caused, according to a state press release this week.
Crews completed a line around the Hilger Valley fire on Thursday and were looking for hot spots. Helicopters were used throughout the week to make water drops on the fire, getting their water from nearby Upper Colter Lake.
The fire was initially spotted on Monday and quickly grew through the afternoon before crews were able to get a handle on it. The blaze was listed at 295 acres as of Friday morning. At its peak, nearly 200 personnel were assigned to work the fire.
The Hilger Valley Fire is 20 miles north of Helena, east of Interstate 15 near the Gates of the Mountains exit. The fire cost around $1.5 million to fight and threatened communication infrastructure, according to the National Interagency Fire Center’s daily fire report. It’s expected to be contained by June 20, the report added. The DNRC County Assist Team gave control back to Helena DNRC on Thursday, which will monitor the fire during the coming days.
Several early fires, including one near Wisdom and another near Plains have burned several thousand acres in Montana already this year. Fire officials have said the May and June wildfire starts are early and crews are expecting a long fire season.
Canadian fires, bringing smoke, have already burned more than 7 million acres this year.
“It’s June, and rising heat and low humidity are drying out grasses, brush, and trees—making them easier to ignite and faster to burn,” the state press release said. “Stay alert and visit MTFireInfo.org to learn how to prevent wildfires.

(Photo by Danita Delimont/Getty Images)It’s rare enough to have environmental victories of any kind these days. Yet, while many environmental groups have decided to deal with the current administration by keeping their heads down, the Alliance for the Wild Rockies is fighting even harder — and winning!
When the Manti–La Sal National Forest issued its decision to log, masticate (grinding trees down to stumps), and burn across 952,115 acres — a stunning 1,487 square miles, which is more than two-thirds of the 1,413,111-acre forest — we filed suit in federal court. 
We’re overjoyed to announce the Forest Service decided to drop the project. Why? Because the agency knew it would lose in court since the area slated for habitat destruction included 454,452 acres — 710 square miles — of Federal Inventoried Roadless Areas that provide essential habitat for bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, bears, raptors, and birds, including the imperiled pinyon jay.
The Manti-La Sal National Forest stretches from central to southeastern Utah and into Colorado and contains the La Sal Mountains, the state’s second highest mountain range that includes areas in the Bears Ears National Monument.
Given the stunning beauty of this area one might credibly wonder why the Forest Service ever authorized this project. Although calling it “restoration” the project actually authorized mass logging and burning of conifers and aspens, including 170,000 acres of pinyon-juniper forest.
Pinyon jays are unique and social birds that travel in large flocks and play a significant role in maintaining the biodiversity of the West. But like many bird species, Pinyon jay populations have declined by 85% in the last 50 years due to habitat destruction. Ironically, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently issued a decision that pinyon jays may be warranted to be listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act because of loss of their habitat to projects like this.
While the Forest Service is very gung-ho on make-work “management” projects that destroy habitat, pinyon jays actually enhance their habitat by collecting and burying caches of piñon seeds, known as pine nuts. Because they don’t retrieve all the seeds they bury, many germinate and replenish the pinyon-juniper woodlands that are critical for their survival. 
This project was such a huge threat to the Manti-La Sal’s beautiful and biologically diverse roadless forests that the Castle Valley town council passed a resolution supporting our lawsuit, in large part to protect its critical watershed, which is fed by mountain snowpack in our ever hotter and drier climate.
Normally, those who prevail in lawsuits against the government are entitled by law to have their costs reimbursed. But because the Forest Service pulled this project prior to a court ruling, the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and our co-Plaintiffs Native Ecosystems Council, Wildlands Defense, and Council on Fish and Wildlife will not recover our attorney fees.
The Alliance caught the Forest Service breaking the law, we sued, and the agency caved. While this is a great victory for wildlife and their habitat, it’s a mystery why the Forest Service forced us to sue rather than heed our comments, which clearly stated the agency was breaking the law.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-683747825-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 17:38:53.411919
,California,2025-06-13 21:14:30+00:00,CalMatters,He misled the public about his last big immigration sweep. Now he’s leading the Border Patrol in LA,"Andrew Donohue, Sergio Olmos and Wendy Fry",,,,,https://calmatters.org/investigation/2025/06/los-angeles-border-patrol-chief/,"The immigration raids across Los Angeles have all the hallmarks of Gregory Bovino's Kern County sweep, which a federal judge says likely violated the Constitution.","In summary
The immigration raids across Los Angeles have all the hallmarks of Gregory Bovino’s Kern County sweep, which a federal judge says likely violated the Constitution. 


The day after Congress certified President Donald Trump’s victory, Gregory Bovino led his Border Patrol agents hundreds of miles north, sweeping through Kern County in an audacious immigration raid that shocked the local agricultural community. 
At the time, Bovino, chief of the El Centro sector, said that his agents had a “predetermined list of targets,” many of whom had criminal records, before they set off for Kern County. “We did our homework,” he said. 
In the weeks after, both the factual and legal foundation of Bovino’s bold sweep crumbled. Border Patrol documents obtained by CalMatters showed that 77 of the 78 people his agents arrested had no prior record with the agency. 
Then, a federal judge ruled the wide-net sweep – based on random, warrantless stops where day laborers and farm workers congregate – likely violated the Constitution’s protection against unreasonable searches. Lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security promised to re-train Bovino’s 900-plus agents on the Constitution. But that wasn’t enough. The judge issued an injunction forbidding the Border Patrol from conducting similar raids in California’s Central Valley. 
“You just can’t walk up to people with brown skin and say, ‘Give me your papers,’” said U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer L. Thurston.
It appears Bovino’s stock has only risen within the Trump administration since. 
On Thursday, Bovino – in his green uniform, with his high-and-tight hairdo – stood next to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and announced that he has been in charge of Customs and Border Protection operations in Los Angeles. Indeed, the immigration raids that sparked the protests have all the hallmarks of Bovino’s Kern County operation. 
Federal agents picked up day laborers outside of a Home Depot in Westlake. They went after car wash workers in Los Angeles and garment workers in Downtown LA. And farm workers have reported that Border Patrol agents have been conducting operations around the strawberry fields of Oxnard.  
Bovino doesn’t distinguish between field workers or paleteros and fentanyl dealers. To him, they all fit one category: “Bad people.”
“For Customs and Border Protection, that’s why we are here right now, is to remove those bad people and bad things, whether illegal aliens, drugs or otherwise,” he said at the press conference Thursday. “We are here and we’re not going away.” 
At this point, Bovino’s rapid rise from one of 20 section chiefs around the country to the face of Trump’s aggressive immigration sweeps in Los Angeles almost seems inevitable. His team employs a group of five agents to make videos, cranking out dramatic, fictionalized videos portraying migrants crossing the border as menaces with a bloodlust to commit crimes. 
Bovino seems to relish the camera himself. The El Centro sector posts staged photos of him in uniform, including a closeup with an AR-15, and one on a white horse in the desert, cradling a shotgun. In an interview with CalMatters in February, flanked by a wall of armed agents, he taunted his other Border Patrol counterparts. “Twenty sectors in the U.S. Border Patrol, and we do call ourselves the ‘Premiere Sector,’” he said with a smile. “So please let those other chiefs know we said that.”  


Bovino likes to praise President Dwight Eisenhower, who led the largest deportation in American history, rounding up 1.3 million Mexicans and Mexican Americans in 1954. The first buses deporting migrants – in what was called “Operation Wetback” – rolled out of El Centro over 70 years ago. 
The Kern County raids were pitched as a “proof of concept” for how the Border Patrol could be mobilized for mass deportation operations away from the border. It’s exactly the kind of operation that, according to the Wall Street Journal, top White House aide Steven Miller wanted to see when he convened top immigration officials in late May and demanded more aggressive action. Miller, the Journal reported, told officials they didn’t need targeted lists of immigrants – they should instead just go to Home Depots, inspiring the LA raids. 
Now, Bovino, at the same press conference in which agents handcuffed Sen. Alex Padilla after the senator tried asking questions of Noem, said he’s sticking around.
“You’ll continue to see us in Los Angeles,” he said. “Not going anywhere soon.” 
A new series of raids in California
Bovino labeled the Kern County sweeps “Operation Return to Sender.” Over three days, his agents detained day laborers, farm workers and others in a Home Depot parking lot, outside a convenience store and along a highway between orchards.  
The ACLU sued on behalf of United Farm Workers, arguing that the indiscriminate stops violated the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. 
The judge hasn’t yet ruled on the full case, but found the ACLU was likely to succeed, and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Border Patrol agents from taking similar actions. That restricts them from stopping people unless they have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in violation of U.S. immigration law. It also bars agents from carrying out warrantless arrests unless they have probable cause that the person is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. 
The injunction only applies to the Central Valley, but similar legal challenges could await after the latest wave of sweeps.
Advocates are still trying to get a handle on the scope and details of federal actions over the last week. 
Just after dawn on Tuesday, Border Patrol agents and other federal officers swept across Ventura, Kern, and Tulare counties, according to the United Farm Workers. 
UFW provided CalMatters with a video that shows a white and green Border Patrol truck pulling up to a business in Moorpark. Two masked agents emerged and arrested a man in a baseball cap and neon yellow work shirt who was opening the gate just before 9 a.m.
A video shared on social media by ABC7 shows officers in green Border Patrol uniforms chasing a farmworker through an Oxnard field. Another video shot from a different angle shows a green and white Border Patrol truck racing along the edge of the farm fields. 
The agents appear to catch the worker, but it is unclear what happens after that. “There’s a lot we don’t know yet,” said Antonio de Loera-Brust, a spokesman for UFW. The labor union representing farm workers is working to contact families affected by the raids. 
Other videos show white and green vehicles typically used by Border Patrol, but so far, the agency has not confirmed their participation. A spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency for Border Patrol, told CalMatters to direct our questions to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A spokesperson for ICE told CalMatters to contact Customs and Border Protection with our questions. 
“We’ve seen videos of Border Patrol trucks tearing through farmlands. I’ve heard reports of operations in farmlands, and we’re still investigating if the court’s order has been violated,” said Bree Bernwanger, an attorney with ACLU Northern California, which brought the Kern County suit.
“The Fourth Amendment really prohibits immigration agents from doing sweeps of communities, from doing racial profiling, from targeting people just because they’re Brown or looking like a farm worker.”
Oxnard Mayor Luis McArthur said his office has also received disturbing reports of immigration officials trying to enter agricultural fields and conducting vehicle stops. 
“These actions are completely unjustified and harmful. They create chaos and distress in our community without contributing to public safety,” he said. “The individuals affected by these operations; they’re not criminals. They’re hardworking families who make meaningful contributions to our local economy and to our greater community.”
Elizabeth Strater, vice president of the UFW, said that a number of employers stopped federal agents from accessing their land. 
“All across California one thing that is good to hear is that we can confirm in a number of locations federal agents attempted to enter a worksite and were repelled because the employer took the practical steps, like gates, and told the agents that they couldn’t come onto the property,” she said. 
In February, Bovino denied that his agents had gone after farmworkers. 
“For us, targeting agricultural workers at their job, absolutely not. That has no merit,” he said. “But when Border Patrol comes into contact with illegal aliens, you’re going to get arrested.”
He promised to take his fight across the state. “Our area goes through Central California all the way to the Oregon border, so anywhere in that area, we are going to go where that threat is, and where we can do the most damage to bad people and bad things as we possibly can,” Bovino said. 
For now, that’s Los Angeles. Bovino said at the Thursday press conference he had several hundred agents and officers there. 
“Many millions of illegal aliens have passed across that border over the past several years. It’s our job to get them out,” he said. “And that’s what we’re going to do and what we’re doing right now.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061325_Gregory-Bovino_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-13 17:38:53.411919

We look at the digits.","Workers with Health Care for the Homeless offer water, education and treatment to unsheltered New Mexicans in Albuquerque in response to high heat risk. (Courtesy of Health Care for the Homeless / Sara Lucero)Parts of New Mexico will get their first encounters with intense heat this weekend, including projected temperatures of 103 and 104 degrees in Las Cruces. 
The temperatures will be dangerously hot in some places, according to the National Weather Service’s Heat Risk Map. The map takes into account how unusual the heat is at a given time of year, how long it will last into the day and night and whether those temperatures pose a higher risk of heat-related impacts based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Local New Mexico officials told Source New Mexico earlier this week that they’re monitoring for heat threats and ready to take action during extreme heat.
Rio Rancho, Albuquerque and Las Cruces recently topped a USA Today analysis of cities with the largest increase of high-heat days — 90 degrees and upward — since 1985: 39, 36 and 31 more such days, respectively.
According to the Heat Risk Map, areas in and around Las Cruces will be so hot that they’ll turn from “red” to “magenta” beginning Monday, June 16. Areas can reach this “extreme” level of heat with rare or long-duration extreme heat with little overnight relief. 

 
 
 

Heat at the “magenta” level “affects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration. Impacts likely in most health systems, heat-sensitive industries and infrastructure,” the National Weather Service warns.
Despite the extreme temperatures predicted, local officials in Las Cruces told Source that, as of Wednesday,  they did not plan to extend cooling center hours, unless a power outage or further needs arise.
Heat of the Moment

Doña Ana Assistant County Manager Steven Lopez said recent temperatures have not reached a threshold of 105 degrees on the heat index. The county requires those high temperatures for several days to provide additional cooling sites, he said.
Dangerously hot temperatures forecasted in the coming days have nonprofit advocates and providers bracing for “life or death” impacts to unhoused people in New Mexico’s largest cities.

But both are advocating for their cities and seeking changes to public education funding in CT.","A week after New Haven’s mayor decried the inadequacy of state funding for local education, Hartford’s mayor came to the state Capitol office of House Speaker Matt Ritter to publicly offer thanks for the positive impact the recently adopted budget will have on his city.
“I come up to the Capitol very often to ask for things,” Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam said.
“You’re nicer than some mayors,” Ritter said, smiling.
“My mom told me, taught me, that if you are willing to ask for something, you better say thank you when you get it, and we’re here to say thank you,” Arulampalam said.
Behind the political politesse is the challenge of urban mayors to advocate for immediate needs, while also playing the longer game of seeking structural changes in how Connecticut meets its constitutional responsibility of equitably funding public education.
“The state has an obligation, constitutionally, to fund public education with regard to equity, and we don’t. We just don’t,” said Joe DeLong, the executive director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
DeLong was not party to Elicker’s denunciation of Gov. Ned Lamont’s refusal to raise taxes and provide greater funding for education, nor the press conference Arulampalam sought to publicize some of the fiscal relief coming to Hartford. But he understands both points of view.
The state both increased funding for special education and accelerated by one year the commitment to fully funding the Education Cost Sharing formula, through which most state aid for local education flows.
For Hartford, that means $3.4 million more for special education and an additional $2.8 million in ECS money. There is an other $8 million in new funding for the city, including $1 million that will be matched for the city to once again employ 800 young people in summer jobs.
“It’s a significant investment in our youth. It’s a significant investment in violence prevention in our city. It has so many layers of impact, and we really appreciate the legislature coming through,” Arulampalam said.
Ritter, a Democrat from Hartford, had expressed annoyance last week at Elicker’s complaint. On Friday, the former city council leader said he understood Elicker’s larger frustrations with the inability of the General Assembly to make more dramatic changes in funding schools.
“I have a lot of respect for all the mayors. I know what a hard job it is,” Ritter said. “So this is not a knock or a dig at anybody. What I would say, though, is that incremental progress in the legislature is often what happens. And so the idea that a group can ask for a half a billion dollars in one year is just not practical.”
Urban legislators are not a majority in the the General Assembly, but both chambers are led by urban Democrats: Ritter in the House, and Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney of New Haven in the Senate.
DeLong said the notion of incremental change and progress is reasonable, but it must be viewed in a larger picture: The ECS formula has not been changed significantly since 2013, and inflation means that the state’s share of K-12 funding actually shrinks some years even as over spending goes up.
Connecticut’s 36% state share of financing public schools is one of the lowest in the U.S.
“I wish I could walk in the legislature and get $545 million in a new Educational Cost Sharing formula. We have to, as leaders, deal with the realities in front of us,” Arulampalam said. 
Elicker said Friday his criticism was not directed at the legislative leaders, who were constrained by the governor’s refusal to consider higher taxes.
“We need to think big, and we need to act big,” Elicker said. “An unwillingness to raise taxes at the state level means raising them at the local level.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7869-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)Chants of “Todos somos Kilmar” — “we are all Kilmar” — punctuated a gathering of immigrant, labor, faith and civil rights organizations who gathered at a downtown Nashville church Friday ahead of Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s arraignment.
Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran native living in Maryland, was detained after a traffic stop in March and then deported to a Salvadoran prison under accusations of being a member of the MS-13 criminal gang.
His deportation — which a Trump administration attorney admitted was done in error — has become a lightning rod for public opposition to the administration’s immigration policies.
“Let’s be clear: We are fighting because they are continuing to call this an administrative error, but there’s nothing administrative about destroying a family, and this is not an error,”  Lydia Walther-Rodriguez, a leader with  immigrant advocacy group CASA Maryland, said. 
“This is an intentional attack to Black and brown communities. Not just in Maryland, but all throughout this country, they are continuing to fight to erase us, and we must continue to stand up and resist,” she said.
Abrego Garcia came to the United States illegally as a teenager. A 2019 immigration court order barred the government from sending him back to El Salvador, where he said he feared persecution.
The El Salvador government returned Abrego Garcia to the United States in June to face human smuggling charges issued in a grand jury indictment in late May. The charges stem from a 2022 incident when the Tennessee Highway Patrol pulled over Abrego Garcia’s SUV — which had nine Hispanic men inside — for speeding.
He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment at a Nashville federal courthouse Friday.
The group of organizations that met on the steps of the First Lutheran Church also included the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRRC), SEIU Local 205, Central Labor Council of Nashville and Middle Tennessee and The Equity Alliance.

Vonda McDaniel, president of the Central Labor Council of Nashville and Middle Tennessee, demanded fair treatment for Abrego Garcia, saying his case will not “disappear in the shadows of a courtroom.” She also questioned the legitimacy of the charges against him, which were filed after his deportation.
“This is a clear attempt to criminalize Kilmar retroactively in order to justify what they did to him illegally, and to intimidate other immigrants (and) workers who might dare to fight back when their rights are violated … Today, we stand before you to demand justice, not vengeance,” McDaniel said.
Speakers: turmoil in Nashville reflects broader pattern
TIRRC Executive Director Lisa Sherman Luna spoke of the Tennessee legislature’s recent actions, including a law that created an immigration enforcement division that is exempt from public records and created criminal penalties for local elected officials who “adopt sanctuary policies.” Another law created a new crime for harboring or hiding immigrants without legal immigration status “for the purpose … of private financial gain.”
“What happened to Kilmar Garcia is a chilling example of what could happen to any one of us, because it’s exactly what happens when those in power put themselves above the law, when court orders are ignored, when people are disappeared, when due process is erased,” she said. “Right now, immigrants are being used as pawns in a broader assault on our democracy.”
Sherman Luna said Nashville specifically has been under “full-scale assault” since ICE detained around 200 people, most of whom had no criminal records, from the city’s most diverse neighborhoods in May. 
U.S. “border czar” Tom Homan, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton and Trump administration officials have since denounced Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell for condemning the immigration detention sweep.

After the detainments, O’Connell revised a 2019 executive order that requires some city employees to report interactions with federal immigration officials to the mayor’s office, shortening the original 3-day timeframe to 24 hours. The mayor’s office posted records of these reports, which inadvertently included the names of three federal immigration officials and one official’s first name, according to O’Connell’s administration. The posts were later removed.
Tennessee GOP leaders have accused O’Connell of endangering immigration officials and interfering with immigration enforcement.
O’Connell now faces an investigation by a U.S. Congressional committee, and Tennessee Republican state lawmakers have proposed legislation that would make it a felony for public officials to release immigration officers’ names. The bill would also remove state and local officials from office. 
“They criminalized the ability of local elected officials to protect immigrant residents, and now they’re trying to make it a crime to even release the names of ICE officers, people with immense power operating without any public oversight,” Sherman Luna said. “This is what governments do when they know they’re acting outside of the law, when they’re trampling on our rights (and) they want to do it with total impunity.”
District 17 Metro Nashville Council member Terry Vo, who chairs the Immigrant Caucus, said the state legislature “has already stripped Tennessee cities of the right to take care of our people, from banning sanctuary policies to restricting (minimum wage increases) and to blocking worker protections.”
Cities in Tennessee and throughout the nation, she said, cannot “comply in advance.”
“Let’s not forget the freedoms we enjoy now were not gifted to us,” Vo said. “They were fought for. They were sacrificed for.”
Tequila Johnson, co-founder and vice president of The Equity Alliance, said it’s the same system that “locks up Black bodies” and “is deporting immigrant families.”
“We owe it to our ancestors … to the people who died, who fought for these rights, to continue fighting,” Johnson said. “Because just because hate isn’t knocking at your door right now, doesn’t mean it’s not on your street.”

(Rhode Island Department of Transportation Traffic Camera)Two of the 13 firms being sued by the state for allegedly doing negligent work on the westbound Washington Bridge have filed a counterclaim, alleging the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) failed to tell them about a key inspection report.
The counterclaim filed by Barletta Heavy Division Inc. and Aetna Bridge Company in Providence County Superior Court Thursday argues they should have been alerted to the findings of a January 1992 report by Lichtenstein & Associates, at the time they bid for the state’s $78 million contract to rehabilitate the Washington Bridge in 2021.
The 1992 report was cited by the state in its lawsuit against the firms, claiming they all should have known about deterioration in the concrete drop-in beams and signs of distress in the grout and cantilever beams that were eventually deemed a risk to the bridge’s structural integrity. The westbound span on Interstate 195 was closed in December 2023 when engineers determined the bridge was at risk of collapsing.
“RIDOT knew or should have known, or ought to have known, that the Washington Bridge incorporated a unique design that limited the ability to determine its condition from visual inspections alone,” the counterclaim states.
The westbound bridge is expected to be rebuilt by November 2028 and cost up to $427 million. Chicago-headquartered Walsh Construction Company was awarded the state’s contract on June 6 after two attempts by Gov. Dan McKee’s administration to secure a bridge builder.
Work is scheduled to begin in July, which overlaps with the ongoing demolition of the existing bridge by Aetna, which is among the 13 firms being sued by the state. The Warwick-based contractor is expected to complete its work by the end of 2025.
Barletta and Aetna claim the state concealed the true condition of the bridge and neglected to conduct the appropriate testing ahead of issuing a request for proposals in 2021. Instead, the companies allege that they received a project scope which did not identify any structural deficiencies with the post-tensioning system.
The 1992 report called for RIDOT to perform additional radiographic and other evaluation of the Washington Bridge before any future attempts to rehabilitate the span over the Seekonk River.
“The Rhode Island Department of Transportation may have averted a costly and disastrous emergency closure of the Washington Bridge last December if it had followed recommendations in a detailed 1992 inspection report,” Barletta spokesperson Sallie Hofmeister said in an emailed statement.
Because of the state’s alleged failure to investigate the bridge, Barletta and Aetna claim they were deprived of incentives available after successful completion of the initial rehabilitation project. The two firms have asked the court to issue a judgment against the state for all of its damages plus interest.
The state’s initial August 2024 complaint seeks to recover damages based on alleged economic losses and physical damages, along with breaches of contracts. 
RIDOT spokesperson Charles St. Martin deferred comment to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office, which is handling the state’s case. 
“Counterclaims are to be expected in a case like this,” Timothy Rondeau, a spokesperson for the AG’s office, said in an emailed statement.“The state stands by the allegations in its complaint. As this is part of ongoing litigation, we have no further comment.”

Andy Kim and Rep. Rob Menendez speak outside Delaney Hall on Friday, June 13, 2025, after touring the immigrant jail. (Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)Hours after unrest erupted inside a controversial migrant jail in Newark, two congressmen visited the site and confirmed “major movement of detainees out of this facility.”
Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat, and Rep. Rob Menendez (D-09) visited Delaney Hall Friday morning to inspect the facility and talk with immigration and jail officials after detainees revolted late Thursday over insufficient or inedible food, undrinkable water, and overcrowding.  
“Everything that they told me was that, yes, it’s an insecure facility. They do not have confidence in this facility, which is why they’re doing a security review, and it looks like moving most, if not all, of the detainees out of there while they do a review in that process,” Kim said. 
Four detainees escaped through a wall, made of drywall and mesh, that had toppled in the chaos, Kim said.

“It shows just how shoddy the construction was here, what happens when we are paying billions of dollars for for-profit prisons that are skirting the responsibilities they have and try to pocket as much of that money as possible,” Kim told protestors gathered outside the jail Friday morning. 
The Department of Homeland Security said the four escaped prisoners remain at large, but did not comment on Kim’s concerns or the transfer of detainees. A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson did not respond for comment. 
DHS officials also refuted claims of a chaotic night, despite video posted on social media that included authorities pepper-spraying activists and journalists and protesters forming a human barricade to prevent cars from entering the facility on Doremus Avenue in an industrial section of Newark. 
“Contrary to current reporting, there has been no widespread unrest at the Delaney Hall Detention facility. This privately held facility remains dedicated to providing high-quality services, including include around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietician-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice their religious beliefs,” Homeland Security officials said. 
Vans and buses lined up Friday morning alongside the jail to move detainees out. It’s unclear where they will be taken. New Jersey is home to one other migrant jail, the Elizabeth Detention Center. 
Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed facility, was the first immigration detention facility to open under President Donald Trump. The facility, run by prison operator Geo Group, opened just as the Trump administration ramped up efforts to mass detain and deport immigrants.
Backlash began even before it opened, and near-daily protests have cropped up outside since it started housing migrants in May. 
Newark officials sued Geo Group, claiming it lacked the proper city permits and inspections to open, including a certificate of occupancy. 
The facility captured national attention when Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested and detained for five hours after attempting to enter. While a judge later dismissed his charges, federal authorities charged Rep. LaMonica McIver with felony assault over a scuffle that occurred when agents handcuffed Baraka. 
In a statement early Friday, Baraka demanded answers from Geo Group and the Department of Homeland Security and urged authorities to “not allow this operation to continue unchecked.” 
“This entire situation lacks sufficient oversight of every basic detail — including local zoning laws and fundamental constitutional rights. This is why city officials and our congressional delegation need to be allowed entry to observe and monitor, and why private prisons pose a very real problem to our state and its constitution,” he said. 
Kim echoed concerns that Geo Group was “cutting corners” in a rush to open the facility.
“We need to see what exactly is going to be the future of this place and whether or not there will still be detainees in here past this weekend,” Kim said.
A Geo Group spokesman did not respond Friday to a request for comment, but has said the facility holds a valid certificate of occupancy and complies with health and safety requirements.
Lawyers barred from entering Delaney Hall
Attorneys were turned away from the facility Friday by guards. 
Franklin S. Montero, a Clifton-based immigration attorney, was there for his first visit with a client. 
When he arrived at the gate, guards told him a directive prohibited them from allowing anyone inside and offered no information on when he could enter. That means his client won’t be able to sign necessary petitions and documents before a hearing, he said.
“Never, never, never have I seen this before. In my years of practicing immigration law, I’ve always been able to get inside the facility and meet with my client,” Montero said. “Even during COVID. It’s just — it’s not normal, I’ll tell you that.”
Mustafa Cetin represents a man who has lived in South Jersey since 2022 and was detained during a routine check-in with immigration officials. His client now wants to be released to return to Turkey, Cetin said.
Cetin also got turned away from a scheduled meeting with his client Friday afternoon. He said that’s a due process issue that could be fought in court. 
“I don’t think that’s legal. That should be decided by a court if it’s reasonable for them to do that or not — weighing due process rights, our access to our clients, and them having the resources,” he said.

Lawmakers on the powerful budget-writing committee went back and forth for nearly three hours about the plans with Republicans saying they made significant investments in education and would help Wisconsinites while Democrats argued the state should do more for schools. 
Over $220 million for special education, no additional general aid for schools
The committee approved a total of about $336 million total in new general purpose revenue for Wisconsin’s K-12 schools — only about 10% of Gov. Tony Evers’ proposed $3.1 billion in new spending.
Special education costs will receive the majority of the allocation with an additional $220 million that will be split between the general special education reimbursement and a subset of high-cost special education services. 
The special education reimbursement funding includes $77.2 million in the first year of the budget, which will bring the rate at which the state reimburses school districts to an estimated 35%, and $151 million in the second year bringing the rate to an estimated 37.5%. It’s well below the $1.13 billion or 60% reimbursement for special education that Evers had proposed and that advocates had said was essential to place school districts back on a sustainable funding path. 
Education advocates spent the last week lobbying for the additional funding — and warning lawmakers about the financial strain on districts and the resources the students could lose. Ahead of the meeting Thursday, Democrats and a coalition of Wisconsin parents of students with disabilities spoke to the urgent need for additional investment in the state’s general special education reimbursement rate. 
“Everywhere we’ve gone in the state of Wisconsin, whether it’s rural school districts, urban school districts, whether it’s school districts that have passed referendums and those that haven’t, they all say the same thing — 60% primary special education funding is absolutely necessary for our schools to succeed,” Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said at the press conference.  “You can see that we have had a cycle of referendum throughout Wisconsin, and that cycle has to end.”

The special education reimbursement peaked at 70% in 1973, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum. After falling to a low of 24.9% in 2015-16, the state’s share of special education costs has been incrementally increasing with some fluctuations. 
The Republican proposal represents, at maximum, about a 5% increase to the current rate by the second year. According to budget papers prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the investment lawmakers made last session was meant to bring the rate to 33.3%, but because it is a sum certain rate — meaning there was only a set amount of money set aside, regardless of expanding costs  — the actual rates have been 32.4% in 2023-24 and an estimated 32.1% for 2024-25.
Joint Finance Co-Chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said at a press conference ahead of the meeting that he would tell advocates who wanted the 60% rate that the state budget has to be “right-sized” and “affordable.”
“The governor’s budget has always [had] reckless spending that the state can’t afford, and so we’re choosing to make key investments and priorities, and these investments today will be some of … the largest investments you’ll see in the budget,” Born said. 
The committee also added $54.5 million to bring the additional reimbursement rate for a small number of high-cost special education services to 50% in the first year of the budget and 90% in the second year. The high-cost special education program provides additional aid when costs exceed $30,000 for a single student in one year. According to DPI, in 2025 only 3% of students with disabilities fell in the high-cost special education category.
In 2024-25, the program only received $14.5 million from the state. Evers had proposed the state invest an additional $18.5 million. 
Republicans on the committee insisted that they were trying to compromise and making a significant investment in schools — noting that education likely will continue being the state’s top expenditure in the budget. Meanwhile, Democrats spoke extensively about the need for higher rates of investment, read messages from superintendents and students in their districts and said Republicans were not doing what people asked for. 
“High needs special education funding only reaches about 3% of Wisconsin’s special education students,” Rep. Deb Andraca said. “You’re getting a couple good talking points, but you’re not going to get the kinds of public schools that Wisconsin kids deserve.” 
During the committee meeting, Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) criticized Democrats for saying they would vote against the proposals. He said Democrats would vote against any proposal if it isn’t what they want. 
“If we all voted no, we would return to base funding, which was good enough by the way for the governor last budget because he signed it,” Bradley said. “There would be no increases, but instead we’ve introduced a motion which will increase funding.”
McGuire responded by saying he wouldn’t vote for a proposal that is “condemning the state to continuing the cycle of referendum,” which he said Republicans are doing by minimally increasing the special education reimbursement rate and not investing any additional money in general aid. 
“Wisconsinites across the state are having to choose between raising their own property taxes” and the schools, McGuire said. 
The Kenosha School District, which is in McGuire’s legislative district, recently failed to pass referendum to help reduce a budget deficit. School leaders had said a significant increase in the special education reimbursement would prevent the district from having to seek a referendum again.
“They had a $19 million budget gap, and if this state went to 60% special education funding, you know roughly where we promised we would be, that would’ve gone down to $6 million,” McGuire said, “…$13 million of those dollars are our responsibility. That’s been our failing, and we should live up to that.”
“What are we arguing about? We’re putting more money in,” Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) said.“I would think that when this gets to his desk, Evers would sign this because it is a bigger increase than any of what he proposed while he was state superintendent.”
McGuire said the investment in the high-cost special education is also good, but only applies to a small number of schools and students. 
“You know, what would benefit all school districts in the state and will benefit all students who need special education? The primary special education reimbursement rate, which you put at 37.5[%], but everyone says should be at 60[%].” McGuire said. “I don’t think this is your intention, but I don’t believe that we should be exchanging children who need our assistance for other children who need our assistance. Why can’t we just help all of the kids who need our help?”
Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) said that the increase for high-cost special education will have a significant impact on some schools, especially smaller ones, and students, even if it’s not many of them.
“To get 90% for them is huge for any of our rural districts. One child, which deserves an education, can break the bank for our small districts,” Kurtz said. “Is it perfect? No, it’s not perfect, but we have to stay within our means.” 
Committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) echoed Kurtz’s comments saying that there will be “a lot of districts that are going to be awful happy about that.” 
“They’ve been worried about sometimes, a student moves into the district, and it’s of incredibly high, high needs,” Marklein said.
The committee also declined to include additional general aid for school districts. Republicans on the committee said  there was already a $325 per pupil increase to districts’ revenue limits built into the budget from last session due to Evers’ partial veto. The increase gives districts the option to raise property taxes, though it doesn’t require them to, and does not include state funding for the increase.
Sen. Romaine Quinn (R-Birchwood) told lawmakers not to forget about the increase, saying the “insulting part about that is that everyone gets it.
There are schools that don’t need that,” Quinn said. “72% of my districts spend less than [the schools of] my Democratic colleagues on this panel.” 
School Administrators Alliance Executive Director Dee Pettack, Wisconsin Association of School Boards Executive Director Dan Rossmiller, Southeast Wisconsin School Alliance Executive Director Cathy Olig and Wisconsin Rural Schools Alliance Executive Director Jeff Eide said in a joint letter reacting to the proposal that lawmakers failed to hear the voices school leaders, parents and community and business leaders.
“While the $325 revenue limit authority exists, it is not funded by the state. Instead, it is entirely borne by local property taxpayers. In addition, school districts will not see the requested support in special education,” the leaders stated. “Because of the lack of state support in these two critical areas, school districts will be left with no choice but to ask their local taxpayers to step up and shoulder the costs locally, regardless of their ability to pay.” 
The leaders said the state was investing minimally and school districts will continue to struggle to fund mandated primary special education programs.
State Superintendent Jill Underly called the Republicans’ proposal “irresponsible” in a statement Friday and said it “puts politics ahead of kids and disregards educators and public schools when they need support the most.”
“Our public schools desperately need and deserve funding that is flexible, spendable and predictable,” Underly said. “This budget fails to deliver on all three. Once again, those in power had an opportunity to do right by Wisconsin’s children — and once again, they turned their backs on them.” 
The committee also approved $30 million for the state’s choice school programs, $20 million for mental health services in school, $250,000 for robotics league grants, $750,000 for a single school, the Lakeland STAR Academy (a provision that Evers vetoed last session), $100,000 for Special Olympics Wisconsin, $3 million for public library system aid, $500,000 for recovery high schools and $500,000 for Wisconsin Reading Corps. 
Over $1 billion in tax cuts 
Republican lawmakers also approved tax cuts of about $1.3 billion for the budget Thursday evening after 8 p.m., including changes to the income tax brackets and a cut for retirees in Wisconsin.
Born and Marklein said the cuts would help retirees and other Wisconsinites afford to stay in the state.
“These are average, hard-working people in our state that will benefit from our tax cut,” Marklein said. 
The income tax change will allow more people to qualify for the second tax bracket with a rate of 4.4% by raising the qualifying maximum income to $50,480 for single filers, $67,300 for joint filers and $33,650 for married-separate filers. This will reduce the state’s revenues by $323 million in 2025-26 and $320 million in 2026-27. 
People currently eligible for the second tax bracket include: single filers making between $14,680 and $29,370, joint filers making between $19,580 and $39,150 and married separate filers making between $9,790 and $19,580.
Wisconsin Republicans have been seeking another significant tax cut since the last budget cycle when Evers vetoed their proposals. After the rejection, Republicans started to narrow their tax cuts proposals to focus on retirees and a couple of other groups with the hope of getting Evers’ approval. When negotiations on this year’s budget reached an impasse, Evers had said he was willing to support Republicans’ tax goals, but he wanted agreements from them, too. 
The proposal also includes an exclusion from income taxes for retirees that would reduce the state’s revenues by $395 million in 2025-26 and $300 million in 2026-27.
“This isn’t a high-income oriented kind of thing,” Marklein said during the meeting. “It just helps a lot of average people in the state of Wisconsin, so it’s very good tax policy.” 
Democrats appeared unimpressed with the tax proposal. 
The Legislative Fiscal Bureau told lawmakers that the income tax change would lead to about a maximum impact of $253 annually for married joint filers, $190 annually for single filers and $127 for married separate filers. 
“So roughly $5 a week for a married couple,” McGuire said. 
McGuire said that Democrats just have the perspective that Wisconsin could invest more in the priorities that residents have been expressing. 
“We heard from a lot of people about what they need,” McGuire said in reference to school districts. “We also know that as they’ve been attempting to get those funds they’ve had to go to referendums across the state, and… we think that’s harming communities and making it more difficult for people. As a perspective, we believe that that’s a good place to invest in dollars.” 
Tech colleges
The committee also voted to provide additional funding for the Wisconsin technical colleges, though it is, again, significantly less than what was requested by Evers and by the system.
The proposal will provide an additional $13 million to the system. This includes $7 million in general aid for the system of 16 technical colleges, $2 million in aid meant for grants for artificial intelligence, $3 million for grants for textbooks and nearly $30,000 to support the operations of the system. 
Evers had proposed the state provide the system with $45 million in general aid
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) said the differences between Evers’ proposals and what Republicans offered were stark. 
“We hear my GOP colleagues talk about worker training all the time and this is their opportunity to make sure that our technical colleges have the resources that they need to make sure that we are training an adequate workforce,” Johnson said, noting that the state could be short by 1,000 nurses (many of whom start their education in technical colleges) by 2030. “I’ve never had an employer complain about having an educated workforce, not once, but I have heard employers say that Wisconsin lacks the skill sets and educational skills they need. It seems my Republican colleagues are more concerned with starving our institutions of higher education, rather than making sure they have the resources they need.” 
Testin said the proposal was not a cut and that Republicans were investing in technical colleges. 
“We see there’s value in our technical colleges because they are working with the business community … getting students through the door quicker with less debt,” Testin said. “Any conversations that this is a cut is just unrealistic. These are critical investments in the technical system.”

The owner of a Florida business that sells medical equipment has been indicted in Vermont on federal charges alleging that his company submitted false claims to Medicare for reimbursement.
A federal grand jury in Burlington indicted Donald Jani on Thursday on charges of attempted health care fraud and committing health care fraud. 
Jani was the co-owner of CSS Pain Relief Inc,, a company based in Fort Pierce, Florida, and an enrolled Medicare provider, according to the indictment. Medicare is a federally funded health care program providing medical services to elderly and disabled people across the country.
Jani and other unnamed co-conspirators between August 2020 and April of this year took part in a scheme to defraud Medicare by submitting fraudulent claims for medical equipment, such as back braces and glucose monitors, for his company’s customers, the indictment stated. 
The claims, the charging document stated, were for customers from several parts of the country, including Medicare beneficiaries in Vermont. 
In total, according to the indictment, Jani’s company submitted 2,252 claims for Medicare reimbursement for medical equipment that was “purportedly provided to 894” people throughout the United States. 
The Florida company submitted $1.9 million in Medicare claims and received $790,000 in reimbursements, the filing stated. 
The indictment does not provide a breakdown of how many of the alleged false claims involved Vermonters.
Medicare reimbursements are paid out if a claim has been determined to be medically necessary by a prescribing provider, according to the indictment. The claims submitted by Jani’s company, the filing added, allegedly contained “false representations,” including in cases where medical equipment was never provided to a customer.

The California Legislature has rejected many of the spending cuts Gov. Gavin Newsom is seeking to close a $12 billion budget deficit, relying on internal borrowing to put off difficult decisions.


The California Legislature passed a state budget today that relies more on borrowing than spending cuts to close a projected $12 billion deficit, aiming to push off difficult decisions about priorities even as that gap is only expected to grow in future years.
The $325 billion legislative spending plan, which was approved by the Democratic majority along largely partisan lines, is something of a formality, because lawmakers are constitutionally required to pass a balanced budget by June 15 or forgo their pay.
Having rejected many of the cuts to social services that Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed last month to stabilize California’s finances long-term, they must now negotiate a compromise in the coming weeks, with the July 1 start of the fiscal year looming.
The two sides remain billions of dollars apart, particularly on Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for the poor, as well as home health services, public transit, higher education and raises for state workers.
Democratic leaders said they want to delay painful cuts by a few years to give themselves more time to find another solution that doesn’t “balance the budget on the backs of the most vulnerable” — and perhaps, as one lawmaker put it this week, wait for a “miracle” turnaround in California’s economy.
“The worst outcome here, though, would be to make cuts that we ultimately realize we didn’t need to make — to throw people off safety net programs and then come back and realize, you know what, the projections were off, that wasn’t something that was necessary,” Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, the Encino Democrat who chairs the Assembly budget committee, told reporters after the vote. “We could be in a totally different world six months from now.”
A major point of contention is Medi-Cal, which is driving a large portion of the deficit. The state expanded services significantly in recent years and costs are now rising faster than anticipated after more new patients enrolled than projected. Lawmakers allocated billions of dollars in additional funding to the program this spring to keep it solvent.
Newsom proposed major changes to address those structural issues, including freezing enrollment for adults living in the country illegally, who became newly eligible last year, as well as adding a $100 monthly premium and cutting long-term care and dental benefits for those who maintain their coverage. The governor also wants to eliminate coverage for weight loss drugs like Ozempic and reinstate a strict asset test for seniors, which was recently eliminated.
The Legislature has accepted some of those proposals, such as the enrollment freeze and stopping coverage of weight loss drugs, and scaled back others, including the asset test. Lawmakers want to lower the monthly premium for undocumented immigrants to $30, give those who lose their Medi-Cal coverage because they cannot pay it a chance to re-enroll, delay cutting their dental benefits and maintain their long-term care benefits.
Even that potential compromise has been anathema to some Democrats, who spoke out against what they deemed a “two-tiered health care system” during the floor debate, urging a no vote or asking the Legislature to instead consider raising taxes on billionaires.
“We cannot contribute to the fear and suffering of communities across our state, and I implore us to consider alternatives,” said Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez, an Arleta Democrat, who was nearly in tears as she told her colleagues that she was offended by the budget bill.
The legislative plan also rejects a Newsom proposal to cap overtime hours for in-home supportive service providers and eliminate those benefits for adults living in the country illegally. 
It restores funding the governor had sought to eliminate for family planning clinics; the University of California, California State University and student financial aid; and public transit. It moves forward with $767 million in raises for state employees that Newsom asked to pause and introduces funding for other legislative priorities, including more than $900 million for affordable housing construction and mortgage assistance for first-time homebuyers. It proposes lending up to $1.75 billion from the state for local governments in Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area transit agencies dealing with their own budget crunches.
All of that would add billions of dollars in spending, next year and ongoing, above Newsom’s plan — which already relies on shifting money meant to pay for climate projects and Medi-Cal provider reimbursements, and pulling $7.1 billion out of a rainy-day reserve fund to close the revenue gap. To pay for it, the Legislature seeks to borrow even more from state special funds.

Their approach could be difficult to maintain given the state’s grim fiscal outlook, with an annual budget shortfall projected to grow to $30 billion within the next three years. Turmoil in the stock market and key California industries caused by Trump’s sweeping new tariffs, as well as anticipated federal funding cuts, could deepen that hole.
“This budget was really passed on a hope,” state Sen. Roger Niello, a Roseville Republican who serves as vice chair of the Senate budget committee, told reporters. “A budget that is passed on hope is a budget that is destined for trouble.”
Out of touch with Californians on spending?
And it increasingly does not reflect the will of California voters.
The Public Policy Institute of California has been surveying residents since 2003 on whether they prefer having higher taxes and a state government that provides more services or lower taxes and a state government that provides fewer services.
While Californians narrowly expressed a preference for higher taxes and more services for more than 20 years, that has recently flipped. PPIC’s latest survey released this week found that 55% of Californians now would rather have lower taxes and fewer services — although that is only true of about a third of Democrats.
The survey also found that 56% of California adults think it’s a bad idea to dip into the rainy-day fund to help balance the budget, even as an equal number support some combination of spending cuts, revenue increases and borrowing. And 58% now oppose providing health care coverage for undocumented immigrants, a complete reversal from when the question was last asked two years ago.
Mark Baldassare, director of the PPIC survey, told CalMatters the shifting political landscape tracks with an increasing number of respondents in recent years who believe the state is headed in the wrong direction and that there are bad economic times ahead.
“There’s so much pessimism about what the year ahead might look like, both in California and the nation, that there’s really a desire to shrink down the size of government and expectations that we had previously,” he said. “Voters are just not convinced that we’re not going to be in times where we can afford all the things that we want from government.”
State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, dismissed the results of one poll. He contends that most Californians, asked if they want to cut specific programs such as funding for community health clinics or kick people off their health care, would say no.
“Yes, Californians want to have government that is run well and efficiently. I want that, too,” Wiener told reporters following the budget vote. “But Californians have shown over and over again that they care deeply about making sure that we have these basic services.”
A few Democrats agreed during the floor debate today that California needed to “right-size” its spending, especially with heavy cuts to federal funding likely coming later this year.
But most defended their plan as striking the right balance between fiscal responsibility and upholding California’s values, generating intense criticism from Republicans.
“Let’s be practical. We can’t be all things to all people, but we can be responsible to the critical issues that make California a great state,” said Assemblymember Diane Dixon, a Newport Beach Republican, who cited wildfire management and home health services as priorities that the Legislature should focus on funding. “We can’t be perfect, which means we can’t do everything.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/031325_Assembly-Floor_FG_CM_22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

Legislators, cutting $3.5 billion in overall funding, endorsed a freeze on state health care for undocumented immigrants but want lower premiums and other changes In Newsom’s proposal. Democrats are divided. 



As California lawmakers grapple with a multibillion-dollar deficit and looming federal cuts that could undo the state’s health policies for immigrants, they’re banking on a tenuous budget strategy: hope.
Legislators today rejected some of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s cost-saving proposals to limit Medi-Cal for immigrants without legal status, and expanded others. And in the long run, they hope that some good financial news will help them handle the rising costs of the state health insurance and preserve future access for immigrants. 
Newsom in May proposed freezing Medi-Cal enrollment for immigrants 19 and older without permanent legal status, canceling dental care and implementing a $100 monthly copay for immigrants.
In contrast, the legislators want to expand that Medi-Cal freeze to block enrollment by more people — all non-citizens with “unsatisfactory immigration status,” which includes some legal permanent residents. But they also want some provisions designed to help immigrants: Stipulating that people already enrolled in Medi-Cal will not “age out” and awarding a six-month grace period to re-enroll if they fall off of the program because their income rises temporarily or other disqualifications.
The lawmakers also want to lower the $100 monthly premium Newsom proposed for immigrants to $30 and limit it to adults 19 through 59, and delay elimination of immigrant dental benefits for two years, until 2027. They also rejected canceling home care for immigrants.
Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, a Democrat from Santa Rosa, said earlier this week that the Legislature’s budget reverses the most “draconian” of Newsom’s cuts. 
The Legislature’s budget cuts $3.5 billion from overall state spending and borrows or delays $8.8 billion of spending during the 2025-26 budget year. During the next budget year, cuts will grow to $12 billion. 
Today’s Assembly vote was 57-19 in favor of the budget plan, including one Democrat, Joaquin Arambula of Fresno, voting against it and three Assemblymembers not casting a vote. The Senate vote was 26 to 8, with one Democrat,  María Elena Durazo, opposing it and six senators not casting a vote.
The Legislature and Newsom have two weeks, until June 27, to negotiate a final budget deal. The governor’s office didn’t immediately respond to questions about the legislators’ Medi-Cal budget.
Lawmakers from both parties, as well as health advocates, have heavily criticized both budget proposals — though for different reasons.
Health equity advocates say the budget reneges on promises lawmakers and Newsom made over the past several years to provide health care for all Californians regardless of immigration status. 
Kiran Savage-Sangwan, executive director of the group California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, said the Legislature’s budget is “deeply disappointing.” 
“While the Legislature’s proposal is not as destructive as the…Governor’s May Revision, it still buys into the flawed premise that immigrant communities are less worthy of care that keeps people healthy.”KIRIN SAVAGE-SANGWAN, CALIFORNINA PAN-ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK 
“While the Legislature’s proposal is not as destructive as the devastating reductions proposed in the Governor’s May Revision, it still buys into the flawed premise that immigrant communities are less worthy of care that keeps people healthy,” Savage-Sangwan said in a statement.
Republican lawmakers, who are largely boxed out of budget negotiations, say continuing coverage for non-citizens is fiscally irresponsible because it could come at the cost of services for citizens. Assemblymember James Gallagher, who is the leader of Assembly Republicans, said Medi-Cal is “falling apart,” with inadequate money and providers to serve patients. 
Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance for low-income Californians, covers 15 million people, including 1.6 million immigrants. It has become a flashpoint in national and state debates over rising health care costs. California last year spent $8.5 billion on immigrant health care alone, and projections indicate that it will cost more than $12 billion in the upcoming year.
Lawmakers earlier this year appropriated additional funds to Medi-Cal to stave off a $6.2 billion shortfall. Growing senior enrollment and pharmaceutical costs accounted for most of the shortfall, but about $2.7 billion came from unanticipated enrollment growth of immigrants.
While the Legislature’s proposal softens some of Newsom’s language to freeze enrollment and implement monthly premiums, it doesn’t eliminate the changes nor does it identify new revenue sources that could sustain its rapidly growing expenses. Instead, Democratic leaders have laid most of the blame for California’s deficit on President Donald Trump’s tariffs, and said they’re banking on a future economic upturn to prevent cuts. 
“We have pushed things out for two years, because hopefully there will be a miracle, and we find ourselves at a better point for revenue,” said state Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson, chair of the health budget subcommittee and a Democrat from La Mesa, during a recent press conference.
Sen. Scott Wiener, budget chair and Democrat from San Francisco, pushed back on the idea of a miracle alleviating the state’s financial woes but said the state’s revenues frequently change unexpectedly. In 2020 and 2021, California’s budget swung wildly from a brief recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to a historic surplus because of the state’s reliance on capital gains taxes. 
“We have pushed things out for two years, because hopefully there will be a miracle, and we find ourselves at a better point for revenue.”SEN. AKILAH WEBER PIERSON 
Other lawmakers say tax returns from Los Angeles County, which have been delayed until October because of the January wildfires, may also provide some relief.
“You never know. In a year, two years, three years, our revenue could be very different from what we’re projecting,” Wiener said.
Unhappy Democrats
Some Democrats are among the most vocal critics of the budget.
Many members of the Latino Caucus, which pushed for the expansion of Medi-Cal for more than a decade, say the enrollment freeze and the monthly premium create a “two-tiered” health care system that makes immigrants second-class residents.
State Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Democrat from Van Nuys, said in a statement earlier this week that McGuire removed her from the budget health subcommittee because of her opposition to cuts for immigrants. McGuire’s office did not respond to questions about why she was removed.
On the floor today, Menjivar, who abstained from voting on the budget, said her vote wasn’t needed for the budget to pass, but her constituents needed to know she fought for them. 
“Your community is my community and we’re suffering right now and hurting. I need to be able to stand firm and tall for my constituents and say this is why I dissented,” Menjivar said.
Senate Majority Leader and Latino Caucus Chair Lena Gonzalez, from Long Beach, urged Newsom and other lawmakers to protect “health care for all.”
Other Democrats defended their choices.
“We are keeping the promises that we made,” Weber Pierson said on the Senate floor. “No one will be disenrolled from Medi-Cal. That means no one currently covered will automatically lose their health care coverage.”
Unhappy Republicans
In a rare showing of bipartisanship, a handful of Republicans opposed another Newsom proposal, which would reduce in-home supportive services that many seniors and people with disabilities rely on. But they criticize the choice to continue offering health care for immigrants, especially with a large deficit.
Newsom is “trying to prop up this faulty system, and a big part of it was expanding it to illegal immigrants. It’s not fiscally feasible. It’s ballooning the budget out of control,” Gallagher said.
Gov. Newsom is “trying to prop up this faulty system, and a big part of it was expanding it to illegal immigrants. It’s not fiscally feasible. It’s ballooning the budget out of control.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER JAMES GALLAGHER
State Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican from Roseville and ranking minority member on the budget committee, said the Democrats’ proposal relies on budget gimmicks, such as delayed spending or fund shifts, and fails to address the structural deficit caused by growing Medi-Cal costs. 
Niello pointed out that the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office projects steep deficits for the next three budget years. 
“Hoping against hope, that’s not a good budget strategy,” Niello said. “What you should do is hope for better, but prepare for the worst, and we’re not preparing for the worst. We’re not even preparing for the negative, reasonable expectation that we’re looking at over the next three or four budget years.”
Unhappy health advocates
In past years, the Medi-Cal expansion to immigrants has been popular with some Central Valley Republicans supporting it. But recent polls indicate Californians have mixed feelings about providing Medi-Cal to people who are not citizens. 
In a new poll commissioned by the California Endowment, 56% of likely voters supported allowing all low-income Californians regardless of immigration status to use Medi-Cal. But a Public Policy Institute of California poll published Thursday shows nearly the opposite, with 58% of adults opposing health care for immigrants without legal status. That’s in contrast to 2023 and 2021 polls from the institute showing clear majorities of Californians supported health care for immigrants.
Still, health advocates who have pushed for the expansion said the Legislature is callously sacrificing the health care of immigrants.
Amanda McAllister-Wallner, executive director of Health Access California, said lawmakers have not proposed any real solutions to keep health access for immigrants intact. Instead, they accepted Newsom’s framework to scale it back, she said. 
That is especially troubling, she said, because deep federal funding cuts likely to be approved before the end of the year will cause California even more financial pain. One cut approved by House Republicans last month in the federal budget bill punishes states that give health care to immigrants by reducing their federal reimbursements.
“If they’re not willing to fight now, I’m worried about that,” McAllister-Wallner said.

Mark Mullet, when he was running for governor. He’s now running to be mayor of Issaquah after retiring from the Legislature. (Photo courtesy of Mark Mullet gubernatorial campaign)Former Washington state lawmaker Mark Mullet didn’t break any laws when he accepted contributions to his campaign for Issaquah mayor in December, a judge ruled Friday.
Issaquah Municipal Court Judge Scott Stewart dismissed a complaint against Mullet, saying the city ordinance he was accused of violating, which restricted when candidates could receive donations, is unconstitutional.
Stewart ruled from the bench following a hearing that lasted a little over five minutes. He later issued a one-page order stating the city’s limitation violates the First Amendment right to donate to political campaigns.
“This unconstitutional law was left on the books too long. As mayor, I look forward to fixing inconsistencies in our laws like this one,” Mullet said afterwards.
The city pretty much conceded last month, informing the judge that it would defer to his decision.
Mullet, a Democrat and ex-state senator who ran unsuccessfully for governor last year, launched his mayoral campaign in December. That month, he raised $4,478.34.
A complaint filed in February accused him of violating an Issaquah law that says candidates can only fundraise in the same calendar year as the election for the office they seek. Therefore, he needed to wait until Jan. 1 because the mayoral race is on the November ballot.
Had the judge upheld the law, Mullet could have been ordered to surrender his December haul to the city as a penalty.
The Issaquah City Council passed that ordinance in May 2009, and it took effect on June 1 of that year. It also imposed a $500 cap on donations that is not affected by Friday’s ruling.
That same year, Mullet won a seat on the city council. He has said he recalled the debate on the city law focused on the contribution limit, not the timing for accepting donations. Mullet served on the council until 2013 when he entered the Legislature.
Mullet never disputed the facts. He questioned the legality of the ordinance and noted no other city in the state had such a rule restricting when contributions could be collected. 
In a May 19 letter to the court, Issaquah Prosecuting Attorney Alexa McBarron attached a February ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas, which said the city of Austin’s ban on fundraising outside a one-year period is unconstitutional.
Mullet and City Councilwoman Lindsey Walsh are competing to be Issaquah’s next mayor. 
In March, Walsh took a swipe at her opponent, saying she knew the rules and that it was important “that if somebody is going to lead the city, they respect and follow the laws.”
She declined to comment on Friday’s outcome.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mullet-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Several Arkansas cities are slated to be the scene of organized “No Kings” demonstrations Saturday, as part of a national protest against President Donald Trump’s policies and actions during his second term.
A map on the No Kings website shows 15 demonstrations are planned in Arkansas. In addition to Little Rock and Fayetteville, other demonstrations are planned for Bentonville, Fort Smith, Texarkana, Monticello, Jonesboro, Paragould, West Memphis, Hot Springs, Benton/Bryant, Russellville, Eureka Springs, Harrison and Mountain Home.
The demonstrations coincide with Flag Day, the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army and Trump’s 79th birthday. A large-scale military parade, costing as much as $45 million is planned for Washington, D.C. Although the Army’s anniversary celebration isn’t officially tied to Trump’s birthday, the president has had such an event on his wish list since his first term. 
“June 14, Flag Day, is when President Donald Trump is holding a military parade in the nation’s capital, wasting tens of millions of taxpayer dollars as a birthday gift to himself while his administration defies checks on his power, undermines our civil rights and tries to strip away essential benefits from veterans, seniors, hungry children and others,” the organizers of the No Kings protest in Fayetteville, Indivisible NWA, wrote in a press release.
The planned protests come as tensions in Los Angeles have flared in recent days due to arrests of immigrants the Trump administration says are in the country. The arrests led to large protests occasionally marred by violence. In response to the protests, Trump federalized the California National Guard over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom in order to push back what he described as a “Migrant Invasion,” and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth promptly ordered them into Los Angeles in the name of protecting federal law enforcement.
A federal court Thursday issued a temporary restraining order returning the National Guard to state control, calling the Trump administration’s actions “illegal.” An appeals court temporarily stayed the ruling soon after.
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders chimed in on the L.A. protests while in the nation’s capital earlier this week, saying that unlike Newsom, she would call the Trump administration for assistance if protests similar to the ones in California broke out in Arkansas. 
When contacted for comment on whether state resources would be utilized in response to protests this weekend, a spokesperson for Sanders directed the Advocate to the Arkansas National Guard.
“The Arkansas National Guard always stands ready to support the needs of the state, when directed by the Governor. At this time, we’ve received no request for military support,” Arkansas National Guard spokesperson Bob Oldham said in an email.
Jan Amann, one of Indivisible NWA’s co-leaders, said the emphasis is and always will be having a peaceful, nonviolent protest. She added that there will be marchers in the crowd who have been trained in deescalation techniques.
Indivisible NWA is trying to get attention, Amann said. The group has been protesting weekly in front of U.S. Rep. Steve Womack’s office and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton’s office in Rogers in attempts to have conversations with them, but their requests for a conversation or a townhall have not been acknowledged, she said.
Amann said she felt confident they were well-prepared for Saturday’s demonstrations. While anything can happen, especially when it comes to “kneejerk” reactions from individuals, the advantage to having a protest in Fayetteville is how experienced local law enforcement is with handling large crowds with opposing viewpoints, thanks to the presence of the Arkansas Razorbacks and Razorback Stadium.
“They know what to watch for,” Amann said. “Some people come [to protests] wanting to agitate. … When you’re getting a bunch of people with differing points of view, we need to expect that there might be something, but the whole key is preparation.”
Gracie Ziegler, a spokesperson for the city of Fayetteville, echoed Amann in saying the city was well prepared. She said preparations have been thorough, and that the protest organizers have been very communicative. She said the city did not anticipate major issues.
“The police department is aware of the plans, and they’ll be present to make sure everybody stays safe and peaceful, which is the goal of the organizers. They’ve all been in really good communication,” Ziegler said.
Amann said that while the NWA protest would be “rain or shine,” they were keeping an eye on the weather. If more severe weather affects the protest, it likely won’t go forward since their protest permit is for a specific period of time.
Other protests will happen in Little Rock, where organizers wrote online that demonstrators will cross the Broadway Street Bridge to North Little Rock. The Advocate was not able to get in touch with protest organizers in Little Rock.
Little Rock Police Department spokesperson Mark Edwards said the department has “a plan in place” for the protests, confirming that additional officers would be on-hand. He would not confirm whether the department would shut down the bridge, saying it was “premature to say what we’ll do. A lot of it will be dictated by the scene and the circumstances.”
“The goal is always for people to be able to — on both sides — to be able to protest in peace, and you want everybody to be safe,” Edwards said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250405_Fayetteville-Rally-6-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

Free.,Radiation exposure fund backed by Missouri’s Hawley included in U.S. Senate mega-bill,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/radiation-exposure-fund-backed-missouris-hawley-included-us-senate-mega-bill,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri praised the addition of radiation exposure compensation funds in the Senate version of the costly “one big beautiful” budget reconciliation bill that extends and expands tax cuts and reduces funding from social safety net programs.Hawley, a Republican, said Friday the proposed revival and expansion of the fund for Americans in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Wyoming and the Navajo Nation marks a “tremendous day for the people of Missouri and for nuclear radiation survivors across the country.”“This is a chance, finally, to make it right,” Hawley said on a call with reporters.“All of this is caused by the federal government's negligence in its testing program and its disposal program, where repeatedly the government, over the years, exposed citizens unwillingly and unwittingly to nuclear radiation,” Hawley said.Lawmakers on the Republican-led Senate Committee on the Judiciary included the bipartisan legislation in the panel’s text for the massive budget reconciliation bill, which the panel released Thursday. Hawley is a member of the committee.The complex budget process combines legislation from 10 Senate committees and only requires a simple majority to get through the chamber.If approved by the Senate, lawmakers in both chambers would then need to reconcile their separate versions. The House version does not include a reauthorization of the radiation exposure fund.Radiation exposure fundThe Radiation Exposure Compensation Fund, often called RECA, was established in 1990 and pays one-time sums to those who developed certain diseases after working on U.S. nuclear tests and to those who lived in counties downwind from test explosion sites in Arizona, Nevada and Utah.Uranium industry workers who were employed in 11 states who subsequently developed qualifying diseases also qualify.The U.S. conducted more than 1,000 atomic weapons tests from 1945 to 1992 — the first at the Trinity Test site near Alamogordo, New Mexico, where the U.S. tested the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project prior to dropping the weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, at the end of World War II.The Department of Justice administered the fund before it ended in June 2024, and by June 2022 had approved $2.3 billion in benefits.The Senate overwhelmingly passed the bipartisan bill in March 2024 but it died in the House.If the lawmakers approve the legislation as part of the budget reconciliation package, the fund would reach areas including in Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, where communities were impacted by radioactive waste dumping, uranium processing and other activities surrounding the testing.The bill would also expand downwind areas to include Colorado, Idaho, Montana and New Mexico and increase the one-time compensation sums to victims or surviving family members up to $100,000.Dawn Chapman, a Missouri advocate for radioactive waste cleanup and co-founder of Just Moms STL, told reporters on the Friday morning call that generations in the St. Louis area have suffered “extreme amounts of devastation in the form of illnesses.”“If you take a hard look at our bipartisan RECA family as we call ourselves, you'll see that we are made up of so many different backgrounds, so many different communities, so many different faiths,” she said.“And we understand politically right now that there's a lot going on with this big package. We're just hopeful that this is the one thing in this bill that everybody will agree is a great thing, and not touch and leave it in there and let us have our justice and peace.”Negotiations ongoingRepublicans have wrangled with limiting the price tag of the mega-bill as they aim to carry out President Donald Trump’s campaign promises of extending and expanding tax cuts, which cost roughly $3.9 trillion according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.To offset the massive costs, the House-passed version cuts social safety net programs and clean energy incentives.By changing eligibility requirements and what Medicaid can cover, the House bill would reduce federal spending on health provisions, including the government health insurance program for low-income individuals, by roughly $902 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.It would also tighten eligibility and shift to states costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, resulting in a $285.7 billion reduction in federal spending, according to CBO.The bill would also eliminate $249 billion in clean energy investment and production tax credits over the next decade.With Senate negotiations in full swing, CBO released an analysis last week revealing the overall bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years.A separate CBO analysis also found the House version would tilt in the favor of higher earners and overall decrease resources for low-income Americans.Hawley, who vows he won’t support cuts to Medicaid in the Senate version, said Friday he’ll continue that stance, even with the added price tag of the RECA fund.“Not cutting Medicaid benefits is hugely, hugely important for me, (and) making sure rural hospitals don't close. Half of the hospitals in Missouri are rural. I don't want to see any of those closed, so I am in hourly contact with leadership in negotiations on this,” he said.Hawley is also pushing to significantly increase the child tax credit to $5,000, up from the temporary $2,500 in the House version. He did not comment directly on the call when a reporter asked whether the increased child tax credit remained a priority for him in the mega-bill.",,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

(George Frey | Getty Images)A legal challenge of West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order allowing religious exemptions to the state’s school vaccine requirements will proceed, despite the state school board voting this week to defy the order.
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice filed the writ of mandamus last month in Kanawha County Circuit Court on behalf of two parents of immunocompromised children. The lawsuit asks the court to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop granting religious exemptions in compliance with Morrisey’s executive order. 
“The lawsuit is still ongoing,” Aubrey Sparks, legal director for ACLU-WV, said Friday. “I think that there are a lot of questions about what [the board of education’s decision] means practically, whether this fixes the issue, or whether it doesn’t. At this point, it’s just too early for us to know the consequences of the school board’s actions, given that Patrick Morrisey is still committed to awarding these exemptions.”
The state school board unanimously voted Wednesday that Superintendent Michele Blatt would issue guidance to county boards of education that schools should follow the state’s existing vaccine mandates, which allow only medical exemptions, rather than the executive order. 
“The intent of the state board is to do what’s best for the 241,000 children, 23,000 educators and 15,000 service personnel in our 629 public schools,” the board wrote in a statement Thursday afternoon. “This includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws.
“The board is constitutionally bound to provide a thorough and efficient system of free schools, and our members remain committed to this charge,” they wrote. 
Sparks said the board’s action introduces a lot of uncertainty both to families who want religious exemptions and families of immunocompromised children who might be at risk if exemptions are granted.
West Virginia’s school vaccine laws are some of the strongest in the country. It’s one of five states that by law allow only medical exemptions for school-required vaccines. Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state to allow religious exemptions.
Despite the order, the Legislature this year rejected Senate Bill 460, which would have made the religious exemptions part of state law. 
Since Morrisey issued the executive order in January, the state Department of Health has granted at least 330 religious exemptions to the vaccine requirements. 
A spokeswoman for the school board said Friday that the exemptions that have already been granted will not be accepted for the upcoming new school year because, per the governor’s instructions, the exemptions must be renewed yearly. 
Alisa Shepler, a school nurse in Wood County, said the state school board’s move is a victory for school nurses and for West Virginia health care more generally. Immunizations protect more than only school children, they also protect immunocompromised people in the community, she said.
Shepler, who is retiring Friday after more than 25 years on the job, said she’s proud of the school board for going against the governor’s order. 
“I think that it’s very telling that our state board of education, they kind of drew a line in the sand,” she said. “And a lot of times, I think states don’t have that backbone, but obviously our state board of education did.”
In a statement Wednesday, a spokesman for the governor’s office said that the state school board is “trampling on the religious liberties of children, ignoring the state’s religious freedom law, and trying to make the state an extreme outlier on vaccine policy when there isn’t a valid public policy reason to do so.”
The governor’s executive order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act, a law signed by former Gov. Jim Justice in 2023 that prohibits government action that substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion unless it serves a compelling government interest and is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.
Sparks said the religious freedom law gives people a process by which to say their rights have been violated, but it does not give the governor the right to ignore, override a duty created by the legislature. 
“What really is underlying this is an attempt at executive power over reach,” Sparks said. “Patrick Morrisey wanted a law passed. He lobbied to get a law passed, and he wasn’t successful at it. He didn’t pull it across the finish line because the Legislature didn’t agree with them. And it’s not a governor’s right or ability to ignore the laws that the Legislature passes just because they don’t like them.”

First quarter exports are down 6% compared to the first quarter of 2024 — and the quarter ended before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, which raised the effective tax on imports to 27%, before courts intervened and Trump reversed or paused some of the taxes. 
Minnesota exports have been hit harder than the country as a whole; nationally, exports were up 3% compared to this time last year.

Trump’s tariffs have prompted retaliation from two of Minnesota’s biggest trade partners: Canada and China, which imposed taxes on goods purchased from the U.S. 
Mexico, Minnesota’s second-biggest trade partner, has largely avoided major tariffs and has not retaliated with new import taxes of its own.
Exports from Minnesota to Mexico, however, have dropped 16%, as the country buys fewer Minnesota-produced vehicles, machines, food byproducts, cereals and iron. Exports to Canada, the state’s biggest buyer, are down 3%.
“On-again, off-again tariffs issued unilaterally by the Trump Administration continue to cause significant uncertainty and concern for Minnesota companies in planning their business strategies, including importing and exporting,” DEED Commissioner Matt Varilek said in a press release.
The effects of tariffs and economic uncertainty are distributed unevenly across states and industries; in nearby Wisconsin, exports have increased 2% compared to the first quarter of 2024. North Dakota’s exports are up 5%, while South Dakota’s are down 11%.
In Minnesota, sellers of vehicles, food byproducts and air and spacecraft have suffered the biggest losses in international markets; for those industries, international sales have dropped by around one-quarter.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/trumptariffs-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)Federal authorities refused a judge’s order Friday to release Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, arguing that the order only barred them from detaining him on the basis of an obscure 1952 law that allows deportations for foreign policy reasons.
U.S. District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz had ruled Wednesday that federal authorities lacked grounds to hold Khalil, a permanent resident who’s been detained since March for helping to organize pro-Palestinian protests. His detention was likely unconstitutional, the judge decreed, ordering authorities to free him or ask the 3d Circuit Court of Appeals by Friday morning to step in.
But in a letter to the court Friday, government attorneys argued they were no longer detaining Khalil based on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and instead held him based on a separate federal statute that allows authorities to keep immigrants in custody during removal proceedings.
“Detaining Khalil based on that other ground of removal is lawful,” the attorneys wrote. “An alien like Khalil may be detained during the pendency of removal proceedings regardless of the charge of removability.”
Secretary of State Marco Rubio in April released a memo justifying Khalil’s deportation that argued his support of pro-Palestinian protests would have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”
Farbiarz on Wednesday had noted the government could argue Khalil, who has no criminal convictions or charges, could be detained because some information on his lawful permanent resident application was allegedly inaccurate. But he’d cautioned that argument would be ineffective here because green card holders are virtually never detained for that reason.
“That strongly suggests that it is the Secretary of State’s determination that drives the Petitioner’s ongoing detention — not the other charge against him,” the judge wrote Wednesday.
Attorney Ian Fernando Hinonangan, who represents Khalil, echoed the judge’s own words and said federal authorities’ reasoning for his continued detention was part of a campaign of retaliation for Khalil’s First Amendment-protected speech.
While the judge’s order allowed officials to continue efforts to remove Khalil that were not based on Rubio’s memo, it did not explicitly permit them to continue detaining him for other reasons, Hinonangan wrote in a Friday declaration.
“The post-hoc charge is an undisputed continuation in the fabric of retaliatory motive and hence ‘carries the taint of unconstitutional conduct,’” Hinonangan said.

Pictured is a 2023 protest over abortion rights at the same location. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderFive years ago, an Atlanta protest that began peacefully ended in chaos with burning police cars and tear gas canisters.
With mass protests over the Trump administration’s policies set to take place around the country Saturday, Georgia’s leaders say they will be prepared if violent elements overtake peaceful protests. Around two dozen protests are scheduled across Georgia with hundreds across the country.
But organizers of the planned “No Kings” event in Atlanta say they’ve taken every step to ensure a morning of peaceful demonstration.
“This is a permitted rally,” said Laura Judge, an activist with the Indivisible Georgia Coalition, one of the main organizers of the Atlanta event. “We went and we talked with local officials and law enforcement to make sure that this is a safe and permitted, peaceful rally. But, you know, we went above and beyond to ensure that there is safety and de-escalation.”
Judge said that means over 100 volunteers, including 28 medics and 37 marshals trained in de-escalation, conflict prevention and crowd safety techniques. Medics will be specifically trained to assist older attendees and with disabilities, and the staff will include a law enforcement liaison to assist with communicating with police.
Georgia’s top leaders have warned against violent escalations. Gov. Brian Kemp vowed “heavy accountability,” and Attorney General Chris Carr issued a statement threatening to charge offenders with domestic terrorism, which comes with a prison sentence of up to 35 years.
“Our attorney general just put a statement out about how protests should look,” Judge said. “And while we’re committed and we want all our attendees to be peaceful and use their First Amendment rights, we don’t want anyone having that threat of being arrested or being detained when we have done everything, we have checked all the boxes to do what is right using our First Amendment.”
Organizers of Columbus’ event recommended an unusual response in case of unexpected behavior.
“In the rare event that individuals outside our organization come to the event and behave in ways that are contrary to our peaceful values, we strongly encourage attendees to sit, hold hands, and listen to to instructions from our trained de-escalators,” reads a post from Indivisible Columbus on social media. “We are 100% committed to and united in peace.”
Speaking at a virtual meeting for nationwide participants Thursday, Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin called for spirited but peaceful protests, saying that violence would play into the hands of their political opponents.
“When some bad actors engage in property destruction or violence, the Trump team says, ‘see, there, now we need to escalate further,’” he said. “And that’s Trump’s plan, rinse and repeat. It’s straight from the authoritarian playbook.”
Britt Jacovich, deputy communications director at the liberal MoveOn advocacy group, echoed Levin’s sentiments.
“Trump wants chaos on camera, and so we shouldn’t give him any footage to use,” she said. “We win by showing the truth. We are joyful, proud, nonviolent, in every corner of the country.”
Judge said problems caused by outside agitators are always a concern for protesters, but volunteers have been trained to deal with potential criminal elements.
“I believe it’s important that at least the organizers and the volunteers are all on the same page knowing who we go to and who we need to work with when things are escalating like that so that we’re not branded as these agitators,” she said. “Because that is not the purpose, our purpose is to show the power belongs to the people and we’re allowed to speak up and we should not just automatically be branded as agitators or instigators.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/abortion-protest-capitol.jpg,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

(Photo by Cecilia Lynch/USDA)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Friday released its renewable fuel standards draft rule which, if finalized, would set record high levels of biofuels to be blended into U.S. transportation fuels. 
Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said the draft rule, which proposes a total 24.02 billion gallon blending level in 2026, is a “very strong starting point for further discussions.” 
Shaw said the association will need time to evaluate the proposal, specifically as it relates to changes in credits for imported fuels and feedstocks. 
According to the proposal, EPA is considering “several regulatory changes” to the RFS program that would reduce the number of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs which is the measuring unit for renewable fuel, for imported renewable fuels and renewable fuels produced from imported feedstocks.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports imported biodiesel feedstocks, like used cooking oil, tallow and canola oil have all increased over the past several years due to the high cost of domestic feedstocks. According to the same report, in the 2023 and 2024 marketing year, the U.S. consumed nearly 30% of biofuel feedstocks exported globally.
The news to prioritize domestic feedstocks was welcomed by Iowa Soybean Association President Brent Swart, who said biomass-based diesel supports “roughly 10% of the price per bushel of soybeans.” 
“Biomass-based diesel has long provided significant value to soybean farmers, helping us weather difficult economic times and supporting our state’s thriving agriculture industry,” Swart said in a statement.
The EPA program sets overall standards and specific standards for different types of biofuels. The draft rules propose biomass-based diesel standards equivalent to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons in 2027. 
These figures are a significant jump from 2025 targets from EPA, which set an annual volume requirement of 3.35 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel.
“This is a significant step toward putting the market back on track,” Swart said. “It is also a long overdue recognition that Iowa farmers, soybean processors and the state’s biodiesel producers, can contribute even more (to) America’s energy output.” 
Swart said the announcement “provides added certainty” for soybean farmers during the growing season and he thanked the Trump administration for supporting “farmers’ critical role” in U.S. energy policy. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said USDA and EPA have “never been more aligned” on the demand for domestically grown biofuels. 
“This is the highest ever Renewable Volume Obligation and it sends a strong signal to the U.S. biofuels industry that President Trump has their backs and gives them the incentive to invest in American products for American consumers and to export around the world,” Rollins said in a statement. 


Biofuels in Iowa: 
Iowa is the leading producer of biofuels in the nation. According to Iowa Soybean Association, the soybean oil used to produce biodiesel in Iowa in 2024 was equivalent to more than 30% of the soybeans grown in the state. 
An IRFA report found that in 2024, the state produced 4.61 billion gallons of fuel ethanol, and the industry provided a market for nearly 60% of Iowa’s 2024 corn crop. 
The same study, however, showed a decline in economic impact from the biofuels industry, and IRFA said entry to the ultra-low carbon fuel market would be the “most cost-effective and impactful” way to revitalize biofuels and corn markets. 


The EPA proposal additionally waives the 2025 cellulosic biofuel volume requirement and reinstates the values through 2026 and 2027, due to a shortfall in the production of the fuels made from nonfood-based renewable feedstocks, like cellulose or lignin.
The draft rule also removes renewable electricity as a qualifying renewable fuel under the program, which follows a move from the Trump administration to block state-specific mandates on emissions that encouraged the use of electric vehicles. 
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst celebrated the move and the EPA announcement in a statement, saying it brings RFS “back on track.” 
“By eliminating the electric vehicle mandate and restoring the RFS’ original focus on liquid transportation fuels, prioritizing domestically grown crops over foreign imports, setting record-high volumes to revitalize the biofuel industry, and adopting safeguards to prevent small refinery waivers from gutting the program—it is clear the Trump administration is committed to championing rural America,” Ernst said. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig similarly applauded the move, including the proposed regulation changes to steer producers away from foreign-made feedstocks. 
“President Trump is once again demonstrating his commitment to showcasing how Iowa-made biofuels can be central to his effort to make America energy dominant,” Naig said in a statement. “Biofuels are a win for drivers and American farmers – they save drivers money at the pump, directly support corn and soybean prices, expand markets for farmers, and support rural jobs and communities.” 
EPA will host a public hearing on the rules July 8. 
Shaw said IRFA plans to work with EPA through the commenting period and to secure a final rule from the agency. 
“Agriculture is hurting, having just endured the largest two-year drop in net farm income in history,” Shaw said. “We need forward leaning RFS blending levels to maximize American energy dominance.”

(Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A three-judge appeals court panel on Friday cleared the way for Kansans to resume changing their gender markers on driver’s licenses, rejecting arguments made by Attorney General Kris Kobach and overturning a lower court ruling.
The Kansas Court of Appeals panel ordered the case return to the district court level to be heard by someone other than Shawnee County District Judge Teresa Watson, who abused her discretion and committed legal and factual errors, according to the Friday ruling.
Judges Karen Arnold-Burger, Stephen Hill and Sarah Warner determined the state would suffer no harm by allowing transgender residents to be identified by their “gender,” which is a personal identity or expression, rather than their “sex,” which relates to reproductive systems. Kobach’s office had argued that the two terms are interchangeable.
The Legislature passed a law in 2023 that requires vital statistics to recognize a person’s biological sex at birth. Kobach sued the Kansas Department of Revenue for continuing to allow transgender residents to change the gender markers on their driver’s license, as the office had done since at least 2007.
From 2011 to 2022, KDOR issued 9,316,937 driver’s licenses. During that period, 380 drivers changed their gender marker.
Watson in 2023 issued a temporary injunction to block changes in gender markers on driver’s licenses. The appeals court, which heard arguments in January, removed that injunction and replaced it with an order to allow changes.
Watson, the higher court said, had committed a legal error by concluding, without any support, that Kobach’s mere allegation that KDOR was violating state law had established irreparable harm. Additionally, the higher court faulted Watson’s conclusion that changing a gender marker could hinder law enforcement officers.
“The problem with the district court’s finding is that the AG presented no evidence to support this claimed injury beyond unsubstantiated speculation,” Arnold-Burger wrote on behalf of the appeals court panel.
In fact, she wrote, “the evidence was overwhelming that there was no harm.”
At the district court level, Shawnee County Sheriff Brian Hill testified that one time, he didn’t say when, he arrested a transgender woman who told him that she was a man. One of the problems with that example, Arnold-Burger wrote, is that he relied on the individual’s “outward appearance,” not their driver’s license. And, she wrote, the same mistake could be made for any cisgender woman who appears less feminine and more masculine than the average woman.
Additionally, the sheriff’s gender confusion didn’t prevent the arrest or immediate discovery of the person’s identity. And, Hill acknowledged that law enforcement officers can’t always rely on a driver’s license anyway because people change their names.
“The district court committed an error of fact by concluding that there was evidence — any evidence beyond mere speculation — to support a finding that law enforcement would be immediately hindered in the identification of suspects, victims, wanted persons, missing persons, detainees, and others if the driver’s license did not display the driver’s sex assigned at birth,” Arnold-Burger wrote.
The appeals court ruling also noted that the Kansas Supreme Court has recognized a distinction between “sex” and “gender” since at least 2002. And it determined that Kobach was unlikely to prevail in the case.
The appeals court panel ordered the case return to the district court level for a hearing before a new judge.
“Because of the district court’s abuse of discretion, the KDOR has been unable to issue reclassifications of gender designations on Kansas driver’s licenses for two years while this litigation languished,” Arnold-Burger wrote.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/4F5A8392-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-13 15:57:13.782636

CHICAGO — Transit agency officials in Chicagoland met this week and formally began the process of planning for next year’s budget, including drawing up plans for major service cuts and potential layoffs.

It’s the latest chapter in an ongoing fight between public transit officials and state lawmakers over funding. Public transportation agencies’ federal COVID-19 relief funds are set to run out in 2026. Despite the funding, ridership on buses and trains still hasn’t reached prepandemic levels.

Now, transit agencies running buses and trains in northern Illinois are facing a $771 million annual combined budget gap — and lawmakers did not pass funding reform legislation by a critical May 31 deadline.

While House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch told Capitol News Illinois last week that lawmakers “have time” to handle the situation, transit officials told a very different story at two meetings this week.

“We have told everyone they needed to act by May 31st or else,” Regional Transportation Authority board member Tom Kotarac said at a board meeting Thursday. “We are in the ‘or else’ phase.”

Officials at the RTA laid out a plan Thursday to handle the monetary uncertainty: create two budgets. In one scenario, budget planners assume the gap is filled, and agencies can move forward with the rough plan approved late last year.

“But we cannot operate on assumptions and pledges of good faith and promises. We just can’t, legally,” RTA government affairs director Rob Nash said.

The RTA board formally asked the agencies it oversees — the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra commuter rail and Pace Suburban Bus — to prepare a budget that assumes no new funding from Springfield before the end of the year. This means a roughly 20% reduction from what the agency expected.

Multiple RTA officials called it the “doomsday” scenario. RTA Chief Financial Officer Kevin Bueso said it would require “catastrophic” cuts. CTA acting President Nora Leerhsen told the CTA board on Wednesday that it was “severe and sobering for all of us and hard to stomach.”

Under both plans, the RTA would institute fare increases in 2026 and administrative “efficiencies” to reduce costs in 2025. The RTA also plans to create an ad hoc task force to plan cuts and manage the year’s unusual budget process.

The austerity measures are not just a piece of political theater. The RTA, under state law, must tell service boards the amount of revenue that will be available to them by Sept. 15 each year and the boards must submit individual budgets based on that revenue. The oversight agency releases preliminary funding amounts for transit planners to use months earlier in July.

Leerhsen said the CTA will continue to operate with its current 2025 service plan, but that over the summer and into the fall, the agency will hold public hearings to “more specifically consider” the consequences of the fiscal cliff.

The September deadline is three weeks before the General Assembly's fall session begins — the earliest that lawmakers are scheduled to meet.

But even if lawmakers meet in October and pass funding reform, officials said that missing their spring deadline has already guaranteed harmful effects.

“I don't want to give anyone false hope that there is still any way to avoid some of these negative impacts,” RTA Executive Director Leanne Redden said. “The negative impacts are here, and now we're going to have to all work together to mitigate the worst of those impacts for as long as possible while the legislature continues to do their work.”

Even if lawmakers pass a new funding mechanism, because of the time it takes to implement new policies, that money might not become available to transit agencies until next summer, either due to far off effective dates on any new laws or the delays of implementing new policies.

Delays in funding would, according to Nash, impose “costs, financial and otherwise, to the system and to riders.”

“We are likely to face a challenge in the first part of 2026 no matter what the General Assembly does at this point,” Nash said during the Thursday RTA board meeting.

What’s next in Springfield

Over the past year, several proposals have been pitched in Springfield to address problems in Chicagoland transit agencies.

Two major proposals came from a coalition of environmentalists and labor unions. On Thursday, representatives of the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and Labor Alliance for Public Transportation, two groups that have occasionally disagreed on how to address transit agencies’ woes, released a joint statement.

The groups said the RTA’s Thursday meeting “unveiled the disastrous consequences of Springfield’s inaction” and called for lawmakers to meet this summer to address the problem.

“We cannot wait any longer — the General Assembly needs to avert further disaster and address the transit fiscal cliff with reforms and dedicated revenue, while working with existing agencies to ensure that we are investing in the future of our transit systems. The time to act is now,” the groups said.

While no proposal received close to the support it needed this spring, one bill made it through the Senate in the final hours of lawmakers’ legislative session.

That bill would have instituted several reforms that had been broadly agreed on, although not unanimous. Certain provisions laying out the balance of power on various boards were opposed by local governments.

Its funding mechanism, however, ignited quick controversy. The provision that sparked the greatest opposition would have instituted a $1.50 tax on package deliveries except on orders of groceries and medicine.

That provision drew near-immediate opposition from businesses and interest groups with influential networks of lobbyists. The major tech lobbying group TechNet, along with Uber, Instacart, DoorDash, Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce and several retail industry groups, registered their opposition.

That bill was not considered in the House, and no bill with a similar funding mechanism was proposed in that chamber.

Paula Worthington, an economist and senior lecturer at the University of Chicago, told Capitol News Illinois that imposing a new tax like the delivery fee would be difficult.

“That is a heavy lift, procedurally, legally,” Worthington said. “You can’t just wave a magic wand.”

Worthington pointed to other states’ systems of transit funding that typically include “some elements of shared burden.” Other states have implemented a “commuter transportation mobility” tax on certain businesses, taxes on road users, or expanding taxes on ride sharing companies. Worthington said Illinois could consider those or other taxes during discussions over the summer to identify a solution.

“But those discussions now need to be out in the public,” Worthington said.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is urging insurers to continue covering vaccinations during pregnancy in an open letter signed by 30 prominent professional health organizations.
Pregnant patients and their infants are vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. In the letter to payers and insurance companies released this week, ACOG stressed the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations and how they protect babies and pregnant people. It was signed by prominent professional groups including the American College of Physicians, Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Public Health Association.
The letter follows U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy children and healthy pregnant patients, sidestepping an established decision process by scientists. Kennedy, who has made false claims questioning vaccine safety, earlier this week fired all 17 experts on the federal vaccine advisory committee panel, replacing them with eight new members, four of whom have spoken out against vaccines.
The Trump administration’s moves have alarmed health experts, who worry about coverage and access to the shot amid the agency’s dismissal of science.

“We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” the letter reads. “Given the historic gaps in research, investment, and support for women’s health, it is essential that all aspects of obstetric and gynecologic care — including COVID-19 vaccination — be grounded in the best available scientific evidence.
Studies have shown babies born following a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have a higher risk of low birth weights, stillbirth and respiratory distress, and data demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.

Pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are also at higher risk of complications such as blood clots, are more likely to be hospitalized in intensive care units or to need ventilators, and are at a higher risk of death, the letter notes.
Payers should make the vaccine available to “pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” the letter reads. Without insurance, a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 shot can cost roughly $140 for adults.
Following the recommendation rollback, public health officials in some states have emphasized their support of COVID-19 vaccines.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, for example, said it “continues to recommend the current COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older,” noting that newborns “depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection.” Wisconsin Medicaid will also continue to cover the shot, the department said in a media release.
Officials in Georgia also said they expect continued coverage of the shot.
In Washington, a spokesperson for the state health agency told local media that the department is advising pregnant people to speak with their provider “to determine if receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is best for them.”
During this year’s legislative sessions, at least seven states introduced legislation aiming to ban or limit mRNA vaccines. Instead of using a weakened or dead version of the actual virus to stimulate an immune response, mRNA vaccines use a genetic code created in a laboratory to tell the body’s cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology.
“The COVID vaccines were a remarkable scientific accomplishment, and they remain the best tool that we have to prevent severe outcomes associated with COVID infection,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, ACOG president, wrote in a statement. “Ob-gyns know that COVID infection during pregnancy can be incredibly dangerous for our pregnant patients — and we know that the vaccine can protect both them and their infants after birth.”
When patients are “forced to pay out of pocket, or to cover high cost sharing,” he wrote, “they are less likely to be able to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”

Other locations included Walmarts in Albuquerque and Santa Fe and an indoor pool in Rio Rancho.
The New Mexico Department of Health reported that two separate travelers were diagnosed with measles cases in the state: an adult with unknown vaccination status and an 18-month old with at least one vaccine.
“These two cases remind us that travel remains an exposure risk when it comes to this contagious virus,” said NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham in a statement. “The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine remains the best protection against measles.”
The travelers’ diagnoses do not impact New Mexico’s measles infections, which remain at 81 cases Friday.
The reported cases may have exposed people at the following places, dates and times:
Rio Rancho
1 to 4 p.m. on Monday, June 2: Rio Rancho Aquatic Center, 745 Loma Colorado NE

NMDOH urged anyone who was possibly exposed to check vaccination status and to stay home if symptoms such as a rash or fever develop. Further questions about testing, vaccinations and potential treatment can be directed to the NMDOH Hotline at 1-833-796-8773.
Measles symptoms do not develop immediately, often between one to three weeks from exposure. People are infectious several days before and after symptoms such as headache, cough, runny nose, red eyes, fever, and spotty red rash appear.
Additional information, such as vaccine clinic hours, is available on NMDOH’s measles webpage.

A court fight in Irvington shows why it's needed.,"A Reach NJ poster along Pacific Ave. in Atlantic City on Feb. 13, 2023. (Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)A state panel on Thursday issued a five-year strategic plan advising New Jersey communities how to spend over $1 billion in national opioid settlement funds they’re expected to receive over the next decade and a half.
The plan comes as an escalating court fight over two “opioid awareness concerts” in Irvington shows such guidance may be overdue.
Investigators from the state comptroller’s office have raised concerns about fraud, misuse of money and contract and ethical improprieties after Irvington paid nearly $370,000 in opioid settlement funds in 2023 and 2024 to two entertainment companies — both tied to a township employee — that ran the concerts, according to a defamation lawsuit Irvington filed in April. The comptroller’s office was set to release a report on investigators’ findings when the township sued to block its release.
The state’s strategic plan announced Thursday — drafted by an advisory council convened in 2023 — offered no definitive answers on whether drug awareness concerts are an acceptable use of settlement funds. Instead, the council said spending should be evaluated on an array of metrics to ensure it is “data-driven and equity-focused.”
The settlement funds come from pharmaceutical companies and others that helped fuel the opioid crisis, and the settlement agreements arose from separate claims by states and local governments. The state of New Jersey and its local governments will each get about half of the more than $1.1 billion in funding expected to flow to New Jersey through 2038.
Thursday’s plan is intended to guide the disbursement of the state’s share of settlement funds, “though hopefully it will prove a helpful tool for subdivision decision-making,” said Tom Hester, a state Department of Human Services spokesman.
“The state does not provide legal advice nor approve or deny local proposals related to subdivision settlement funds. Subdivisions are encouraged to review the national and state subdivision agreements for guidance on how these funds may be used,” he said.
County and municipal officials must publicly report each year how they spend settlement funds, which began disbursing in 2022.
Some reported that they haven’t started spending yet. But those that have invested in things like direct services to people struggling with addiction, drug-awareness school assemblies and community events, and Narcan training and supplies for government employees.
The reports give a snapshot of the various ways officials have spent funds, including:

Union County paid for transportation to treatment centers, with the goal of removing that barrier to recovery.
Salem County used some funds to build up its overdose fatality review team.
Paterson spent part of its distribution on medication-assisted treatment.
Middlesex County spent some on “go bags” — filled with Narcan, drug-testing strips, addiction treatment information, and more — to give people discharged from the county jail.

Irvington was the only municipality that used its funds to host concerts, according to the filings. Berkeley Township reported that it shared educational materials on safe medication disposal and drug drop box locations at an annual scheduled summer concert series — but did not spend settlement funds to do so.
In Irvington’s 2024 filing, township officials reported that Irvington has received almost $1.1 million in settlement funds since 2022.
They reported that they opted to host the opioid awareness concerts after doing “internal research on the benefits and effectiveness of concerts and festivals in making the community and stakeholders (aware of) the impact of opioid use and misuse.” They did not engage the public to help decide how to use the funds, have a strategic plan, complete a risk assessment for demographic or geographic impact or measure key performance indicators to track the success or impact of the spending, according to their filings.
Local officials unsure what would be sanctioned uses of opioid settlement funds “should seek legal advice from their own counsel and/or guidance ‌from their respective County Advisory Council,” said Allison Inserro, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office.
The plan’s particulars
The strategic plan recommends that officials plotting how to spend settlement funds should prioritize harm reduction services, addiction treatment and social services that fix problems, like housing insecurity, that can impede recovery.
Its overarching goals are to reduce overdose deaths, remove barriers to treatment and build “a robust monitoring and evaluation framework” to track the funds’ impact and ensure accountability, according to a Department of Human Services announcement.
Overdose deaths have fallen in New Jersey since an epidemic high of 3,171 in 2022, with 2,816 overdose fatalities reported in 2023, 1,813 in 2024, and 490 so far this year, state data shows. Health officials largely have credited harm reduction efforts for the decline.
The state already has allocated at least $120 million of the funds it has received. State officials announced last year that $95 million would support housing, harm reduction and mobile units to deliver medication-assisted treatment and $25 million would go toward free legal services for people struggling with addiction, an initiative to reduce teenage addiction and emergency response needs like xylazine-testing kits to reduce misuse of a horse sedative known as “tranq” or “zombie drugs.”
Human Services Commissioner Sarah Adelman chairs the advisory council that issued the strategic plan Thursday.
“While no amount of settlement payments can undo the harm and human toll of the opioid crisis, we can and must ensure New Jersey uses the funding wisely to help our residents and communities recover,” Adelman said in a statement.
Hundreds of people who have struggled with addiction shared their thoughts with the advisory council, resulting in a “strong plan that prioritizes evidence-based harm reduction, treatment, and recovery services,” she said.
Meanwhile, in Irvington …
Late last month, a state appeals judge granted Irvington’s request to block the comptroller’s office from releasing its findings on the drug awareness concerts.
The office already had given early copies, as is its practice, to Gov. Phil Murphy, Senate President Nick Scutari, and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin. So last week, Judge Mark K. Chase made an unusual move — he extended the injunction to them, forbidding “any government entity or official” from distributing the comptroller’s report on Irvington any further.
Irvington’s attorneys have complained that state investigators did not let them adequately respond to their findings.
In a brief filed last week, they wrote that the report “reads like a ham-handed and overly-broad Drew Pearson serial with an accusatory purpose.” They warned that it threatens to irreparably harm the township’s reputation, endanger vendor contracts, hurt the township’s ability to carry out public health initiatives, and erode the trust of state and federal officials who interact with the township.
“All of those harms would be especially pernicious in Irvington, a predominantly Black and minority community, which has historically faced discrimination in oversight and in governance,” the attorneys wrote.
But Friday afternoon, the comptroller’s office snagged a win.
Chase denied Irvington’s injunction request, calling the matter moot because the report had already been released to 
Murphy and top legislative leaders.
Besides, the comptroller’s office had given the township 15 days to respond to its draft report, Chase added. Officials “failed to do so. They now complain of the contents of the report,” the judge wrote.
He gave Irvington until 4 p.m. Monday to ask the state Supreme Court for relief, saying his stay on the report’s release should remain in place until then.



But, the judge added, “any further suppression of OSC’s report hinders its statutory mandate and oversight role, and directly harms the public interest.”

Newsom lambasts Trump for giving immigrants’ health data to deportation officials,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/06/newsom-trump-immigrant-data-deportation-medicaid/,"Many undocumented immigrants have long feared that their Medi-Cal data would be used against them. Newsom calls it ""an abuse.""","In summary
Many undocumented immigrants have long feared that their Medi-Cal data would be used against them. Newsom calls it “an abuse.”


Calling the move “legally dubious” and an “abuse,” Gov. Gavin Newsom today heavily criticized the Trump administration after reports surfaced that personal medical information — including immigration status — is being shared with deportation officials.
The governor’s comments come as protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are being held in parts of downtown Los Angeles for the eighth day in a row. 
According to the Associated Press, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to give the Department of Homeland Security immigration and other medical data for millions of non-citizens. The data transfer includes information about California enrollees and other states that allow immigrants without legal status to enroll in health services, according to the AP. 
The order overturns longstanding federal policy that prohibits the agency that oversees the nation’s publicly operated health programs from sharing private enrollee data with other federal agencies.
During the first Trump administration, many groups that assist people with Medi-Cal enrollment reported high levels of mistrust of government programs and declining enrollment because of the fear that it could be used to refuse citizenship applications or initiate deportation proceedings. 
“Sharing Medicaid beneficiary information with the Department of Homeland Security – which is itself legally dubious – will jeopardize the safety, health, and security of those who will undoubtedly be targeted by this abuse, and Americans more broadly,” Newsom said in a statement. 
In a letter sent to states last month, Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said he was putting states “on notice” that he would no longer allow “federal dollars to be diverted” for immigrant health care. 
“Medicaid is not, and cannot be, a backdoor pathway to subsidize open borders,” Oz said in a news release accompanying the letter. 
Trump administration officials, including Oz, have previously claimed without evidence that states like California are illegally using federal money to pay for immigrant health care. 
Newsom’s office confirmed that the state’s Medicaid agency, the Department of Health Care Services, responded earlier this year to a federal data request to show that the state was not improperly using federal funds, which cannot be used to pay for health services for immigrants without legal status. 
Six other states and the District of Columbia allow immigrants to enroll in some state-funded health programs, but none are as expansive as California’s. All states are required to provide emergency Medicaid to immigrants.
California currently uses more than $8.5 billion in annual state revenue to provide coverage to about 1.6 million immigrants through Medi-Cal, the state’s version of Medicaid.
Newsom’s office did not say whether it planned to sue to block the use of Medicaid data for immigration enforcement. But spokesperson Elana Ross said in a statement that the administration would “explore all avenues to protect Californians’ information and safety.”
“The federal government continues to instill fear across this nation and shroud its continued violation of Americans’ privacy rights in propaganda,” Newsom said.
California officials, including the Department of Health Care Services, have long reassured immigrants without legal status that their data would not be shared with federal agencies for immigration enforcement. 
The state health care services department refused to answer questions about sending information to the federal government, instead directing CalMatters to Newsom’s statement.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121923_MediCal-Expansion_LJ_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-13 15:57:13.782636

(Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Complaints from the farm and hotel industries that President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort is costing them valued workers will prompt change, Trump promised Thursday in a post on Truth Social.
“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” wrote Trump, who owns a number of hotels in the U.S., including one in Las Vegas. 
“It’s a very simple thing to say, ‘we’re going to secure the border and we’re going to deport violent criminals and terrorists.’ Everybody agrees with that,” Culinary Local 226 Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said during a phone interview Thursday. “When you bring in the Marines to arrest dishwashers, that backlash is exploding in industry, among citizens and voters. If there’s one thing this president knows how to do it’s to backtrack quickly when he gets a backlash.”
The U.S. employed more than 782,000 farm workers in 2023, according to the government. About two-thirds are immigrants, according to the government.
The leisure and hospitality industries in the U.S. employ some 14 million people, and almost one-third are immigrants, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.
Nevada’s hospitality and leisure industries employed 368,400 people as of April, according to the Federal Reserve.
“These industries are run by very smart people, and they understand that the immigrant workforce powers this economy,” said Pappageorge.
Pappageorge said he’s not bothered by a carve-out from the deportation policy for two industries, suggesting agriculture and hospitality are just the first two to the table.
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who endorsed Trump and was endorsed by Trump, did not respond to inquiries about whether he’s reached out to the White House regarding the president’s deportation plan and disruption to the labor force.
The Nevada Resort Association, which represents casino hotels in Nevada, referred the Current to the American Hotel and Lodging Association.
“Along with our members, we continue to communicate with Congress and the administration about the importance of building a strong hospitality and tourism workforce,” the AHLA, which represents 32,000 properties, said in a statement. “As an industry, we are committed to strict compliance with labor laws and immigration regulations, including those focused on recruitment, background checks and employment verification.”
The hospitality industry is already reeling from a precipitous drop in travel resulting from Trump’s trade wars, Bloomberg reported last week.
“The AHLA urges Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and strengthen the H-2B visa program, which allows temporary non-agricultural work in the U.S., and the J-1 visa program, which allows participation in exchange programs,” says the AHLA website. “We believe that the United States can have both an effective and welcoming legal immigration process that enables hotels and other businesses to meet our workforce needs, while also protecting our national security.”
How Trump plans to exclude workers from the two industries from deportation is unknown.
“They could do this by prosecutorial discretion possibly,” said Michael Kagan, director of UNLV’s Immigration Clinic. Immigrations and Customer Enforcement (ICE) has the option to close cases and allow individuals to avoid deportation.

Jerry Moran demanded commitments from federal officials during hearings Thursday to keep airspace safe at Reagan Washington National Airport, the site of a deadly collision in January. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran pressed federal officials Wednesday on how they intend to ensure safety at the Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C., in the wake of a January crash between a passenger plane from Wichita and an Army helicopter that left no survivors.
Moran, a Kansas Republican, questioned U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Federal Aviation Administration administrator nominee Bryan Bedford at separate committee hearings Wednesday on whether they would commit to keeping in place restrictions on non-essential helicopter flights around the D.C. airport.
“It’s my understanding, from information from the Army, that since Jan. 29, seven flights have taken off and landed at the Pentagon,” Moran said to Hegseth. “Six of those flights occurred during periods of high volume at DCA. One of those aircraft caused two different commercial flights to abort landing on May 1, and since this latest incident, I understand that all flights have been halted.”
Since the January crash, Moran has pushed for aviation reforms, introducing legislation that mandates in busy airspace the use of Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast, or ADS-B, which automatically transmits an aircraft’s location to nearby pilots once per second. The legislation also removes the possibility for pilots to opt out of using ADS-B.
Moran introduced that legislation after close calls at the same airport where the crash took place. The Pentagon, which is less than two miles away from Reagan National as the crow flies, halted military helicopter flights near the airport. The legislation has been in a committee awaiting action since it was introduced in early May.
Moran wants the flight restrictions in place until the FAA can come up with a safe route, if there is one.
Hegseth, in response, said no authorization for VIP or convenience flights exists in that area.
“You have our assurance that I’m working with (Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy) very closely to make sure that the only flights that would be — even in a modified path — would be those that are necessary and are authorized,” Hegseth said.
Moran sits on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, where he questioned Hegseth, and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, where he requested a commitment from Bedford to maintain safety restrictions.
“My understanding is the FAA is supreme when it comes to the control of the airspace,” Bedford said. “But we want to be good partners with the Department of Defense, and we have protocols on how to do that — multiple protocols, as I understand.”
The FAA creates military operating areas, which include restricted and prohibited spaces, and line of fire space and alert zones, and determines the airspace classifications around airports.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A University of Northern Iowa employee is suing the institution after she was demoted from an assistant vice president position, alleging discrimination against her age that led to her taking a pay cut as well as her title and some duties being handed off to younger coworkers.
Shelley O’Connell, former UNI assistant vice president and executive director of Student Health and Well Being and current assistant to the vice president, filed suit against the university and the Iowa Board of Regents June 2 and requested a trial by jury. According to court filings, she is seeking funds “in an amount which will fully and fairly compensate her for her injuries and damages” like emotional stress, lost wages and more.
“As a proximate result of Defendants’ actions … Shelley O’Connell has in the past and will in the future suffer mental and emotional harm, anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, loss of dignity, lost wages and benefits, loss of professional career, and lost earning capacity,” the court filing stated.

The 59-year-old started working at UNI in 2001 as an administrative assistant, the filing stated, and according to her LinkedIn profile, O’Connell earned a master’s degree in educational leadership and administration from the institution in 2007.
She moved into the assistant vice president position in 2022. In her time in the role, the court filing stated O’Connell received positive performance evaluations and received an award for her “outstanding dedication and service.”
In August 2023, O’Connell had a meeting with her then-supervisor Heather Harbach, the university’s vice president for student life, according to the filing, during which Harbach asked O’Connell if she had any plans of stepping down or moving out of a role supervising staff. These questions were “motivated by (O’Connell’s) age,” the filing stated, to which O’Connell replied she had no interest in retiring or stepping away.
This exchange led to distance between the coworkers, according to the filing, and O’Connell brought her concerns to the university’s Title IX office, saying she felt Harbach was trying to make her vacate her position based on her age.
“Shelley remained committed to her job and providing the best service to the University that she possibly could,” the filing stated.
Harbach informed Shelley of her demotion in April 2024,  according to the filing, providing the new title and saying her duties specific to her previous role were being transferred to Allyson Rafanello and Nick Rafanello, a married couple.
The employees Shelley oversaw were transitioned to work under one of the new assistant vice presidents, and Shelley’s pay was reduced by more than $50,000. Allyson Rafanello received an around-$50,000 pay increase for the new duties, the filing stated.
In addition to holding the assistant vice president title, Allyson Rafanello is the dean of students and Nick Rafanello is the executive director of university housing and dining.
“Shelley will have to work longer than she had anticipated because her wages were slashed by more than $50,000 per year, thereby delaying her ability to retire,” the filing stated.
The plaintiff also had 15 more years of experience at UNI than the new assistant vice presidents, according to the filing, and decades of experience in health care and public health. One of her previous duties was overseeing all university medical facilities, which was transferred to the Rafanellos after her demotion.
UNI, and the board of regents, committed age discrimination by setting higher standards for O’Connell than her peers, the filing stated, as well as not treating her equally to younger employees, allowing discrimination from her supervisor, demoting her and offering less pay.
UNI spokesperson Pete Moris said the university “does not comment on pending legal matters.” The university must provide an answer to the petition within 20 days of its filing to the Polk County courthouse.

(Ed Murray for New Jersey Monitor)A handful of New Jersey’s Assembly primaries remained too close to call early Friday afternoon, and counts for some races were poised to stretch until provisional ballots are tallied next week.
Most of the state’s races were decided on or shortly after Election Night due to a 2022 law that allowed election officials to prepare mail ballots for counting ahead of Election Day. But candidates in a handful of contests were separated by fewer than 200 votes, leaving final tallies up to provisional ballots that won’t be counted until next week.
“The legislature and the Governor saw a problem, and they saw a need to fix it, and apparently they have fixed it because now we seem to be a fast-counting state, or at least we were this time,” said Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics.
In the 31st District, where voters gave Hudson County Commissioner Jerry Walker the Democratic nomination, Assemblyman William Sampson’s (D-Hudson) lead over Assemblywoman Barbara McCann Stamato (D-Hudson) narrowed somewhat after county election officials updated vote tallies Thursday.
Sampson leads his onetime running mate, who sought reelection under gubernatorial hopeful and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop’s slogan, by 194 votes, down from 308 on Wednesday.
Hudson officials on Thursday reported there were 101 vote-by-mail ballots and 698 provisional ballots yet uncounted. Those could be enough to bring McCann Stamato back to second place in the district’s primary. They’re unlikely to save her running mate, Jacqueline Weimmer, who lags Sampson by 403 votes.
Election officials will continue receiving late-arriving mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day until 8 p.m. Monday, though those ballots are typically small in number. Provisional ballots can only be counted after the end of the mail-voting grace period. In some counties, officials aren’t counting more ballots until next week.
Not all outstanding ballots will have been cast in Democratic primaries, and some mail and some provisional ballots won’t be counted because the voters who cast them were ineligible to vote, among other deficiencies. Voters whose mail ballots are rejected have until June 18 to cure them.
The contest for a second seat in the 20th District remained tight Friday morning. There, independent Democrat Ed Rodriguez leads party-backed Union County Commissioner Sergio Granados by 105 votes with Assemblywoman Annette Quijano (D-Union) in a distant first place.
There were 543 mail ballots and 707 provisional ballots left uncounted in the Union County-based district late Thursday. The race remains too close to call and will likely be decided by provisional ballots. The uncounted ballots won’t be enough to bring Walter Wimbush, Rodriguez’s running mate, into contention for the seat.
Rodriguez is among the independent Democrats who performed well in races that featured opponents on competing slates backed by party organizations and Fulop.
“When you get a one-on-one, you can say, ‘Well, the other guy stinks,’” Rasmussen said. “But when you’ve got six candidates — as we did in the gubernatorial field and as we did in some of these Assembly races — it’s not enough to say the other guy stinks. You’ve got to say, ‘No, this is why I’m the best and I deserve your first or your second vote.’”
Outstanding ballots in the 35th District appear to favor Assemblyman Al Abdelaziz (D-Passaic), who leads his party-backed running mate, Passaic County Commissioner Orlando Cruz, by 261 votes for second place.
Nearly all votes are counted in the Bergen County portion of the district, where only 18 mail ballots and 44 provisional ballots remain untallied. Passaic has more outstanding votes: 1,195 between both categories, and Abdelaziz ran ahead of Cruz in the county.
Newark Corporation Counsel Kenyatta Stewart, who ran on an independent ticket, leads the assemblyman by 1,301 votes — more than the number of ballots currently outstanding — and will go on to face Republicans Nelvin Mercado-Duran and Rawell Perez-Muñoz in November. The district has not had a Republican member in three decades.
A second-place race between Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla and Assemblywoman Jessica Ramirez (D-Hudson) in the 32nd District remained tight. Bhalla leads the incumbent, who ran on Fulop’s slate, by 194 votes with 717 mostly provisional ballots left uncounted as of Thursday afternoon.
Former New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency chief of staff Katie Brennan leads Ramirez by 497 votes and is virtually certain to be one of the district’s Democratic nominees. Brennan, whose accusations of sexual assault against a 2017 Murphy campaign staffer roiled Trenton, ran with Bhalla on an independent ticket.
“This was a district where voters were paying attention and had really good choices, and I think the result of picking Katie Brennan at the top of the field is really a remarkable outcome for a housing advocate and a planner and somebody who we know about, given her experience with the Murphy campaign in the early days of the Murphy administration,” Rasmussen said.
The three remaining candidates, Jersey City Councilman Yousef Saleh, Crystal Fonseca, and Jennie Pu, are not in contention for either seat.
Some other contests remain close.
In the Democratic primary in the 2nd District, Fulop-aligned Bruce Weeks trails Joanne Famularo, who has party backing, by just 82 votes with 1,026 ballots uncounted. The district is held by Republican Assembly members Don Guardian and Claire Swift, who were unopposed in the GOP primary.

(Photo courtesy of Bill King)Eight demonstrations will be held across seven Rhode Island municipalities Saturday as part of nationwide “No Kings” protests intended to reject the “authoritarian overreach” of President Donald Trump’s second term.
Robert Vitello, treasurer of the Newport Democratic City Committee, who helped organize Saturday’s noon demonstration planned at Two Mile Corner in Middletown, said Friday morning he’s received 350 responses from people who intend to show up.
“It will be peaceful, it will at many times be silent,” Vitello said in an interview. “People will be holding their signs and letting them speak of their frustration, their outrage, and utter concern with the state of our democracy.”
 
 Demonstrations will be held at the following locations in Rhode Island, according to the national No Kings coalition’s website:

Water Street in New Shoreham on Block Island, from noon to 1 p.m.
The Rhode Island State House in Providence, from noon to 2 p.m.
India Point Park in Providence, from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
Two Mile Corner in Middletown, from noon to 2 p.m.
80 Boston Neck Road in North Kingstown, from noon to 2 p.m.
The village of Wakefield in South Kingstown, from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
53 Child Street in Warren, noon to 1 p.m.
248 Post Road in Westerly, from noon to 2 p.m.




Vitello said interest in the rally has grown following the Trump administration’s crackdown on mostly nonviolent protests in Los Angeles and the recent forcible removal and handcuffing of U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-C.A.) by federal law enforcement at a Department of Homeland Security press conference.
Such actions have come in defiance of federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, where Trump has deployed the National Guard against demonstrators.
“As much as what we were all warned about what a second Trump term could be like, it’s gone far beyond what people could have envisioned,” Vitello said.
Saturday’s protests are timed to coincide with the national military parade in Washington D.C. meant to celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday — along with President Trump’s 79th birthday. Saturday is also Flag Day.
Indivisible Rhode Island, which organized the demonstration at India Point Park, referred to the D.C. festival as a “vanity parade” on its website. The group also organized the “Hands Off!” rally outside Kennedy Plaza in April against proposed cuts to federal funding.
Among those speaking at the India Point Park rally will be Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat.
“I am pleased to know that there is a movement where thousands of people all across the country and especially right here in our backyard of Providence, Rhode Island are here to take a stand,” Morales said in an interview.
The national festival and parade are expected to cost between $25 million to $45 million, according to reporting by States Newsroom. It will feature roughly 6,700 soldiers from every division, 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, 34 horses, two mules and one dog.
But the parade will not include any members of the Rhode Island National Guard. Col. Brenton Groeneveld, a spokesperson for the Guard, confirmed the state will not participate in or provide any support for the parade.
“​​The RING was not asked or tasked with providing any support to the June 14 parade,” Groeneveld said in an email.
The No Kings coalition projects millions of demonstrators will take the streets of over 2,000 cities and towns across the country — just not the nation’s capital.
“Real power isn’t staged in Washington,” national organizers wrote on the coalition’s website. “It rises up everywhere else.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Inmate Stephen Stanko, who was sentenced to death twice in separate cases, is set to be put to death at 6 p.m. Friday.
The 57-year-old is scheduled to be the sixth inmate executed since the state resumed executions in September. He chose to die by lethal injection, as his attorneys questioned whether the state had properly carried out previous death sentences.
A 4th SC death row inmate opts to die by lethal injection following concerns over firing squad

A federal judge and an appeals court declined to halt Stanko’s execution earlier this week. His attorneys asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene Thursday.
If the nation’s highest court doesn’t step in, Stanko’s final hope of avoiding the death chamber would be for the governor to grant him clemency. Gov. Henry McMaster, a former prosecutor and state attorney general, has declined to commute the sentences of any inmates previously executed.
Appeals
After Stanko’s attorneys unsuccessfully petitioned the state Supreme Court for more information about the state Department of Corrections’ execution protocols, Stanko chose to die by lethal injection.
His decision was to avoid the electric chair, which legislators made the default in 2021, and not because his concerns about other methods were assuaged, he wrote in a statement attached to the decision.
2 SC legislators call for independent investigation into latest execution

Stanko’s attorneys filed a separate appeal, this one in federal court, raising concerns about all three of the state’s allowed methods of execution: lethal injection, electrocution and firing squad.
The firing squad, in particular, has been under scrutiny by the state’s death row lawyers and some legislators after an autopsy of the last inmate executed in the state, Mikal Mahdi, showed two bullet holes instead of the expected three. The bullets also appeared not to have hit Mahdi squarely in the heart, as they had for a previous inmate, according to the autopsy report.
The marksmen, shooting at a target 15 feet away, might have intentionally missed the target to cause more suffering for Mahdi, who was put to death for killing a police officer, the attorneys claimed in their filing.
The state corrections department argued two bullets struck Mahdi in the same spot and followed the same path through his body. The bullets did hit his heart, the marksmen didn’t miss, and the target was properly placed, the state has said in legal filings.
Next, Stanko’s attorneys argued the state’s use of two “massive” doses of the sedative pentobarbital in at least two of the three previous lethal injection executions also suggests something went wrong. One inmate, Freddie Owens, declined an autopsy for religious reasons.
Attorneys for the state have said this is the state’s protocol and nothing has gone amiss in any executions carried out since September.
A federal judge declined to intervene. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel wrote in an order Wednesday he would not rule on firing squad arguments since that was not Stanko’s selected method. Furthermore, he saw no cause for intervention based on the previous lethal injection executions, he wrote.
The crime
Stanko’s crime spree began April 7, 2005, at the Murrell’s Inlet home he shared with his girlfriend, librarian Laura Ling.
Ling’s 15-year-old daughter woke at about 1 a.m. to find Stanko standing over her in her bedroom. She ran to her mother’s bedroom, where she found Ling incapacitated and bleeding on the floor beside the bed, according to court records.
Stanko tied up, beat and raped Ling’s daughter, then choked Ling to death. He slit the daughter’s throat and left her for dead before packing a suitcase, stealing Ling’s credit card and jewelry, and fleeing in Ling’s car, according to court records.
Around 4 a.m., Stanko called a friend, Henry Turner. Stanko lied saying his father had died and asked Turner if he could spend the night.
SC executes second death row inmate by firing squad

Turner agreed and called his partner, who lived in Charlotte, to tell her. He ended the call in his usual style, saying, “I love you, brown eyes,” Cecelia Kotsipias later testified in court.
The next morning, after getting the two of them breakfast, Turner went to shave his face in the mirror. Using a pillow as a silencer, Stanko came up behind Turner and shot him in the back, according to court documents.
Stanko then struck Turner and fatally shot him in the chest.
Stanko took Turner’s truck, stole money from his bank account and drove to Columbia. There, he spent an evening posing as a businessman and buying people drinks at bars before taking off for Georgia.
In Augusta, Stanko told a woman he met that he was in town for the Masters golf tournament. A charming man, as people who knew him later testified, he convinced her to let him stay at her house.
Stanko stayed there until April 12, before leaving abruptly in the middle of the night. After his departure, the woman recognized Stanko’s photograph in the newspaper alongside a headline about Turner’s death. She called the police, who apprehended Stanko before he left the city, according to court records.
Back home, Stanko had a reputation as a scam artist. Over the years, he was charged and convicted more than a dozen times for stealing money, computers and cars from employers and falsely posing as a lawyer.
Stanko also had served a prison sentence for kidnapping his then-girlfriend with the intent to kill her. While serving that sentence, he helped write the book “Living in Prison: A History of the Correctional System with an Insider’s View,” alongside researchers Wayne Gillespie and Gordon A. Crews.
Stanko was released from prison for that crime about a year before committing those that would land him on death row.
SC inmate executed by firing squad, a first nationwide since 2010

Stanko never claimed innocence, instead arguing he had brain damage that caused him to commit the killings. Two separate juries, in 2006 and 2009, convicted Stanko of murdering Ling and Turner. The juries recommended death sentences for each of the crimes.
It’s Turner’s killing for which Stanko is set to be executed Friday. His appeals in the other case are ongoing.
Stephen Stanko
Growing up, Stanko was smart and well-liked. Although his father could be harsh and his parents weren’t particularly involved in his life, Stanko was outgoing and cheerful at school, teachers and neighbors recalled during his trials.
He was a member of the honor society, Beta Club, and junior engineering club, as well as an escort at school pageants and vice president of the school’s Spanish club. He placed in a regional competition for the Olympics of the Mind, in which students would participate in academic challenges, former teachers said.
“He was, I think, a role model to the other students,” one of his middle school teachers, Barbara Poland, testified. “I think the other students really did look up to him.”
As an adult, Stanko remained intelligent and charming, his former girlfriend, Elizabeth Buckner, testified. But she saw a darker side to him, too, in the four years they were together, she said.

Stanko lied to Buckner repeatedly about work, telling her he’s been promoted when really he’d been fired or saying he was starting a side business selling cars without telling her the cars were stolen.
Stanko had an “inability to speak the truth about anything,” Buckner testified.
“He ran into trouble in every position that he held,” she said.
When Buckner confronted Stanko, he tried to knock her out using a combination of chemicals. When that didn’t work, he tied her up. He pleaded guilty to kidnapping and assault and battery with the intent to kill, according to court documents.
Henry Turner
Turner was a jester, both literally and figuratively.
He was a member of the Royal Order of Jesters, an invite-only faction of Shriners for which Turner would don clown makeup and the distinctive fez to ride tiny cars in parades. He was always making jokes and acting eccentric, friends and family testified during Stanko’s 2009 trial.
Turner, who served as a master sergeant in the Air Force, loved to wear a pair of red, white and blue joggers wherever he went, said his partner Kotsipias. At first, she asked him to wear something else, but eventually, the pants grew on her.
SC inmate is executed despite calls for clemency from jurors, trial judge

“Everywhere we’d go, he got attention by these pants, and I grew to love them, too,” she said.
Turner loved fishing, and he passed down the passion to his three children and six grandchildren, his children testified. When his daughter, Debbie Gallogly, needed a break from the chaos of two younger brothers, her dad would take her out on the lake.
“We don’t have his laughter, or his humor, or his intelligence, or his compassion,” Gallogly testified. “All of that is erased when you lose a family member, and to lose someone the way that he died — it hurts my heart so bad to know the circumstances surrounding my father’s death.”
At the time of his death, Turner had been working for Stanko to make extra money so he could take Kotsipias on a cruise, she said.
“We had a wonderful life together, and Stephen Stanko has ruined our lives,” Kotsipias said. “He has ruined it entirely, because Henry would have been living today. We would have been fishing, we would have been singing, we would have been having a wonderful time together.”
Laura Ling
Christina Ling remembered her mother as a hard worker. After divorcing Christina Ling’s father, Laura Ling worked a job at a library, raised her three children and earned a master’s degree in library science all at once, Christina Ling testified in 2006.
“It was tough, but she did it, and she was so successful,” Christina Ling said.
Laura Ling also helped at her friend Rebecca Cahly’s greenhouse, often working harder than even Cahly herself for little or no pay. Really, Ling would ride her children’s bikes to help because she liked the time she could spent chatting with Cahly, the friend testified.
A talented seamstress, Ling handmade Halloween costumes and Christmas stockings so elaborate that Cahly, a seamstress herself, said Ling must have put more than 100 hours of work into them.
“I wish that I would have asked her to teach me how to sew and stuff before she passed away, because I’m not very good at it,” Christina Ling testified.

Laura Ling loved playing tennis and watching movies with her children. When Cahly went through a difficult pregnancy, Ling made a habit of calling her up and, instead of saying hello, yelling into the receiver, “I love you.” If Christina was around, she’d join in, Cahly testified.
A couple years before Laura Ling was killed, she and her daughter went through a rough patch, spurred in part by Ling’s preoccupation with her other children, her job and her degree. Hoping to work it out, Christina Ling wrote her mother a letter that she later found buried in the bottom of her mother’s purse.
“You have been my mom and on some occasions even my dad, my tennis mate, my friend, my mentor through the good and the bad,” Ling wrote in the letter, which she read in court. “To be honest, I’m sure we have got a lot of bad ahead of us, but just know that I’m going to be sticking it out there with you and that I love you very much.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 15:57:13.782636

“You never want to close the road, but a two-day closure has a lot less impact on everyone,” said Bob Hammond, resident engineer with the Wyoming Department of Transportation. WYDOT plans to close the road to traffic during the weekend of June 21.
Without the closure, work needed to finish fixing the “Big Fill” landslide — last year’s catastrophic failure of a 30-yard chunk of Wyoming Highway 22 over the steep mountain pass — could stretch over 10 days or more. Keeping the road open during construction would mean resorting to one, alternating lane of travel.

“It would just back up horribly,” Hammond said of the traffic that would result.
 Crews will work 24 hours a day to expedite Teton Pass project

During peak traffic hours, delays could be so substantial that motorists might opt for the longer detour anyway. When the mountain pass closes, commuters from the Idaho side of the Teton Range, where housing is cheaper than Jackson Hole, typically re-route their daily travel through Swan Valley, Alpine and the Snake River Canyon. That adds roughly 1 hour and 6 minutes to what is usually a 24-mile and 32-minute drive.

Community stakeholders have generally agreed that it’s best to end the disruption quickly, said Stephanie Harsha, a WYDOT public relations specialist who has been working with Teton County organizations to get the word out about the closure slated for 6 p.m., June 20, through 6 a.m. June 23.
“I think people understand how we came to the decision,” Harsha said. “We’re very thankful for their support. When we do close it, we are disrupting commerce and the economy because there are so many commuters. We understand the impact it has in the area.”
Crews will work 24 hours a day to expedite milling, grading, placing crushed base and paving. They’ll also install guardrails and signs.
The highway will be closed between the Coal Creek Campground on the west side and the gate at mile marker 7 on the east side. People can still bike and otherwise recreate on the east side of Teton Pass and access the Coal Creek Campground on the west side. But WYDOT is warning walkers and bikers to beware of heavy trucks and not descend from the top of the pass down the west side toward the Big Fill work site.
The June 7, 2024, landslide made national news, spurring local businesses to reassure visitors they could still reach Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. But the closure also highlighted the vulnerabilities of a mountain community’s robust tourism and lifestyle economy.

 Teton Pass essential to travel for workers, visitors and school kids

That so much depends on a single road became evident just last week when a trailer lost its load on Highway 22, blocking both lanes of travel near the Snake River bridge.
On June 5, Hammond started receiving texts from contractors working in Teton County on a second major WYDOT project, building a new four-lane bridge over the Snake River between Jackson and Wilson. The multi-year, $60 million bridge reconstruction and intersection redesign is expected to wrap up in July.
A log cabin fell off a trailer, “at least twice,” including on the WYDOT jobsite. Crews moved some concrete barriers to give the abode a temporary home.
“We were able to get that cabin off the road to get the lanes open,” Hammond said. “Otherwise, it was blocking the entire road.”
The transport company had tried to move the Etna-bound cabin in the middle of the night but quickly ran into trouble, the Jackson Hole News and Guide reported Friday. The sudden sight of a cabin taking up residence on the bridge spawned some humor on social media, with commenters posting on Facebook, “rent is 3k as it sits”; “Hey you can’t park there” and “someone move in, squatters rights!”

But it also seriously snarled the morning commute, backing eastbound traffic all the way up Teton Pass and disrupting travel for workers, visitors and school kids, who had their tardies excused. Even after the road reopened, it took another four hours to clear the congestion, Hammond said. The cabin was finally removed Saturday morning, he said, “before everyone was up.”
Although unrelated to the Teton Pass project, the cabin debacle shows how long it can take to clear traffic once commuters from Idaho get stacked up, Hammond said.
Highway 22 between Jackson and Teton Village Road sees about 18,000 vehicles per day on average — but 24,000 in July and August with a peak of 27,000, according to WYDOT data. The stretch over Teton Pass to the Idaho state line sees an average of 10,000 vehicles per day. In the height of summer, daily trips jump to around 16,000 west of Teton Village Road and 10,000 east of Victor, Idaho. For comparison, the divided four-lane stretch of Interstate 80 between Green River and Rock Springs accommodates an annual average of 25,000 vehicles per day.
Knowing how any disruption can create problems on the busy Teton corridor, WYDOT wanted to give at least two weeks advance notice of the upcoming weekend pass closure so workers could plan ahead.
“We wanted to give them an opportunity to maybe set up an alternate schedule,” Hammond said. “We can’t really reach all the tourists, but we’ll be putting up variable messaging signs.”
 A permanent fix?

After the road first failed, WYDOT contracted for $900,000 with Evans Construction to put in an emergency detour. That got the vital highway reopened within 20 days. Now Ames Construction is putting the finishing touches on the permanent fix to the tune of about $43 million.

The detour functioned well but has an 11.3% grade and a 20-mph speed limit. The rebuild follows the original, more gentle contour that uses fill material to create a bridge between two hills, hence the name “Big Fill.” The speed limit will return to 45 mph with a speed advisory that likely will be set at 35 mph, Hammond said.
Although WYDOT had observed movement there for decades, Hammond said, “it wasn’t a big concern until it was. When it slid out.”
WYDOT hired a geotechnical engineer with experience working on landslides around the country and has taken steps to avert future problems.
The three factors that contributed to the slide were lubrication, too much weight “or driving force” on top of the fill and too little “resisting force” holding the bottom together, Hammond said.
“When you get all three together, that’s typically when landslides happen,” he said.
So crews have inserted drains at the base of the fill so groundwater doesn’t pool there like it did before. Workers have excavated and drilled “micro piles” — steel rods inside a casing — in a pattern to stitch  together the ground beneath the new fill to increase “resisting force.” To reduce “driving force,” the new fill includes lightweight material that cuts the total weight in half to around 60 pounds per cubic foot compared to the typical 120-125 pounds per cubic foot, Hammond said.
Hammond credits both Evans and Ames with getting the job done quickly in the face of catastrophe.
“We got some contractors who understood what they had to do and how important it was,” he said.
