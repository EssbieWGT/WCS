Brad Little gives his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, on the House floor at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Gov. Brad Little vetoed a bill to ban Idaho businesses, local and state governments, private and public schools, and colleges and universities from requiring medical interventions, such as vaccines, treatment or medication.
Senate Bill 1023, called the Idaho Medical Freedom Act, would have banned businesses and any Idaho governments — local, county or state — from requiring medical interventions for employment, admission to venues, transportation, or providing products or services. 
The bill would’ve also extended to schools in Idaho — private or public — and colleges, universities and trade schools, blocking them from requiring medical interventions for school attendance, employment, or entrance into campus or school buildings.
Little vetoed the bill Saturday — the first bill the Idaho governor has vetoed this year.

“Medical freedom is an Idaho value. However, this bill removes parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy at school because it jeopardizes the ability of schools to send home sick students with highly contagious conditions including measles, lice, ringworm, pink eye, strep throat, stomach viruses, the flu, and other illnesses that disrupt families’ lives,” Little wrote in a transmittal letter explaining his veto.
This year, Little signed into law a bill to let Idaho doctors and health care entities refuse care that violates their beliefs. He cited that bill as one of several examples of his support of “true medical freedom in Idaho.”
“We are proud that Idaho already boasts the freest laws in the country when it comes to personal medical decisions, and we need to keep it that way,” Little wrote. “Parents already have enough to worry about while raising their children. They do not need government imposing more limitations on keeping children safe and healthy from contagious illnesses at school.”
 Bill would’ve expanded on businesses COVID vaccine requirement ban

In 2022, Little vetoed a bill that would ban Idaho businesses from requiring COVID vaccines.
“I have been consistent in stating my belief that businesses should be left to make decisions about the management of their operations and employees with limited interference from government,” Little wrote in his transmittal letter explaining his veto. 
The new broader medical intervention requirement ban the governor vetoed would have expanded on a previous Idaho law banning COVID vaccine requirements, which Little signed in 2023, despite its similarities to one he vetoed a year earlier, the Idaho Statesman reported.
This year’s broader bill — amended twice — was cosponsored by Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow, and Rep. Robert Beiswenger, R-Horseshoe Bend. Health Freedom Defense Fund President and Founder Leslie Manookian wrote the bill. 
 Citing Idaho doctor who spread COVID disinformation, Idaho GOP chairwoman pushed for governor to sign bill

In a column published Thursday, Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon urged people to ask Little to sign the bill. 
She referenced support for the bill by Dr. Ryan Cole, an Idaho pathologist whose Washington medical license has been restricted after state regulators found he shared COVID disinformation and broke medical standards by virtually prescribing ivermectin to COVID patients, against medical practice, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
“In 2020 and 2021, it felt like the whole world had gone mad,” Moon wrote. “Many of us feared for the future of freedom in America. But this is 2025, and much has changed since those dark days. The American people sent Donald Trump back to the White House with a mandate to set things right. He, in turn, appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead Health & Human Services. Like Dr. Cole, RFK Jr. has long been skeptical of Big Pharma’s rhetoric and the government overreach that enabled it.”
Idaho Freedom Action, the lobbying arm of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, in an email alert Saturday said the governor “betrayed Idaho,” arguing Little “chose special interests” over “the interests of Idaho’s families.” The group asked supporters to send form emails to Idaho state lawmakers requesting they override the governor’s veto. 
Overriding a gubernatorial veto requires two-thirds support in each chamber of the Idaho Legislature. The bill narrowly passed the Senate on a 19-14 vote, and the House passage barely cleared that two-third threshold on a 47-23 vote. 
 Bill allows limited medical intervention mandates

Under the bill, medical interventions include “a procedure, treatment, device, drug injection, medication, or action taken to diagnose, prevent, or cure a disease or alter the health or biological function of a person.” 
Business medical intervention mandates for employment would still be allowed in a few excepted circumstances, including in certain federal travel scenarios if jobs require entry into facilities that require medical interventions, or if required by federal law. 
The bill would also exempt medical intervention bans in situations where employers require “personal protection equipment, items, or clothing … based on existing traditional and accepted industry standards or federal law.” But the bill says COVID-era requirements, such as for masks or vaccines, are not exempt from the ban.
The bill would allow the Idaho attorney general or county prosecuting attorneys to enforce the law through injunctive relief, which are essentially civil court actions issued in lawsuits.

In the wooded highlands of northern Arkansas, where small towns have few dentists, water officials who serve more than 20,000 people have for more than a decade openly defied state law by refusing to add fluoride to the drinking water.
For its refusal, the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority has received hundreds of state fines amounting to about $130,000, which are stuffed in a cardboard box and left unpaid, said Andy Anderson, who is opposed to fluoridation and has led the water system for nearly two decades.
This Ozark region is among hundreds of rural American communities that face a one-two punch to oral health: a dire shortage of dentists and a lack of fluoridated drinking water, which is widely viewed among dentists as one of the most effective tools to prevent tooth decay. But as the anti-fluoride movement builds unprecedented momentum, it may turn out that the Ozarks were not behind the times after all.
“We will eventually win,” Anderson said. “We will be vindicated.”
Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, keeps teeth strong when added to drinking water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Dental Association. But the anti-fluoride movement has been energized since a government report last summer found a possible link between lower IQ in children and consuming amounts of fluoride that are higher than what is recommended in American drinking water. Dozens of communities have decided to stop fluoridating in recent months, and state officials in Florida and Texas have urged their water systems to do the same. Utah is poised to become the first state to ban it in tap water.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long espoused fringe health theories, has called fluoride an “industrial waste” and “dangerous neurotoxin” and said the Trump administration will recommend it be removed from all public drinking water.
Separately, Republican efforts to extend tax cuts and shrink federal spending may squeeze Medicaid, which could deepen existing shortages of dentists in rural areas where many residents depend on the federal insurance program for whatever dental care they can find.
Dental experts warn that the simultaneous erosion of Medicaid and fluoridation could exacerbate a crisis of rural oral health and reverse decades of progress against tooth decay, particularly for children and those who rarely see a dentist.
“If you have folks with little access to professional care and no access to water fluoridation,” said Steven Levy, a dentist and leading fluoride researcher at the University of Iowa, “then they are missing two of the big pillars of how to keep healthy for a lifetime.”
Many already are.

Overlapping ‘Dental Deserts’ and Fluoride-Free Zones
Nearly 25 million Americans live in areas without enough dentists — more than twice as many as prior estimates by the federal government — according to a recent study from Harvard University that measured U.S. “dental deserts” with more depth and precision than before.
Hawazin Elani, a Harvard dentist and epidemiologist who co-authored the study, found that many shortage areas are rural and poor, and depend heavily on Medicaid. But many dentists do not accept Medicaid because payments can be low, Elani said.
The ADA has estimated that only a third of dentists treat patients on Medicaid.
“I suspect this situation is much worse for Medicaid beneficiaries,” Elani said. “If you have Medicaid and your nearest dentists do not accept it, then you will likely have to go to the third, or fourth, or the fifth.”
The Harvard study identified over 780 counties where more than half of the residents live in a shortage area. Of those counties, at least 230 also have mostly or completely unfluoridated public drinking water, according to a KFF analysis of fluoride data published by the CDC. That means people in these areas who can’t find a dentist also do not get protection for their teeth from their tap water.
The KFF Health News analysis does not cover the entire nation because it does not include private wells and 13 states do not submit fluoride data to the CDC. But among those that do, most counties with a shortage of dentists and unfluoridated water are in the south-central U.S., in a cluster that stretches from Texas to the Florida Panhandle and up into Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma.
In the center of that cluster is the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority, which serves the Arkansas counties of Boone, Marion, Newton, and Searcy. It has refused to add fluoride ever since Arkansas enacted a statewide mandate in 2011. After weekly fines began in 2016, the water system unsuccessfully challenged the fluoride mandate in state court, then lost again on appeal.
Anderson, who has chaired the water system’s board since 2007, said he would like to challenge the fluoride mandate in court again and would argue the case himself if necessary. In a phone interview, Anderson said he believes that fluoride can hamper the brain and body to the point of making people “get fat and lazy.”
“So if you go out in the streets these days, walk down the streets, you’ll see lots of fat people wearing their pajamas out in public,” he said.
Nearby in the tiny, no-stoplight community of Leslie, Arkansas, which gets water from the Ozark system, the only dentist in town operates out of a one-man clinic tucked in the back of an antique store. Hand-painted lettering on the store window advertises a “pretty good dentist.”
James Flanagin, a third-generation dentist who opened this clinic three years ago, said he was drawn to Leslie by the quaint charms and friendly smiles of small-town life. But those same smiles also reveal the unmistakable consequences of refusing to fluoridate, he said.
“There is no doubt that there is more dental decay here than there would otherwise be,” he said. “You are going to have more decay if your water is not fluoridated. That’s just a fact.”

Fluoride Seen as a Great Public Health Achievement
Fluoride was first added to public water in an American city in 1945 and spread to half of the U.S. population by 1980, according to the CDC. Because of “the dramatic decline” in cavities that followed, in 1999 the CDC dubbed fluoridation as one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.
Currently more than 70% of the U.S. population on public water systems get fluoridated water, with a recommended concentration of 0.7 milligrams per liter, or about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel, according to the CDC.
Fluoride is also present in modern toothpaste, mouthwash, dental varnish, and some food and drinks — like raisins, potatoes, oatmeal, coffee, and black tea. But several dental experts said these products do not reliably reach as many low-income families as drinking water, which has an additional benefit over toothpaste of strengthening children’s teeth from within as they grow.
Two recent polls have found that the largest share of Americans support fluoridation, but a sizable minority does not. Polls from Axios/Ipsos and AP-NORC found that 48% and 40% of respondents wanted to keep fluoride in public water supplies, while 29% and 26% supported its removal.
Chelsea Fosse, an expert on oral health policy at the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, said she worried that misguided fears of fluoride would cause many people to stop using fluoridated toothpaste and varnish just as Medicaid cuts made it harder to see a dentist.
The combination, she said, could be “devastating.”
“It will be visibly apparent what this does to the prevalence of tooth decay,” Fosse said. “If we get rid of water fluoridation, if we make Medicaid cuts, and if we don’t support providers in locating and serving the highest-need populations, I truly don’t know what we will do.”
Multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown what ending water fluoridation could look like. In the past few years, studies of cities in Alaska and Canada have shown that communities that stopped fluoridation saw significant increases in children’s cavities when compared with similar cities that did not. A 2024 study from Israel reported a “two-fold increase” in dental treatments for kids within five years after the country stopped fluoridating in 2014.
Despite the benefits of fluoridation, it has been fiercely opposed by some since its inception, said Catherine Hayes, a Harvard dental expert who advises the American Dental Association on fluoride and has studied its use for three decades.

Fluoridation was initially smeared as a communist plot against America, Hayes said, and then later fears arose of possible links to cancer, which were refuted through extensive scientific research. In the ’80s, hysteria fueled fears of fluoride causing AIDS, which was “ludicrous,” Hayes said.
More recently, the anti-fluoride movement seized on international research that suggests high levels of fluoride can hinder children’s brain development and has been boosted by high-profile legal and political victories.
Last August, a hotly debated report from the National Institutes of Health’s National Toxicology Program found “with moderate confidence” that exposure to levels of fluoride that are higher than what is present in American drinking water is associated with lower IQ in children. The report was based on an analysis of 74 studies conducted in other countries, most of which were considered “low quality” and involved exposure of at least 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water — or more than twice the U.S. recommendation — according to the program.
The following month, in a long-simmering lawsuit filed by fluoride opponents, a federal judge in California said the possible link between fluoride and lowered IQ was too risky to ignore, then ordered the federal Environmental Protection Agency to take nonspecified steps to lower that risk. The EPA started to appeal this ruling in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump administration could reverse course.
The EPA and Department of Justice declined to comment. The White House and Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about fluoride.
Despite the National Toxicology Program’s report, Hayes said, no association has been shown to date between lowered IQ and the amount of fluoride actually present in most Americans’ water. The court ruling may prompt additional research conducted in the U.S., Hayes said, which she hoped would finally put the campaign against fluoride to rest.
“It’s one of the great mysteries of my career, what sustains it,” Hayes said. “What concerns me is that there’s some belief amongst some members of the public — and some of our policymakers — that there is some truth to this.”
Not all experts were so dismissive of the toxicology program’s report. Bruce Lanphear, a children’s health researcher at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, published an editorial in January that said the findings should prompt health organizations “to reassess the risks and benefits of fluoride, particularly for pregnant women and infants.”
“The people who are proposing fluoridation need to now prove it’s safe,” Lanphear told NPR in January. “That’s what this study does. It shifts the burden of proof — or it should.”

Cities and States Rethink Fluoride
At least 14 states so far this year have considered or are considering bills that would lift fluoride mandates or prohibit fluoride in drinking water altogether. In February, Utah lawmakers passed the nation’s first ban, which Republican Gov. Spencer Cox told ABC4 Utah he intends to sign. And both Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have called for their respective states to end fluoridation.
“I don’t want Big Brother telling me what to do,” Miller told The Dallas Morning News in February. “Government has forced this on us for too long.”
Additionally, dozens of cities and counties have decided to stop fluoridation in the past six months — including at least 16 communities in Florida with a combined population of more than 1.6 million — according to news reports and the Fluoride Action Network, an anti-fluoride group.
Stuart Cooper, executive director of that group, said the movement’s unprecedented momentum would be further supercharged if Kennedy and the Trump administration follow through on a recommendation against fluoride.
Cooper predicted that most U.S. communities will have stopped fluoridating within years.
“I think what you are seeing in Florida, where every community is falling like dominoes, is going to now happen in the United States,” he said. “I think we’re seeing the absolute end of it.”
If Cooper’s prediction is right, Hayes said, widespread decay would be visible within years. Kids’ teeth will rot in their mouths, she said, even though “we know how to completely prevent it.”
“It’s unnecessary pain and suffering,” Hayes said. “If you go into any children’s hospital across this country, you’ll see a waiting list of kids to get into the operating room to get their teeth fixed because they have severe decay because they haven’t had access to either fluoridated water or other types of fluoride. Unfortunately, that’s just going to get worse.”
 



Methodology: How We Counted
This KFF Health News article identifies communities with an elevated risk of tooth decay by combining data on areas with dentist shortages and unfluoridated drinking water. Our analysis merged Harvard University research on dentist-shortage areas with large datasets on public water systems published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Harvard research determined that nearly 25 million Americans live in dentist-shortage areas that span much of rural America. The CDC data details the populations served and fluoridation status of more than 38,000 public water systems in 37 states. We classified counties as having elevated risk of tooth decay if they met three criteria:More than half of the residents live in a dentist-shortage area identified by Harvard.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to more than half of the county’s population.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to at least half of the total population of all water systems based in that county, even if those systems reached beyond the county borders, which many do.
Our analysis identified approximately 230 counties that meet these criteria, meaning they have both a dire shortage of dentists and largely unfluoridated drinking water.
But this total is certainly an undercount. Thirteen states do not report water system data to the CDC, and the agency data does not include private wells, most of which are unfluoridated.

Cox explained [&#8230;]","A pride flag flies at the Salt Lake City & County Building on Thursday, March 13, 2025. (McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)SALT LAKE CITY — Saying Utahns are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox will allow a bill aimed at banning many flags — including pride or LGBTQ+ flags — from schools and all government buildings to become law without his signature.
Cox explained his reasoning in a letter to legislative leaders issued with just over an hour to spare before his midnight deadline Thursday to sign or veto bills passed by the 2025 Utah Legislature.
“HB77 has been one of the most divisive bills of the session, and I am deeply disappointed that it did not land in a better place,” wrote Cox, who also explained he agreed with the intent behind the legislation. “My understanding is that there was a deal on a compromise that would have removed problematic portions of the bill while retaining others that would support political neutrality in the classroom. Sadly the sponsors did not move that deal forward.”
Supporters of HB77, sponsored by Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, argued it was meant to promote “political neutrality” in government spaces. But critics argued a broad ban that extended to all government properties would invite free speech litigation while also leaving some Utahns, especially the LGBTQ+ community, feeling unwelcome and erased.

Now slated to take effect on May 7, HB77 will ban almost all flags from being displayed on or in public buildings, except for flags explicitly allowed in a prescriptive list included in the bill, such as the U.S. flag, the state flag, military flags, Olympic flags, college or university flags, or others. Pride flags or other LGBTQ+ flags — which Utah lawmakers in recent years have repeatedly tried to bar from schools in various ways — would be prohibited.
It’s slated to make Utah the first state in the nation to enact such sweeping flag restrictions in government-owned buildings. The Idaho Legislature recently passed a similar bill, HB41, which Gov. Brad Little signed last week, but that legislation won’t take effect until July 1 and it only applies to schools. Idaho lawmakers are also advancing a separate bill to restrict government entities from displaying certain types of flags.

Utah’s largest LGBTQ+ rights group, Equality Utah, had negotiated with lawmakers on the bill, which originally focused the flag ban on school classrooms. However, in a House committee last month, Lee changed the legislation to broaden the flag ban to all government property, leading Equality Utah to oppose the bill even though it was prepared to take a “neutral” position on its earlier version.
Cox faced numerous calls to veto HB77 from advocacy groups including Equality Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, as well as from Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, whose city hosts the annual Utah Pride Festival. He could have vetoed the bill — but he indicated in his letter that it would likely just be overridden by the GOP-supermajority Utah Legislature. Instead, he’s urging lawmakers to work to fix it.
“I continue to have serious concerns with this bill,” Cox said. “However, because a veto would be overridden, I have decided to allow the bill to go into law without my signature, and urge lawmakers to consider commonsense solutions that address the bill’s numerous flaws.”
Cox encouraged lawmakers to consider allowing the Utah State Board of Education to “go further in ensuring the political neutrality of our classrooms, while also considering repealing the local government piece of this legislation and allowing elected representatives to answer to their own constituents.”
“If you are willing to pursue this kind of solution, you will have an open door in the executive branch,” Cox wrote.
Cox’s comments on the flag ban came after the bill cast final-hour drama over Utah’s multimillion-dollar bid to entice the Sundance Film Festival to stay, with some saying it could impact Utah’s chances.
Earlier Thursday, festival organizers announced they’d opted to move the event to Colorado to help the festival grow. By the time they’d reached their decision, Cox had not yet acted on HB77, but a veto was looking unlikely.

While Cox told reporters last week Sundance organizers had told state leaders “very clearly that political issues have nothing to do with the decision,” others, including Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, worried that HB77 could indeed be “harmful to our effort to retain Sundance.”
In the end, Utah lost its bid. Cox — who earlier Thursday called Sundance’s decision a “mistake” — also included a note in his letter that he’ll be calling a special session to address, among other issues, what the Legislature should instead do with the $3.5 million it had set aside as part of Utah’s bid to keep Sundance.
“Let’s reappropriate that money to efforts in Utah to create a new festival and a world-class film economy right here in our state,” he said.
Cox says he agrees with ‘underlying intent’ but HB77 has flaws
Cox, in his letter, dove deeper into why he had misgivings with HB77 but said he agreed with the “underlying intent” of the bill.
“I deeply believe that our classrooms need to be a place where everyone feels welcome — free from the politics that are fracturing our country,” Cox wrote. “Parents are rightly upset when they bring their kids to publicly funded schools and see culture-war symbols in a place that should be apolitical. In an attempt to make some kids feel more welcome, other kids feel less welcome.”
Cox also said he appreciated that the bill is “neutral on the types of flags in question,” while adding that “I find it strange that no headline reads ‘MAGA flags banned from classrooms.’”

“I agree with the underlying intent of those legislators who supported this bill in an attempt to bring political neutrality to the classroom,” he said, though he added, “Unfortunately, this bill does not do that.”
He said because it’s aimed at only flags, “there is little preventing countless other displays — posters, signs, drawings, furniture — from entering the classroom.”
“To those legislators who supported this bill, I’m sure it will not fix what you are trying to fix,” Cox said.
He noted that many schools have already enacted their own “political neutrality” policies in classrooms, and he argued “we have a better place” to make regulations: the Utah State Board of Education. While he said the board has already set expectations for political neutrality in teacher code of conduct, “I believe more needs to be done by USBE to provide direction in this regard.”
“I have asked the Board of Education to continue their work to find ways to make our classrooms both more politically neutral and more welcoming to every student to exercise their own individual freedom of expression,” Cox said. “The idea that kids can only feel welcome in a school if a teacher puts up a rainbow flag is just wrong. Let’s do everything possible to make our classrooms one of the last remaining politically neutral places in our state.”
Cox says bill goes ‘too far’
The governor added that the flag ban “goes too far” by extending the ban to local governments.
“While I think it’s wrong for city and county officials to fly divisive flags, I believe that election have consequences and the best way to stop that behavior is to elect people who believe differently,” Cox said. “All this bill does is add more fuel to the fire, and I suspect it will only ratchet up the creative use of political symbolism.”
Ultimately, Cox urged legislators to focus on solutions rather than legislation that deepens divides.


Let us know what you think...


 

“As tired as Utahns are of politically divisive symbols, I think they are also tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” he said.
The governor urged lawmakers to work with the LGBTQ+ community, as they have in the past, to find common ground.
“Utah has always had a reputation of trying to find a way to work together and solve issues between sides that have strongly-held, opposing points of view,” Cox said. “There are so many examples of the LGBTQ community and the conservative community coming together to find helpful and hopeful compromise. I hope we can retain this as our model and North Star.”
The governor also shared a message directly to LGBTQ+ Utahns, acknowledging that “recent legislation has been difficult.”
“Politics can be a bit of a blood sport at times and I know we have had our disagreements,” he said. “I want you to know that I love and appreciate you and I am grateful that you are part of our state. I know these words may ring hollow to many of you, but please know that I mean them sincerely.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Nine months after historic flooding in McCook Lake wreaked havoc on homes, roads, trees and infrastructure, government officials are widening their focus from recovery efforts to prevention.
McCook Lake is a community of lakefront homes within North Sioux City in the southeastern corner of South Dakota, near the confluence of the Big Sioux and Missouri rivers.
Raging floodwaters that hit McCook Lake in June cost the city an estimated total of $15 million in infrastructure repair, according to North Sioux City and Union County officials. Homeowners suffered millions in additional damage and received some assistance from federal disaster relief programs, although not enough in some cases to replace their losses. Some also lacked flood insurance.
Local governments consider short-term, long-term mitigation plans
North Sioux City Administrator Jeff Dooley said the city is considering building greenways, culverts and storm sewer pipes along affected roads — capitalizing on some of the channels carved by the flood — to better direct future floodwaters into McCook Lake.
“Mother Nature has already plowed through there,” Dooley said. The city is also exploring how to better convey floodwaters from McCook Lake to the Missouri River “where it doesn’t harm anyone else.”

Dooley said a proposal will be presented to the public in late April for input from area residents and city commissioners. He plans to “hit these concepts hard” before applying for a Federal Emergency Management Agency hazard mitigation grant program by the end of May.
“A lot of damage has been done, and we’re doing our best to get out ahead of things,” Dooley said. “Any solution we come up with has to protect everybody.”
Dooley does not have a cost estimate prepared for the plan yet.

In the long term, Dooley and other area officials are requesting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to help reevaluate the current flood plan and develop new mitigation plans. The current plan, which uses levees to redirect floodwaters over Interstate 29 and into McCook Lake before they reach the rest of North Sioux City and nearby Dakota Dunes, was developed in 1976. Union County, North Sioux City and Sioux City wrote a letter to the Corps saying they will sponsor improvement projects recommended by the Corps.
While Dooley said the Corps of Engineers likely recognizes a nearly 50-year-old mitigation plan is outdated, he warned it’ll probably take 10 to 15 years for a study’s conclusions to come to reality. That’s because the project will have a large study scope and a long construction timeline, he said.
Residents continue with recovery, lawmaker seeks to provide future relief
More than 100 homes were damaged in the McCook Lake flood, and 20 homes were demolished by North Sioux City in December. That’s left pockets of empty lots around the north side of the lake.
Morgan Speichinger lives on North Shore Drive, an outlet off the lake’s main road. Before the flood, her family couldn’t see the lake because of the houses lining its shore. Then the raging floodwaters carved a channel toward the river in her family’s backyard and through her neighbors’ houses.
“We didn’t have a lake view. Now, unfortunately, we do,” she said.

Speichinger and her husband rented a skid-steer loader at the end of March to move some of the 66 truckloads of dirt donated by RP Constructors and the Dakota County Fire District to fill holes in their property and in empty neighboring lots.
Other volunteers, such as workers with Mitchell Electric, helped move dirt with vans and trailers.
“I love the help and volunteers willing to step up and help other people, but it’s frustrating that we have to rely on our community to bring us back together,” Speichinger said. “You don’t see the city, county or state leadership out here, but they’re the ones who should be helping.”

Vermillion Republican Rep. Chris Kassin has visited McCook Lake several times, walking the lake and assessing damage done to his constituents’ homes. Kassin led a failed effort to establish a fund for the cleanup and restoration of McCook Lake this legislative session.
Kassin plans to explore legislation to “find a creative solution” to offer state financial support to future natural disaster victims. He plans to work with the state Department of Public Safety, Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and Department of Game, Fish and Parks to understand what options are available.
“It showed some gaps in the way we deal with disasters in the state and some of the lack of funding triggers or mechanisms that we might have to help people in need,” Kassin said during a legislative panel Thursday at the University of South Dakota.
Speichinger said she and her family plan to remain in their home because they can’t afford to move elsewhere. She said any mitigation plan North Sioux City presents should include an overhaul of the 1976 plan.
State analyzes prediction and modeling failures
Tim Cowman is the state geologist and director of the South Dakota Geological Survey. In a meeting with the East Dakota Water Development District in late 2024, he said the Big Sioux River flooding came faster and harder than predicted by the National Weather Service. The flooding was caused by three days of rain June 20-22 in southeast South Dakota, surpassing 17 inches in some locations.
Cowman said the water started flowing over I-29 a mile before the levee.
“The flood would have happened at McCook Lake whether or not that levee was there,” Cowman said.

Some residents including Speichinger say the levee over I-29 made the flooding at McCook Lake worse, that they were not properly informed of the plan to install it, and were not sufficiently warned about the potential effects. She, a group of other residents and their attorney have since served the state of South Dakota with a notice of a potential lawsuit over its role in constructing the levee, although no lawsuit has yet been filed.
Cowman said future mitigation measures should plan for flood events like this more often.
“These are 100 and 500 year floods, but they happen every five years now,” Cowman said.

Experts say factors in that change may include more severe precipitation due to climate change, the conversion of sponge-like prairies to farm fields, the installation of drain tile under fields to dump excess moisture into creeks and rivers, and urban sprawl that sends more runoff into waterways.
Cowman helps predict flooding impacts for the state with the South Dakota Flood Information System, which produces flood maps based on different scenarios, including peak flows and breached levees.
Cowman said predictions of the “magnitude” of flooding that struck McCook Lake should be more accurate in the future, because they’ll include data from the 2024 flood.
He and his team met with the National Weather Service Missouri Basin River Forecast Center in Kansas City twice to “work out kinks” and understand modeling and timing failures.
“From the state’s standpoint,” Cowman said, “we’re trying to make sure the river forecast center doesn’t get fooled again on a flood of this magnitude down there.”

Trump also promised that “drill baby drill” would not only “unleash” energy production in the U.S. As he insisted repeatedly at his campaign appearances in Nevada last year, lower energy costs rippling through the economy as a result of drill baby drill was also the centerpiece of his strategy for lowering prices on all other goods and services.

Oil prices are projected to decline slightly this year, not because of drill baby drill, but because Trump’s tariffs and their accompanying televised presidential hissy fits are a drag on the economy. Trump met with oil industry executives Wednesday. They love the prospect of Trump cutting their taxes and regulations.

Budget-wise it’s among the smallest of the numerous tax cuts he promised (the lost revenue from No Tax on Social Security income is humongous by comparison). So it might be included in the tax cuts for the rich and corporate that Trump and congressional Republicans are poised to pay for by cutting Medicaid (which will hurt Nevada more than most states, by the way).
At the same time, if tariffs send consumers into a spending tailspin, and tourists (and not just international ones) stop coming to Las Vegas, a lot of folks who might have hoped to catch a No Tax on Tips break may find that the presence or absence of federal taxation of tips is the least of their problems. If it wasn’t already.

When he was campaigning Trump also promised to be a dictator on day one, punish his enemies, and concentrate unprecedented and,  according to multiple lower federal courts, unconstitutional authority in the executive branch at the expense of Congress and the judiciary.

What are the odds voters will buy that in the 21st century? Judging from the last 10 years or so, fifty-fifty sounds about right.

Reid/Kitsap Sun)Tatiana Leone never leaves her Bremerton apartment without a reusable grocery bag filled with documents detailing her son’s history of mental illness. She doesn’t know when she will run into her son, who lives unhoused in Seattle, and she wants to be prepared if he’s in a crisis.
She’s used the pile of documents — including records of his behavioral health history, jail stints and hospital stays — once before. In 2020, she successfully asked a Pierce County judge to involuntarily detain her son, whom she asked not to be named to respect his privacy, under Washington’s Joel’s Law. Leone, like others caring for loved ones experiencing acute mental illness, had spent many painstaking years trying to get her son help, only to find a fractured and complex mental health system that did little more than send her son to jail. She felt like she had exhausted all other options.
“It’s a gut-wrenching process because you don’t want to alienate your loved one and make them fear you or that the world is against them because they’re already thinking that in some cases,” Leone said. “You’re just trying to help.” 
Joel’s Law, which passed the state Legislature with overwhelming support in 2015, was designed to provide a lifeline for parents like Leone who wished to directly petition the judicial system to get their loved one into treatment. Typically, designated crisis responders — mental health professionals who act as a bridge between the medical system and the courts — are the ones to recommend involuntary detainment if they believe someone’s behavioral health conditions meet the state’s legal criteria.
While the law was celebrated for helping to elevate the voices of concerned families, petitioning the court is just one step in a long, complicated process that might not ultimately lead to treatment or sustained support, as Leone and others have experienced. Only three days after Leone’s son was detained, he was released from the hospital and was back cycling through the same systems as before.
Joel’s Law petitions comprise only a small portion of all involuntary detainments in Washington, but the number of cases involving the petitions has increased statewide by 266% since 2020, according to state court data obtained through a public records request. Much of that growth has been concentrated in the South and Central Puget Sound areas. Pierce and Kitsap County, where Leone attempted to get her son detained, have among the highest per-capita rates among Washington’s large counties. 
Medical professionals, mental health providers and lawyers have a longstanding disagreement over involuntary treatment, especially in Washington, where physicians are not allowed to make that call. Some medical professionals and families feel the system is antiquated and leaves too many people without care until they ultimately wind up in the criminal justice system. 
A decade since the law was passed, the use of the petitions is increasing, though questions remain about how much these petitions have helped make treatment more accessible to families. Those skeptical of the law acknowledge there needs to be more access points to behavioral health care but question if involuntary care is the appropriate response or if many of these people could be more effectively treated in the community.

Tara Urs, special counsel for civil policy and practice for the King County Department of Public Defense, feels for the family members submitting these petitions, knowing that the supports available outside of the hospital doors are difficult — and at times impossible —— to access. 
“I understand why people might want to be banging down the only door that might be available, even though I think it is the wrong door,” said Urs, who represents people facing involuntary detention. But the state must meet a high burden of proof before taking away someone’s civil liberties.
“Joel’s Law increased the kinds of people who could try to access the front door of the hospital, and for King County, I’m not sure how much of an impact that’s made,” she added. “But I don’t think that means that there’s not a problem worth solving.”
Number of petitions on the rise
A group of parents, frustrated that their loved ones with acute mental illnesses were not getting help, pushed for the passage of Joel’s Law in 2015. Doug and Nancy Reuter, whose son Joel became the law’s namesake, helped bring attention to the issue. Seattle police fatally shot Joel, a 28-year-old software engineer suffering from bipolar disorder, in 2013. The Reuters said they tried 48 times prior to that standoff to get their son help.
“What was happening everywhere — and I certainly heard about it in our area — was parents would be told, ‘Well we can’t do anything until they break the law,’ even though the parent knew the child was in grave danger of hurting themselves or somebody else,” said Kitsap County Commissioner Christine Rolfes, a former state senator who was a co-sponsor of the bill creating Joel’s Law.
Michael Kawamura, who oversees Pierce County’s public defender office, suspects the high number of Joel’s Law petitions filed in Pierce County could be due to the county being home to the largest psychiatric hospital in the state, Western State Hospital. A person can be held up to five days for an emergency detention, potentially followed by a 14-day treatment with additional 90- or 180-day extensions. With each extension, a new petition must be filed with the court, which could increase the number being filed in Pierce County.
“The majority of counties don’t do most of the long-term commitments,” said Kawamura, who helps oversee cases involving Joel’s Law petitions. “That’s just the hospital jurisdictions. And so most of the counties will do that initial 14-day commitment, but then they stop.”
Providers attribute much of the increase to more awareness. Police and mental health workers are educating families about Joel’s Law, and in some areas, the complex process to file a petition has been streamlined. 
“It’s 10 years old,” Jenna Vyhlidal, manager of mobile crisis outreach at Kitsap Mental Health Services, said of Joel’s Law, “but I think we’re finally starting to make it work.”
Dr. James Hughes, chief medical officer at Kitsap Mental Health Services, speculates that some of the difference between counties can be attributed to differing interpretations of state statutes. State laws on involuntary detainment are vague and open to nuanced interpretation. The definition of “imminent” — a requirement for someone to be involuntarily detained — is an example of that.
“I’ve heard it used differently by different counties or even different institutions,” he said.
Kitsap is among the counties where crisis responders are permitted to do single-bed certifications, allowing them to detain someone at a local hospital if no inpatient psychiatric beds are available throughout the state. Kitsap also permits non-emergent detention, letting crisis responders petition to detain someone who is not yet an imminent threat to themselves or others but is showing signs of a deteriorating mental state. 
“It lets us do our job but prevent future [crises] so we’re not five days behind,” Vyhlidal said.
By design, medical providers have few options to force a patient into treatment, especially in Washington. The state’s Involuntary Treatment Act was established in the 1970s amid the national “deinstitutionalization” movement that sought to release hundreds of thousands of people held in psychiatric hospitals and move away from the system that gave doctors the sole power to strip someone of their civil liberties.
“If I agree their loved one is in need of help, I can’t make them get it. I have to defer to somebody who did not see you in your acute crisis and may not have the same perspective on medical care or training as I do as the ER clinician caring for you,” said Nathan Schlicher, an emergency room physician who lives in Gig Harbor and is a past president of the Washington State Medical Association. “That is the unique nature of Washington law.”
One family’s journey using Joel’s Law
When Leone’s son’s mental health conditions started to escalate in his late teens, she didn’t know where to turn. She had brought him to the emergency room during a handful of episodes but was often turned away. She had heard of designated crisis responders but was told that the only way to get her son evaluated was to call the police. She tried this numerous times, which often led to him being taken to jail, she said.
“He really just needed help and intervention,” she said. “It didn’t help my son at all, because oftentimes, while in custody, their solution for people in mental health crisis is solitary confinement, and that’s not helpful either.”
On Christmas Eve in 2020, Leone’s son was in acute crisis, in a state of heightened fear and expressing thoughts of self-harm. Leone brought him to St. Anthony’s Hospital in Gig Harbor in hopes that he would be seen by a designated crisis responder from Pierce County instead of in Kitsap County, where they had been evaluated previously but involuntary detainment was not recommended, she said. While she was out getting her son warmer clothes, a designated crisis responder came and went without recommending involuntary detainment. Her son then ran away.

She was angry with the hospital staff for letting him walk out the door in the middle of a snowstorm. They told her there was nothing they could do. Not knowing what to do next, Leone drove to a nearby Target parking lot and called the police. “My son happened to bump right into me in a Target parking lot,” she recalled.
While Leone was on the phone with the 911 operator, her son was talking about harming himself. She asked the operator if she could hear his comments. “One of the (designated crisis responder’s) had told me that unless we hear him say he wants to kill himself to us, or unless we hear it with our own ears, we cannot just take anybody’s word for it.”
The next thing she knew, police were surrounding her car. The 911 operator told her that they would contact the designated crisis responder to come out. Instead, they arrested him and charged him with domestic violence, which prohibited him from contacting Leone. She had told the officers that she wasn’t in danger. “I am not afraid of my son,” she recalled telling them. “I called you to help him.”
“It was unbelievable,” she said. “I am his only support system. He doesn’t have a dad, he doesn’t have any other family or anybody else who advocates for him. So they alienated him from his sole support network.”
After he was taken to jail, Leone called the crisis line back. 
That’s when she was told about Joel’s Law. She says she “thought it was going to be the answer we were looking for.” 
Families have 10 days after a designated crisis responder evaluates their loved one to file a Joel’s Law petition with a judge. The petition includes the reasons the family believes someone should be detained. That often provides a more comprehensive look at someone’s history than what a designated crisis responder can necessarily see at the moment, said  Vyhlidal, the Kitsap crisis outreach manager. 
“I’ve seen petitions go back to childhood photos,” she said.
When a judge grants a Joel’s Law petition, the same process follows as when a designated crisis responder detains someone. They are held for a maximum of 120 hours (plus holidays and weekends) during which a mental health professional decides if they need to be committed for longer. 
The day after Leone’s son was taken to jail and she learned about Joel’s Law, she started gathering the hundreds of documents she was told she needed to file the petition, including documentation of hospital stays, jail stints and admittance to crisis care. The process was arduous.
She was told she had to file the petition in person in Tacoma, but she couldn’t get out of her driveway due to snow. She took an Uber to a FedEx store in Bremerton and spent $200 faxing the documents to the court.
They ultimately approved her petition and served him the paperwork when he was in jail. She said it was painful not to be able to reassure him given the protection order stemming from the DV charge. When she finally spoke to him, he was rightfully upset, she said.
“He thought that I was just out to get him and take him down, which was part of his symptoms, too,” Leone said. “Which kind of makes sense looking back, because his intuition is telling him something was wrong, and he doesn’t know where to look for the source of this feeling, and so everybody becomes a suspect.”
After three days in the hospital and one day back in jail, he was released, and Leone felt like she was back to square one. “I thought they had said that they were going to keep him until he was stabilized,” she said.
Skepticism remains
Silvia Riley, the director of crisis services at Multicare, is lukewarm on Joel’s Law. It is not a bad policy, she said. Designated crisis responders, while highly trained, make mistakes. But she wants judges to apply the same scrutiny to petitions that designated crisis responders do to their evaluations. Detention should be a last resort.
“We show up with the intention of [involuntary commitment] being the last thing we want to do,” she said. “It’s not always a popular decision, but we take it very seriously.”
Judges, she argues, feel compelled to help individuals experiencing severe mental illness, often receiving thick petitions documenting someone’s whole and often traumatic history. But while many people need behavioral health treatment, designated crisis responders often disagree that an involuntary approach is the best method for that care.
For example, MultiCare was once asked to detain someone but could not serve them because they were at work every day.
“That itself tells me that this person is not a good candidate for involuntary commitment, because he’s living productively,” she said, adding later: “It makes me question, is this the best way to get them help? Or are we missing some opportunities in the community?”
The practice of involuntarily detaining someone at a mental hospital has a dark and not-so-distant history. For example, women were frequently institutionalized in mental hospitals for not being submissive enough to their husbands. It’s why the bar is so high for committing someone, Urs said.
Urs wants to see a more holistic approach to mental health treatment and sees the conversation mainly focused on “how open or closed” the door to the hospital should be. Some efforts have given her hope, like King County’s Program of Assertive Community Treatment, coined the PACT program. The program, which Urs describes as a “hospital without walls,” is tailored toward people with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and schizoaffective bipolar disorder. Still, the program only scratches the surface.
“We don’t have nearly enough PACT teams in King County to meet the needs of the people in our community who are experiencing disorders of psychosis,” she added.
Mental toll on families
Any time it snows, Leone is always out searching for her son in Seattle, distributing food and supplies to other unhoused people during the process. When he calls from a borrowed cellphone or from jail, she begs him to call more to let her know he’s OK. If there’s time, she tries to convince him to go to a crisis care center. She said he feels trapped at treatment centers and has lost faith that medication will help.
Leone isn’t sure whether she would file another Joel’s Law petition again, but she hasn’t completely ruled it out. 
“The hope was that he would be able to obtain some relief from his symptoms and then be able to develop some appreciation for knowing what it felt like to not be suffering from those symptoms, and then building that rapport with him would help him be more receptive to staying in compliance with the treatment plan,” Leone said.
She understands why Joel’s Law is controversial. It’s something she has to grapple with frequently.
“They can’t just go around taking people’s rights away” or “involuntarily medicate people,” she said. 
Ultimately, she wishes they had better access to mental health services before it got to the point of using a Joel’s Law petition. Or, that there were court advocates available to help families navigate the Joel’s Law petition process.
She said each time they tried to get help — whether it was at the hospital or through a designated crisis responder or crisis care center — the relief was fleeting and the web of bureaucracy pushed her son further away. “He wanted the help, but he was also able to see that every time somebody was promising to help him, it was only hurting him,” she said.
It’s all taken a toll on Leone.
“I get a lot of ‘Just let it go. He’s choosing this. Just let it go. He likes this lifestyle. He’s choosing this lifestyle.’ And it’s infuriating because it’s like, no, he’s just as in need of help and support and unconditional love as anybody who has got some physically evident disability or impairment or illness.”
Anytime Leone is able to find her son on the streets of Seattle, he is always happy to see her and his little brother, Leone said.

(Photo by Dugan Meyer)Phoenix will be hosting a convention featuring President Donald Trump’s “border czar,” as well as hundreds of military and tech companies bidding for government border contracts, including a company involved in the torture in Abu Ghraib.
The Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center April 8 and 9 features panel discussions, as well as an expo floor where vendors can hawk their wares to government officials from around the world.
“It is just a big marketplace of companies — mostly tech companies — trying to sell things to the government,” Dave Maass, director of investigations for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the Arizona Mirror about the event. The EFF has previously catalogued the vendors who attend the annual conference, with a focus on technologies such as AI, infrared cameras and more.
The Trump administration has made border security a top priority after campaigning on immigration as a major issue. The administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and they have consistently tried to keep their mass deportation plans a secret.
The Mirror attempted to get press credentials to the Border Security Expo but was told that the event is closed to the press “this year.” The event website lists “media partners,” which include online pro-law enforcement trade publications like Border Security Report, Homeland Security Today and Officer.com. Homeland Security Today is run by a group of CEOs whose companies are on the expo floor.
The event will feature a number of high ranking officials from Customs and Border Patrol, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Drug Enforcement Agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The most high profile is Trump’s “border czar,” Tom Homan.
Homan served as the acting director of ICE in Trump’s first term. He backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups. Homan is scheduled to give the opening remarks at the event as part of a “State of the Border” discussion.
Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels will also speak at the event on a panel to give local perspectives to border issues.
While the event will feature a number of panel discussions and high profile speakers, it will also feature a litany of companies who will be aiming to impress government officials at the event in the hopes of securing a government contract or continuing an existing one.
The Mirror examined the list of companies set to be in attendance to highlight some of the key trends as well as noteworthy companies seeking the attention of the government officials.
The military industrial complex 
Many, if not most, of the vendors at the expo also serve the United States military and militaries overseas.
For example, Thales Defense and Security Inc. is a subsidiary of Thales Group, a French multinational aerospace and defense corporation. Its subsidiary has primarily done work on radio upgrades for the US Army and NATO forces and will be present on the expo floor.
When it comes to immigration and border enforcement, the company has supplied the systems the United States uses at ports of entry that involve biometric data. Other companies known for their large military contracts, such as BAE Systems, also will be present.
One particular military contracting company with a dark past also will have a booth on the expo floor. In November 2024, a jury found that Caci International shared liability with the U.S. Army for the torture of three Iraqi men at the Abu Graib prion in 2004, awarding the men $42 million.
The Virginia-based defense contractor has long gotten a number of contracts from the Department of Homeland Security.
Caci International is not the only government contractor with a controversial past.
Journalists at ProPublica recently exposed how private prison company GEO Group, an ICE contractor, has been refusing to pay detainees more than $1 a day for cleaning the governmental facilities at which they live. GEO Group’s stocks have skyrocketed under the Trump administration to $4 billion.
Another group with ties to Trump and a controversial backstory that will be present on the expo floor is Constellis, part of the private security company known as Triple Canopy.
Triple Canopy is a formation of what were once rival private security companies, Blackwater and Constellis. Guards from that company were spotted outside various federal agencies that were being taken over by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.
Also present will be Anduril Industries, which has ties to Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official.
Military grade equipment 
The expo floor will be full of vendors showing off their products which range from physical products like cameras and ground sensors to software that can be used to process data obtained by law enforcement.
Much of that equipment is also military grade.
Groups like ProTech Defense, Soal Marine Group and QuickSet Defense Technologies make military grade equipment that is marketed not just to federal agencies patrolling the border, but military customers.
Other tech is similar, often showcased being used by armed forces in online literature or described with military jargon.
Many of the surveillance camera platforms are similar or the same as those used on military aircraft, naval vessels or ground vehicles. Some firms, like Controp USA, boast about the capabilities of their surveillance platforms for both local law enforcement and military.
The militarization of police and border enforcement has long been a point of debate among privacy advocates, with research suggesting that law enforcement that has more access to military grade equipment are more likely to have violent encounters with the public.
Strongwatch will have a presence at the expo and it already has some of its tools in the hands of local Arizona law enforcement. The Phoenix Police Department has one of Strongwatch’s “Freedom on the Move” surveillance truck platforms, which are frequently deployed at parades and protests.
Anti/pro-drone
This year’s expo also features a number of companies focused on anti-drone technology, something local lawmakers and Attorney General Kris Mayes have been focused on lately, as well.
House Bill 2733 by Rep. David Marshall, R-Snowflake, would give local law enforcement immunity from liability for damage to personal property if they are shooting down a drone they believe is engaged in criminal activity.
The bill comes amid an increase in drug cartel drones flying over the states’ southern border, GOP lawmakers and Mayes say that local police should be able to shoot them out of the sky without fear they’ll be sued. A large number of tech companies at the expo this year are offering their own solutions to this problem.
Fortem Technologies has provided its counter-UAS (unmanned aerial systems, a technical term for drones) equipment to Ukrainian forces, leading to it being sanctioned by Russia in response. The company has already been attracting interest from DHS, but other competitors have been vying for what appears to be a burgeoning market.
The Mirror found four other companies that will be on the expo floor selling anti-drone tech, with another that has sent one of its devices to frontline forces in Ukraine. But there are just as many companies, if not more, wanting to put eyes up in the sky as there are that want to remove them.
Aerial surveillance is a major strategy of CBP and DHS, who deploy aerial assets to the border daily to follow suspects or surveil areas where border crossers are known to frequent or smugglers are known to go.
A number of companies focused on different forms of aerial surveillance are also present at this year’s expo including multiple manufacturers of aerostats, a type of blimp. Recently, one of CBP’s blimps became untethered in Texas, leading to it flying miles away after being blown away by gusts of wind.
QinetiQ, the UK firm behind the Zephyr “pseudo satellite,” a high flying unmanned aircraft that can stay aloft for months at a time, will also be at the expo. Ascent AeroSystems, a subsidiary of Robinson Helicopters, will be at the expo and is currently promoting a new drone that it says is “advanced aerial surveillance in the palm of your hand.”
A number of new drone technologies appear to be on display at this year’s expo, including a hydrogen powered drone and a tethered drone as well.
AI and more 
Another trend this year is the promotion of artificial intelligence. Many of the companies tout the use of AI either to boost already existing programs or to be used in new ways.
One such company is Overland AI, which recently raised $32 million in funding. The company aims to create fully autonomous ground vehicles for the military and Overland is partnered with L3 Harris, one of the largest defense contractors in the world, who will also be present at the expo.
Other uses for AI are for surveillance gathering and analysis, such as with Australian-based FiveCast, which has previously signed contracts with DHS to use AI to look for open source intelligence threats.
Social media monitoring tools that have alarmed privacy advocates, like ShadowDragon, will also be present at the expo.
Other software companies that will be on the sales floor have faced controversy in the past.
One company, Perceptics, which has gotten contracts with the federal government for biometric data collection and automatic license plate reader collection, was part of the reason for a major breach in biometric data related to a facial recognition pilot program.
“A subcontractor working on this effort, Perceptics, LLC, transferred copies of CBP’s biometric data, such as traveler images, to its own company network. The subcontractor obtained access to this data between August 2018 and January 2019 without CBP’s authorization or knowledge. Later in 2019, DHS experienced a major privacy incident, as the subcontractor’s network was subjected to a malicious cyber attack,” the Office of the Inspector General wrote in a 2020 report.
Sponsors
While the event is closed to the press and largely to the public, those who can afford it can opt to pay $1,395 for the full conference. Those with government email or .edu email addresses can get in for free, and the expo offers a guide to those seeking to “justify” the event’s cost to their employer.
Akima, who got nearly a billion dollars in contracts with the United States Space Force last year, is the expo’s top sponsor. However, under the “Supporting Organizations” banner of the event are some more notable organizations.
The Texas Public Policy Foundation is a conservative think tank whose members have been promoted by Trump in the previous administration and have denied climate change, pushed school vouchers and received funding from both the GEO Group and Koch Industries.
The Texas Public Policy Foundation was also on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Project 2025 is a collection of right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power under the Trump administration. The list of policy plans was largely created by former Trump aides and allies.
Another “supporting organization” is the Border Patrol Foundation, whose president in 2018 garnered controversy for defending the use of pepper spray on migrants at the border by saying that a person could put it on nachos and eat it. That man, Ron Colburn, is on the advisory board for the expo.

Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are ringing alarm bells over congressional Republicans’ proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding, which could especially hurt older Americans. (Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
 A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
 Cutting care at home

All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”
Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.
Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”
There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

(Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images)Nearly 20 years ago, my wife and I were lucky enough to study abroad in England. We had been awarded graduate scholarships and obtained our student visas from the British government. At the time, there was a heartbreaking genocide happening in Darfur. As concerned students invested in the moral standing of our university, we joined peaceful protests calling on Oxford to divest from companies that profited from the genocide and urged the British Parliament to intervene.

I never feared that my exercise of free speech would get me arrested and kicked out of what I took to be the second freest nation on earth, after my own. And I certainly could not have imagined a swarm of British agents abducting me on the street and deporting me without cause. Perhaps in the time of King George III but not the age of constitutions.



On Tuesday, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University in Boston, was walking peacefully to the university’s Interfaith Center to break her Ramadan fast when six government agents in masks and hoodies surrounded her and took her away screaming in an unmarked SUV.
For a day or more, according to Fox News, Rumeysa’s family and lawyers had no idea where she was and were unable to contact her. No charges were filed against her. A federal district judge even ordered the government not to move her out of state. But she was moved anyway — to a detention center in Louisiana, awaiting deportation.
Rumeysa had a valid student visa, as Fox News also reported. She was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to complete her Ph.D. at Tufts’ Department of Child Study and Human Development, where she researches children and media. No charges were filed against her and there was no warrant for her arrest; warrants are issued by judges who require the government to show cause.
The best guess for why she has been detained is that her name appeared with several others on an article in the student newspaper last year calling on Tufts University to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies with ties to Israel. The op-ed never mentioned Hamas, which the U.S. government rightly considers a terrorist organization. There is no evidence that she harbored any sympathy for, much less aided and abetted, Hamas or other organizations opposed to the United States. It seems her only “crime” was to peacefully speak out, as a concerned student, in a manner disfavored by the current administration.
Americans may freely disagree about the heartbreaking conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has left thousands of innocent Israelis and hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians dead or injured in recent years. For my part, having traveled to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and believing in the state of Israel as a necessary response to the evils of the Holocaust (in which Jewish family members of mine were killed), I take seriously the conclusions of the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International that Israel’s war in Gaza is a “plausible” genocide.
But regardless of what we believe about Israel and Palestine, there is one thing on which Americans overwhelmingly agree: our constitutional right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment is sacred and immigrants who lawfully reside among us are not without rights of their own. As you uphold my right to call the war in Gaza genocidal, I defend your right to call Hamas an evil terrorist organization. In fact, I’ll join in that because it is also true.
Freedom of speech is as American as apple pie. It’s what has attracted many of the brightest minds from foreign lands to come here legally as students and help make America the richest, most innovative nation on earth — including Elon Musk.
Sadly, Rumeysa is not alone. She is one of hundreds of lawful immigrants so far who have been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration in recent weeks, without any pretense of due process. Their abductions on American streets by unmarked and unidentified “law enforcement” agents are being funded by our tax dollars to the tune of untold millions.
So far we have seen at least seven other students detained for showing sympathy for Palestinians; hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported to a Salvadoran prison camp against the orders of a federal judge, and extended detentions and physical abuse of lawful migrants at the American border. These and countless other acts represent an unprecedented abuse of federal power against individuals whose lack of citizenship gives them limited legal recourse, in spite of their legal status in this country.
Given the choice, I still believe my fellow Americans would choose the Constitution over a man who would be king. It’s time we make that choice — not just for Rumeysa but for this country we love.

Gov. Leslie Rutledge preside over a joint session of the Arkansas House and Senate on Jan. 14, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas legislative leaders say they expect long days at the Capitol during the home stretch of the 2025 legislative session, which they anticipate ending by April 16.
“We’re going to start earlier in the day and we’re going to work late in the day” to move bills through committees and through the House and Senate, Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said in an interview Wednesday.
For any Senate bills that don’t pass Senate committees this week, “it’s going to be very, very difficult for them to move forward,” he said.
House Speaker Rep. Brian Evans echoed those sentiments Friday, noting that Monday and Tuesday will likely be heavy bill filing days because waiting to file beyond that will make it really difficult for legislation to make it all the way through the process. Many bills already have been delayed due to drafting, amendments and last-minute changes, as well as waiting on fiscal impact statements, according to Evans, who said he wasn’t aware of any urgent or controversial bills that have yet to be filed. 
The Cabot Republican said he’s been speaking with House committee chairs about how to clear their calendars and ensure bills that will be heard are placed on the active agenda. The latter is important for transparency and ensuring constituents have time to make arrangements to speak for or against legislation, he said.

In addition to finalizing the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget, the Legislature is expected to consider some of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ policy priorities for the session that have not yet become law.
Two such bills are sponsored by Hester: Senate Bill 377, which would eliminate the state’s 0.125% grocery sales tax, and Senate Bill 426, the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act. The latter would mandate that Arkansas law enforcement agencies participate in a federal program that deputizes them to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the apprehension and deportation of undocumented migrants held in local jails and state prisons.
Hester said he hopes to present SB 426 for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. SB 377 is on Monday’s Senate Revenue and Tax Committee agenda.
Regulating minors’ access to cellphones and social media has also been a priority for Sanders. Two bills modeled after federal legislation passed the House with bipartisan support this month: House Bill 1717 is the Arkansas Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, and House Bill 1726 is the Arkansas Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA).
Arkansas panel advances children’s online safety and privacy bills modeled after federal efforts

Senate committees will make time to consider both bills even if special orders of business are necessary, Hester said. A special order of business compels consideration before other items on a committee agenda. 
Sanders said in January, during her State of the State address, that the Legislature should amend the Social Media Safety Act of 2023 “so that it’s no longer held up in court and can begin to be enforced.” The enjoined law would have been the first in the nation to require minors to receive parental permission before signing up for a social media account.
So far no such amendments to the law have been proposed, but Hester said he expects it to “happen one way or another” since the governor said it is important to her.
“It may be something we don’t have to handle because it’s getting handled in other ways,” Hester said. “Maybe we’re confident that we’re going to end up winning in court. Maybe we’re confident that… President [Donald] Trump’s executive orders will handle it or something that they’re doing on the federal level.”
Compensation, prisons and China
The Senate is set to take up a proposed revamp of the state employee pay plan Monday, which passed the Joint Budget Committee on March 20. Sanders announced the plan in November and said it should make most state employees’ salaries competitive with the private sector and improve recruitment and retention.

Arkansas lawmakers advance $750 million appropriation bill for prison construction

 

The pay plan has not been controversial, unlike Sanders’ plan to build a 3,000-bed prison on 815 acres the state purchased in Franklin County. Earlier this month, the Joint Budget Committee approved a $750 million appropriation for the project, which has sparked frustration from some lawmakers and Franklin County residents.
Evans said he anticipates the prison appropriation legislation, Senate Bill 354, will continue generating discussion and could take a couple of tries to meet the required vote threshold in the House. Most bills need a simple majority of lawmakers’ support to pass, but budget-related bills need three-fourths of the support of each chamber, or 76 House votes and 27 Senate votes.
“When you’re talking about 100 members, it’s a lot of different opinions, a lot of different ideas, last-minute questions that come up,” he said. “Maybe there’ll be some folks not vote for it the first time just so that they get some extra time, make sure they have all their questions answered.”
Hester said he expects the bill to come before the full Senate on Tuesday. He said he could not predict how the Senate will vote; there is no limit on how many votes an appropriation bill receives before it reaches the three-fourths vote threshold.
Sanders urged passage of the appropriation in an Arkansas Democrat-Gazette op-ed Friday and called on state lawmakers to “[r]eject the tired excuses of politicians who don’t want criminals behind bars. Fund the prison, public safety, and a better future for all Arkansans.”
Sanders has also expressed support for a package of bills that will ban certain interactions between state entities and the Chinese government. She and other Republicans have criticized China’s activities in the state, including its past ownership of farmland in Craighead County.
Only one of the six bills has been signed into law and the rest are at various stages of the legislative process, but Hester said there is “nothing more popular with constituents than pushing back on China and what they’re doing to us.”

Constitutional amendments and education
Prior to last week’s recess, the House State Agencies Committee spent three weeks considering 20 proposed constitutional amendments. Evans anticipates the committee will begin ranking the proposals this week and likely send the top five to the House for further consideration. The Senate has 24 proposals to consider.
The Arkansas Legislature can refer three proposed constitutional amendments to voters during a legislation session, with each chamber generally selecting one and jointly selecting a third, Evans said. However, it’s not a requirement that lawmakers always refer three amendments, he said. 
“I think it’s really, really important to understand that just because we can do three, does not mean that we have to do three,” he said. “But also with the understanding that if we are going to present something forward, refer something out to the public to vote, I think it needs to be something that is really important statewide.”
Also this week, Evans said he anticipates Rep. Keith Brooks, a Little Rock Republican who succeeded him as chair of the House Education Committee this year, will run the biannual public school funding bill, which dictates per-student funding. House Bill 1312 was expected to be considered prior to the break, but was held up because it was awaiting a fiscal impact statement, Evans said. Fiscal impact statements explain how much money a bill would cost to implement, and they are compiled by either the Bureau of Legislative Research or the Department of Finance and Administration.
The per-pupil funding amount for the current school year is $7,771. If lawmakers approve HB 1312, the amount would increase to $8,162 for the 2025-2026 school year and $8,371 for the following academic year. 
New bill would dissolve Arkansas State Library and its board, set new library funding criteria

Overall, the session has been “very smooth,” according to Evans, who said he’s noticed “a different feel, a camaraderie in the House” when it comes to “good policy for all Arkansans.”
“Where things tend to get difficult is when you start looking at policy that’s more culture-driven,” he said. “So while we’ve had a few of those things that have crept up this session, there hasn’t seemed to have been as many. And so the body has really been able to just focus more on policy and members representing their districts, and how that policy’s going to affect their district rather than the culture of the district.” 
One such “culture-driven” bill is Senate Bill 536, which Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, filed March 20. It would dissolve the Arkansas State Library and its board after the board did not take what Sullivan said were appropriate actions to keep “age-inappropriate” materials away from minors.
Hester supports SB 536 and has expressed support for Sullivan’s past promises to abolish the library board, which has repeatedly refused to divest from the American Library Association and to withhold funding from libraries where “sexually explicit” materials are within children’s reach.
“I don’t know how clear we could have been with the library board that they need to take stances to not provide pornography to kids, and they are insistent on it,” Hester said Friday.
The General Assembly resumes its work Monday morning. Meeting schedules, agendas and livestreams are available on the Arkansas Legislature’s website.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)This is Kansas.
Imagine. It’s late at night and you’re fiddling with the tuning dial of an old shortwave radio that’s been in your garage since your eccentric old uncle died and left you a pile of his favorite stuff. You haven’t given much thought to any of it for years, but then one of your neighbors disappeared last month, hustled away by masked individuals with badges and thrown into an unmarked black SUV.
Today is the sixty-ninth day of…
The signal begins to fade, then is lost in the static. Bathed in the glow of the tuning dial, you lean close and turn the knob ever so slightly until the voice of the announcer returns. She speaks well, confident and knowing, and you can almost see her expression as she continues.
We’re broadcasting tonight from — well, we can’t say exactly where, but we can tell you we were in Council Grove last night and Garden City the night before that. 
It’s a bright night in April under a full moon, but you take comfort in the dark of the garage, which smells of grease and ozone from the big transformer in the back of the old radio receiver. It took you a week to figure out how to hang the wire antenna beneath your eaves so you could pick up a broadcast and another night or two to learn how to tune a signal. It all was so strangely analog, but luckily your uncle left you some books about how to do it.
We don’t know where we’ll be tomorrow.
The rumor on the block was that your neighbor was a terrorist, but you hadn’t seen anything to support that. Sure, she had some outspoken opinions about American foreign policy in the Middle East, but she also had had a good job and a family here. You worried about her kids. When you called the regional ICE detention center, run by a private prison, you were told coldly the detainee was no longer in U.S. custody. You asked if that meant she was no longer in the country. There was a pause, and then the voice on the other end of the line asked for your name.
We are here to tell you the news. The news may be good or bad, but we will always tell you the truth. Topping the news is that several hundred American deportees remain in foreign jails, expelled from this country and charged with no crime other than dissent. At least 40 of those individuals are Kansans. A prayer vigil was held at the Capitol Building rotunda in Topeka for the release of the unnamed deportees, but the interfaith gathering was disrupted by authorities citing new policies that make such protests illegal. 
You’ve never paid much attention to the regular news, preferring to get your information from podcasts that make you laugh. Newspapers are dead, magazines seem as old-fashioned as Christmas catalogs, and you haven’t read a book since you were forced to in high school. Television? Who watches fake news when there’s social media. Things that others say they care about — equality, progress, democracy — are just words. You didn’t vote in the presidential election last year because you couldn’t relate to either of the major party candidates. One was a clownish old man and the other was like that teacher in government class during senior year who made you feel guilty because you didn’t know the Bill of Rights.
In world news, NATO alliance helicopters are attempting to airlift the last resistance fighters from Kiev as the fall of the Ukrainian capital to advancing Russian forces appears imminent. A war predicted to last three days when it began in 2022 has lasted more than three years. The turning point was when the United States suspended military assistance in March 2025, the U.S. later withdrew from NATO, and Russia broke the resolve of Ukrainian and European defenders by threatening the use of tactical nuclear weapons. There is no word on the fate of the Ukrainian president, who vowed never to abandon the capital. 
Lately you’ve discovered that it’s more difficult to find on your devices information you used to take for granted: how to file your taxes, how fast the measles outbreak is moving in southwestern Kansas, what the local weather’s going to be for the rest of the week. You’ve also become irritated by the ads showing up on your social media feeds, from the “one weird trick” to getting rich in crypto to the constant appeals for seven “supernatural blessings” for just $1,000.
Now to finances. The global tariff war continues, with Americans paying substantially higher prices for consumer goods ranging from Scotch whisky to imported cars and automobile parts. The average price of a new car is now $49,000, which for a typical family means a monthly payment of up to $1,000, not counting the cost of gas, taxes or insurance.
Worried about your neighbor, you went to your local newspaper office, believing the reporters there might be able to help, but discovered the door to the building was locked and a sign said it had ceased publication. You sort of remember that a local police department had raided a newspaper office somewhere in Kansas not so long ago, but you can’t recall the details. Your parents had always subscribed to the town paper, but it had never occurred to you because news was something you could get on the internet for free.
Where to go now? The nearest television station, the one that had not yet had its operating license revoked, was in Topeka. There used to be a local radio station here, but it went off the air years ago, after refusing to be bought up by a chain. The NPR station broadcasting from the local university was taken off the air a few weeks ago because some lawmakers called it “un-American,” followed by the  closing of most of the campus when the school lost its federal grants for promoting diversity and improper ideology.
Closer to home, Canadian armed forces conducted war games along the 49th Parallel, meant as a show of strength against continued threats from the American president to annex our northern neighbor as the 51st state. While long considered an absurd idea, the threats were taken seriously after American troops last week seized Greenland, declared it a U.S. territory, and gave its 57,000 citizens just five days to renounce their Danish citizenship or face deportation. The Folketing, the Danish parliament, has appealed for defense under Article 5 of the NATO treaty.
Wary of going to the police or other authorities for help, you went to the public library and were directed to an old-fashioned bulletin board where names, photos, and details of the missing were thumbtacked. There were a dozen from your town alone, fathers and mothers and students. Your neighbor wasn’t among them, so you took an index card from a nearby stack and wrote her name and description and added it to the others. You wished you had a photo, but you didn’t. Perhaps somebody else, her family or one of her friends, would add it. On your way out of the building, a librarian wearing a rainbow button on their sweater vest stopped and asked if you had a library card.
“Here,” they had said, and pressed a slip of paper into your hand. “Take it with you.”
But it wasn’t an application for a library card. It was a handwritten note:
“Radio Free Kansas, 10 p.m. nightly, 4960 MHz AM.”
Let us now recall the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who in September 1939 told the American people this: “For four long years a succession of actual wars and constant crises have shaken the entire world and have threatened in each case to bring on the gigantic conflict which is today unhappily a fact. … You are, I believe, the best informed and most enlightened people in all the world at this moment. … At the same time, as I told my press conference today, it is of the highest importance that the press and the radio use the utmost caution to discriminate between actual verified fact on the one hand, and mere rumor on the other.”
You stare at the glowing dial of the shortwave receiver as if it were the secret to decoding a mystery. What historical event happened in September 1939? You had this in history class. What was the significance of the date? Ah, Germany invades Poland. It marks the start of World War II in Europe.
Now, for our final segment, we rebroadcast something from Voice of America, disbanded in March 2025. The new chief responsible for VOA and Radio Free Europe and other broadcast initiatives had accused the agency of harboring spies and terrorist sympathizers, of widespread corruption, and of spending hundreds of millions on fake news. But the real issue with VOA is that it brought the world the truth, good or bad. This segment is about the monarch butterfly migration in Kansas, a journey that takes the colorful migrants from Mexico to Canada. It is from the VOA Learning English Broadcast of three years ago:
“The migrating monarch butterfly is considered an endangered species. Scientists say the dropping numbers of monarchs are due to climate change, loss of habitat and the use of pesticides — chemicals that kill insects — and herbicides — chemicals that kill plants. But there are things that people living in the United States can do to help the beloved black-and-orange insects.”
You think about all the butterflies that fluttered through your back yard this time of year when you were a kid. You think of all of them you caught in a net, all the ones you accidentally crushed, the ones you put in a mason jar and then forgot about. You get tearful, wishing you had urged your parents to plant milkweed.
We hope to see you here again tomorrow night. Stay safe. Ad astra! This is Radio Free Kansas signing off.
A few tinny bars of “Home on the Range” follow.
Then silence.

The morning newsletter Swell earned third place in the outstanding newsletter category among online news sites at the New England Newspaper Convention held at the Portland Regency Hotel & Spa in Portland, Maine.
The competition held by the New England Newspaper & Press Association is a chance for the region’s news outlets to showcase the best efforts of their teams and share their achievements with readers. Work published between Aug. 1 2023, and July 31, 2024, was eligible.
Rhode Island Current staff received a first place award for their work covering the November 2023 special election to fill the open 1st Congressional District seat, which was won by U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo. 
A total of 35 candidates turned in paperwork declaring their intention to run, but only 15 collected the minimum 500 validated and certified signatures from voters to run in the September primary. Thirteen candidates were Democrats, including the early frontrunner, Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos, whose campaign was ultimately derailed by a signature scandal involving her nomination forms.
Rhode Island Current’s election coverage also looked at what shapes this congressional district made up of 19 communities. While the Democratic race drew most of the attention, the team’s coverage included why the two Republican primary candidates stayed quiet. A Primary Day blog was active with regular updates on the candidates as the team fanned out to cover the campaigns and the results that night.
Lavin won a first place award for Business/Economic reporting for her investigative profile of a solar panel company CEO accused of predatory sales tactics. Lavin outlined the loosely regulated legal and business environment that allowed the company to flourish before being sued by the Office of Attorney General and laying off a third of its staff.
An in-depth story on a small but contentious oyster farm project proposed for Tiverton’s Sapowet Cove won Lavin another first place award. Lavin examined how the proposed project illuminated the curious alliances and growing discontent surrounding Rhode Island’s aquaculture industry more broadly.

(Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)In a stunning rejection of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, Louisiana voters turned down all four of his constitutional amendments Saturday, including the governor’s plan to overhaul the state’s tax and budget laws. 
With votes still being counted, nearly two-thirds of voters had refused all of the amendments in an election that could have broader political implications for the rest of Landry’s term. 
The governor, who has sometimes relied on strong-arm tactics to get his agenda through the Louisiana Legislature, could become more vulnerable to pushback after failing to pass his most ambitious policy proposal at the ballot box. 
Landry’s priority for the election, Amendment 2, would have lowered the maximum income tax rate the state could enact and limit annual state budget increases. It also would have made it more difficult to enact new tax breaks.
The proposal was expected to produce a financial windfall for Landry and state legislators later this year. Amendment 2 would have moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana’s general fund, where Landry and state legislators could have spent it more easily. 
Landry had attempted to sweeten voters on Amendment 2 by tying it to compensation for public school teachers. Had it passed, temporary stipends worth $2,000 and $1,000 that teachers and school support staff have received for the past two years were expected to become permanent. 

Now, the educators are at risk of a pay cut since Landry hasn’t included money for their stipend in his current budget proposal. 
Opponents of Amendment 2 celebrated its defeat Saturday night. They include William Most, an attorney who unsuccessfully sued to have the proposal removed from the ballot. He has argued that the language put before voters was convoluted and misleading, making it illegal.
“I think this is a full-throated rejection of attempts to trick Louisiana voters into voting for something they don’t want,” Most said. “… This sends a clear message that if state officials want to change our constitution, they can’t do it through trickery or deceit.”

Landry and the Republican-dominated legislature might have inadvertently stirred up public opposition to Amendment 2 by putting it on the same ballot as Amendment 3, a juvenile justice measure that drew the ire of Democrats and national anti-incarceration groups. 
Amendment 3, which 65% of voters opposed, would have made it easier to send more minors to adult jails and prisons for longer sentences. It spurred national criminal justice reform organizations, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and Vera Institute of Justice, to spend more than $500,000 to turn voters against it. 

While those organizations focused on defeating Amendment 3, they also became the backbone of a “No on All” campaign working to vote down all four of the constitutional amendments Landry was pushing. 
Supporters of the tax proposal in Amendment 2 said they believed the criminal justice issue had a negative effect on their measure in interviews earlier this week. 

“[Amendment 3] is a huge motivation of the groups that are saying no to everything. That seems to be the motivating factor,” said Daniel Erspamer, CEO of the Pelican Institute, a conservative think tank who helped push the tax and budget amendment. 
Landry’s team started to see trouble during the early voting period for the election. John Couvillon, an experienced Louisiana pollster, said Democrats and Black voters showed up in far greater numbers than Republicans during the early voting period. 

“I have just never seen an early vote this strong [for Democrats],” Couvillon said. 
In addition to Amendment 3, Couvillon said left-leaning voters may also be motivated to vote because of concerns about President Donald Trump. Landry is closely aligned with the Trump administration. 
However, opposition to Amendment 2, and the budget and tax changes, also came from some conservative activists. Religious groups and nonprofits were unhappy the amendment would have weakened constitutional protections for property tax exemptions they enjoy. 

Woody Jenkins, chairman of the East Baton Rouge Republican Party and a former state representative, was among those who opposed the amendment. 
The defeat of Amendments 2 and 3 also likely led to the downfall of Amendment 1, which failed with 64% of voters against the proposal. It would have allowed the formation of specialty courts in Louisiana with jurisdiction outside current parish and judicial districts. 
Amendment 4 also failed, with 62% of voters. It would have adjusted the rules for special elections to fill vacant or new judgeships, primarily on the Louisiana Supreme Court.

(Washington State Department of Transportation)A divided Washington state Senate on Saturday approved a hike in the state’s gas tax and a two-year budget that hinges on billions of dollars from new taxes on the state’s wealthiest residents and largest companies.
The Senate, on a 31-18 vote, endorsed raising the tax 6 cents per gallon on July 1 and increasing it 2% annually to account for inflation starting the following year.
It is the anchor of a barge full of new and higher taxes and fees that will generate around $500 million a year for transportation from users of cars, boats, planes, electric bikes and ferries. Those dollars will ensure the state can complete projects underway and do ones that have been long promised to residents.
“We are billions of dollars behind in maintenance and preservation. We have a ferry system that is in shambles. We have citizens dying at a record pace on our roads,” said Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, the lead Republican on the Senate Transportation Committee who helped craft the package. “We had to respond, and that’s what we did.”
Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the transportation committee and the chamber’s lead transportation budget writer, said the revenue “will unlock investments in every corner of the state. It will fill potholes and fix bridges in urban communities and in rural communities, and it will keep promises that we have made.”
An even bigger challenge
Also Saturday, the Senate passed the Democrats’ two-year $78.5 billion operating budget on a 28-21 vote. Democrat Sens. Mike Chapman of Port Angeles and Deb Krishnadasan of Gig Harbor joined Republicans in opposition. 
Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee and lead budget writer, said a looming budget shortfall resulted in some hard choices, such as delaying expansions of early learning programs, furloughing state workers, and draining the state’s reserves. But she noted the budget boosts funding for special education and preserves critical public services.
“The core of this budget is a commitment to the people of Washington,” she said.
It spends about $5.4 billion more than the current budget. Of the increase, $1.6 billion is for education and new collective bargaining agreements for state workers. The rest is to cover increased expenses for existing programs and services, also known as maintenance-level spending.
Robinson said it shaves around $3 billion in spending in the next budget, and $6.5 billion over four fiscal years. Slashing deeper would have been “devastating,” she said.
“None of these choices was made lightly,” Robinson said of the cuts. “That is why this budget bill pairs reductions with smart, necessary and progressive revenue options. This balance of cuts and new revenue allows us to protect services and stay fiscally responsible for years to come.”
The two-year Senate budget relies on roughly $6.2 billion from a four-year, $17 billion package of tax changes that did not get voted on.
Those include lifting the cap on annual property tax growth along with new taxes on the assets of wealthy individuals and the payrolls of large companies. Hearings on the proposed tax legislation will be held Monday in the Senate Ways and Means Committee.
Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, the lead budget writer for Senate Republicans, said the alternative budget he wrote would have spent $75.3 billion and been balanced without new taxes.
“We can do it without all the drastic cuts that people have been talking about. We can do it without any of the harmful taxes,” he said.
He criticized Democrats’ draining of the emergency reserves, saying it puts the state in a precarious fiscal position in a period of uncertainty over how decisions by the federal government might impact the state. And he said the document was confusing because it spends money to fund state worker pay raises and then seeks to save dollars by furloughing them for up to 13 days.
The House is slated to vote on its proposed budget Monday. Like the Senate, it counts on money from that chamber’s $14.8 billion tax package that has not yet been acted on. If passed, negotiations will begin in earnest to reconcile differences in the two spending approaches.
In the meantime, House and Senate budget writers will need to work with Gov. Bob Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, who has said he wants all cost-cutting options explored before considering any new taxes. 
‘Everybody is being asked to contribute’
The current two-year state transportation budget is $14.6 billion and includes money for road maintenance, ferries, bike and pedestrian projects and more. 
The budget blueprint passed by the Senate on Saturday lays out $16.2 billion in spending in the next biennium, made up of $6.2 billion in operating costs and $10 billion for capital projects.
The plethora of new taxes and fee increases is projected to bring in $3 billion in the next six years, of which a little less than a third would be available in the next budget. 
In the floor debate, Liias said they faced a $1 billion shortfall in the next budget, growing to $4 billion to meet current obligations over the next six years. 
To address it, the Senate came up with the revenue plan. It also shifts $5 billion of future expenses tied to replacing culverts to the state’s capital budget. Details on that move will be released Monday morning. And the Senate is directing 0.3% of sales tax collections from the operating budget to transportation starting in the 2027-2029 biennium.
Absent these moves, the Legislature would have been forced to halt some undertakings and postpone “every single improvement project that is not currently under contract,” Liias said Saturday.
The revenue package is intended to spread the burden across all users of the transportation system.
“It’s not the folks who drive a car are going to pay more or folks who bike are going to pay more,” Liias said. “Everybody is being asked to contribute more to the infrastructure that we all depend on.”
Fares could rise 1.5% each year on Washington State Ferries and a new surcharge would be added for credit card transactions. Tolls could be collected on the entire Highway 520 corridor instead of just the floating bridge. Police could issue $150 tickets for cars parked with expired tabs in the public right-of-way.
There’s a new 10% luxury tax on motor homes, recreational watercraft, and non-commercial aircraft costing over $500,000. The tax would be levied only on the amount of the sale, lease, or transfer value exceeding $500,000.
Other measures include raising registration fees on electric vehicles and hybrids, increasing the tax on rental cars and adding a $10 assessment on traffic infractions starting Jan. 1, 2026. 
And there could be a new $1 fee tacked onto tickets for sporting events and concerts with a crowd of more than 20,000 people. The assessment would be levied on the operators of venues with a capacity of more than 20,000 attendees, such as T-Mobile Park, Lumen Field and the Tacoma Dome.
Sen. Leonard Christian, R-Spokane, opposed the gas tax increase, saying his constituents will drive to Idaho to pay less to fill up and spend on other items while there.
“This is going to be another boon for Idaho,” he said.
In its final action Saturday, the Senate voted 35-14 to pass a bill to issue up to $7 billion of bonds to pay for the design, right-of-way purchases and construction of highway projects. Senate Bill 5800 also increased the bonding authorization for the State Route 520 project by $500 million.
Meanwhile, the House is expected to vote on its transportation budget next week. And it has a bill to raise the state gas tax 9 cents, and then index it to inflation. That too could be acted on.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sr-520-bridge-montlake-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-29 20:58:59.824721

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)As some lawmakers complain about the amount of money influencing ballot measures in South Dakota, new numbers indicate that 2024’s ballot question campaigns were among the most expensive in state history.
Ballot question committees recently filed their year-end campaign finance reports. Those and earlier reports show the total amount spent to support and oppose the seven measures in last fall’s election was about $12 million. There are no limits on contributions to ballot question committees.
South Dakota’s campaign finance system makes compiling and comparing campaign finance data difficult. Rather than entering information directly into a centralized system, candidates, committees and independent spenders submit scanned forms to the South Dakota Secretary of State’s Office that have to be viewed one-by-one, which is what South Dakota Searchlight did to compile its analysis.


 Only the state’s 2006 and 2016 elections had more expensive ballot question campaigns, reaching nearly $13 million each of those years, according to historical data maintained by the national nonprofit Open Secrets.
Republican legislators cited last year’s spending as part of their motivation to file bills this year that would tighten restrictions on citizen-initiated ballot measures. 
One major bill that passed will move the deadline for submitting petition signatures from May to February, shortening the petition-gathering window by three months. Gov. Larry Rhoden vetoed a bill that would require constitutional amendment petitions to have signatures from registered voters in every state Senate district, and legislators will consider that veto on Monday. Legislators put a measure on the 2026 ballot that will ask voters to raise the approval threshold for constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60%.
Governor vetoes effort to restrict constitutional amendment process with geographic rule

Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, sponsor of the 60% proposal, said during the legislative session that last year’s ballot measures resulted in “millions of dollars in out-of-state money coming for deceptive, emotionally charged ads stating half-truths.”
Open Secrets reports that about 70% of the money contributed to last year’s South Dakota ballot measures came from South Dakota residents.
Last year’s most expensive ballot measure campaign in the state appears to have been Amendment G, an abortion-rights measure that voters rejected. 
It’s difficult to determine exactly how much was spent in the Amendment G campaign, because the main group supporting the amendment, Dakotans for Health, also supported another unsuccessful ballot question that would have repealed sales taxes on groceries. Dakotans for Health spent a combined $1.32 million on those campaigns and did not separate expenses in its reports.
Opponents spent $2.74 million against the abortion-rights measure.
The grocery tax measure was Initiated Measure 28. Besides the amount spent to support it by Dakotans for Health, groups spent about $240,000 against it. 
Another big-dollar campaign was Referred Law 21, a set of carbon dioxide pipeline regulations that voters rejected. Spending totaled $3.15 million, with $2.87 million by supporters and $275,000 by opponents. The majority of funds in support of the measure came from ethanol producers hoping to build a multi-state pipeline to capture and sequester carbon emitted by their production plants. 
An unsuccessful effort to legalize recreational marijuana use, Initiated Measure 29, was nearly a $2 million campaign with $1.4 million in spending by supporters and about $468,000 by opponents.
Constitutional Amendment F, which legislators sent to the ballot and voters approved, authorized the state to consider imposing work requirements on people eligible for expanded Medicaid benefits. All $587,000 of spending on the amendment was by the no side.
Amendment H, which would have established open primary elections but was rejected by voters, was a $1.95 million campaign with most of that amount spent by supporters.

(Courtesy of Phil Larkin)Selling, exchanging or transferring Washington State Department of Natural Resources land is serious business. These decisions have long-term implications and require comprehensive information and thorough review of all potential options and should not be rushed.
It appears that the Jan. 7 decision by the Board of Natural Resources agreeing to sell the 200-acre Thorpe Property in Spokane’s Latah Valley in exchange for a Bellingham property fell short of that standard. New information raises questions about whether the board had all the information it needed to make the best decision.
I should know because I served on Washington’s Board of Natural Resources for eight years, and thus am very familiar with the process, motivation, and history surrounding DNR’s land sales and exchanges. Never during my tenure on the board do I recall any land sale or swap that was expedited in a manner similar to this exchange. The process lacked transparency, failed to engage important stakeholders, and ignored a viable alternative to achieve the agency’s goals.
Since 1957, the board has set policies to guide how our state’s trust lands are managed, including approving the sustainable harvest of timber sales and the sale or exchanges of trust lands while meeting a constitutional obligation to act in the best interest of the trust beneficiaries for which those lands are managed (e.g., K-12 schools, higher education, roads, fire departments, hospitals, and other county services). 
DNR manages trust lands to provide jobs, commodities, clean water, wildlife habitat and recreational opportunities while maintaining the primary goal of trust revenue production.
The January decision agreed to sell off the Thorpe Property (valued at $8.4 million) to a development company in addition to paying $7 million in exchange for a property currently housing a Haggen grocery store in Bellingham that the agency has stated has a value of $15.4 million.  At first blush, it would seem those numbers add up, except that a look at the Whatcom County assessor’s valuation of the Bellingham property comes in at $11.4 million.
Commercial real estate can be a risky business these days, as any of us can tell by the number of vacant storefronts in our cities and towns since the pandemic. Add to this that the grocery store in question was one of the stores put on a list for divestiture as part of the recent Kroger-Albertsons merger. Large companies put underperforming stores on such lists before they can gain additional stores in a merger.
What makes this agreement even more puzzling is that the board ignored that DNR had already approved a trust land transfer option that would have transferred the Thorpe Property to the city of Spokane to create a city park and community and education center for residents in the Latah Valley. This would be a much simpler approach and allow the Legislature to compensate the trust for transferring the land with $8.4 million, which would be used to buy replacement lands to benefit the trust beneficiaries.
Only after that process concluded, the previous public lands commissioner rushed through a hasty public hearing and public comment period from late October through mid-December last year. The results of that process were overwhelmingly supportive of the trust land transfer option and critical of the sale option to Blue Fern Development. The Spokane City Council passed a resolution calling for the board to delay the vote to ensure the right decision. This is all well chronicled in more than 15 local print, television and radio stories.
Current Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove did not get a chance to examine or vote on the Thorpe sale that came before the board on Jan. 7 because it was a week before he took office. However, he and the Board of Natural Resources can exercise a provision in the sale agreement to terminate the contract before April 6, 2025. This would allow a real discussion and conversation to occur about what is the best option to sell or transfer the Thorpe property to benefit trust beneficiaries, DNR, the city of Spokane, and local residents.
More than 25 local Spokane organizations, businesses, and elected officials, including the Spokane City Council, are calling for a reexamination of the agreement at the upcoming April 1 BNR meeting. Upthegrove and the board should join them.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/thorpe-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-29 13:04:52.155390

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Even if the Montana Supreme Court decides to suspend Attorney General Austin Knudsen for 90 days, the penalty doesn’t mean he needs to lose his elected office — that’s one thing his lawyer and the lawyer for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel agreed on.
Friday, the Montana Supreme Court, including district court judges sitting in for recused justices, heard arguments about whether Knudsen should be punished for statements he and lawyers under his supervision made that disparaged the court and for defying a court order.
At the hearing, newly sworn in Chief Justice Cory Swanson peppered both lawyers with questions, as did Justice Katherine Bidegaray and some of the five judges sitting in for recused justices.
Christian Corrigan, on behalf of Knudsen, argued the court should dismiss the complaint, a “highly irregular and unprecedented” one, and he said a more appropriate action from the court would be a “letter of caution” to his client.
“This entire process, from investigation, complaint to hearing, has been tainted by persistent due process violations,” Corrigan said.
However, Timothy Strauch, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, urged the court to find suspension appropriate to protect the integrity of the court and the rule of law.
“No lawyer is above this court’s constitutional regulatory authority,” Strauch said. “We do not have here a contrite or apologetic respondent, but a defiant one, to this day, who blames the court, the Commission (on Practice), myself and my predecessor.”
The lawyers argued and judges fired questions in front of a full house, including high-profile Republican legislators and members of the public. Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, former state Sen. Keith Regier, and Montana Family Foundation President Jeff Laszloffy were among those in the gallery.
Swanson, who pointed out Knudsen likely supervises more attorneys than anyone in the state, also questioned the process, and he asked the lawyers where to draw the line.
Lawyers pledge to adhere to their rules of professional conduct, and the Commission on Practice, which regulates the profession, upheld 41 separate ethics violations against the Knudsen last year.
“It would seem strange for us to just rule the attorney general is not subject to those rules in some regard,” Swanson said. “So help us figure out where that line is.”
The case is unusual.
It raised questions about how the state’s top attorney, also head of an agency, should conduct himself, and it fueled a simmering dispute between the legislative and judicial branches in 2021 that has continued in Montana.
In the September 2023 complaint, the Office for Disciplinary Counsel, which handles discipline against members of the state bar, alleged Knudsen broke rules of professional conduct for lawyers— allegations one of his lawyers initially described as a “political stunt.”
A hearing took place in October 2024, and Knudsen acknowledged he might have refrained from the “sharp” language he used in his representation of the legislature in 2021.
In fiery letters from the Attorney General’s Office about the dispute, Knudsen said he saw evidence of “judicial misconduct,” “self interest,” “actual impropriety” and “bias” by the court, according to court records.
Records also show Knudsen and a lawyer under his supervision both said they would not follow orders: “The legislature does not recognize this Court’s … order as binding and will not abide it.”
Bidegaray said defying a court order goes to the heart of the matter. During the 2021 fight, the legislature sought to subpoena judicial records, the court quashed the subpoena, but Knudsen didn’t immediately return records.
Bidegaray wondered what the consequences would be if the top lawyer in Montana was allowed to disobey a court order simply because he considered it invalid.
“Does that not set the tone, or the trickle down of behavior, to the attorneys?” Bidegaray said. “ … Does that not then set some sort of standard that allows every other attorney to disregard court orders?”
Corrigan said the court was on notice that Knudsen disagreed with the order, and the situation veered into unanswered questions of law. Swanson said one problem was that the issue wasn’t dealt with in real time, such as with a motion to compel filed by the other party.
Bidegaray, though, said it might have been more prudent, when traversing new legal terrain, for the AG to have sought a “stay,” or pause, “instead of just disregarding a court order.”
In October 2024 following the hearing, the Commission on Practice unanimously recommended the Montana Supreme Court suspend Knudsen for 90 days for multiple violations of rules.
Corrigan, though, argued the Commission on Practice botched the proceedings in numerous ways, and as a result, he said the Montana Supreme Court should toss the recommendation for a suspension.
Corrigan, with the Attorney General’s Office, said Knudsen acknowledged he would have done some things differently, but he also was acting in a “narrow scenario,” where he was discharging other professional duties.
As such, Corrigan suggested the court at most issue a “letter of caution” that Knudsen walked right up to the line, and he said such an outcome would “turn down the temperature.”
Corrigan also warned the Montana Supreme Court that it shouldn’t make an example of Knudsen, and he said punishing the attorney general wouldn’t help people have faith in their branch of government.
“Obviously, disciplining the Attorney General on this record would not do anything to increase confidence in the judiciary,” Corrigan said.
If the court just tried to turn down the temperature, though, Judge Luke Berger said he wondered if the court would leave the door open for more of the same, without some strict guidance: “What is to stop it from happening in the future?”
On behalf of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, Strauch said he understood the legislature felt strongly that the court had engaged in misconduct, and it retained the “strongest advocate” in the state in Knudsen.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that he fought vigorously for his client,” Strauch said.
But he also said Knudsen crossed the line when he attacked the integrity and qualifications of the court “completely unnecessarily,” and he requested the Montana Supreme Court draw that same line and follow the commission’s recommendation.
“Do we live in a world where these rules are just sort of a quaint reminder about concepts like respect for the rule of law and professionalism?” Strauch asked. Or is it a world where lawyers who swear to protect and defend the constitution and follow the rules are treated equally?
Strauch said he and the AG agree that the suspension would not set up a vacancy in the office, or a situation where Knudsen would need to be replaced.
According to briefings in the case, state law says the office becomes vacant if the attorney general fails to discharge duties for three consecutive months, but a suspension of even 90 days doesn’t need to run consecutively, and the court could also set a period that would ensure it wouldn’t equal three months (August 1 through Oct. 29, for example).
Also, the attorney general must be a lawyer in “good standing,” but a court briefing from Knudsen’s team said that is a qualification for running for office, not for continuing tenure. It also said the state Constitution allows for the removal of a judge, but not for an officer of another branch, and Montanans “overwhelmingly reelected” Knudsen while the case was pending.
“Any other act by one branch that purports to remove a constitutional officer of another branch would exceed constitutional bounds and raise grave constitutional concerns,” said the court filing.
Strauch said a suspension would preserve the rule of law.
Judge Gregory Bonilla, however, said the integrity of the judicial process is important, and key in the case. Bonilla said candidly, if he had worked with Knudsen, he would have cautioned him over his actions, but he said that’s just one question.
“There’s conduct,” Bonilla said. “And then there’s, ‘Did we do it right?’” In other words, he said, he might be certain someone engaged in criminal conduct, but if the search and seizure process was compromised, it doesn’t matter.
“This is what the attorney general is essentially saying, right?” Bonilla said.
Strauch, though, said both jurisprudence and due process are “sacrosanct,” and both were followed.
Swanson, who took office in January, told Strauch he didn’t like the statements that came from the attorney general and his team, but he didn’t like the way the process unfolded either.
“This thing is a mess from start to finish,” Swanson said. “I agree with you. A whole bunch of their statements and conduct on the front end look bad. But the proceeding, ruling on things without him having a chance to respond, and issuing this immediately before the election? … That looks political.”
Strauch agreed the timing could appear political, but he said the timing was due in a large part to the request from the attorney general’s team to delay the proceeding.
Strauch agreed the court had a range of options, from remanding the case for more information to full suspension, but Corrigan said a remand, or “third bite at the apple,” would not be fair to Knudsen.
“It would be inequitable for the Attorney General to have to go through this process again,” Corrigan said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/knudsen-hearing-day1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-29 13:04:52.155390

Lawmakers are getting ready for the last day of the 2025 legislative session on Friday, but they still drop some nuggets everywhere they go.
This week: Democratic discontent comes to the dome, a ride-or-die always Trumper gets rewarded with a new gig and some funny money, and state leaders try to decide whether to add more real money into their yearly salaries. 
Pay bump flop
House lawmakers quickly swatted down a last-minute Senate plan to give the governor and other statewide officials pay raises. 
The Senate had added the salary bumps Thursday to a bill adjusting the pay of judges at higher levels in Georgia. Under the plan, Gov. Brian Kemp would have been tied with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for the highest earning governor in the country. 
  Rep. Rob Leverett. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“You may have seen a little something about the amendment in the news over the last 24 hours,” the bill’s original sponsor, Elberton Republican Rep. Rob Leverett, said to his colleagues Friday. 
“I think that is a discussion we as a body need to have at some point, but we shouldn’t have it as an amendment to a bill in the last two or three days of session,” Leverett said. “I believe it needs to be thought through a little more and it needs a little more study.”
Some senators also tried to increase lawmaker pay in another judicial pay bill focused on superior court judges.
Critics argued that the legislative pay amendment would sabotage a bill intended to create uniform statewide pay for Georgia Superior Court judges. The proposed pay raise amendment to House Bill 85 would have increased the salaries of lawmakers from $24,341 to about $55,000.
Sen. Randal Mangham, a Stone Mountain Democrat, argued it would put Georgia lawmakers in line with the national average of $44,320 in 2024, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
He referenced the limited funding he receives for his staff. 
“$7,000 for an entire year with my budget for expenses to run the people’s business. It’s a $40 billion enterprise,” Mangham said, referring to the state budget.
Sen. John Kennedy, a Macon Republican, urged senators prior to voting to consider how passing the amendment would come across to the taxpayers.
“Colleagues, are you willing to look at your constituents in the eye and tell them you need more of their tax dollars in your pocket and out of their pocket?” Kennedy said.
The debate ended with the legislative pay amendments failing 33 to 18 before the superior court legislation passed with nearly unanimous support.
Dems in disarray
In the wake of a bitter loss to President Donald Trump, Democrats across the country are trying to figure out where it all went wrong. 
A recent Politico analysis of a Quinnipiac poll found that for the first time in the poll’s history, a majority of Democrats view members of their party in Congress unfavorably. Just 40 percent of Democrats polled said the party is doing a good job, compared to 49 percent who said the opposite. 
A March NBC News poll found 65% of self-identified Democrats want the party to fight Trump rather than seek compromise, even if that leads to gridlock in Washington. Around this time in Trump’s first term, only 33% of Democrats felt that way, the pollster found.
That discontent could be springing forth at the state level as well. 
The Forsyth County Democrats released a statement castigating Democrats in Congress and the state Legislature for “voting like Republicans.”
“With democracy itself at stake – and with the public’s frustration with figures like Donald Trump and Elon Musk high – we cannot afford to hand political or legislative victories to Republicans or to validate their agenda while our constituents and values hang in the balance,” the statement reads. “Likewise, here in Georgia, amid widespread discontent with Governor Brian Kemp’s hard-right legislative push, it is imperative that Democrats stand together rather than bolster Kemp’s initiatives that harm the public interest.”
The statement lists three pieces of legislation where some Democrats broke rank – Senate Bill 68, Kemp’s priority lawsuit overhaul bill, supported by three Democrats; Senate Bill 144, liability protections for fertilizer and pesticide manufacturers with the support of nine Democrats and House Bill 267, which bans transgender girls from playing on girls’ school sports teams and got votes from three Dems.
Trump U.S. Treasurer Legislature’s newly popular kid

Republican Sen. Brandon Beach’s selection as President Donald Trump’s choice to become the next U.S. Treasurer has boosted his popularity.
Beach signed fake currency featuring the face of Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch reading “In Goochie We Trust” that was passed around the Capitol last week. The 63-year-old Beach’s signature as U.S. treasurer could soon be emblazoned on the front of real legal tender in the future.   
The senator’s role in state government will end shortly after the Legislature gavels out on April 4 for the final day of the 2025 session.
Beach will act as a liaison between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, as well as oversee the U.S. Mint and Fort Knox. The president is boosting a conspiracy theory these days that some of the gold is missing from Fort Knox and says he plans to go to Kentucky to see for himself if the country’s treasure is still secured. 
Inside the Senate chamber Wednesday, fellow Trump loyalist GOP Lt. Gov. Burt Jones celebrated Beach’s new job opportunity. 
Jones recalled that not long ago they were part of a small cadre of hardline Trump supporters in the Senate who were persona non grata, even among fellow Republicans.

(File photo from iStock / Getty Images Plus)Colorectal cancer is a formidable adversary, ranking as the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.
In 2024 alone, the American Cancer Society estimated 53,000 lives were lost nationwide to this disease, with 2,580 new cases and 920 deaths in South Carolina alone.
The stakes are high — but the prognosis is far more optimistic when the cancer is detected early, thanks to screening tests.
The five-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is 91% when caught in early stages, then plummets to 13% when it’s discovered in late stages after symptoms usually begin to show.
Yet, more than one in three adults in the U.S. age 45 and over — that’s 50 million Americans — are not up to date with recommended screening.
Health care providers play a crucial role in improving colorectal cancer screening rates, with primary care providers on the front lines.
As a primary care physician, I take a whole person approach to patient care that prioritizes both treating illness as it arises and proactive care aimed at maintaining overall health and preventing diseases.
Cancer screening is a critical tool in this effort, and I am committed to ensuring that my patients not only get screened for colorectal cancer and other cancers but are educated about the choices they have for effective screening options.
Recently, I saw results from a national survey that explored attitudes about screening in the lead-up to National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month this March.
The survey findings are both alarming and hopeful.
Nine out of 10 physicians surveyed are, understandably, worried about the high percentage of
patients who do not complete colorectal cancer screenings. The reasons for this are multifaceted, but one of the most prevalent is fear and anxiety.
According to the survey, 74% of primary care physicians and close to a third of patients (29%) report that fear or anxiety is a barrier to completing screening.
But there is promising news. Last summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new blood test, Shield, which offers a simpler alternative to traditional screening methods. It requires no preparation or procedures — just a quick blood draw, which may make it a more appealing option for many patients.
The potential impact of blood-based testing is significant. The survey found that 93% of physicians and 86% of Americans believe avoiding or delaying colorectal cancer screenings is less likely if patients are presented with an FDA-approved blood test option.
Moreover, 92% of Americans are more likely to get a colonoscopy if they have a positive result on a blood screening test first.
These statistics underscore the potential of a blood-based screening option to increase overall screening rates and save lives.
The introduction of blood-based screening can play a crucial role in bridging the CRC screening gap. By offering more and easier screening options to patients, providers can help ensure that more patients get the test they need.
By integrating blood-based screening into our practices, primary care providers can help more South Carolinians stay up to date with their colorectal cancer screenings and ultimately save more lives.
Together, right here in the Palmetto State, we can make a difference in the fight against colorectal cancer.

(Courtesy CT DEEP)A proposal to allow hunting of Connecticut’s black bears is no more.
On Friday, members of the legislature’s Environment Committee unveiled new language for Senate Bill 1523, a proposal that would have allowed the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to establish and regulate a bear hunting season. Instead, the new bill stripped out much of that language and replaced it with new rules that expand the circumstances under which farmers may be allowed to kill bears for damaging their crops.
“Despite the title of this bill, an ‘Act Concerning Bear Hunting,’ this bill is not moving forward a bear hunt,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, who serves as co-chair of the committee.
The move marked the latest time that lawmakers in Connecticut have pulled back on proposals to allow bear hunting, which is practiced in most surrounding states with the exception of Rhode Island.
A black bear hunt in Conn.? Legislators are considering it, again.

Proponents of a hunt say it would help reduce conflicts with the state’s growing population of black bears, which DEEP estimates ranges from 1,000 to 1,200 bears. Opponents, however, argue that hunting would do little to deal with the most problematic bears — which are often found roaming away from the woods into populated areas — and that it does not align with the state’s values.
“It’s getting through to elected officials that hunting is not a solution to resolving bear conflicts,” Annie Hornish, a co-founder of the CT Coalition to Protect Bears, said Friday.
Hornish said she was disappointed lawmakers opted not to provide funding for bear-resistant trash cans and a more robust public awareness campaign to encourage people to take steps to avoid attracting bears as part of the legislation.
“That would have been the best outcome, but we’re happy that they’re not moving forward with hunting,” she said.
After announcing their revisions to the bill Friday, members of the Environment Committee voted 27-6 to advance the legislation to the Senate. All six opposing votes came from Democrats.
One of those voting no, state Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, said the bill still did not do enough to find non-lethal solutions for dealing with bears that forage on crops, such as using packs of specially trained dogs to harass bears away from farms.
“We’re basically laying out a buffet for these bears and then we’re kind of shocked when they show up and eat it,” Mushinsky said.
Other lawmakers lamented the decision to back off of a hunt, which they noted had the support of DEEP and Gov. Ned Lamont.
“We constantly find ways to negate a real bear management plan,” said state Rep. Karen Reddington-Hughes, R-Woodbury. “For the record, the bill was not about a trophy hunt… it was about public safety that is presently in danger because of our inaction.”
The last time legislation was seriously considered to allow a hunt, in 2023, it was similarly amended by the Environment Committee to remove hunting provisions. Instead, that bill set up a process by which farmers could apply for a permit from DEEP allowing them to kill nuisance animals damaging their crops, livestock or bee hives.
Those rules allowed farmers to kill 15 bears last year, according to DEEP.
But state Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, said the process has moved too slowly for some farmers who find the bears gone by the time they get approval from wildlife officials. Horn helped draft the revisions to S.B. 1523 that would allow farmers to get permission to kill a bear up to a year after it is documented damaging crops if it returns to the same property.
“Bears can destroy acres of crops in a short period of time,” Horn said Friday. “If they have to watch that happen, get a permit, and then come back for the bear, by that time the bear is gone. You’ve lost the crop for the season.”
Hornish said on Friday that the Coalition to Protect Bears has concerns about how farmers will verify whether a bear is the same individual they’ve have problems with in the past. Lawmakers said Friday they will continue to work on the exact language of the bill as it moves forward.

Senate Bill 93 would boost funding for school districts that are currently enrolled in early education programs under the Alaska Reads Act. The bill would increase per-student funding from half funding to the full amount for other students within the state’s public education funding formula. 
The Alaska Reads Act program supports early literacy for pre-K through grade 3 with the aim of improving reading. 
“The concept isn’t new,” said Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, the bill’s sponsor, citing a body of research supporting improved lifelong learning outcomes following pre-K programs. “For every dollar we invest in high quality early learning, we see a $32 return on investment in increased earning potential, higher graduation rates, higher engagement and post-secondary opportunities.”
She explained with the outmigration of families and children from Alaska, funding early learning programs would encourage young student enrollment. “Last year, the Legislative Finance Division indicated about 3,700 kids left our public education system in total,” she said. “So what our hope is, is not only to provide districts with full funding to maintain their pre-elementary programs, but also to help balance out that outmigration with incoming students.”
School districts can choose to offer prekindergarten in Alaska, and districts’ enrollment in early learning programs under the Alaska Reads Act is also voluntary. Currently the participating districts are Anchorage, Skagway and Valdez.
The Department of Education estimates the funding increase would cost roughly $7.6 million, already requested in Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s budget proposal for next year, going towards funding the Alaska Reads Act, according to a fiscal note to the bill. 
State Education Commissioner Deena Bishop said that the governor’s budget includes roughly $4.7 million to sustain funding for existing early education programs and $3 million to expand the number of districts with these programs. The Alaska Reads Act planned for annual increases in funding and programs, Bishop said in a text statement through a spokesperson.
“We look forward to all Alaska school districts who desire to serve their communities with pre-schools, can do so,” she said. “The Alaska Reads Act was a transformational piece of legislation. The present bill builds on its success.”
Tobin said the increased funding could also help alleviate child care costs for families. “We know those pre-K kids are in their communities, their parents might be struggling to braid together support for child care, or for babysitting,” she said. “And by not only providing stability for districts to offer these programs, we also are helping them in stabilizing their school population, and also helping families that are looking for child care options that are high quality and available.”
The bill now is set to be heard in the Senate Finance Committee, where Tobin hopes lawmakers support the education investment. “We know it’s not going to have an impact on our budget. And we do know the fiscal notes of the Alaska Reads Act were adopted when the bill was passed in 2022, so it’s not going to have a discernible impact on our current budget projections.”

Malone did better with a stunning upset in the 36th District special election Tuesday. He beat Republican County Commissioner Joshua Parsons by 0.89%, according to unofficial results, and became the first Democrat to represent Lancaster County in the Pennsylvania Senate since 1879.
Parsons conceded Wednesday afternoon, saying in a post on the social media platform X that a review of the remaining ballots showed there were not enough uncounted votes to change the outcome.

Having reviewed the numbers from last night, including the fact that there are not enough provisional or other outstanding ballots to change the overall result, I have called Mayor Malone to congratulate him and wish him the best.
1/2
— Josh Parsons (@Josh__Parsons) March 26, 2025
The Democratic victory drew national attention as the latest in a string of special election wins across the country. Although it did not change control of the Senate, it reduced Republicans’ majority in the Senate to 27-23.
Ryan Aument, who ran unopposed for the seat in 2022, resigned last year to work for U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick.
Democrats attribute the win, in part, to voters who feel betrayed by what they describe as President Donald Trump’s draconian and tumultuous first months in office.
“Folks are not happy with the chaos that we’re seeing in Washington and are not happy with Parsons,” Malone said, recounting what he heard from voters as he knocked on doors across the district, which President Donald Trump won by more than 15%.
Parsons campaigned on his reputation as a conservative firebrand who defied the state-ordered lockdown during the COVID-19 emergency, an abortion opponent and Trump ally.
But he also drew national attention for his harassment of a reporter at Lancaster Online/LNP and stoking anger over a drag queen story hour at Lancaster Public Library. The library ultimately canceled the event when a bomb threat and suspicious package shut down downtown Lancaster in March 2024.
“A lot of what we heard was they didn’t like his negativity and they didn’t like that he was voting against them,” Malone said.
Efforts to reach Parsons on Wednesday through his campaign’s website, Facebook page and campaign officials were unsuccessful.
A Republican official blamed Parsons’ defeat on a loss of focus after the 2024 election.
“This is a wake up call. We can’t rest on the laurels of last November’s great victories,” Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Greg Rothman said in a post. “We can’t be complacent and we must be unified. We need to keep the intensity of 2024 and fight together for every vote.”
Franklin & Marshall College pollster Berwood Yost said the outcome was both surprising and followed a trend so far in 2025.
“When you have a Republican who loses the district with a 23 point registration advantage, that qualifies as a surprise,” Yost said.
At the same time, Democrats have won five special elections across the country this year, Yost noted. That has a lot to do with the electorate in special elections, when turnout is typically low. In Lancaster county, 29% or about 54,000 registered voters participated.
The emphasis for national Democrats on Tuesday was the special election for the 35th House District in Allegheny County, where the party focused efforts to defend the one-seat majority it won in November. The seat was left empty in January when Rep. Matthew Gergely died after suffering a medical emergency.
Democrat Dan Goughnour won the election with 63.4% of the vote, according to unofficial results.
Special election voters tend to be more tuned-in and have more education, which favors Democrats, Yost said. It also tracks trends following presidential elections, when there is typically a swing toward the party not in the White House or in the majority in Washington.
“When you look back to Trump’s first term, there was a big swing toward Democrats in special elections at that time,” Yost said.
State Rep. Nikki Rivera, D-Lancaster, said Malone was a perfect foil to Parsons, who espoused many positions of the MAGA movement.
As the mayor of East Petersburg, a borough of about 4,500 people a short distance from Lancaster, Malone earned a reputation as a person who leads by example and shows genuine concern and compassion for people.
“He’s known for being personable and connecting with people on all sides of a topic,” Rivera said. “He is truly able to cross party lines to understand and be understood.”
But outside his small community, Malone had “almost no name recognition,” Sexton said. That called for a grassroots effort to introduce him to voters in more than two dozen municipalities.
Iowa inspiration
Sexton said she found inspiration in Iowa Democrat Mike Zimmer’s victory, flipping a state Senate seat in January.
“I reached out to them and said we have to know how you did it,” Sexton said. “They gave us their whole plan.”
Lancaster Democrats enlisted phone banking help from county committees across Pennsylvania and launched a ground game that included “obsessively” tracking mail ballots and dispatching volunteers to retirement communities to follow up with voters, Sexton said.
She said Malone worked hard, meeting voters and attending a League of Women Voters forum that Parsons skipped. Libertarian Zachary Moore of Mount Joy was there too, and won 480 votes, almost exactly the margin by which Parsons lost, Sexton noted.
Sexton said Malone’s campaign spent about $215,000, an amount she estimates is tied with or slightly greater than Parsons’ spending. Campaign finance reports show money continued to flow to the candidates in the final 24 hours of the race.
Parsons’s campaign was supported by GOP activist Scott Presler, who helped turn out Amish voters in the 2024 general election. Presler, who has drawn criticism for his anti-Muslim language, rung early alarm bells about a possible Democratic victory, drawing the attention of billionaire megadonor Elon Musk, Lancaster Online reported this week.
Sexton said Musk’s post came too late to help Parsons’ fundraising. But it reinforced Malone’s message.
“Parsons was really being supported by billionaires and ours was a grassroots campaign and that was really a contrast that resonated with people,” Sexton said.
When Pressler posted on X late Tuesday night lamenting Parsons’ apparent loss, Musk replied with a one word post: “Damn.”

“It is scary to be a college student right now because of the attacks by the Trump administration against DEI, the cutting of funding, and immigrant students being abducted by ICE. We want to protect our community on campus”, said Olivia Schaefer, 20, Social Relations and Policy student and Chair of the Sunrise MSU movement. “Our First Amendment is free speech, so we are doing the right thing by being here and raising our voices.”

The rally coincided with the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion offices by the University of Michigan, following new policies from Washington that are affecting DEI offices at universities across the country. It also followed the arrest of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents, one of the last of the nearly dozen international students arrested so far.

“While it’s true we haven’t seen any changes here at MSU, as we just saw at Columbia University and U of M, federal funding is on the line, and universities will have to go where the money is. Fundamentally, that’s a problem because we need to prioritize diversity and education,” Schaefer emphasized.
In an interview with The State News, MSU president Kevin Guskiewicz emphasized that ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts will remain a priority despite threats from Washington.’ Although vacant positions and building projects could be rethought amid budget riskiness, Guskiewicz said he and his team will analyze the university’s financial situation concerning potential funding cuts.
Jesse Estrada White, 21, a Comparative Cultures and Policies student and member of the Sunrise movement, who, along with four other students, was arrested on Oct. 25, 2024, after a sit-in demonstration inside the Hannah Administration Building as part of a pro-Palestinian action, emphasized the importance of a clear position from MSU.

“Now, the situation isn’t as bad as U of M, but the university has given us nothing so far. They say that all students are safe and welcome on campus, but they haven’t explicitly said anything against Trump’s policies, especially against the abduction of immigrant students. Silence and platitudes, that’s what we got,”Estrada said.
The rally proceeded without major incidents. The protesters remained at the main entrance of the administration building for about an hour, as the sky cleared after the rain.
Posters against the Trump administration, Elon Musk, and fascism, with slogans such as ‘MSU rejects Fascism’ and ‘Student Power,’ were held up, along with chants and screams including “This is what democracy looks like” and “We want divestment now”.
A series of speakers, including student activist leaders, student associations, and members of Sunrise, led the demonstration.
“We are calling on this university to take a stand against state crimes. This university has an active role to play, making sure that students on this campus are safe and that students across the state, and the country are safe as well,” Estrada said.

“We fight fascism,” all the participants shouted together as the rally concluded.
“This rally is just a step, a step in the right direction. Even though they ignored us before, we’ll keep demanding the university authorities to talk to us”, said Omar Anasara, 19, Philosophy student and member of Students for Justice in Palestine at MSU.

He was warned at the door to the visitors’ center that any formal protest inside the building that violated a permit limiting his religious expression to the lawn or steps of the Capitol would result in his arrest for trespassing.


In the rotunda, Stewart began delivering the rebellious alternative mass and was interrupted by three people intent on stopping what could be interpreted as a mockery of their faith. An unidentified man and woman, with young kids at their side, physically intervened to interrupt Stewart. He spun away from them. Counter-protester Marcus Schroeder joined the fray and twice reached to rip papers from Stewart’s hand. Stewart responded by punching Schroeder in the face twice. More than half a dozen Capitol Police wrestled Stewart to the floor to make the arrest.
“I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting,” Stewart repeatedly yelled.
Schroeder, who wore a shirt declaring “death is not welcome here,” wasn’t arrested by Capitol Police. In an interview, he defended his intervention to thwart Stewart.
“He was trying to give a satanic chant. I tried to take his paper out of his hand and he punched me twice in the face,” Schroeder said.

After the area cleared, two other satanists tried to pick up where Stewart left off and were taken into custody. One other person was cuffed and led away by law enforcement outside the Capitol. An individual had grabbed Stewart by the legs in a bid to stop Stewart from stomping on crackers intended to represent those used in a Catholic mass. In that brief exchange, Stewart also punched the guy before law enforcement ended the fracas.
“He was was trying to tackle me to get to the cracker underneath,” Stewart said. “I was able to kind of fend him off. I do think he may have picked up the crumbled cracker and ate it. Did I get physical with him? Yes.”
  Hundreds of Christians upset with an organization’s plan to conduct a satanic black mass at the Kansas Capitol delivered a robust counter-protest to emphasize their disdain for followers of Satanic Grotto. Both sides of the debate used bullhorns to punctuate their messages, creating a blended sound that was difficult for anybody to hear clearly. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)
The opposition
The colorful display of affection and affliction for organized religion culminated attempts by Gov. Laura Kelly, Attorney General Kris Kobach, leaders of the Kansas Legislature and Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, to restrain or derail the demonstration planned by Satanic Grotto.
Kelly had the group’s permit amended so no protest could transpire inside the Capitol. Legislative leaders modified policy regarding use of the Capitol to target Satanic Grotto. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Wichita, said the First Amendment didn’t protect offensive speech or violations of law.
Francis Slobodnik, a Topeka representative of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, told hundreds of Catholics gathered on the south side of the Capitol that public officials shouldn’t have allowed satanists to assemble on public property. He said the process showed a misguided understanding of freedom of speech and religion and a lack of appreciation for how a black mass represented worship of Satan.
“Today’s horrific event, the first of its kind in the history of Kansas, is a sacrilege,” said Slobodnik, who urged people to engage in a peaceful rally. “Of course, there have been terrible crimes and injustices that have happened in our state over the years. However, nothing in our past compares with what is happening today where God is being directly challenged on the state Capitol grounds. The state Capitol represents all of us.”
He praised people at the rally who were standing in opposition to Satanic Grotto, and referred to them as the Navy Seals of the Catholic faith. He said these activists were willing to confront God’s enemies head-on as if on a field of battle. He said the great sin perpetrated by Stewart and other worshipers of Satan meant that others had to step into the void.
“Satanists do not realize that Satan hates all of God’s creation, including them,” Slobodnik said. “Their reward for worshiping and serving him will be eternal fire.”
  Cure Church member Daniel Casteel, center with megaphone, was among Christians who used amplified equipment Friday, March 28, 2025, at the Kansas Capitol to broadcast invitations for people to renounce Satan and welcome Jesus into their lives. He proclaimed to his target audience across a law enforcement barrier: “Any time you’re ready, you can step this way. We will make sure you get saved.” (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
And, an exorcist
Former U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, who served in the Kansas Senate before elected to Congress, said he consulted with a priest with experience in exorcism when considering whether to participate in a television interview with Stewart.
“Father had a simple question: ‘Why would you do this? What do you hope to gain?’ I stumbled around in my answer,” Huelskamp said. “I wanted to share the truth about Christ. The truth about the Eucharist. His summary response was quite stunning to me. He said, ‘There is no good that could come from being in the same room with a satanist.’”
Huelskamp said it was suggested his participation in the interview with Stewart might advance the interests of Satan. The former Republican congressman woke ill the next day, and cancelled the interview. In the end, Huelskamp said he decided it was important to run to the fire created by Satan rather than shrink from it. He said it was the same as making his views known about the evil of abortion or defending the sanctity of marriage between a man and woman.
“I am quite stubborn and hardheaded,” he said. “We cannot be silent. We are required, if we call ourselves Christians, if we call ourselves Catholic, we are publicly required to defend the faith and to stand up for the truth.”
In an interview amid calm before the storm of his arrest, Stewart said he was convinced Catholics assembled around him didn’t understand why Satanic Grotto was at the Capitol to talk about religious oppression.
“What we only want is the rights that every American has,” Stewart said. “I’ve heard people say we’re setting a precedent. Well, if the precedent is freedom of religion for everyone in public spaces, yes, that’s what we’re trying to establish. We are dragging this issue out in the light and we’ll let the people look at it. The issue is that we’re not all being treated the same here.”
  Mike Trapp, of Leavenworth, Kansas, said he took part in rallies outside the State Capitol on Friday, March 28. 2025, to express his view that government needed to respect the constitutional mandate of a formal separation between church and state. He said the rise of Christian nationalists represented the greatest threat to democracy. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
Other voices in crowd
Eudora resident John More, a Christian who carried a call-to-heaven New England pine tree flag, said he was motivated to attend because he viewed the satanists’ criticism of Catholics as an assault on religion in general. He joined with Julie Britschge of Burlingame for a “Jericho Walk,” or prayer walk, by circling the statehouse grounds seven times. Britschge said the walk was patterned after the biblical story of the Israelites’ march aimed at bringing about spiritual change.
“We’re hoping that whatever evil there is today, that He will take care of it,” More said. “I was just planning to add a measure of divine protection.”
Daniel Casteel and Shawn Velasquez, both with the Cure Church, made their views heard with the aid of megaphones. They prowled the security-line perimeter sharing perspectives on religion before taking part in back-and-forth exchanges across the barrier with supporters of Satanic Grotto.
“Jesus loves you,” Casteel bellowed. “Any time you’re ready, you can step this way. We will make sure you get saved. Come give your life to Jesus, please. Break the stronghold.”
In an interview, Velasquez and Casteel said their intent was to convince one or two satanic worshipers to find solace in God.
“They’re just misguided and uninformed,” Velasquez said. “They’re worshiping a false god.”
On the other side of that line, Mike Trapp of Leavenworth quietly held a sign that emphasized his belief the United States was best served by adhering to the constitutional principle of a formal separation between church and state.
“We wouldn’t be standing here today if there weren’t Christians flaunting their religion in the Capitol,” said Trapp, who considered the rise of Christian nationalism to be “the biggest threat to democracy.”
Wichita residents Kyle Francis and Sam McCrory, who were armed with a gun, flag and a collection of religious symbols, said they were present to stand up for Christ.
“Any time that people who oppose Christ show their head, you know, they should be opposed publicly,” McCrory said.
He said separation of church and state was originally the product of a homogenous Christian population. Satanists and others who diluted that national unity often used constitutional freedoms as a weapon against well-meaning people, he said.
“These sorts of things need to be brutally tamped down,” McCrory said. “Let’s set an example. I think that the United States should be an explicitly Christian nation. If you want to be something other than Christian, I think that’s fine, to an extent. I think they (non-Christians) should have to pay an extra tax.”

The firing squad chair (left) was added following a 2021 state law that made death by firing squad an option. The electric chair is under the cover. (Provided by the S.C. Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — Death row inmate Mikal Mahdi chose to die by firing squad, making him the second person in the state to do so since executions resumed, his attorneys said Friday.
Mahdi, 42, was sentenced to death in 2006 for shooting and killing off-duty police officer James Myers with his own rifle as part of a multi-state crime spree. The only remaining man on death row with no remaining appeals, Mahdi is scheduled to die at 6 p.m. April 11.
Brad Sigmon, executed March 7, was the first inmate in the state to die by firing squad, which legislators made an option in 2021. The three other inmates executed since September selected lethal injection.
By law, death row inmates have until two weeks before their execution date to choose whether they will die by firing squad, lethal injection or electrocution, which legislators made the default method in 2021. Mahdi chose “the lesser of three evils,” his attorney, David Weiss, said in a statement Friday.
“Mikal chose the firing squad instead of being burned and mutilated in the electric chair, or suffering a lingering death on the lethal injection gurney,” Weiss said.
SC inmate executed by firing squad, a first nationwide since 2010

Legislators added firing squad as an option after years of struggling to get the drugs used for lethal injection. Inmates challenged the method, as well as electrocution, arguing it violated the constitutional right to avoid cruel and unusual punishment.
The state Supreme Court ruled last year that firing squad and electrocution were constitutional methods of execution, allowing the process to resume after a 13-year hiatus. By that point, lethal injection was again an option, after Department of Corrections officials were able to restock their supply thanks to a law keeping everything about the drugs and the companies selling them a secret.
Inmates have challenged that secrecy law, arguing inmates have a right to know more about the drugs that would kill them. But the state Supreme Court and a federal judge have both turned down those arguments, ruling officials have disclosed everything the law requires for an inmate to make his choice.
Barring intervention from a court or the governor, Mahdi would become the fifth in the nation to be executed by firing squad, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Other than Sigmon, the remaining three took place in Utah, which last conducted a firing squad execution in 2010. Utah’s next death row inmate in line for execution, Ralph Menzies, also faces a firing squad, pending the outcome of his competency appeal.
Mahdi will be strapped to a chair, facing three rectangular openings 15 feet away. Three firing squad members will shoot through those openings, using .308 Winchester bullets, which expand and fragment on impact, causing a more instantaneous death, corrections officials have said previously.
“Before Mikal committed these tragic murders, he was a child in desperate need of care and support,” Weiss said in a statement. “We will continue to fight for the child Mikal was and the man he is today. Executing Mikal on this record would ignore the many ways we failed him in favor of one final injustice.”
Mikal Mahdi
On July 14, 2004, in his hometown of Lawrenceville, Virginia, Mahdi stole a car and a gun before fleeing south. Stopping in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Mahdi shot gas station clerk Christopher Boggs point-blank in the head while Boggs was verifying his ID to buy a beer, according to court documents.
Mahdi continued on to South Carolina, where he carjacked a man in Columbia and drove to Calhoun County. He stopped at a gas station, where a clerk seemed to grow suspicious after the gas pump declined his card. Mahdi fled on foot to a nearby farmhouse, where he hid out in Myers’ workshop.
When Myers, a captain for the Orangeburg Department of Public Safety, returned home at the end of the day, Mahdi shot him nine times with one of the rifles Myers kept there, according to court documents.
Mahdi lit Myers’ body on fire and stole his police truck, which he continued driving south. Police arrested Mahdi in Satellite Beach, Florida, on July 21, 2004, a week after he stole the first car.
Mahdi pleaded guilty to the crimes in 2006, at which point Judge Clifton Newman sentenced him to death.
SC death row inmate’s attorneys ask court to halt execution over traumatic childhood

Mahdi’s attorneys have asked the state Supreme Court to halt his execution, claiming a traumatic childhood influenced his development and led him to a life of crime.
Mahdi’s original defense attorneys hardly touched on his past, which could have convinced Newman to sentence him to life in prison instead of death, Mahdi’s current attorneys argued in court filings.
As a child, Mahdi struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts, his attorneys claimed. He entered the juvenile justice system at age 14 for committing property crimes and spent most of his life in jails after that point, often in solitary confinement, his attorneys said.
Mahdi had been out of jail for about two months when he committed the crimes that landed him on death row.
“When we think of Mikal choosing his method of execution, we’re reminded of the tormented child who, at nine years old, told his teacher that he wanted to shoot himself. Or, on another occasion, to electrocute himself. Or, another time, to hang himself,” Weiss said in a statement Friday.
But Mahdi’s attorneys didn’t show anything the court hasn’t already considered and dismissed during the appeals process, the Attorney General’s Office responded in a filing this week. Mahdi’s difficult childhood and the impact it may have had on him have no legal bearing on his crime, the attorneys continued.
The state Supreme Court has not yet given a decision on the arguments.
The state’s highest court, as well as the U.S. Supreme Court, has yet to rule in favor of stopping a South Carolina inmate’s execution in the past six months. Mahdi can also appeal to Gov. Henry McMaster for clemency, which no governor has granted in the modern era.

Great Lakes Day is an annual summit where politicians and officials of all stripes gather in Washington, D.C., to demonstrate their commitment to the region home to the largest freshwater ecosystem on the planet. For years, leaders from the United States and Canada have met at the event without incident. But earlier this month and amid a tariff dispute between the two nations, the Trump administration abruptly disinvited two Canadian mayors from the long-standing White House meeting.
The last-minute exclusion of Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and St. Catharines Mayor Mat Siscoe came just 48 hours before the event due to “diplomatic protocols,” according to Christine Maydossian, a spokesperson for the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, which coordinates the meeting and submitted the names of the two Canadian mayors and one American to White House officials a month earlier.
Neither Canadian mayor responded to a request for comment.
Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump and his administration has repeatedly stoked tensions with Canada, once considered the United States’ closest ally. Along with trade and tariffs, this strife has also raised questions about how the region’s water resources will be managed. Amid the escalating political tensions, some Great Lakes advocates worry the diplomatic snub is a warning sign that one of the world’s most successful examples of water-sharing could become collateral damage in a geopolitical rift.
“We are worried that maybe behind all this is the idea that a country one day will be able to take water out of the Great Lakes and manage water not as an ecosystem that needs to be preserved in its watershed, but as a resource, as a commodity,” said Jérôme Marty, speaking as the director of the International Association for Great Lakes Research.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that in calls with then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump had “mentioned revisiting the sharing of lakes and rivers between the two nations.”
“President Trump has made clear the need for Canada to stop ripping off the United States on trade. President Trump will explore any and all actions that put the interests of America first,” said Brian Hughes, a spokesperson with the National Security Council, in an emailed statement to Grist. (The White House did not respond directly to Grist’s questions about cooperation between the two countries concerning the Great Lakes.)
For over a century, the United States and Canada have worked in tandem to manage four of the five Great Lakes that straddle both countries: Superior, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. That cooperative arrangement — with which the countries settle everything from water use to navigation to invasive species to pollution — may now be on the line.
“We cannot let this be sacrificed,” said Rachel Havrelock, a professor at the University of Illinois Chicago who directs the Freshwater Lab, an environmental research initiative focused on the Great Lakes and environmental justice.
“This is the most stable, productive, and mutually beneficial form of binational water governance on Earth,” she added.
The lakes provide drinking water for more than 30 million people spread across both sides of the border. The U.S. and Canada, then under British rule, signed the Boundary Waters Treaty in 1909, a highly-praised water sharing agreement that formed the International Joint Commission, or IJC, a binational organization that aims to prevent and resolve disputes over shared lakes and rivers.
(The arrangements between the two countries long sidelined Indigenous nations, some of which the U.S.-Canada border artificially bisected. For example, the IJC did not invite Indigenous representatives to participate until the 1980s, despite the sovereign rights of those nations. Indigenous communities often face disproportionate impacts from pollution and climate change, and recent IJC assessments have acknowledged that strengthening relationships with Indigenous governments is key to improving its response to those threats.)
The relationship was further cemented by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, established in 1955, which coordinates how invasive species and fisheries are managed, and again by the 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, which committed the two nations to “restore and maintain” the health of the lakes.
Those are just three among a layered patchwork of treaties and other agreements between local, state, federal, and tribal governments that determine Great Lakes management. Some don’t necessarily rely on federal involvement, such as the Great Lakes Agreement and Compact, which protects the water from being shipped to other states and regions.
Trump has cast doubt on the stability of these agreements by breaking a series of diplomatic taboos, including calling Canada the “51st state” and halting negotiations on the Columbia River Treaty, after referring to the British Columbia river as a “large faucet” that could be used to solve California’s water crisis last year.
Policy experts say Trump’s recent tack raises a red flag for the future of the Great Lakes.
“The water and the resources don’t recognize international boundaries,” said Mike Shriberg, a faculty member at the University of Michigan who specializes in Great Lakes policy. “You can’t manage things like invasive species from only one country and not the other. You can’t manage harmful algal blooms from one country or the other. The information on the flow of ice and what that means for shipping has to be shared across borders.”
Shriberg said the Trump administration’s funding freeze and staffing cuts related to management of the lakes are impacting how the U.S. will protect them and meet its obligations with Canada — concerns that prompted him to write an op-ed making the case for politicians to unify to protect the Great Lakes.
Some areas have shown signs of revival; the Great Lakes Fishery Commission’s sea lamprey program can begin rehiring U.S. federal workers to control the invasive species, which can wreak havoc on other fish. That means the program will move forward, albeit weeks behind schedule.
But other threats are visible, according to Shriberg: There are more bureaucratic roadblocks to federal scientists working with their Canadian counterparts on everything from harmful algal blooms to flooding — work he said had until this point been “seamless.”
“It’s often not happening because of the chaos within the agencies that’s being caused by all the cutbacks,” Shriberg said.
Those cutbacks have reached the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, which has been rocked by staffing upheavals, with a fifth of their employees reportedly retiring, resigning, fired, or on leave, including the communications team.

The bill aims to make certain crimes where no death occurred, such as child sex abuse and child sex trafficking, eligible for the death penalty — a direct violation of the 8th Amendment as established in the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court case Kennedy v. Louisiana.
But Senate Bill 196 isn’t just about overturning one Supreme Court decision.
It’s part of a broader movement to dismantle decades of constitutional protections under the 8th Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment. If successful, it could lead to the return of automatic death sentences and even the execution of vulnerable defendants, including children and the intellectually disabled, and open the door to arbitrary sentencing that masks lynch-mob style racism.
In challenging the Supreme Court’s 2008 decision, Senate Bill 196 proponents would have Missouri join Florida and Tennessee in bringing back the death penalty for statutory rape and similar crimes. This movement seeks to repeal not just the Supreme Court decision, but a line of cases recognizing that the Framers understood the 8th Amendment should “draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.”
This line of cases started in 1958, when the court recognized that while we used to summarily execute wartime deserters, an American draftee who went AWOL for a matter of hours in a foreign land in the waning days of World War II could not be stripped of his U.S. citizenship — a punishment based on a pre-Civil War statute.
A national consensus had emerged that such punishment was disproportionate to the crime, making it cruel and unusual.
This understanding of the 8th Amendment has been the foundation for categorical rules limiting punishments for certain types of cases and defendants.
A 1977 case held that rape of an adult not resulting in death is categorically ineligible for death, reflecting the problematic “southern rape cases” in which Black men were sentenced to death for the rape of white women, the holding the Kennedy decision would later extend.
A pair of cases decided in 1982 and 1987 created the rule that a defendant who did not personally cause the death of the victim is only death-eligible if the defendant was a major participant in the underlying felony and recklessly ignored the foreseeable risk of death.
Decisions in 2002 and 2005 established categorical exemptions from the death penalty for intellectually disabled individuals and juveniles. The court also relied on this approach outside of capital cases, in 2010 and 2012 decisions prohibiting life without parole for juveniles convicted of non-homicide crimes and requiring individualized sentencing for juvenile homicide offenders.
These decisions reflect a growing consensus that the harshest punishments must be reserved for the worst of the worst.
If states succeed in dismantling the 8th Amendment’s protections, the consequences will be devastating. Imagine a return to the days when racial biases permeated death penalty decisions, as seen in the tragic case of George Stinney, a 14-year-old Black boy executed in 1944.
That Senate Bill 196 is part of this broader effort is not speculation. Missouri’s Attorney General has signed onto a brief  in a case from Alabama attacking the court’s requirement that intellectual disability be determined in keeping with current clinical practices, and explicitly attacking the entire line of “evolving standards of decency” cases.
Senate Bill 196 is likely part of an ever broader movement to carry out President Donald Trump’s executive order that seeks “overruling of Supreme Court precedents that limit the authority of state and federal governments to impose capital punishment.”
Florida’s recently enacted “Trump Act,” which proposes automatic death sentences for certain offenders, would challenge foundational cases which rejected automatic death penalty statutes and required case-by-case weighing of any mitigating evidence related to the circumstances of the crime or the character of the defendant.
Senate Bill 196 invites a future where the state wields the ultimate punishment with alarming arbitrariness.
The people of Missouri deserve a criminal justice system that reflects our progress, not one that drags us backward. Senate Bill 196 is a step in the wrong direction.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-646867352-1024x658.jpg,,,2025-03-29 07:02:33.375077

(Photo by Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
 Withholding tribes’ data

As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.
Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
 State data agreements

In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
 Tracking disease

In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
 ‘We needed this yesterday’

During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”
There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

Here is our quick rundown of the major happenings during the 12th week of the Idaho Legislature’s 2025 session.
 Idaho governor signs immigration bill Thursday morning, state gets sued Thursday afternoon

At 9:10 a.m. on Thursday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law House Bill 83, as amended. 
By early Thursday evening, a federal judge temporarily blocked the new immigration law from taking effect after the ACLU of Idaho sued the state – upholding its promise to do so from earlier in the 2025 legislative session.
The bill allows law enforcement to record a person’s documentation status if they are suspected of a crime.
Modeled after a controversial 2023 Texas law, the legislation creates Idaho immigration crimes “illegal entry” and “illegal reentry,” targeting individuals who do not have proper immigration authorization and those who have already been deported from coming to Idaho. Law enforcement would only be able to convict someone of those crimes if they are suspected for a different crime. 
The law also creates the crime of “trafficking a dangerous illegal alien,” or knowingly transporting an unauthorized immigrant who has previously been convicted of a crime in the U.S. or another country. The law grants immunity to law enforcement, meaning they are protected from lawsuits that could arise from the damages and liability they cause while enforcing the law.

The ACLU and the multiple plaintiffs in the case say the law is unconstitutional in several ways, including violating the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which establishes that federal law overrides state law, including in immigration matters.
Bill sponsors have said the bill’s purpose is to curb unauthorized migration and prevent dangerous unauthorized immigrants from entering Idaho. 
However, ACLU of Idaho legal director Paul Carlos Southwick said the bill clearly does not just target criminals. 
“You do not have to have any criminal conviction in order to be arrested, detained or prosecuted for these crimes,” he said in a press conference. “Law enforcement merely needs suspicion that you have engaged in some kind of independent crime.”
Because the bill had an emergency clause, it went into effect immediately after the governor signed it. The court’s temporary restraining order issued Thursday evening will prevent the law’s enforcement for 14 days. A preliminary injunction hearing in the case is scheduled at 10 a.m. April 10 at the federal courthouse in Boise.
 $100M property tax cut signed into law

Little also signed into law a bill that cuts property taxes and bolsters school districts’ bond issues and levies.
Joined by Idaho Republican legislative leaders at a livestreamed news conference in a Boise neighborhood on Wednesday, Little signed House Bill 304.

The new law reduces Idaho’s state tax revenue by $100 million every year, shifting funds in two ways:

It transfers $50 million to a state fund to reduce property taxes for Idaho homeowners.
And it sends another $50 million to a state fund that helps pay off school districts’ bond issues and levies.

The bill is the third major tax cut bill the Idaho Legislature passed this year, totalling $403 million in annual reductions to Idaho’s state revenue. 

House Bill 40 reduces the corporate and individual income tax rates from 5.695% to 5.3% and reduces state revenue by $253 million per year. When Little signed the bill, the governor’s office described the bill as the largest income tax cut in state history.
House Bill 231 increases the grocery tax credit used to offset the sales tax Idahoans pay on food to $155 per year. To increase the grocery tax credit, House Bill 231 reduces state revenue by $50 million every year.

Another new law this year, House Bill 93, provides a refundable tax credit for education expenses for families, including tuition at private, religious schools. That bill reduces the state’s revenue by $50 million – bringing total revenue reductions from those four bills to $453 million.
 Child care deregulation bill signed into law, despite opposition from children’s advocates

Little also signed into law a bill to deregulate child care centers that the bill’s sponsors said will help ease Idaho’s child care shortage crisis.  
House Bill 243 loosens state-set minimum child-to-staff ratio standards. The bill also preempts local governments from having more stringent child care regulations than issued by the state.
Idaho’s existing child-to-staff ratios are the 41st lowest in the nation, compared to all 50 states and the District of Columbia, a report by Idaho Voices for Children found. In other words, Idaho’s existing state-set child care standards let individual staffers care for more children at a given time than most states. 
The new law will leave Idaho with the 45th least stringent child-to-staff ratios in the nation, Idaho Voices for Children Executive Director Christine Tiddens previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.
The law takes effect July 1.
 Idaho’s death penalty now extends to some child sex abuse cases

Little signed into law on Wednesday a bill to make people who sexually abuse young children in Idaho eligible for the death penalty. 
House Bill 380 will allow the death penalty in a new criminal charge the bill creates: aggravated lewd conduct with children age 12 and younger.
The bill also would add mandatory minimum prison sentences for cases of aggravated lewd conduct with minors that don’t meet the bill’s proposed criteria for death penalty eligibility. The new crime would only apply to abuse of children age 16 and below. 
Little signed the bill Wednesday morning, according to the governor’s office legislation tracker. He told the Idaho Capital Sun in a written statement that he signed the bill “because heinous sex crimes against children destroy lives, and the perpetrators deserve the ultimate punishment.”
The law takes effect July 1.
 Governor also signs media shield law

Idaho will become the 41st state with a media shield law, which protects sources who provide confidential information or documents to journalists.
Little signed House Bill 158 into law Thursday after it passed the full Legislature unanimously, following a rise in legal threats across the state that sought to force journalists to reveal their sources. 
Idaho is one of 10 states without a journalism shield law, according to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. 
The new law takes effect July 1.

(Courtesy of Jim Jones) March 29 is Vietnam War Veterans Day, the day set aside to remember and honor those who served in that ill-fated war. 
A phone call earlier this month brought to mind a perfect example of what dedicated service-to-country looks like. My friend, James Peterson, called to say that he would be undergoing surgery for a dangerous cancer, likely the result of his substantial exposure to Agent Orange during two tours of service with the Special Forces in Vietnam. 
It hit me hard because here was a man who had dedicated his life to standing up for his country and now was faced with a hefty price.
I met James in August 2006 at the 40th reunion of the Twin Falls High School’s Class of 1966 (my wife, Kelly, is a member of the class). We were at the City Park, refurbishing the memorial dedicated on Memorial Day in 1967 to those from Twin Falls County who died in the war. 
Seventeen names, starting with Major James H. Allred in 1963 and ending with PFC Fred S. Smart in 1970, were eventually placed on the memorial plaque. James spent many hours over the years, helping to keep up the memorial. 
In that initial conversation, we established that we’d both been stationed in Tay Ninh Province in 1968 – he at the Thien Ngon Special Forces camp 71 miles northwest of Saigon and me with a heavy artillery unit near Tay Ninh City. 
The strangest thing happened when I mentioned that, as an aerial artillery spotter, I’d destroyed a river bridge south of Thien Ngon that enemy fighters used to transport weapons and supplies. James went to his car, opened the trunk, and brought back a picture of that very bridge. We bonded immediately.

It was not until years later we pieced together the fact that we had likely met at the Thien Ngon Special Forces camp on Sept. 30, 1968. He was the communications specialist at the camp; the Special Forcecs commander for the Province was flying me around to introduce me to the artillery customers I would be serving. 
The Thien Ngon camp was in extremely hostile territory. Two days previously, it had been ferociously attacked by an estimated two battalions of North Vietnamese soldiers. The scars of the battle were still evident.
As Stars and Stripes described the battle, the Communists fired about 1,000 rockets, mortar rounds and grenades into the relatively small camp, then suffered 130 dead in trying but failing to overrun it. The six companies of Vietnamese defenders suffered four dead. Thirteen were wounded, including four Special Forces advisers. 
James was not one of them. James described the event as just business as usual those many years later.
James’ service to the country did not stop there. Although I never asked him how he used his remarkable communication skills during the next several decades and he never explained, I have the abiding feeling he kept serving the country in a clandestine capacity. 
He commented in one reunion booklet that he’d had the “opportunity to work in communications and other fields and live in so many different countries both friendly and unfriendly.” James lived in The Bahamas for 19 years on his catamaran “Bifrost” until it was destroyed in a hurricane in 2019.
James made frequent visits to the Boise VA Medical Center for a variety of conditions related to his service. Having been a gung-ho parachute jumper in his Army days (and perhaps in his later endeavors), his lower extremities needed frequent medical care. For a while, he parked a camp trailer on one of the two camper lots at the facility. He was and is a big fan of the VA Medical Center.
We spoke after his recent surgery and he reported doing well. He has three daughters and one son, 10 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. He should have plenty of time and opportunity with them in this final chapter of his life to make up for his numerous years of dedicated service to his country.
In everything James has done, he has shunned publicity and recognition by way of medals, decorations and the like. He would be rather unhappy to know that I’m paying this tribute to his life of service. However, I can’t think of a better person to remember on Vietnam War Veterans Day than James Peterson, who came from tough beginnings to be a true patriot and fine example. 
Thanks, Brother.

A pair of Omaha state senators on Friday laid out their respective bills to the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, both saying they were open to tweaks that would help green light the measures.
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“We have had too many people die on roads, and I am interested in making this work,” State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington during a public hearing at the Capitol. “Let’s figure out a way.”
 Record pace

Nebraska had 251 traffic fatalities in 2024, the highest single-year total since 2007, which had 256, according to the Nebraska Department of Transportation.
DeBoer’s Legislative Bill 600 in part would give the Transportation Department the power to set up speed-detecting systems in highway work zones and to lower speed limits in dangerous areas.
Legislative Bill 616, introduced by State Sen. John Cavanaugh, would authorize the use of automated license plate reader cameras for red light violations and provides for civil enforcement.
Cavanaugh said his goal was to create a noncriminal way to deter reckless driving on city streets. A violation would result in a civil fee that could be waived if the driver participated in a no-cost safety program he called a “rehabilitative stop” class.
Any fees paid by those who choose not to take the class would help cover someone else taking the class, he said. 
No points would be assessed against the violator’s driver’s license. No warrant would be issued. If someone failed to pay the fee or complete the class, a charge would be assessed as a condition of renewing the vehicle’s registration. 
Any evidence or information obtained from the camera is not to be used for any purpose other than that particular statute.
  State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“Someone is not going to find themself incarcerated as a result of a red light camera,” Cavanaugh said, adding that the threat of jail should not be the only way to improve public safety.
Acknowledging that the bill needs work, Cavanaugh, a lawyer, chuckled that a pair of typically at-odds parties were unified in their objection to his bill. “That’s a real accomplishment,” he said of the alliance between the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska and the Nebraska Sheriffs Association. 
 ‘Harvest, collect and sell’ 

Bryan Waugh, the Kearney police chief, spoke on behalf of the Nebraska Sheriffs and Police Associations. He said cameras can be helpful in fighting violent and property crime and in alerts for missing persons — and said his city has 28 in use.
But Waugh does not think they are intended for “minor traffic or parking violations.”
“While we appreciate the focus on traffic safety, we believe intermingling this technology for traffic enforcement may negatively impact the effective use of the technology for crime prevention, solving crime and keeping the community safe from crime,” he said.
Waugh said his research shows that cameras targeting red light runners could increase the likelihood of a traffic collision, if people slam on their brakes to avoid getting caught.

Spike Eickholt, representing the ACLU and the Nebraska Criminal Defense Attorneys Association, expressed concerns about license plate reader companies and how they “harvest, collect and sell” license plate data.
His bigger worry, he said, is that traffic infractions in Nebraska are criminal in nature and that those charged or cited have rights, including to a trial.
“I don’t think that the Legislature can make something that is criminal, civil, just due to the enforcement mechanism that happens to be different than an officer actually observing a red light violation and writing a citation,” Eickholt said.
 Behavioral change

Supporters of the change included Timothy Adams, an engineer specializing in roadway safety. He told the committee that 80 people died in the Lincoln and Omaha areas alone at signalized intersections over the past five years.
“These cameras serve as a strong deterrent leading to long term behavioral changes that make our roads safe.”
DeBoer said a multifaceted LB 600 aims to improve safety around highway worker construction areas and at-risk spots and intersections.
As written, DeBoer said, the law would empower the Transportation Department to assess administrative civil penalties to the registered owner of a vehicle recorded by special technology traveling at excessive speed through a marked area. 
For a highway work zone, that threshold would be eleven miles per hour or more over the speed limit. The first offense would be a warning. A second offense within three years would be $75. She said she is open to considering a criminal violation route.
 17-year high 

  Vicki Kramer, director of the Nebraska Department of Transportation. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
Vicki Kramer, director of the state Department of Transportation, supported the bill.
She told the committee that in 2024, Nebraska’s roadway fatality count spiked to a 17-year high, despite national statistics for crashes trending down. She said that motivated the department to research counter measures. Among the department’s recommendations, she said, were speed safety cameras or devices in work areas and variable speed limits in danger zones.
“The provisions are not intended to generate revenue, but to influence driver behavior,” she said.

Feb. 25, 2025. Photo: Jim NeugerWe’ve reached the point in the legislative session where votes are starting to pick up. In an effort to keep up, and keep you all informed, Maine Morning Star is restarting our weekly round-up of notable votes and other actions, particularly those we may not have been able to cover elsewhere. 
Arguably the biggest thing that transpired this week is Gov. Janet Mills officially reconvened the Legislature after the House and Senate voted to adjourn shortly after midnight last Friday in a procedural move that will start the clock to make the funds in the continuing services budget available in 90 days.
However, Republican members of the House argued the reconvening amounted to an “illegal session,” as Rep. Shelley Rudnicki of Fairfield put it during Tuesday’s session. A motion to “adjourn without day,” or without a plan to reconvene, failed 68-77.
The reconvening also prompted discussion in the House Tuesday about whether the censure of Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) would continue. An effort to end the censure failed in a 68-76 vote.
The drama continued into Thursday when Rudnicki introduced an order to censure House Speaker Ryan Fecteau over what she said were breaches in the House rules. That effort split Republicans, ultimately failing 24-119.
Full Legislature
Both the House and Senate have now voted against LD 234, a Republican-led effort to eliminate ranked choice voting. The Senate voted 20-14 in favor of the Judiciary Committee’s recommendation against the bill following the 76-66 vote in the House.
Over the objection of some Republicans that the votes amounted to a “waste of taxpayer money,” and some questions about the difference between the two animal classes, House and Senate backed proposals to designate the wood turtle as the official state reptile (LD 73) and the spring peeper as the official state amphibian (LD 72).
The House and Senate also supported the Education Committee’s recommendation to pass LD 74, which would extend the system of learning results review from five to seven years. 
Lawmakers rejected a bill (LD 444), sponsored by Libby, that would repeal the law setting out the state’s goals for consumption of electricity from renewable resources. Members backed the committee recommendation against the bill 78-65 in the House and 20-13 in the Senate.
The House and Senate both voted under the hammer to reject a bill (LD 387) sponsored by Republican leadership in the House and Senate that would prohibit the governor from “relocat[ing] illegal immigrants into this State or take any other actions intended to authorize, approve or otherwise assist in the relocation or transportation of illegal immigrants into this State.” However, the House sponsor said this action was recommended because there is another similar bill also being considered they plan to support.
Senate votes
On Thursday, the Senate unanimously voted to confirm Michael Duguay, Gov. Janet Mills’ pick to head the Department of Economic and Community Development. 
The Senate also unanimously confirmed the appointment of Amy Dieterich of Auburn as a district court Judge and the reappointment of Honorable Matthew G. Tice of Scarborough for reappointment as a district court judge.
The Senate voted “under the hammer,” meaning without roll call, to back several bills, including: LD 586, “An Act to Provide a Court Authority to Issue Proximity Restrictions in Protection from Abuse Orders;” LD 466, an emergency bill to extend the law governing electric power and service residential rates for military veterans’ organizations; LD 254, “An Act to Designate November as Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month;” LD 683 “An Act to Clarify the Law Governing the Minimum Indirect Financial Interest Disclosure Requirement for Liquor Licenses.”
These all now head to the House.

Opinion editor Clay Wirestone’s weekly roundup of legislative flotsam and jetsam. Read the archive.


Who the hell asked for this?
That was my response as yet another session of the Kansas Legislature wrapped up Thursday, with lawmakers setting up future fiscal calamity, sticking their noses in national political issues and generally trying to hightail it out of town before the satanists descended.
Each year, Kansas Reflector editor Sherman Smith and I discuss the character of the session. We chat about the throughlines, the issues, the character. Each year, as you might imagine, varies. Some focus on taxes, others on issues like education or abortion.
What made the 2025 session so unusual, Smith and I agreed, was the extent to which it didn’t have a driving story.
Legislators made a mess of process, closing caucus meetings and rushing through an unprecedentedly short calendar. They pushed through fiscally and morally reprehensible legislation. But at the end of it, as 125 representatives and 40 senators made a mad dash for home, I was left confused.
What did they mean to do? What was the theme, the purpose, the goal?
Sure, they wanted to make the rich richer and leave the poor to rot. That’s always the case. Sure, they demonized trans people and immigrants.
But why? We heard little from House Speaker Dan Hawkins or Senate President Ty Masterson explaining their stances or outlining their path to prosperity. They simply wielded power and plowed through bills.
Perhaps they meant to set up Masterson’s possible gubernatorial bid.
Perhaps they meant to leave Gov. Laura Kelly with a fresh budget crisis when new revenue estimates arrive.
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
My take? I don’t think we’ve seen or heard the last of this session. Sure, members will return for a veto session on April 10. But I think there are more stories to be told and more to be learned about what went down this year. As too many characters in the Star Wars universe say: I have a bad feeling about this.
 
  House Republican lawmakers met behind closed doors on March 18, 2025 (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Closed caucus
On Monday, I wrote about House Republicans closing their caucus meetings for the session.
You might expect such an embarrassing story to generate statements of regret or indignant denials from lawmakers. Instead, House Republicans said absolutely nothing, which suggests 1.) that the column was accurate in all particulars and 2.) they were mortified about it.
Not a word from House Majority Leader Chris Croft, either, despite my repeated attempts to contact him. He sets the policy, so there we go.
Lawmakers might be interested to know who I did hear from: readers.
That’s right, Kansas voters were quite interested to hear about the closed meetings. They left dozens of comments under our Facebook post about the story, and a good number send me email messages asking about the situation.
I plan to write more about the closed meetings. After all, everyone comes back to the Statehouse next month. We’ll see what they do then.
 
Proctor poppycock
The one and only Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, has touted discredited election conspiracies for years.
But I was taken with this recent Twitter post from the representative.

There is nothing more fundamental to our form of government than voter confidence that the results of elections reflect their will. As your House Elections Chair, I’m fighting to fix vulnerabilities in our election system to restore voter confidence–before it’s too late.#ksleg pic.twitter.com/2Q5QV4RgPd
— Pat Proctor (@RealPatProctor) March 27, 2025

My question to Proctor — I left it as a response tweet as well — is a simple one. What does he mean by writing “before it’s too late”?
Before insurrectionists attempt to overthrow our duly elected president on Jan. 6, 2021? Pretty sure that already happened.
Before deciding to spread doubt and confusion over perfectly legitimate elections administered by a succession of Republican secretaries of state? Pretty sure that already happened as well.
Or does he simply mean before a group of overcaffeinated ideological fanatics decide to do away with elections altogether and install their choice as president or governor? Why aren’t decades of free and fair elections enough for Proctor and his ilk?
Sadly, Proctor didn’t respond to my question. I should have said I needed his answer before it was too late.

Questions teem
Let’s delve into one more batch of legislative questions for this decidedly unmagical March.

Kansas lawmakers broke their promise to add $73 million in special education funding. What other promises will they break next month?
How many satanic activities by satanists at the Statehouse need to occur before we all just realize we like saying the word “satanic” a lot?
What seemingly dead legislation will shudder back to life during the supposed “veto session” next month? I bet folks won’t like it!
Did anyone else notice that hearings against Rep. Ford Carr, D-Wichita, magically stopped after gaining statewide attention and a crowd showed up to protest?

 
Opinion deportation
In the world of opinion journalism this week, I couldn’t help but follow news about Tufts graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who was arrested and detained by the Trump administration. Officials want to deport the Turkish grad student, who has legal status.
According to supporters, Ozturk’s offense appears to be writing an op-ed for The Tufts Daily titled “Try again, President Kumar: Renewing calls for Tufts to adopt March 4 TCU Senate resolutions.” (Read the column if you’d like, but I warn you that it’s dry and not particularly interesting.)
Perhaps the administration has further evidence in the case. But if not, I don’t see how such detention can be defended.
The First Amendment forms one of the bedrocks of our democratic republic. Its protections should extend to visa holders, immigrants without legal status or random visitors to this country. Threatening deportation for exercising free speech takes jackhammer to that bedrock. It’s outright 1984 territory.
 
Press box phenomenon
You’d like to think Hawkins would have finally seen the error of his ways in the closing days of the session and allowed journalists to return to the press box in his chamber.
He didn’t.
But as a gift to the speaker and his staff, I’d like to offer two photos from Smith. The first comes from when he entered the back of the chamber. You might notice that the press box mentioned above sits empty. Gosh, it would be so nice if a few journalists could sit there, no?
  An empty press box could be seen March 18, 2025, in the Kansas House of Represenatives. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
A few minutes in, the House speaker appears to have noticed Smith’s presence. Soon after, House staffers filtered out to sit behind the press box. It’s a session miracle!
  A few minutes later, House staffers have taken their places in the press box, supposedly showing how little room remains for journalists. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
As the Statehouse goes on hiatus the next couple of weeks, so will Statehouse scraps. I’ll return when lawmakers do!

(Courtesy of Lincoln Electric System)I often oppose new wind and solar energy projects in Nebraska. I’ve appeared in opposition to proposals in Cass, Knox, Lancaster, Saunders and York Counties.
As an attorney, I represent Knox County and a group of Lancaster County landowners. I regularly address the Omaha Public Power District board regarding its foolish net-zero policy.
I am opposed to wind and solar for many reasons, but the main reason is economics. I do, however, agree with the Amish farmer who spoke in opposition to a solar project that was rejected in Knox County. He said, “I don’t think it is a good idea to build a business based on a fad.”
Tax credits tilt playing field
Wind and solar are all about the federal income tax credits. That’s it. Goldman Sachs projected $1.2 trillion in federal payments for renewable energy projects through 2032.
It has little to do with saving the planet. For wind and solar proponents, there is certainly an element of virtue signaling to show others how much they care about the future of mankind.
I’ve long been of the opinion that the theory of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming is a scam. It is based on corrupt data that is fed into faulty models by people who have a financial bias in the result.
It is a prediction about the entire climate of the planet in the distant future, a prediction unlikely to be accurate.
Adam Smith created the academic discipline of economics with his “The Wealth of Nations.” In that book, he proved the economic law of natural advantage.
Nebraska has other advantages
The natural advantage of Nebraska is the efficient production of food. Oklahoma and Texas, on the other hand, have the natural advantage of efficient oil and natural gas production.
Nebraska trades food for oil and natural gas with other states. Both states benefit. This is how the United States has become the wealthiest nation in the world.
Gov. Jim Pillen is aware that it is not possible to create additional acres of Nebraska farmland. That’s part of why he has opposed putting solar panels on productive Nebraska ag land.
It is true that participating landowners get three to five times the cash rent for their land to let these projects happen. But many landowners reject the offer because they value something more than the almighty dollar.
I saw neighbors pitted against neighbors in Cass County. I also saw a woman cry before a legislative hearing after she recited the facts of disappearing farmland.
Debt matters
Our country is $37 trillion in debt. For every dollar spent on an approved wind, solar and battery project, the developer gets a significant slice of federal money.
We all pay for the federal debt, even those landowners who get windfall cash rents from renewable energy developers. The other point that I repeatedly make is that as wind and solar are added to the electric grid, electricity prices increase.
Over 50% of Germany’s electricity comes from renewable sources. That’s why Germany’s electricity is three to four times more expensive than the U.S. average. That’s also why Germany’s industrial base has been declining. The economics don’t work.
The OPPD board has been informed about economic studies done by the Center of the American Experiment regarding net-zero policies in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The studies show that electric rates will triple and that there could be forced blackouts in the dead of winter.
The essential problem is that solar and wind are intermittent power sources, but electricity demand is constant. Nebraska’s public power districts are required, by law, to produce only reliable power. Only dispatchable power is reliable.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/03/29/house-members-overhaul-moore-housing-bill-with-simpler-amendments/,"Lawmakers are scrambling to push through a heavily amended version of Gov. Wes Moore's (D) priority ""Housing for Jobs Act,"" which may be the governor's bill in name only at this point.","Houses and businesses lining the streets of Annapolis on March 24, 2025. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).Lawmakers are scrambling to push through a heavily amended version of Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) priority “Housing for Jobs Act,” which may be the governor’s bill in name only at this point.
The bill that originally would have tied increased housing development to job growth in the state now calls for studies, the setting of housing goals and limited guarantees for developers.
The House Environment and Transportation Committee approved the amended version of the House Bill 503 Friday and will send it to the full House next week, when there will be just a week left in the session. The Senate is waiting for the House bill.
“This was the path forward that we found, and I think will provide meaningful changes while also setting, hopefully, a roadmap to the future to make even more meaningful changes,” Del. Dylan Behler (D-Anne Arundel), a member of the committee, said this week. “I know that there were a lot of conversations [between] … the governor’s office and other groups that care deeply about this and focus on lowering the cost of housing for Marylanders.”
With clock ticking, lawmakers still hope to iron out issues on Moore’s housing bill

Despite the changes, the Moore administration said in a statement that it’s “proud” of the amended bill and will “continue to work with legislative partners to pass it into law.”
“Maryland is facing a housing supply and affordability crisis and this legislation directly addresses it by creating regulatory certainty for housing production in Maryland,” the administration statement said.
When introduced, the governor’s bill was framed as an expansion on his housing package from last year. The original version aimed to expedite housing development by requiring counties to automatically approve most qualifying project requests if the state determines there is an imbalance between housing and jobs in the county.
Representatives from the Maryland Association of Counties quickly expressed “significant” concerns over the bill, particularly the language that would have forced counties to approve housing in some situations. MACo officials said in a recent statement that the bill is now more “streamlined” and that many of its initial concerns have been addressed.
Now, the bill creates a housing commission to study the state’s housing crisis and make recommendations to address the lack of affordable units in the state. It also calls on the state’s housing secretary to set a 10-year target for housing production in the state, while creating create subtargets for specific regions in consultation with county governments.
The bill also sets up “vesting rights” for developers, meaning that they would have a guarantee for five years that they can build on a property once a project is approved, and ensures that the developer is governed by the laws and policies issued at the time of a projects application.
MACo Executive Director Michael Sanderson believes the current, “simpler” version of the bill will have an easier time navigating the remaining legislative hurdles than the initial language. He said the administration bill was not helped by the fact that it did not get a hearing until March.

“It’s just kind of unfortunate that this ended up being one of the bills that got a late hearing. Maybe if this whole process had started on Valentine’s day instead of March … we might have been further along,” Sanderson said.
He added that the amendments narrow the goal of the bill to the “essential elements that they (the administration) think could move the needle the most.”
“Nobody loves the idea of a task force or a commission as a resolution,” Sanderson said, “but sometimes on big issues, having the forum where you go hash this stuff out, that might be a more productive way.”
There is a Senate version of the legislation, Senate Bill 430, but Education, Energy, and the Environment Chair Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery) said he is waiting to see how the House settles the bill before the legislation moves in the Senate.
Housing Secretary Jake Day said that despite the language overhaul, the bill still incorporates an overarching goal of improving housing supply in areas that need it.
“I am grateful now that it seems like we are at a place where this can move, and I think many of the most important concepts remain intact — and look to me like they are going to move forward,” Day said. “I know we’re nearing the end, but … I still think it’s a bill that can move the needle on housing production and housing affordability.”

Citing the complete language overhaul, Del. Ryan Nawrocki (R-Baltimore) said the initial bill language was “clearly not ready for primetime.”
“It says to me that the bill was a flawed bill as it came to the committee, if we’re kind of rewriting the whole bill through amendments,” he said. “The significant rewrite … is the committee also acknowledging that there were serious flaws with that initial version of the bill.”
Nawrocki voted against the bill during Friday’s voting session, noting that he had some “heartburn” on the new vesting rights language, which could be a point of contention as it moves through the legislative process. But it still received overall approval in the House committee.
Day hopes that the bill passed this year will inform additional housing legislation in future sessions to help tackle the affordability crisis in the state.
“We’ll have to see what gets passed this year,” Day said. “Time is of the essence, and housing isn’t getting cheaper … We’ve got a lot of work to do on production. I think what comes back in future years really depends on the progress that is made this year.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC01957-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-29 03:00:52.026229

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)After an hour of robust debate, a Senate committee advanced a House bill Friday that would let some long-serving incarcerated individuals to ask a judge for a second chance at life.
By an 8-3 vote, the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee approved the Second Look Act, which would let individuals who have served at least 20 years in prison petition for a reduced sentence.
The bill sponsored by Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County) passed the House on March 17. Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County) sponsored a version in his chamber, but the Senate will work off Pasteur’s bill.
A similar bill passed the Senate last year but stalled in the House.
This year’s bill would apply to anyone sentenced for a crime committed between the ages of 18 and 25, who has served at least 20 years of their sentence. Those incarcerated would need to wait five years to petition the court again if they were turned down the first time, and those sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or a convicted “sex offender” would not be eligible.
Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore and Carroll) said he has reservations about the age restrictions — those 18 to 25 should know right from wrong, he said — but he still voted in favor of it.

“Many will call, many will knock on the door, but not that many will be let out by the judge because it all depends on what you’ve done in the intervening 20 years,” West said after the Senate adjourned Friday afternoon.
“Does the judge really believe that you’ve reformed and you’re longer a threat to society? I think we need to give them [those incarcerated] some consideration,” he said.
Others worried that the bill would give a second chance to individuals charged with murder and other violent crimes.
“I would probably support this bill if it took out murder … and some of the violent crimes,” said Sen. Mary-Dulany James (D-Harford), who voted against the bill in committee. “That’s where I think it’s a bridge too far.”
Supporters of the bill have stressed this “isn’t a get out of jail free card” because it doesn’t guarantee everyone incarcerated will be freed from prison.
The bill would apply to an estimated 350 people. If a court decides to grant parole, it can order the paroled individual to “stay away from and refrain from contact with a victim and victim’s family … unless the victim requests otherwise.”
A victim or a victim’s representative would be able to submit an impact statement to the court “regarding the impact of the crime and the proposed sentence reduction.” Those statements can “carry weight” in court, said Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), chair of the committee, who voted in favor of the bill.
But Sen. Mike McKay (R-Garrett, Allegany and Washington) said the bill would simply “revictimize, revictimize, revictimize, revictimize.”
House grants final approval to Second Look Act, sends bill to the Senate

“I believe that we are in the business of correcting and rehabilitating people, but not at the expense of increasing the amount of time to revictimize,” McKay said before he voted against the bill.
Sydnor, who voted for the bill, said it attempts to strike a balance for victims and rehabilitation.
“This bill is really about mercy and grace for someone who has been incarcerated for a minimum of 20 years and who has shown or demonstrated that they have rehabilitated themselves,” he said. “It’s just a second look. Judges aren’t being forced to release anyone.”
Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick) cited families such as Richard and Dawn Collins, who traveled to Annapolis in January to testify against the bill on behalf of their son, Richard W. Collins III. He was visiting a friend at the University of Maryland, College Park, when he was fatally stabbed in a racially motivated hate crime in May 2017. The stabbing took place a few days before he was set to graduate from Bowie State University, where he was in the Army ROTC.
“This bill would undermine the small justice and the loss of her [Dawn Collins] up-and-coming second lieutenant son, going to make a difference,” said Folden, who voted against the measure.
Folden said Richard “told his mother the world would know his name. We know his name because his parents come down here and advocate on his behalf because he’s no longer here.”
Meanwhile, the bill’s racial equity impact note notes that incarcerated Black prisoners could receive the most benefit.
As of Jan. 1, the state Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services reported that 12,675, or 72%, of those incarcerated in the state’s prisons are Black; the state’s Black residents accounted for 31.6% of the state’s overall population in 2023.
Of the total 17,586 individuals incarcerated in the state, about 1,303 are serving life sentences and 331 are those without the possibility of parole.
“Black inmates would experience the most significant impact given their overrepresentation in the State’s incarcerated population,” according to the note.
The full Senate could debate the measure sometime next week. It would have to act before April 7, the last day of the legislative session.

It could amount to an average of $81 per household, according to legislative analysts.","Linemen work on a power line in Puerto Rico, in this file photo from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. (Photo by Dave Palmer/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)That potential electric bill refund being touted by legislative leaders as part of a larger energy reform package? It could amount to an average of $81 per household, according to legislative analysts.
The provision is one of a laundry list of energy reforms included in legislation that passed unanimously in a Senate committee this week, including language that would expedite the construction of new nuclear energy and — possibly — natural gas power plants in Maryland.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) held up the rebate as the quickest remedy legislators can provide for Marylanders’ utility bill sticker shock.
“The goal was to have a short-term impact, a mid-term impact and a long-term impact and that’s what this energy leadership package really represents,” Ferguson said Friday.
The plan is to use about $200 million from the Maryland Energy Administration’s Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which is typically used for energy efficiency projects, Ferguson said.
Each household’s exact refund would depend on their energy usage, and the payment would arrive in two parts in fiscal 2026: Once during the peak summer season and again during winter.
Sen. Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery) said Friday, after voting in favor of the bill in committee, that she remains concerned that there is no “litmus test” determining which Marylanders ought to be compensated.
“My concern is that someone in a megamansion is going to get a whole lot of money, and someone who’s trying to pinch their pennies will get a paltry amount, but have a greater need,” Kagan said.
But Ferguson said that offering the refund across the board, and basing it on energy usage, was seen as the best way to reach not just low-income ratepayers — who can take advantage of other programs to help with electric bills — but also the middle class.
“We’re really concerned for those who are not eligible for the lowest-income funds, but were not wealthy, and that middle gap is really feeling the pinch,” Ferguson said.
The SEIF funds actually come from the utilities themselves, which can make “alternative compliance payments” when they haven’t purchased enough renewable energy to comply with state mandates.
In fiscal 2024, utilities contributed $318 million to the SEIF fund. It was a large amount relative to prior years, because the alternative compliance fees became less expensive than actual renewable energy credits.
Normally, the funding would go to projects meant to fill in the gap, such as HVAC replacements, lighting upgrades and solar panel installations.
If approved, the refunds would appear on Marylanders’ utility bills as a “Legislative Energy Hardship Credit.” But some legislators want to go back to the drawing board.
Sen. Ronald L. Watson (D-Prince George’s) said Thursday that the name ought to be changed to “consumer relief payment,” or something similar.
“It’s not a legislative hardship,” Watson said. “No, we are reimbursing ratepayers who have paid too much for far too long, and trying to give them something back twice in one year.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/4277388-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-29 03:00:52.026229

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s top elections administrator said he is “disheartened” by a presidential executive order that could dramatically change elections.
President Donald Trump imposed sweeping changes Wednesday to elections in an executive order. Included in those are calls for voters to prove they are U.S. citizens in order to register to vote and Election Day deadlines for returning mail-in ballots.
Maryland State Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis, in a statement, said the state board “is committed to protecting voters from undue harassment or intimidation regarding when and how they voted. Voting is a protected right that was fought for during the course of our county’s history. The struggle to vote was not easy and must always be protected. Harassment and intimidation not only occurs during times of voting but can take place after the election under different guises.”
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Maryland adopted a broad mail-in voting program that lets anyone cast a ballot by mail without having to justify the request. Before 2020, voters could only vote by mail — called absentee balloting — under certain circumstances. Residents overseas, including those in the military, were also eligible. All that changed during the pandemic.
DeMarinis said his office is “analyzing the impact of the Executive Order on our military and overseas voters as well as our domestic ones. Mail-in ballots cast and postmarked before or on Election Day are legal ballots that must be counted. Those voters’ voices must be heard. Claiming that the method in which the ballot was cast somehow invalidates the vote is misinformation and the record must be corrected.”
The elections administrator said Trump’s order ignored modern threats to election integrity.
“I am disheartened that the Executive Order did not mention mis/dis or malinformation especially from foreign influences,” DeMarinis’ staetment said. “The rapid pace of technology has allowed some dis/misinformation to deter participation as well as harm faith in our election results.”
As long as we’re bashing Trump executive orders …
Maryland Democrats lined up Friday to attack Trump over another executive order, this one canceling collective bargaining rights for workers at scores of federal agencies.
It was one of 10 executive orders signed by the president this week alone, from attacking the Smithsonian Institution for its “divisive, race-centered ideology” to meddling in District affairs to continuing his fight with “Big Law,” reviewing security clearances and suppressing business with law firms he said “engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.” This week’s targets were WilmerHale and Jennings & Block.

	The “Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs” said that union representation is “dangerous in agencies with national security responsibilities” and that collective bargaining would be ended at agencies with national security missions. The White House then proceeded to give an extremely broad definition of agencies with national security mandates, including the Office of General Counsel at Health and Human Services (pandemic preparedness); the Federal Communications Commission (cybersecurity); the U.S. Agency for International Development (foreign affairs); the Environmental Protection Agency (energy security); and “most components of the Department of Public Safety and Federal Emergency Management Administration” (public safety), among others.
Curiously exempted from list of agencies with security responsibilities were police and firefighters’ unions, which have been generally supportive of Trump’s campaigns. They retained their collective bargaining rights.
Democrats were quick to reply. Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) said in a social media post that the “especially disappointed” to see the president “use the guise of national security to weaken union protections for nearly two-thirds of the entire federal workforce,” while Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) called it an attack on “hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have dedicated their lives to national security, public safety, and the well-being of all Americans.”
Gov. Wes Moore called it an extension of the administration’s attacks on federal workers, who have been laid off by the thousands in recent weeks. “These continued attacks on the federal workforce have already led to countless jobs lost, countless lives disrupted, and a drastic hit to Maryland’s economy,” Moore said in a statement, adding that the state would continue to fight for collective bargaining and workers’ rights.
Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) said, “Donald Trump’s Executive Order terminating union rights for hundreds of thousands of federal workers is destructive, very disturbing, and perhaps and probably, not perhaps, probably illegal.” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), in a social media post, called it “another illegal executive order, this time taking a chainsaw to unions and collective bargaining,” while Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) called it a “brazenly illegal attack on unions.”
The only GOP member of the state’s congressional delegation, Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), had not posted anything about the executive order as of Friday evening.
Blueprint paused, not really
Budget and Taxation Committee Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) calmly read 14 amendments from Senate Bill 429 that are part of the state’s Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan Friday. But instead of debating it then, senators asked that it be laid over — held for later action — until Monday.
Guzzone’s committee voted Wednesday on and amended the Senate version of the bill, but also voted to make the House of Delegates version approved earlier this month conform to the Senate version.
Some differences between the bills include a four-year pause in the phase-in of collaborative time for teachers. The Senate agreed with the pause first presented by Gov. Wes Moore (D). The House rejected it and chose to pause for one year.
House approves Blueprint education bill that rejects most cuts proposed by governor

The House also rejected the governor’s proposal on “foundation” funding, or per pupil spending. Under the Blueprint, it was slated to grow from $8,789 per pupil this year to $9,226 next fiscal year, but the administration proposed reducing the growth to $9,063 next year and slowing the pace of growth for several years after. The Senate committee agreed, but the House voted to keep the original Blueprint funding levels.
Another difference between the two chambers deals with the Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, part of the multibillion-dollar Blueprint plan that deals with mental health and other wraparound services for the students. The House chose to fund it at $40 million next year and each year after, but the Senate budgeted $70 million next year and then $100 million for fiscal year 2027 and beyond.
Because of the differences between both chambers, the House will likely reject the Senate plan and force a conference committee to be formed to hash out the differences before the final day of the legislative session April 7.
House approves delay to FAMLI benefit 
House members pushed forward a bill that would delay Marylanders’ access to guaranteed paid family and medical leave, a delay the Moore administration proposed in February amid what it called “huge instability and uncertainty” from the Trump administration.
Benefits from the Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program are supposed to be available in 2026, but the House Bill 102 would move that start date back to 2028. The House voted 95-34 Friday for the bill which would not only impose the delay but also create an avenue in which self-employed individuals can partake in the benefit when it launches.
Faced with a $3 billion budget shortfall and rapid-fire policy decisions from the Trump administration, Maryland officials suggested pushing the start date for FAMLI back by 18 months, meaning that payroll collections for the benefit would begin Jan. 1, 2027, and benefits would become available on Jan. 1, 2028.
Despite a recent poll suggesting that more Marylanders want the benefit as soon as possible, the bill received very little discussion on second reader earlier this week and no debate Friday before the House voted to approve it. HB102 now heads to the Senate for consideration.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_2825-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-29 03:00:52.026229

(Photo by Fiordaliso/Getty Stock Images)I got the phone call at 2:39 p.m. on Oct. 16, 2020. After four anxious days of waiting, I heard the voice on the line say, “I’m so sorry to tell you the tumor we found was malignant – you have cancer.”
As the person on the phone became a muffled “Peanuts”-esque voice, talking about oncology referrals and scheduling staging scans, I remember curling into a ball on my couch, alone with my cat, the room spinning as a myriad of rapid-fire thoughts ran through my head: “I’m only 37. I have cancer?! Am I going to die? How do I tell my parents? My family? Friends? Work? What treatments will I need? Surgery? Chemo? What do those cost? What will my insurance cover?”
With little warning, four days after a routine colonoscopy I had because of a family history of polyps, my life suddenly cleaved in two: Before and after my Stage 3 neuroendocrine cancer diagnosis.
As my brain started the first of countless doom spirals, I tried to accept my life-threatening diagnosis, but I was fortunate never to have to ponder, “Will I lose my job? Can I pay rent? Can I afford groceries?” Thanks to my large employer, I was among the lucky employees in Maryland with access to paid family and medical leave. Only 43% of the workforce have access to paid medical leave and even fewer have access to paid family leave.

I was fortunate to have the time off to confront my situation, but no one should have to rely on luck to fight for their survival or the well-being of their loved ones. That’s why we fought so hard to pass the Time to Care Act. In 2022, the Maryland General Assembly enacted it, creating a statewide Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program. A full 88% of Marylanders support this program, and the Maryland Department of Labor has been hard at work preparing to implement it.
Consequently, I am heartbroken by Gov. Wes Moore’s proposal to delay the implementation of the FAMLI program for an additional 18 months: an unconscionable amount of time for Marylanders who need time to care today.
When you are faced with a life-threatening diagnosis, you are quickly reminded that the future is a luxury. Delaying this vital program harms every Marylander with a serious illness, caregiving for a loved one facing the end of their life, or welcoming new family members.
These Marylanders might not have an additional 18 months to wait for benefits to begin Jan. 1, 2028. During this proposed delay, over 247,000 Marylanders who would have applied for benefits will instead have to make impossible decisions about which bills to forgo, decide if they should miss a day’s pay to sit at a parent’s bedside in hospice care or risk bodily harm by returning to work too soon after giving birth.
Everyone needs time to care, and I am a testament to the unpredictability of when you might need paid leave.
The proposed delay has been justified by “federal uncertainty,” but life doesn’t stop because of uncertainty. I was diagnosed with cancer during a worldwide pandemic but care couldn’t wait. No other state is delaying the implementation of its FAMLI program in response to the federal administration’s recent actions, and Maryland’s FAMLI program does not rely on federal funding.
Maryland was lauded as a national leader when it passed the Time to Care Act, but each year the implementation gets delayed and other states move ahead with starting their paid leave programs, Maryland gets left behind.
By keeping the FAMLI program on its current implementation timeline, the Moore-Miller administration can provide certainty to Marylanders facing the uncertainty of a life-threatening illness that they won’t lose their income while navigating their care.
As a cancer survivor, I believe when facing an uncertain future you center your values, you stand beside each other, and you do the next right thing even if you can’t see far into the distance. We may not be able to predict everything the future will bring, but the next right thing is for Maryland to hold fast to its values by keeping the FAMLI program on its current implementation timeline.
Marylanders should feel secure in knowing that facing life’s best and most challenging times won’t also create an economic tragedy. We can’t delay promised progress because of the fear of some undefined uncertainty. Now is the moment to champion the timely implementation of FAMLI leave in Maryland.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1428788053-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-29 03:00:52.026229

Federal immigration officials have moved a University of Alabama graduate student to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Jena, Louisiana.
An attorney for Alireza Doroudi confirmed Friday afternoon after the ICE detainee locator listed where he was detained. For several days, the detainee locator only stated he was “in ICE custody” but did not list any location. The facility in Jena is holding several international students targeted by federal authorities.
David Rozas, Doroudi’s attorney, disputed claims by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that his client posed a national security concern.

Doroudi, an Iranian national pursuing a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering, was taken into custody by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit around 3 a.m. Tuesday, Rozas said in a statement sent on Friday. Immigration authorities cited the U.S. State Department’s revocation of Doroudi’s student visa as the reason for his arrest.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Doroudi “posed significant national security concerns.” The spokesperson declined to provide further details about what the concerns were, saying “That is all we are able to share at this time.”
Rozas challenged that characterization, saying he was unaware “of any allegations concerning significant national security issues.”
“He has not been arrested for any crime, nor has he participated in any anti-government protests,” the statement from Rozas said. “He is legally present in the U.S., pursuing his American dream by working towards his doctorate in mechanical engineering.”
Rozas added that Doroudi’s student visa was still active and that he was in the early stages of applying for permanent residency as a researcher.
Student organizers from the Students for Justice in Palestine, a student organization at UA, said Thursday that Doroudi had no involvement in recent pro-Palestine protests at the university or with the organization.
Doroudi’s fiancé, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, started a GoFundMe to help cover his legal expenses, garnering over $21,000 in about a day. She said in a LinkedIn post that Doroudi’s is set to defend his dissertation next academic year and has been “fully engaged” in academic work and research projects in the department.
“His dedication and achievements have earned him recognition in his field and led to his selection to apply for permanent residency,” she wrote in a post.
The University of Alabama has not provided further details about the situation. Spokesperson Alex House did not respond to messages Friday after initially stating that the university was cooperating with immigration authorities. House did not address whether the university was offering Doroudi any assistance.

(Photo by Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
 Withholding tribes’ data

As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”
Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.
Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
 State data agreements

In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
 Tracking disease

In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
 ‘We needed this yesterday’

During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”
There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A federal judge dismissed the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking to shutter the Dakota Access Pipeline, finding that the tribe must wait until the Army Corps finishes a key environmental study to bring another legal challenge against the agency.
“No matter its frustration with Defendants’ sluggish pace, it is not yet entitled to a second bite at the apple,” U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a Friday order.
Standing Rock filed the lawsuit in October, arguing that Corps is violating federal law by allowing the pipeline to operate without an easement. The tribe also claimed that the Corps failed to properly study the environmental impacts of the Dakota Access Pipeline or require its developer to prepare adequate spill response plans, among other alleged violations.
The suit is a successor to a lawsuit the tribe filed against the same agency in 2016.
Jury finds Greenpeace at fault for protest damages, awards pipeline developer more than $660 million

In that case, Boasberg in 2020 found the Army Corps had violated federal law by not conducting a full environmental impact study before granting an easement allowing the pipeline to cross underneath the Missouri River. He pulled the easement and ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline to be drained of oil pending the Army Corps’ completion of the study.
An appellate court in 2021 reversed Boasberg’s decision to shut down the pipeline, but did not reinstate the easement.
Boasberg wrote in a 2021 order following that decision that he could not shutter the pipeline because the tribe hadn’t sufficiently demonstrated that it posed an immediate threat of irreparable harm.
He noted in his Friday memo that “remarkably little” has changed in the four years since.
“Once more unto the breach, dear friends,” Boasberg wrote at the beginning of the order, quoting Shakespeare’s “Henry V”.
The Army Corps still has not finished the environmental impact study. It published a draft version of its report in late 2023. Once the study is complete, the Army Corps will use it to decide whether to grant the easement again.
One of the main arguments the tribe made in its 2024 lawsuit is that the Army Corps’ yearslong inaction on the Dakota Access Pipeline is a violation of federal law.
Boasberg wrote previously that, given the pipeline is operating on Army Corps land without proper authorization, the agency in the interim could have done something to enforce its property rights.
“The Corps has conspicuously declined to adopt a conclusive position regarding the pipeline’s continued operation, despite repeated prodding from this Court and the Court of Appeals to do so,” he wrote in his 2021 order.
But the Army Corps for now is not legally required to do anything but finish the environmental impact study, Boasberg stated in the Friday memo.
He said that other arguments Standing Rock raised in its complaint seek to relitigate issues that were already decided in the 2016 case, and that the legal landscape is not likely to change until the study is completed.
Boasberg noted that Standing Rock can file another lawsuit against the Corps once the study is published. The Army Corps of Engineers in legal filings also argued the tribe cannot sue the Corps over the easement when it had not yet made a final decision on the permit.
The tribe indicated last fall that it had new evidence to present related to the pipeline’s safety. The pipeline company has indicated previously it does not consider that information credible.
North Dakota, other states and pipeline owner Dakota Access intervened in the lawsuit on the side of the Corps. The intervenors called on the court to dismiss the case, arguing that the pipeline is important to the country’s economy, and that shutting it down would violate states’ rights and make road and rail transit less safe.
“The Dakota Access Pipeline has been operating safely for almost eight years now and is a critical piece of infrastructure for North Dakota and our nation’s energy security,” North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement regarding Boasberg’s decision.
A spokesperson for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Army Corps of Engineers declined to comment.
“The Corps has failed to act and failed to protect the tribe,” Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire said in an October press conference announcing the lawsuit.
The pipeline, which spans more than 1,000 miles, carries crude oil from northwest North Dakota to Illinois. Its pathway includes unceded land recognized as the Sioux Nation’s in 19th century treaties signed by the U.S. government.

Fourteen incumbent Republican lawmakers lost in the 2024 primaries, with many challengers capitalizing on opposition to Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed multibillion-dollar pipeline project. That produced a large class of freshman Republican legislators, and last year’s Republican leadership group lost support, resulting in a new leadership team when the Legislature convened in January.
Sen. Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, said those changes produced bills that pitted Republicans against each other, leading Democrats and some Republicans to work together against legislation they both opposed. Republicans outnumber Democrats in the Legislature 96-9.
“Unfortunately this year, a lot of times it was killing bad bills that we were the most successful,” Smith said.

Rep. Drew Peterson, R-Salem, said he ran for a caucus leadership position ahead of the session but “lost by a few.” He said some Republicans who failed to gain a leadership post worked with Democrats on some issues.
“I wasn’t in leadership this year, but we still lead within our group,” Peterson said. “Collectively we could get 36 to 42 votes between the Democrats and Republicans, and we did our job.”
Peterson and Smith were among the lawmakers who participated in a legislative panel discussion at the annual conference hosted by the Chiesman Center for Democracy at the University of South Dakota.
As evidence of bipartisan efforts between Democrats and some Republicans, the lawmakers highlighted the amending of legislation dubbed the “locking up librarians” bill, by removing a proposed criminal penalty for distributing harmful or obscene material to minors and instead requiring an appeals process for challenging materials in school and public libraries. The amendment passed the Senate 18-16 before the bill passed the chamber 32-2. The House accepted the amendments in a 36-34 vote, and Gov. Larry Rhoden signed the bill this month.

There was also bipartisan cooperation against a failed attempt to stop funding the state’s controversial Future Fund, which is an economic development fund controlled by the executive branch, and several failed bills intended to provide property tax relief to South Dakotans.
Sioux Falls Democratic Rep. Erik Muckey said he most clearly saw the shift within the Republican Party in the Future Fund debate, where he said some Republicans reacted to a lack of oversight for the fund by supporting its elimination without “actually digging into” how it works.
“We’re trying to take down an agency, effectively,” Muckey said, “but we don’t actually know what the agency does, the process to get there or what the consequences of a bill is that we didn’t even all probably read, frankly.”
Rep. Chris Kassin, R-Vermillion, said the push for property tax relief included a determination by some freshmen lawmakers to pass property tax cuts without considering costs. That’s primarily because some lawmakers, he said, were quick to “slam something through” and slow to research and understand a bill’s consequences.
The Legislature ultimately passed Rhoden’s legislation including a temporary cap on countywide assessment increases, with plans to dig into the property tax system further with a summer task force.
Other notable efforts that some Republicans and Democrats worked together on failed, such as funding the replacement of the state penitentiary.
The Legislature lost leadership with deep institutional knowledge because of the primary defeats, said Sen. Sydney Davis, R-Burbank, leading to less understanding among lawmakers of the process and why bills failed in past sessions.
Davis said some bills saw several layers of amendments, which hinders how lawmakers and the public vet bills in the committee process.
“That’s a drain on the process and the system,” she said.
One of the new legislative leaders, House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, told South Dakota Searchlight by phone that he saw factions of Republicans working with Democrats during the session. He described the comments made during the panel as part of an attempt to frame the session as “fraught and chaotic.”

The bills highlighted by lawmakers during the panel weren’t bad, he said, but were emblematic of the divide within the Republican Party. The Future Fund and property tax discussions, he said, showed the divide is centered on government involvement in economic development and government spending.
“What some people call bad, others call conservative,” Odenbach said.
Odenbach said the next session will be different as freshman lawmakers have a year under their belts and a better understanding of the legislative process. The divide, he said, will remain.
“The South Dakota Republican Party is changing,” Odenbach said. “It’s going back to its roots and we’re going to redefine what it means to be a conservative. It’ll take a few twists and turns until we get there.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/591A9119-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 20:02:25.465331

(Photo via U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission)Data centers used for artificial intelligence and other aspects of the online world are likely to have a significant impact on Pennsylvania’s energy economy in coming years, according to the head of the state Public Utility Commission. 
The PUC unanimously approved Chairperson Stephen DeFrank’s motion Thursday to hold a hearing April 24 on how to protect consumers, while harnessing the opportunities for economic growth, technological advancement, electricity market stability and bolstering national security.
“Balancing concerns like these is one of the primary mandates of the commission,” DeFrank said in the motion, adding that it would be required to provide non-discriminatory access to public utilities, while guarding against undue burdens and costs for existing customers and risk to electric utilities.
At least two large data center projects are in the works that have the potential to affect Pennsylvania’s electrical grid.
Constellation Energy announced in September a $1.6 billion investment to restart its nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island in Dauphin County. The  deal wouldprovide carbon-free electricity to supply power for software giant Microsoft’s AI data centers in the region.
This month, Amazon Web Services announced the $650 million purchase of a data center with 1,200 acres of land adjacent to the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station nuclear power plant near Berwick, Luzerne County. AWS plans to build a data center campus that would consume as much energy as 900,000 homes.
Jon Gordon, wholesale markets manager for Advanced Energy United, an association of clean energy providers, told the Capital-Star the prospect of many large data centers being located in a region introduces new variables into the economy.
“Forecasting energy demand used to be relatively straightforward. Demand grew in a straight line with economic activity,” he said.
The demand from data centers could affect electricity supply and reliability when added to already increased demand from electric vehicles and heating, the retirement of fossil-fuel generating stations, the push to increase the amount of carbon-neutral energy being used, and delays in getting clean energy generation on line, Gordon said.
“We don’t know how speculative these projects are and how many are actually going to come online,” he said. “In the energy industry, we need to figure out which ones are actually going to get built.”
DeFrank noted such projects may require upgrades to electrical distribution systems to connect to the grid. The PUC must ensure that if utilities pay for improvements to serve projects that ultimately do not materialize that current ratepayers are not left with the bill.
“In such cases, questions may arise about who will ultimately bear these stranded costs. Providing certainty may mean requiring deposits or other finance security, minimum contract terms, or some sort of breakage or termination fee for loads that decide not to proceed with construction,” DeFrank’s motion said.
The PUC also needs to provide large electricity users with certainty regarding how long it will take and how much it will cost to connect to the grid. Users willing to pay for and build system upgrades may be able to connect faster. But utilities may take a conservative approach to large projects, DeFrank said.

Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, which operates clinics in the St. Louis region, Rolla and Springfield, and Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates clinics in Kansas City and Columbia, received a letter from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on Thursday stating their complication plans did not meet state requirements.
The decision means that almost five months after voters approved a constitutional amendment restoring abortion rights, the most common method to terminate a pregnancy is not available in Missouri.

This rejection was based on the criteria of an emergency rule published the same day by the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office. 
That rule requires the complication plan for any facility prescribing abortion medication to more than 10 women a month must: 

Have an on-call OB-GYN who lives within 25 miles of the clinic available at all times for seven days after a patient takes the medication. This physician would be required to treat any complications that arise as a result of the medication unless the standard of care requires someone else to treat them. 
Provide for patients who live further than 25 miles from the clinic, the name of the emergency room and a physician “within a reasonable distance of the location where the patient will complete the abortion.”
Submit the full names of all physicians involved in the local complication plans.

While three clinics —Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis — have resumed some procedural abortions, Planned Parenthood leadership have said they will not begin prescribing medication abortions without an approved complication plan. 
Leadership with Planned Parenthood Great Rivers is still deciding on next steps, a spokesperson said. 
The Department of Health and Senior Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement in February, department spokeswoman Sami Jo Freeman said complication plans are “important to ensure the safety of patients because medication abortions will likely be completed at home without a physician present.” 
When the clinics submitted their complication plans in February, they did not include the names of any physicians involved. The proposals state that patients could contact the clinic at any time with concerns, including an after-hours line staffed by licensed nurses who can refer calls to an on-call physician. 
“If a potentially urgent complication is suspected based on the patient’s symptoms or the patient is not able to return to the health center in a timely way, the nurse will direct them to the emergency department (ED),” the initial plans submitted by Planned Parenthood read. 
With the patient’s consent, the proposal continued, the ER would be told the patient’s medical history if possible. Planned Parenthood would follow up with the patient the next day.
Across the country, abortion medication is the most common method used to end a pregnancy.
In 2023, nearly two-thirds of abortions in the United States took place using medication as opposed to in-clinic procedures, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group.   
In states where abortion is legal, medication that induces a miscarriage is available to patients in their first trimester of pregnancy. Patients typically take two doses of medication, the second of which is often taken at home. In recent years, a growing number of women have been ordering abortion medication from online providers in the United States and abroad, including to states where abortion remains illegal. 
According to the FDA, mifepristone is safe to use if taken as directed. Cramping and bleeding are common side effects of the medication. Those prescribed mifepristone are urged to call their doctor if they experience heavy bleeding, abdominal pain or a fever. The same guidance applies to those who recently underwent procedural abortions, experienced miscarriages or delivered a baby.   
Since the medication was approved for use 28 years ago, only 32 deaths have been reported associated with mifepristone, according to the FDA. 
Earlier this month, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey issued a notice of an intent to serve a cease and desist letter to the Planned Parenthood clinics, doubling down on his demand that Planned Parenthood stop performing a type of abortion that its clinics aren’t actually offering patients.
Several Planned Parenthood clinics remained open even after the procedure was outlawed statewide in June 2022. The clinics primarily provide family planning services, cancer screenings and STI testing and treatment, including to patients on Medicaid. 
Shortly after Missourians in November narrowly approved Amendment 3, granting the constitutional right to an abortion, Planned Parenthood sued the state, arguing dozens of regulations on abortion providers were no longer constitutional. 
In mid-February, a Jackson County judge struck down most of the regulations, allowing Planned Parenthood to resume in-clinic procedural abortions for the first time in years. 
Abortion returns to Columbia, opening access for mid-Missouri for first time since 2018

The first abortion to happen in Missouri since the procedure was outlawed statewide in June 2022 took place in February at a Kansas City clinic. In early March, procedural abortions returned to the clinic in Columbia for the first time since 2018. 
And on Thursday, the clinic in St. Louis quietly performed its first two abortions since 2022. 
The clinic plans to take additional abortion patients who are earlier than 12 weeks gestation over the coming weeks, but the number of days abortion is provided in St. Louis will depend on physicians’ schedules, Nick Dunne, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood, said Friday.
Staff at the St. Louis clinic did not initially indicate they would bring back procedural abortions this soon. 
“Ahead of the December ruling, our staff had been preparing to start providing medication abortion — including staff training, as well as ordering supplies and medications,” Dunne said in a statement. “Recognizing more recently that we were likely to face additional hurdles from state officials on medication abortion, our medical and patient services teams pivoted to allocating staff, equipment, and other necessary resources in order to begin offering procedural abortion again.” 
Planned Parenthood likely won’t be able to begin offering procedural abortions at its clinics in Rolla or Springfield until additional physicians are hired, Dunne said, adding that Planned Parenthood is “working aggressively” to expand their physician numbers.
There are currently two long-term staff physicians and one contracted physician at Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, which also oversees the clinic in Fairview Heights. The two long-term physicians are both based in the St. Louis area.

The audits, aimed at evaluating security and safety standard compliance at the Ionia Correctional Facility, Baraga Correctional Facility and Richard A. Handlon Correctional Facility, found some overlapping issues with security that State Auditor General Doug Ringler said in the reports could lead to harm for those who are incarcerated, as well as staff and visitors.
The reports each offer recommendations and possible remedies to the issues presented such as evaluating procedures by the Department of Corrections, or MDOC, on metal detector usage, and improving safety checks for those in the prison.
While the shortcomings outlined in the audits are serious, they are fixable and MDOC has started to address the issues outlined and take proper measures for accountability from the employees who falsified records, MDOC Legislative Liaison Kyle Kaminski told lawmakers on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Corrections and Judiciary Thursday.
“We’re not trying to minimize the findings of those audits. We take them very seriously. We’re going to learn from them.. We agree that those findings are problematic,” Kaminski said. “We had started to institute some changes even before the audit was done… While it covers three facilities, we take it as a lesson that we need to apply to all 26 facilities.”
Lawmakers on the committee expressed sympathy for the national staffing shortage state prisons are facing, noting that lawmakers have been confronted in recent years with the task of creating policies to alleviate some of the strains that sector of the workforce endures.
Corrections officers have incredibly difficult jobs, but these lapses in performing duties to ensure public safety can’t stand, House Appropriations Chair Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) said in a statement Friday.
“These findings are deeply troubling and highlight a dangerous lack of oversight in our corrections system,” Bollin said. “When officers are failing to conduct thorough searches of inmates, vehicles, and staff entering the prison, it creates a major security risk…We must prioritize improving staffing levels while also ensuring that all security measures are enforced consistently.”

About 38% of the prison cell searches correction officers logged at the Ionia Correctional Facility that auditors reviewed between May and June of 2023 were falsified, meaning no officers even entered the cells they said were checked, according to an audit report. And still, officers only documented about 80% of the minimum number of cell or bunk checks, with about one third of actual checks performed lasting less than one minute, calling into question the thoroughness of the checks performed.
Issues with falsifying records of checks, not performing the appropriate number of checks and the reality of those checks being done in a matter of seconds, were cause for concern for audits, especially as they were able to carry contraband through all the metal detectors they tested.
Auditors were able to carry in a pair of 6-inch needle nose pliers, a 7-inch pair of scissors, a 3-inch seam ripper and 4-inch seam ripper, according to an audit report.
At the Richard Handlon Correctional Facility, also in Ionia, auditors were able to get a welding rod, a flat piece of stainless steel and a 5-7 inch-long piece of scrap metal through metal detectors in July of 2023, according to an audit report.
Auditors found that corrections officers at Baraga Correctional Facility in the Upper Peninsula falsified cell search records about 25% of the time and nearly half of the cell searches that were observed were completed in less than a minute in an audit.
The falsification of records is not reflective of the majority of corrections staff, Kaminski told lawmakers Thursday, though the issue is being taken seriously and those scenarios were referred for investigation and potential discipline. 
“That type of falsification certainly will not be tolerated and at the same time, it’s resulted in us changing some of our internal quality assurance processes to say, ‘Okay… we can no longer feel like… just because it’s documented, that it’s sufficient, that it occurred, we’re going to have to go back, look at video, do other things to try to determine exactly what was done and how well it was done,” Kaminski said.

(Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources photo)FRANKFORT — The first Black member of a board overseeing Kentucky’s wildlife management agency apparently lost his seat under a GOP-backed law that a Senate leader said was justified by political Facebook posts.
The Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate did not confirm the reappointment of Jerry Ferrell to the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission when it adjourned Friday. Under previous state law, Ferrell would have been allowed to serve on the commission until the end of the year. But under Senate Bill 245, a new law passed over the veto of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear that only impacts Ferrell this year, he is required to vacate his position with the legislature’s adjournment.
Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, had said SB 245 was spurred in reaction to political Facebook posts purportedly shared by Ferrell that Stivers considered to be inappropriate for a sitting member of a state board. Stivers specifically mentioned a Facebook post purportedly shared by Ferrell that showed a majority of U.S. Supreme Court justices in “KKK hoodies”. 
Ferrell previously told the Lantern he believed SB 245 was targeting him for social media posts he’s shared with his political views, commentary he believed is separate from and not relevant to his work on the Fish and Wildlife Commission. Ferrell was also concerned his removal was a part of a larger “culture” against diversity. 
Stivers had denied Ferrell’s removal had anything to do with race, saying he didn’t know Ferrell’s race when the issue of the Facebook posts was brought to him. Ferrell told the Lantern on Friday he was skeptical that Stivers wasn’t aware he is Black. 
Ferrell, a veteran, said he was angry about the situation, arguing he didn’t believe “people really understand what it means to be Black in this country.” Ferrell said he was considering his options on how to challenge the removal.
“He wants me out of there. He got his wish,” Ferrell said. “My family has been in service all their life, and that’s what caused me to serve and still serve.” 
The commission is made up of nine unpaid members who oversee the KDFWR’s budget consisting of tens of millions of dollars in hunting and fishing license fees, boat registration fees, and federal grants. State law directs the commission to keep a “watchful eye” over the department.
Ferrell’s removal would leave one vacancy on the commission.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)BOX ELDER — A new state law brought a degree of certainty Friday to a situation filled with unknowns for the Douglas School District.
The law, signed by South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, authorizes a $15 million, zero-interest loan to the district from the state’s housing infrastructure fund. The money will help pay for the construction of a third elementary school.
The extra school is needed because the federal government is developing B-21 stealth bombers, and some of them will be stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base, which neighbors the school district’s Box Elder campus.
The construction and extra personnel needed to accommodate the new planes are expected to grow the base and the surrounding area by thousands of people. But the school district doesn’t know when the planes will arrive.
“We know they’re coming probably in the next three to four years,” said Superintendent Kevin Case, “but we don’t have an exact timeline.”

The district needs a building large enough for 640 students, Case said, which will cost an estimated $62 million. The $15 million loan will help pay for that, and the district anticipates contributing $5 million or more of its own money. The rest will hopefully come from federal funds that South Dakota’s congressional delegates are working to obtain, Case said.
Douglas is uniquely financially hindered by the presence of the vast base, which is not subjected to property taxes. The district gets payments from the federal government to compensate for the lost tax revenue, but Case said it’s not enough to fund a major building project.
Rapid City-area lawmakers have worked for years to win state grant funding for the district. Some other lawmakers opposed the idea, saying it would set a bad precedent and encourage other districts to seek state funding for local projects.
The alternative proposal legislators adopted this year will tap into the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The Legislature created it two years ago with state dollars and federal pandemic relief money, to help spark housing development projects across the state.
Half of the $200 million fund was made available as grants, and all of that money has been awarded. The other half was made available as loans, but demand has been low. More than $80 million was still available as recently as December.
Sen. Helene Duhamel, R-Rapid City, sponsored legislation earlier this year that went through several amendments before it finally reached Gov. Rhoden’s desk in the form of a loan from the housing fund. The legislation gives the state Housing Development Authority permission to make the loan, with a repayment period of 20 years.
The district can use the money for any expenses related to the new school’s construction. Under regular program rules, a loan from the fund can only be used for things like roads, sidewalks, or water and sewer lines to support housing developments.
Rhoden signed the bill Friday in the Vandenberg Elementary School gym at Box Elder.
“We’ve talked about this issue for a couple of years now, as legislators well know,” Rhoden said. “And this, I believe, is the right solution to move forward.”

(Lily Alexander)Kylie Pucella, 21, a trans woman and senior at the University of New Mexico, began hormone therapy when she was 18. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, she has worried that the legal protections for her care in New Mexico — often described as a safe haven for LGBTQ+ people — might not last amid presidential executive orders that target transgender rights.
She’s not the only one.
“People are really scared about losing their access to care,” Adrien Lawyer, co-founder and executive director of the Albuquerque-based New Mexico Transgender Resource Center told Source. “But in New Mexico, that’s very unlikely to happen.”
That’s because the state created a legal framework well in advance of federal rollbacks of trans rights. But that hasn’t stopped legal challenges here, nor fully assuaged the fears of people who consider the care lifesaving.
The care
Gender-affirming care typically includes medication and surgical options that help people feel more aligned with the gender they know themselves to be, according to Dr. Molly McClain, a physician who provides gender-affirming care in the state. Medications include ones to suspend puberty, as well as hormone therapy to initiate puberty aligned with someone’s gender, McClain said. People 18 and older also have surgical options.
“The very important thing for everyone to recognize is that the way that someone feels affirmed in their gender is really, really individually dependent,” McClain said. “So not everybody needs to be on medications, not everybody needs to get surgery, and everyone has their own journey that they are embarking on.”
In New Mexico, most medical practices are doing their best to continue providing gender-affirming care while paying attention to the federal changes, McClain noted.
“I think we have a lot of protections here and a lot of support that kids in other states don’t — a lot of people who see them and hear them and love them,” McClain said.
The legal landscape
In 2023, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Act into law, which in part prohibits public bodies from restricting or discriminating against a person’s right to access gender-affirming care. The act defines gender-affirming care broadly, according to Jazmyn Taitingfong, a reproductive rights and gender equity attorney with ACLU of New Mexico.
“It’s described as psychological, behavioral, surgical, pharmaceutical and medical care services and supplies to support a person’s gender identity,” Taitingfong said. “So that’s a very wide definition, and that’s on purpose so that it protects people from discrimination from public bodies.”
The same year, Lujan Grisham signed protections for reproductive and gender-affirming health care providers and patients into law, preventing public bodies from releasing information or using their resources to assist outside investigations that seek to impose civil or criminal liability on medical providers who provide this care in New Mexico.
“The reason that is so important is that many people are being forced to flee their home state to get certain types of health care — mainly gender affirming care and abortion health care,” Taitingfong said. “And so that is a level of protection if people go back to their home state.”
After taking office in January, Trump signed an order halting the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care for youth under 19 years old. While a federal court blocked the other, NPR reports some hospitals across the country have stopped performing gender-affirming surgeries and providing other care nonetheless.
According to Trans Legislation Tracker, eight anti-trans bills were introduced in the most recent legislative session, one of which would have largely prohibited health care providers from providing gender-affirming care to minors, and opened up doctors to liability. The New Mexico Attorney General’s Office commented that many of the provisions of that bill may have been unconstitutional.
Ultimately, none of the bills made it through the legislative session.
New Mexico’s protections have been long in coming, Lawyer said, noting that LGBTQ+ advocates have worked for decades to create statewide protections.
“We’ve had activists here for a long, long time — 30 years — trying to proactively create a legislative climate at the state level that’s incredibly protective, and it’s worked,” Lawyer said.
Fear persists
Despite the legal protections New Mexico offers, McClain said she worries about the impact of the federal climate on her trans patients and their families.
“What I’m seeing for all of these families is just a much higher level of stress and of fear,” McClain said. “I think we’re going to see a huge uptick in all the things that make trans and nonbinary kids sick already.”
Heather Johnson, also a trans senior at UNM, said she is concerned about the future of insurance coverage for hormone therapy. Earlier this month, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released a proposed rule that would prohibit individual and small business health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act from covering gender-affirming care as an essential health benefit, according to KFF.
“As soon as insurance denies it, it’ll at least triple in price,” Johnson said. “A lot of this stuff is rather expensive, and insurance takes care of a fair amount of it. And so the real fear is that we’ll just be priced out of the medication we need to live.”
Johnson said the care allowed her to live a life that feels normal.
“It’s legitimately a life-saving care,” she said. “Without it, I wouldn’t be here, I guarantee that.”
For Pucella, access to hormone therapy allowed her to become a full version of herself. While she feels relatively safe in New Mexico, she worries that could change as national anti-trans sentiment and federal action continues. 
“I’m not really sure if — given the climate of things if they keep on going the way they’re going — there really is going to be a safe haven anywhere in the U.S. for trans people,” Pucella said.

House Bill 460 is a 2026 budget enhancement for the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. 
Vocational Rehabilitation is a state/federal program that seeks to help people with disabilities secure and retain employment, according to the division’s website. At the time that the division’s financial troubles came to light last year, Vocational Rehabilitation was serving about 8,000 Idahoans with disabilities. 
A year ago, at the very end of the 2024 legislative session, the former administrator of Vocational Rehabilitation suddenly told the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee that the division was out of money and would be unable to pay its bills, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, is a powerful legislative committee that sets the budgets for every state agency and department every year.
  Federal government notified the state of Idaho that grant was considered high risk 

Since the financial problems came to light publicly, the federal Rehabilitation Services Administration (which is part of the U.S. Department of Education) notified the state that the Vocational Rehabilitation grant was considered high risk because of significant concerns about the division’s financial accountability, the Sun previously reported.
In September, the Sun reported Vocational Rehabilitation was offered $10 million in emergency federal funding to help the division pay for people the division has already committed to helping. In order to fully access the federal funds, Idaho would need to provide $2.7 million in state funds.

Fast forward to Friday, and House Bill 460 provides $35,000 in additional funding for the fiscal year 2026 budget for interpreter services and a one-time $4.4 million supplemental funding appropriation for the current fiscal year 2025 budget.
The supplemental funding includes $2.7 million as a state match to allow Vocational Rehabilitation to access $10 million in emergency federal funds intended to help the agency stay afloat and $1.7 million for client services that have already been provided but are not eligible for federal reimbursement.
Idaho’s state government runs on a fiscal year calendar. The current 2025 fiscal year ends June 30, and the 2026 fiscal year begins July 1.
Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as co-chair of JFAC, acknowledged the division’s financial concerns Friday and said Vocational Rehabilitation is under new leadership.  
“I must give praise to the interim director, who stepped into a difficult situation and is trying to make sense of what’s going on, but it’s a very complicated situation,” Horman said. 
Without any debate, the Idaho House voted 49-20 to pass the Vocational Rehabilitation budget bill.
House Bill 460 heads next to the Idaho Senate for consideration.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)An effort to overturn a controversial union bill that passed this legislative session is gaining steam in Utah. 
On Friday, the Protect Utah Workers coalition, which consists of 14 labor unions, announced it has collected about 130,000 signatures from voters around the state, nearing the threshold to qualify for a ballot referendum. 
“But that is not enough. Not even close,” said Jessica Bruner, director of the Utah Public Employees Association. “We still have a lot of hard work to do to meet the legislature’s complex requirements and guidelines. That means we need to keep up this momentum for two more weeks and gather as many signatures as we can before mid April.”
Bruner spoke from the steps of the Utah Capitol on Friday, alongside a coalition of teachers, electricians, firefighters, city and county workers, and police officers, all of whom have HB267 in their crosshairs.  
Sponsored by Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy, HB267 prevents public unions from collective bargaining, the process where unions meet with employers to negotiate terms of employment. 
That means a teachers union, for example, can no longer negotiate an employment contract with a school district. The same goes for firefighters, police officers, municipal workers and other public employees.

The bill passed both the House and Senate, despite public outcry and bipartisan opposition. On Feb. 14, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed it, though he told reporters he wasn’t happy with the finished product, wishing lawmakers and unions had been able to reach a compromise. 
“Talk about unpopular bills, that was certainly one of them. I think we had 10,000 emails on that one,” Cox said during his monthly PBS news conference last week. 
The sponsors say the bill is meant to protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members — but it was met with staunch criticism from labor advocates.
Now, those same opponents are trying to gather enough signatures to trigger a referendum, where voters could decide whether to overturn the bill on the November 2026 ballot.

That’s a monumental challenge. Of the 26 states that allow ballot referendums, Utah’s process is one of the most restrictive, requiring signatures from at least 8% of the state’s voters in 30 days. In addition, the law requires signatures from 8% of voters in at least 15 of the state’s 29 Senate districts. 
The lieutenant governor’s office will then verify the signatures and, assuming the coalition has complied with state code, ballot language will be crafted for the next general election, where the fate of HB267 is up to voters. 
“I love the referendum process. I love that we have it. I think it’s really important. I think it’s one of those checks on the legislative process,” Cox said during the news conference. “When it does happen, it sends a really important message.” 
The governor said at the time he thinks the coalition “has a chance” to meet the signature threshold. 
The 8% statewide threshold means advocates need slightly more than 140,000 signatures — at nearly 130,000 so far, the coalition is getting close. But there will inevitably be errors, so the coalition is shooting to go well beyond the minimum requirement. 
“We need to double that number before our deadline on April 15,” said Bruner. “We know that we have well-meaning people signing this petition who may not be registered to vote, or put down an incorrect address. They might fill out the form incorrectly, or their signature or handwriting may be illegible. … Although we have nearly 130,000 signatures and overwhelming support, we must keep this momentum going.”

The coalition received an assist this week, with the state’s largest police and firefighter unions throwing their support behind the referendum effort. 
“House bill 267 has stripped the voice of our heroes to advocate for their needs,” said Kevin Murray, president of the Utah Fraternal Order of Police, which represents more than 5,200 law enforcement officers across the state. “Without a voice, we are unable to advocate for safe working conditions or competitive wages and benefits to attract qualified candidates to protect our communities.”
“We tried to not let it get to this point, but this is where we’re at,” said Jack Tidrow, president of the Professional Firefighters Association of Utah. “We need the public’s help to get us across the finish line.”

Volunteers around Utah who have helped gather signatures say they see little to no opposition, with people from all walks of life signing the packets. 
“Everyone is signing. I’ve had maybe two people say no to me,” said Greg Burrow, interim executive director of the Utah School Employees Association. “Politics is not a part of this at all. People are upset with the Legislature. I don’t think it’s just this issue, I think they believe the Legislature has overstepped on multiple issues and this is a way to make sure their voices are heard.” 
Meanwhile, the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity kicked off its “Decline to Sign” campaign last week. The group, which spoke in support of HB267, says the labor coalition has been spreading misinformation related to HB267 and is urging Utahns not to throw their signatures behind the effort. 
“The messaging that they need these collective bargaining rights when so many are already not using it, is just fundamentally wrong,” said Americans for Prosperity-Utah state director Kevin Greene last week, pointing to other school districts, fire and police departments, and municipalities that don’t collectively bargain and haven’t seen stagnant wages or unsafe work environments.

(Photo by Shelby Kleinhans for Source NM)State lawmakers sent Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham a bill that would, if enacted, allow immigrants authorized to work by the federal government to become police officers in New Mexico.
Currently, New Mexico law limits policing jobs to people with U.S. citizenship.
Senate Bill 364 would open these jobs up to applicants who have work authorization from the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, part of the federal Department of Homeland Security.
According to a spokesperson for the governor, she has not yet decided whether to sign SB364.
“The governor is going through each bill that made it to the 4th floor and there is a process where she evaluates each one. She has until April 11 to decide,” Deputy Director of Communications Jodi McGinnis Porter told Source NM on Friday.
SB364 co-sponsor Sen. Cindy Nava (D-Bernalillo) told the Senate Judiciary Committee the bill would remove “outdated restrictions” in state law and allow immigrants with federal work authorization to be police officers and sheriff’s deputies.
The bill, if enacted, would allow legal permanent residents and beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to become police officers, if they meet all the standards and qualifications, Nava said. She told the House Judiciary Committee it would open the door to more than 51,000 New Mexicans to apply for police jobs.
“These are individuals who are desperately needed by our police departments and sheriff’s offices,” said Nava, who is a DACA recipient herself.
The Albuquerque Police Department has indicated that its 885 sworn officers are 74% of the budgeted capacity, according to the Department of Workforce Solutions’ analysis of the bill. 
Using national survey data from the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the department estimates New Mexico has between 749 and 1,947 empty but funded positions for patrol officers, supervisors and detectives.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
SB364 was sponsored by Nava, House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque), Senate Majority Whip Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque), Senate Judiciary Chair Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces), and Sen. Craig Brandt (R-Rio Rancho).
SB364 passed the Senate on March 13 and the House of Representatives on March 21. It passed unanimously through the Senate Tax, Business and Transportation Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, and passed with bipartisan support through the House Judiciary Committee.
Jessica Inez Martinez, director of policy and coalition building at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, was an expert witness on SB364 and told the House Judiciary Committee that legal permanent residents must go through a lengthy process to achieve that status and then in order to maintain it, must not commit specific crimes. DACA recipients, to maintain their status, can’t commit any crimes, she said.
“They would go through the process to do the background checks like every other candidate that is going through the law enforcement process,” she said.
She also noted people who achieve legal permanent residence can also become citizens within three to five years. DACA recipients cannot achieve citizenship but can get work authorization, she said.
Rep. Nicole Chavez (R-Albuquerque) said she had thought that noncitizens can’t carry firearms and asked how that would work under the bill. Sen. Brandt responded by reading from a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice that outlines exceptions to that prohibition, including DACA recipients who are certified police officers, who may possess firearms and ammunition issued to them by the police department for official use.
If an officer’s job requires them to be armed 24/7, then they are allowed to take the gun home, but if their job only allows them to carry while on shift, then they lock the gun up in the department’s armory every day, Brandt said.
In her presentations to legislative committees about the bill, Nava spoke in detail about her brother, who is a DACA recipient like her and moved away from New Mexico to work for the police department in Blue Island, Illinois.
Jeffrey Farr, chief of police in Blue Island, told the House Judiciary Committee via Zoom that his department employs seven DACA recipients and started hiring them about two years ago because they found it “increasingly difficult to communicate with the community that we are supposed to serve.”
“Each of them have played a vital role in the success of our police department,” Farr said. “I highly encourage you to pass this law.”

That makes six vetoes this year, adding to the two rejections Cox issued this week, turning down a bill that allowed him to appoint the chief justice of the Utah Supreme Court, and another legislative proposal that would have permitted the state to reroute property tax revenue for schools for other purposes.
It’s a different, stronger approach than last year’s when Cox issued vetoes on seven bills he said could have been “a phone call” since they were unnecessary.

However, some things remained the same as last year — like the governor’s usual plea to see fewer bills during the 45-day session. The Legislature passed 582 bills in 2025, not a record-breaking number, but still more than what passed in previous years.
“To further illustrate the nature of the concern, there have been 646 education bills passed in the last five years, representing ~23% of all bills passed,” Cox wrote in his veto letter. “While many of these bills greatly benefit our students, parents, and educators, this additional regulation creates a significant burden upon local education agencies and their genuine efforts to be in compliance with the new statutory expectations within short timeframes.”
Cox vetoes bill that would have given governor power over appointing Utah chief justice

The increase also represents an additional burden for the public, state entities and local governments, Cox said. Something he, again, hopes to avoid next year.
As the list of vetoes is still fresh, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said lawmakers will discuss how to best proceed during the next couple of weeks.
“Utah stands out as the top state in the nation because of our ability to come together and chart the best course for our future. While there may be differences of opinion and we do not always agree, I appreciate the governor’s commitment to working collaboratively to build an even brighter future for our great state,” Adams said in a statement.
In addition to the full vetoes, Cox rejected certain line items from appropriation bills, excluding money directed to legislative proposals that didn’t pass. Those provisions would be addressed in a special session, he said.
Here’s what Cox vetoed on Thursday night:
SB197, Property Tax Amendments
Sponsored by Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, the bill was a proposal to phase out the Circuit Breaker program, a property tax relief program for low-income senior and indigent residents in Utah. Under the legislation, McCay said, people who have assets but are unable to pay their share of taxes on them could defer their property taxes until a later date, whenever they sell their homes.
“The property tax circuit breaker program is growing significantly and that amount of money has been difficult to try to plan for and balance,” McCay told the Senate in February. 
The bill passed the House and Senate with a fair amount of opposition from lawmakers of both parties. A group of senior citizen, housing and low-income advocates and the Utah County tax administrator spoke against the bill and asked for a veto.
Cox said in his veto letter that a number of county government leaders had concerns about the administrative challenges the policy would entail. They also worried about what this would mean for seniors in the state.
“While S.B. 197 contains well-intentioned goals of reforming and streamlining property tax relief programs, it risks cutting off the most vulnerable of Utah’s expanding senior population from a critical tax relief lifeline, while also adding administrative burdens on counties,” Cox wrote. “A more prudent approach would be to revisit these reforms as part of a comprehensive, coordinated review of Utah’s tax system.”
HB306, Precious Metals Amendments
Sponsored by Rep. Ken Ivory, R-West Jordan, the legislation would have made Utah the first state in the country to allow vendors to receive payment in gold or silver from the state. The bill also directed the state treasurer to start a competitive bid process for a company to create a payment system, integrated in the state’s accounting structure, to facilitate electronic payments backed by precious metals. 
Utah 1st in the nation to pass these 5 bills: Flags, fluoride, gold and more

The proposal followed HB348, a 2024 bill that allowed the treasurer to invest up to 10% of Utah’s rainy day funds in precious metals and created the Utah Precious Metals Study Workgroup.
“While Utah has been implementing last year’s H.B. 348, Precious Metals Amendments, under which the state treasurer may invest in precious metals, there are significant problems that make H.B. 306 operationally impracticable,” Cox wrote. “Additionally, I am concerned that a specific entity offered to fund the bill, which could jeopardize the required competitive process in the bill.”
Treasurer Marlo Oaks had supported the bill, arguing it would open up another choice for financial transactions in the state.
“H.B. 306 gives state vendors the option to be paid in precious metals, while ensuring the physical assets backing the system are stored in Utah and subject to regular audits,” Oaks said in a news release. “This not only supports a secure and transparent system, but also takes an important step toward making transactional gold a viable option for all citizens.”
According to the release from the treasurer’s office, Kevin Freeman, founder of Economic War Room, and who also served on the Utah Precious Metals Workgroup, wrote a roadmap for states to implement transactional gold and silver systems.
“This isn’t just about gold,” Freeman said about the bill. “It’s about liberty, privacy, and economic justice. I’m proud to see constitutional currency come to life in this historic legislation.”
HB315, Elected Official Vacancy Modifications
Sponsored by Rep. Andrew Stoddard, D-Sandy, the bill would have allowed breaking a tie among three or more candidates in elections for midterm vacancies in municipal offices through a “game of chance.” 



Let us know what you think...


 


According to the bill, the local council would be able to hold a game in which “the outcome is determined by chance” and “each participant has equal odds of winning.” 
But, that language may be problematic for a state like Utah, which includes in its constitution a lottery prohibition. 
“In light of the language of the Utah Constitution that the ‘Legislature shall not authorize any game of chance,’ I am vetoing the bill out of an abundance of caution to avoid creating potential legal issues for the state in this area,” Cox wrote in the letter.
SB106, Utah-Ireland Trade Commission 
Sponsored by Sen. Wayne Harper, R-Taylorsville, the proposal appropriated $10,000 to create a trade commission between Utah and Ireland composed of six legislators and five appointees from the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity.
The bill initially failed in the House during the session’s last week, with many lawmakers questioning the need for such an entity. But it was brought back the same night, passing comfortably. 
“While I understand the intent of this bill, I continue to be wary of creating new commissions in statute. Thanks to your outstanding work, we are now under 400 boards and commissions in the state,” Cox said. “Let’s not go backward on this when it is not necessary to do so!”
Cox also expressed concerns about creating a trade commission for a specific country when others, which are more significant trade partners for the state, don’t receive the same treatment. 
“We don’t need to create a new commission when I can do everything that this bill calls for without a new statute or a new trade commission,” Cox said. “I do these things on behalf of the state of Utah regularly.”

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)A Senate joint resolution urging Congress to release over a million acres of wilderness study area in Montana from consideration of inclusion into the National Wilderness Preservation System brought significant opposition this week.
Montana lawmakers can only urge federal action on these parcels of land since only Congress has the authority to classify the land.
The National Wilderness Preservation System protects about 111 million acres of land across the country. No action has been taken yet on the measure, Senate Resolution 14, which was brought by Sen. Tony Tezak, R-Ennis.
Proponents of the resolution said it would open up the areas to more uses, like ranching and logging. Opponents argued the resolution was a full-fledged assault on public lands. 
The resolution would involve a little more than a million acres.
The Wilderness Study Area Act was passed in 1977, and none of the land under consideration has been formally designated as wilderness. 
Tezak believes the land should be, “returned into public lands management decisions of our local forest service and Bureau of Land Management districts, rather than their current state of being managed as a wilderness study area dictated by Washington, D.C.
The 1977 law requires a review of potential wilderness areas within five years. The resolution addresses this specifically, as well as a 2000 law that created more study areas on Bureau of Land Management land.
“The vast majority of Montana lands identified in the Montana Wilderness Study Act have never been formally recommended by the Secretary of Agriculture for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System and no law has been signed by the President to designate these lands as wilderness,” the bill reads.
Opponents of the bill included Wild Montana, Montana Chapter of Back Country Hunters and Anglers, Trout Unlimited, and many individual residents. The Blackfeet Tribe, Fort Belknap Indian Community and the Chippewa Cree Tribe of Rocky Boy also opposed the resolution.
“We see this as a destructive attempt to undermine the hard work the localized community, including the Blackfeet Tribe, has done to protect these areas,” said Patrick Yawakie, who was representing multiple tribal communities.
Proponents for the bill included the Montana Stock Growers Association as well as several ranchers. 
“We are supporters of multiple use of public lands, and know that management of WSAs can curtail livestock grazing, something our organization cares deeply about,” said Ellie Brighton, who was representing the Montana Stock Growers Association. “Many existing WSAs did not have substantial support from livestock producers, and we support a collaborative approach.”
Opponents of the bill pointed to the slow pace of the federal government for not resolving the issue.
“The problem with creating lasting solutions for WSAs is not with the locally developed collaboratives or the balanced proposals that they’ve developed,” said Noah Marion, representing Wild Montana. “The problem is with Washington, D.C., and their inability to pass legislation in a timely manner. There have been many bills in DC to resolve the status of WSAs, including one in the late ‘80s that resolved many of them. That was pocket vetoed.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20211002_1646142-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-03-28 19:04:48.322770

Phil Murphy's energy agenda while Democrats pointed the finger at the state's grid operator. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers’ first hearing on soaring electricity prices oscillated between criticism of Gov. Phil Murphy’s energy agenda, condemnation of the state’s grid operator, and desperate calls for New Jersey to avoid shrinking its existing generation supply.
Throughout Friday’s nearly six-hour hearing of a joint committee that included members of the state Senate and Assembly, Republican members pressed officials on the impact of Murphy’s push to shift New Jersey’s electricity generation to renewable sources, arguing it is to blame for spiking electricity costs.
“I can’t help but get the impression today that we’re here because all of a sudden the rates went up and people are like, ‘Wow’ — you know, like it wasn’t foreseen or that it couldn’t have been predicted,” said Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris). “Many of my colleagues have been sounding the alarm on the governor’s misplaced energy master plan and the costs associated with it for five years.”
Witnesses and Democratic legislators put the blame elsewhere, citing market rules for the state’s grid operator, PJM Interconnection, that excluded some power plants from the supply sold in recent price-setting electricity auctions and other reforms that slowed the organization’s review of pending generation projects.
Utility customers will see their monthly electricity bills rise by roughly $25 beginning in June as a result of a February generation auction, which followed surging prices at a separate capacity auction held in October.
Democratic lawmakers in the Assembly have been particularly anxious about the planned increases, since all 80 seats in the body are up for grabs in this year’s elections (Democrats in that body hold a 52-28 majority).
“It’s not a secret that we at the BPU and in New Jersey and other states have felt that PJM has made decisions that lean toward fossil fuel generation and the states that have large-scale fossil fuel generation,” Christine Guhl-Sadovy, president of the Board of Public Utilities, told the committee.

Demand for power in New Jersey grew slowly for decades before surging in recent years as load forecasts — which predict how much power New Jersey and 12 other states on PJM’s grid will need in future years — began to account for artificial intelligence data centers proposed throughout PJM’s service area.
These data centers are incredibly power-hungry, though Asim Haque, a senior vice president at PJM, warned that officials are still trying to determine the overall scale of that demand. It isn’t always clear, he said, which data center proposals are authentic.
“The industry is legitimately struggling with what is real on these data centers. It is not an easy issue to unpack,” he said.
PJM operates the electric grid for a region that stretches from New Jersey down to North Carolina and from parts of Illinois over to Washington, D.C. It coordinates the movement of electricity from gas, coal, wind, and other generators and distributes it to the utilities serving the roughly 70 million people who live in its service area.
Beginning in 2019, Haque said, PJM’s interconnection queue — the list of new generators seeking to connect to its grid — saw changes. Where past projects were typically large, newer projects were smaller and more renewable, and their sheer number increased the interconnector’s backlog.
PJM is expected to finish transforming its interconnection queue early next year and anticipates wait times for projects will then fall to between one and two years. But it could still take years for new generation to come online even after the interconnector gives the green light.
Lawmakers of both parties — and Republicans in particular — have urged for a reversal of state policies that seek to increase generation from renewable sources and phase out fossil ones. But some witnesses said Friday that generation from some renewable sources like solar and battery storage would come online fastest.
Once they received interconnection approval, some battery projects have come online in less than two years, said Abe Silverman, assistant research scholar at John Hopkins University’s Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute.
A new gas plant would likely take between five and seven years to stand up, and because even small amounts of new generation can relieve demand pressures on electricity, additions of a few hundred or thousand megawatts can significantly reduce electricity costs for consumers.
“Even small amounts of new megawatts can really have an outsized impact on prices, and we should be scouring the couch cushions for anything we can deploy in the next 18 to 24 months,” Silverman said.
Natural gas should still play a role in New Jersey’s energy mix, witnesses said. Natural gas accounted for 49% of electricity generated in New Jersey in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while the state’s two nuclear plants accounted for 42% and renewables made up roughly 8%.
Interest in gas projects from investors and consumers — including data centers that are a major driver of increasing energy needs — has waned in recent years, Silverman said, and projects on PJM’s waitlist are increasingly renewable.
New Jersey Rate Counsel Brian Lipman added some proposed changes — like pending legislation that would require utilities to join a regional transmission organization like PJM to deny them additional profit for voluntarily joining one — could reduce how much New Jerseyans pay for electricity.
Greater oversight of organizations receiving ratepayer money, whether through subsidies funded on utility bills or groups like PJM, could also help control costs, he said.
“One the things I would strongly recommend is we require those taking ratepayer money to open up their books. Let the BPU and rate counsel see their books,” Lipman told the panel. “In fairness to utilities, they don’t get to spend a penny that I can’t look at and see what they spent it on, where they spent it.”
The impact of surging electricity prices could be keenly felt, Lipman said, especially as the seasons shift into sweltering summers or frigid winters.
“I am not being sensationalist when I say people will die,” Lipman said in written remarks prepared for the committee. “Heat-related deaths will increase as we make air conditioning more unaffordable. Likewise, we just completed a brutally cold winter. If heating becomes unaffordable, people will freeze.”
Assemblyman Wayne DeAngelo (D-Mercer), who chairs the Assembly’s utilities panel, said lawmakers would invite testimony from utilities at a future hearing.

The high-profile killing late last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has focused even more attention on so-called prior authorization, the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding. There had been protests and outrage over the company’s practices for months before Thompson’s death, and UnitedHealthcare has been accused in a class-action lawsuit of using AI to wrongfully deny claims.
As more patients and doctors voice their frustrations, states are responding with legislation designed to regulate prior authorization and claims reviews. So far this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states are considering measures that would, for example, limit the use of AI in reviewing claims; exclude certain prescription medications from prior authorization rules; ensure that emergency mental health care is not delayed for more than 48 hours; and require that insurers’ review boards include licensed physicians, dentists or pharmacists with clinical experience.
Insurers have long required doctors to obtain their approval before they’ll pay for certain drugs, treatments and procedures. They argue it is necessary to rein in health care costs and limit unnecessary services. But many doctors and patients say the practice has gotten out of hand, causing delays and denials of care that are harming and even killing people.
In a survey last year by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors said that insurers’ prior authorization practices delayed “necessary care” for their patients. Twenty-nine percent said such delays had led to a “serious adverse event,” such as hospitalization, permanent injury or death.
In 2023, insurers selling plans on the marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act denied a combined average of 20% of all claims. Of the 73 million in-network claims they denied, only 1% were appealed, according to KFF, a health policy research group.
 The federal role

Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice took a firmer hand against health care corporations alleged to be engaging in behavior resulting in limited and more expensive care for patients. The administration also approved rules requiring that beginning in 2026, Medicare and Medicaid plans create a streamlined electronic process for reviewing claims, making decisions more quickly and providing specific reasons for denying care.
But it’s difficult to hold insurers accountable, according to Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“Each part of the health care industry — hospitals, pharmaceuticals, insurers — they all have a lot of concentrated power,” McBride said in a phone interview. “And unless somebody actually takes it on directly, it’s going to stay that way. I think the Biden administration tried to take it on, but didn’t make a lot of progress.”
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration and Congress will reverse course. During his confirmation hearing on March 14, Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, defended the use of artificial intelligence in reviewing claims.
“AI can be used for good or for evil, and it to a large extent depends on who’s using it and for what purpose,” Oz told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. “I think AI could play a vital role in accelerating preauthorization.”
In the past, Trump has supported measures to help patients, such as increasing hospital price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices, McBride noted. But “Republicans and conservatives generally are anti-regulation,” he said. “My gut feeling would be that they back off on the Biden push on this.”
States have limited power to act on their own. They have authority only over state-regulated health plans, which include Medicaid, plans for state workers and policies residents purchase from the ACA marketplaces. About 90 million people are covered that way. State laws do not apply to the 156 million workers, retirees and dependents who get their coverage through employer-sponsored health plans, which are regulated through a federal law known as ERISA.
Furthermore, health insurance companies are large and have deep pockets, allowing them to easily absorb state fines.
But Kaye Pestaina, the director of the program on patient and consumer protection at KFF, said states have an important role to play.
“Much of the focus around prior authorization at the federal level has kind of originated from state protections, so I imagine there will be continual activity by state legislatures to come at the problem,” Pestaina told Stateline.
 What states are doing

Pestaina said states are trying a number of solutions. For example, states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have given their insurance regulators more authority to directly access claims denial information, in order to overturn decisions or potentially enforce state rules. And these efforts have largely had bipartisan support.
In Pennsylvania, Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill pushed through bipartisan legislation in 2022 to streamline prior authorization practices for state-regulated health plans after hearing numerous complaints from patients and doctors.
The legislation created an Independent External Review organization that allows Pennsylvanians to submit an online form to request a review if their insurer denies a service or treatment. If the review organization decides the service should be covered, the insurer must do so. Before then, patients could turn only to a federal review process, which may have been more challenging to navigate and taken more time.
“Our reforms created clear rules, clear timelines for the prior authorization process, and it removed ambiguity or uncertainty from the system that at times, insurers could exploit and providers could be confused over,” Phillips-Hill told Stateline. “Prior to that reform, if you had a denial from your insurer, you had very little recourse.”
The program began in January 2024, and in its first year the Pennsylvania Insurance Department overturned half of 517 denials, which amounted to claims from 259 people.
Jonathan Greer, president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said his trade group worked with lawmakers to come to an agreement on how to change the prior authorization process in a way that worked for insurers and patient advocates. Greer says he thinks Pennsylvania could be a model for other states.
“Prior authorization, I think unfairly, has been characterized as a reason to say ‘no’ by insurers,” Greer said. “The purpose of prior authorization is to make sure that you know the care that you get is consistent with the care that you need.”
In North Carolina, Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder is hopeful that his prior authorization bill will make it across the finish line this year. Reeder’s bill would set tight deadlines on insurers’ claim decisions and require companies to have licensed practitioners on their claim review boards. Insurers would also have to publicize a list of services they require authorization for.
“I’m not saying that we need to get rid of it completely,” Reeder told Stateline. “There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.”
But some state laws have proven to be less effective than advertised.
In 2021, Texas enacted a first-of-its-kind law creating a “gold card” standard, under which physicians whose care recommendations are approved by insurers at least 90% of the time are exempt from the prior authorization process. But as of the end of 2023, only 3% of Texas physicians had earned gold card status, according to the Texas Medical Association.
That’s why the group is pushing legislation that would require insurers to report which preauthorization exemptions they granted and denied and how many claims went to independent review. Dr. Zeke Silva of the Texas Medical Association’s legislative council said it would be “in the same spirit” as what Pennsylvania has done.
“Our focus with the [Texas Medical Association] is our physicians being able to provide the best care possible. And we want that to be free of burden,” Silva told Stateline. “We want to minimize third parties coming in and inappropriately denying care that our physicians and our patients think is in their best interest.”

Instead, the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission attempted to strike a balance, approving some of the company’s proposed changes to customers’ gas and electric bills, while significantly slashing its capital spending plan under a series of motions approved Friday afternoon.
The various changes to bills for both gas and electric customers take effect April 1.
Soaring utility bills brought a standing room-only crowd of residents, advocates and lawmakers to the commission’s Warwick offices earlier this month, with many urging the commission to reject rate increases and to offer more relief to vulnerable residents. But the regulatory panel is powerless to influence at least some of the components of customers’ bills, including the supply rate. State law prevents regulators from denying seasonal usage rates as long as they reflect the prices Rhode Island Energy pays to third-party suppliers.
Seasonal fluctuations in electric prices, dictated by regional demand and global conflict, have been particularly volatile in the last few years, peaking in the winter of 2022. But summer savings are again in store, with the price per kilowatt-hour set to drop nearly 39% over current winter rates. For the average residential customer using 500 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, this translates to a $31 monthly savings on supply-side charges.
However, lower supply charges will be partially offset by higher customer fees relating to transmission fees, renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, which are set based on federal and state laws. And, customers will pay more to support the company’s capital investments in the electric and gas infrastructure — though far less than what Rhode Island Energy wanted.
State regulators spent nearly all of the three-and-a-half hour hearing Friday picking apart the company’s fiscal 2026 gas and electric capital budgets, which pay for maintenance and repairs meant to ensure reliability and safety.
Chairman Ronald Gerwatowski criticized PPL Corp., Rhode Island Energy’s parent company, for substantially increasing yearly capital spending, far above the annual hikes proposed under former utility operator National Grid.
Indeed, the company’s proposed electric fiscal 2026 capital budget which starts April 1 is more than double what National Grid spent in fiscal 2022, the last year before the utility business was sold. And Rhode Island Energy’s proposed fiscal 2026 gas capital investments are $16 million more than what was spent under National Grid in fiscal 2022.
PPL in a call with its investors earlier this year said it hopes to invest more than $1.3 billion into Rhode Island’s electric grid over the next four years, and nearly as much on the natural gas side.
“While it is positive that PPL and RI Energy wish to invest in Rhode Island, there are significant rate implications in the future tied to these ambitious investment goals,” Gerwatowski said.

Flattening the pancake tower
He likened the various charges built into customers’ bills as individual pancakes, which must be considered not only on their own, but as a plate.
“It is the cumulative effect of the entire pancake tower that strains affordability,” he said. “Unfortunately, many of the pancake costs, we have no control over. But the company does have control over the pace of its investments.”
The proposed $247.9 million in electric investments includes $88 million in fiscal 2026 spending on “smart meters,” which was approved separately in 2023.The remaining $160 million would pay for repairs to electric poles and wires, substations, and tree-trimming, among other costs.
Commissioners shaved $29 million off the proposed electric budget, including $24 million from general “soft costs” associated with electric grid repairs, and $5 million from the budget for major projects. The final $131 million electric fiscal 2026 budget marks an 18% cut to what Rhode Island Energy proposed, excluding the fixed smart meter costs.
The proposed $223 million in fiscal 2026 gas capital spending rankled commissioners more.
“I almost fell out of my chair when I saw that number,” Gerwatowski said of the gas spending plan, noting that it was more than the $221 million in federal grants helping pay for the Washington Bridge rebuild.
Commissioner Abigail Anthony said the company’s witnesses failed to provide “compelling evidence” that the spending hikes were necessary, rather than discretionary. Especially as the state contemplates shifting away from reliance on natural gas to meet its decarbonization mandates.
The final $179.5 million gas capital budget authorized by commissioners marks a nearly 20% cut over what Rhode Island Energy proposed, with cuts scaling back the scope of gas main replacement to only those lines in immediate need of an upgrade.
The original fiscal 2026 electric capital spending plan would have translated to $1.01 average monthly increase for electric customers, while the $223 million gas capital budget was set to bring a $78.58 average annual increase for gas customers. Bill charges under the reduced spending plans approved by utility regulators Friday have not yet been calculated.
Greg Cornett, president of Rhode Island Energy, expressed disappointment in the cuts to capital budgets in an emailed response Friday.
“Our focus remains on delivering safe, reliable service and maintaining the strength of our energy infrastructure,” Cornett said. “While we are disappointed that the public utility commission has reduced our requested investments, which we developed in consultation with the Division of Public Utilities & Carriers, we will continue to remain focused on safety and reliability to meet the needs of our customers. Ongoing investment is essential as the energy landscape evolves, and we remain committed to working within the approved framework to maintain our infrastructure for the future.”
Customers in seven municipalities — Barrington, Central Falls, Narragansett, Newport, Portsmouth, Providence, and South Kingstown — can opt out of Rhode Island Energy electric prices and participate instead in a community aggregation plan that leverages bulk buying power to secure lower-priced electricity for residents. The default community summer electric rate of 10.014 cents per kilowatt-hour is 0.5% less than Rhode Island Energy’s base residential electricity supply rate. Community aggregation electric rates take effect May 1.
About 25% of the 780,000 Rhode Island Energy customers already opt out of the company’s default electric prices.

(File photos) The Republican judge who is seeking to throw out more than 60,000 votes in order to win a seat on the state Supreme Court dressed in a Confederate uniform while a member of a UNC-Chapel Hill fraternity, the Associated Press reported. 
Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin was a member of Kappa Alpha, a fraternity that claims Confederate General Robert E. Lee as its spiritual founder, the AP reported. The wire service obtained a photograph of Griffin posing with other fraternity members at its “Old South” ball in 2001 and a 2000 photograph of Griffin and other fraternity members in front of a Confederate flag. 
While Griffin told the AP that his attendance at the ball is not a reflection of who he is today, opponents of his efforts to throw out more than 60,000 votes in his Supreme Court race see a clear line between his past embrace of Confederate symbols and his voter challenges. Griffin is suing the state Board of Elections in an attempt to invalidate enough votes to unseat incumbent Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs. Riggs holds a 734-vote lead, which was affirmed in two recounts. Griffin claims the state elections board is counting illegal votes. 
In a statement to the AP, Griffin said his attendance at the “Old South” ball was inappropriate. 
“I attended a college fraternity event that, in hindsight, was inappropriate and does not reflect the person I am today,” Griffin said in his statement to the AP. “At that time, like many college students, I did not fully grasp such participation’s broader historical and social implications. Since then, I have grown, learned, and dedicated myself to values that promote unity, inclusivity, and respect for all people.”
Griffin was the fraternity chapter president in 2002. 
In a 1998 News & Observer “scholars of the week” feature, Griffin, then a high school student, named Robert E. Lee one of three people on his “ideal guest list.”
The state Republican Party is supporting Griffin’s lawsuit. The party’s spokesman, Matt Mercer, did not respond to an email seeking comment, though in an exchange of insults with former Joe Biden spokesman Andrew Bates on social media, Mercer referred to “visiting the wayback machine.”
The state Court of Appeals heard arguments in Griffin’s case last week. The three-judge panel did not indicate when they would issue an opinion. 
Opponents of Griffin’s attempt to erase more than 60,000 votes see a connection between his lawsuit and his past mimicry of Confederate traditions.

“These latest revelations about young Jefferson Griffin only reinforce the deeply problematic character flaws that we see in him now,” said Dawn Blagrove, executive director of the advocacy nonprofit Emancipate NC. 
“It appears even as a child and a young man, he cared nothing about the feelings or constitutional rights of his fellow Americans. He was not committed to inclusion. He was not committed to diversity, and he was not committed to seeing all sides of the situation and having empathy,” she said in an interview.  
“What we are seeing today about Jefferson Griffin from high school and from college has a straight line to the Jefferson Griffin that we see today who is challenging legal votes of 60,000 people,” she said. “And just like the Confederates lost the Civil War, Jefferson Griffin will lose this election.”
Rob Stephens, an organizer with the NC Poor People’s Campaign, said some would argue it doesn’t matter what someone did when he was 20. But here, “Griffin’s campaign is drenched in that same ideology and worldview,” Stephens said. “He’s living out this fantasy of plantation society where the elite are able to control the lives and the futures of everyone else in the racial caste system.”
Military and overseas absentee voters one of the categories of voters Griffin is challenging. But he’s only challenging those votes from a handful of heavily Democratic counties. 
“He wants to go where there are Black voters,” Stephens said. Anyone who denies it “is delusional or is lying to us or lying to themselves,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Griffin-and-NC_SupCourt-1024x596.jpg,,,2025-03-28 18:04:08.603765

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma lawmakers advanced bills expanding college scholarships, recess time and school tutoring while approving limits to virtual school days and diversity programs before a key legislative deadline this week.
Bills had to pass their chamber of origin by Thursday, needing approval of the full House or Senate to continue being considered this year.
A variety of legislation impacting schools and students survived the deadline, including measures that are top-of-mind for House and Senate leaders.
House votes to expand Oklahoma’s Promise, recess, school board powers
One of those priority bills is House Bill 1727 to extend the Oklahoma’s Promise college scholarship to children of classroom teachers who have worked in public schools for 10 years or more. The House sent the legislation from Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, to the Senate with a 71-20 vote.
HB 1491, another bill House leadership touted, also heads to the upper chamber after passing 80-16 on Wednesday.
The measure from Rep. Ronny Johns, R-Ada, would allow two members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education, and of any district school board with five or more members, to place an item on a meeting agenda by submitting a written request. On school boards with four or fewer positions, a single member could add an agenda item.
The bill emerged after recent appointees to the state Board of Education complained that only the board’s chairperson, the state superintendent, has authority over what items are discussed during meetings. 
Johns said he learned it’s been an issue “all the way back to Sandy Garrett,” referring to the former state superintendent who served from 1991 to 2011.

HB 1493, called the Growing Minds, Active Kids Act, is one of the few education bills from a Democrat to pass the full House. Lawmakers approved the legislation from Rep. Jacob Rosecrants, D-Norman, by a vote of 73-12.
Students in pre-K through fifth grade would be required to have 30 minutes of daily recess in addition to the 60 minutes of physical education a week that state law already requires in elementary schools. Current Oklahoma law strongly recommends 20 minutes of daily recess for elementary grade levels but doesn’t require it.
Rosecrants’ bill would strongly recommend 30 minutes of daily recess for grades 6-8.
District school boards could split the elementary and middle-school recess time into segments.  
“There is a prevailing feeling … that you’re really not learning unless you’re in the classroom, and I couldn’t push back more against that,” Rosecrants, a former teacher, said while discussing the bill on the House floor. “Real learning comes from doing. Real learning comes from being outside. That’s how I taught whenever I was in the schools, as well.”
Senate approves anti-DEI bill, online school day limits, tutoring funding
Senate lawmakers on Thursday agreed to codify Gov. Kevin Stitt’s executive order prohibiting state funds from supporting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at higher education institutions.
Questions and debate over the legislation, Senate Bill 796, consumed two hours. The bill’s author, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said equity programs have “the opposite effect of equality” because they raise “one group of people over another based on a perception of what we think historically has happened.”

“Nobody’s denying history,” Pugh said during the Senate debate. “This isn’t about history. This is about our future. And if we ever want to heal, the last thing we need to do is mandate that when someone shows up on campus, we tell them that it’s your fault. History is your fault, and we’re going to fix it for you by making outcomes more equitable.”
Stitt signed his executive order in December 2023 to outlaw college DEI programs, which cost 0.29% of all higher education spending in the state. Student-led programs were unaffected.
Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, said the executive order shut down the women-in-politics program that inspired her to run for office. The University of Oklahoma closed the National Education for Women’s Leadership program last year, citing a need to comply with Stitt’s order.
One of the Senate’s two Black members, Sen. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa, debated at length against the bill. She contended it ignores Oklahoma’s history of racial segregation that today makes DEI programs necessary.
“The discrimination continues to happen when you do not want to be diverse,” Goodwin said. “When you don’t want to be equitable, then you champion inequity. And when you don’t want to be inclusive, you want to be exclusive. It’s real simple.”
The measure passed along party lines 39-8.
Senators then took up SB 758, which would limit the use of virtual school days in Oklahoma.

The authors, Sen. Kristen Thompson, R-Edmond, and the Senate’s top lawmaker President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, amended their original legislation to change the criteria permitting online learning days for brick-and-mortar schools.
Schools could have up to two online learning days per academic year if the state superintendent approves a virtual instruction plan that the district and its school board submit.
A district’s virtual instruction plan must include how it would serve students with disabilities, provide school meals and transport students to CareerTech classes.
Schools also could rely on virtual days if the governor has issued a state of emergency and the district’s school board approves use of online instruction.
The bill passed 33-14.
“Senate Bill 758 provides the necessary guardrails to keep our schools focused on direct engagement between students and teachers while maintaining a degree of flexibility for truly exceptional circumstances,” Paxton said in a statement.
A bill funding high-dosage tutoring of math and reading passed unanimously through the Senate on Wednesday.
SB 245 from Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin, was inspired by a similar program state Superintendent Ryan Walters established through the Oklahoma State Department of Education.
Walters has said the vast majority of students who participated saw academic improvement.
The bill would offer tutors, who are either school employees or contractors, $1,600 total for each cohort of up to four students they meet with for at least three 30-minute tutoring sessions a week. The tutoring sessions would take place after school hours for at least 10 weeks in the fall semester and no less than 12 weeks in the spring. 
The tutors could earn another $1,000 for each academic grade level increase that each student improves in reading or math in one school year.
Students would have to be at least a half grade level behind in reading or math to participate. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee expects the program will cost $5 million, Deevers said.

Tony Evers vetoed a Republican bill that would have undone recent testing standards changes. Evers talks to reporters at a WisPolitics. Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Gov. Tony Evers vetoed a Republican bill Friday that would have undone recent changes to Wisconsin’s state testing standards — taking the state back to those used in 2019 and tying the standards to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).
Lawmakers introduced the bill after changes were approved by state Superintendent Jill Underly last year, who said the changes would better align tests with educational standards and were developed with the help of teachers and other stakeholders as a part of a standard process. However, lawmakers accused Underly of lowering standards for kids. Evers had criticized the process for the changes as well, saying that there should have been better communication between Underly and other stakeholders. 
Evers said in his veto message for AB 1 that while he has criticized the processes for the recent changes, he vetoed the bill because he objects to lawmakers “attempts to undermine the constitutional authority and independence of the state superintendent.” 
Evers noted that the state superintendent is responsible for supervising public schools under the Wisconsin State Constitution and the Legislature is overstepping, and lawmakers had opportunities to provide input to the review and revision. The bill, he said, would “essentially strip control over school scoring and standard metrics away” from the superintendent and give it to the Legislature.
Underly said in a statement that she commends the veto. She said the bill was “deeply flawed as it relied on the NAEP – a federal assessment that is currently being cut by the federal government and is not aligned to Wisconsin’s rigorous standards – to influence local school policies. Most importantly, it undermined the authority of the state superintendent as outlined in Wisconsin’s Constitution.” 
Lawmakers used the veto as an opportunity to criticize Evers and incumbent Superintendent Jill Underly — and to call on Wisconsinites to vote her out of office next week. Underly is running for her second term and faces education consultant and school choice advocate Brittany Kinser, who has cited the changes as a reason that she entered the race, on Tuesday. 
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu said in a statement that Evers “failed” students by vetoing the legislation. 
“In January, the governor slammed State Superintendent Underly for lowering standards, but when he had a chance to fix it he chose politics over students,” LeMahieu said. “If 2025 is going to be the ‘Year of the Kid,’ Wisconsin voters will have to make changes at the Department of Public Instruction.”
Kinser said in a statement that “the decision to restore high standards now rests in the hands of Wisconsin voters” and she would “restore high standards” if elected.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House voted overwhelmingly against a bill that would have changed which organizations could conduct charitable gambling.
The bill failed in the House on a 87-4 vote.
Senate Bill 2035 would have changed the definition of public spirited organizations and removed adult amateur athletic and tourism organizations from being able to conduct gambling. Those organizations would have still been able to be the recipients of donated gaming proceeds.
The bill would have also excluded clubs and organizations that contribute directly to its officers or members as a primary beneficiary.

An amended version of the bill would have allowed organizations that support a designated convention center or visitors bureau to continue to operate charitable gambling sites.
The House Education Committee voted unanimously, 13-0, for a do not pass recommendation.
“The committee urges you to vote no based on the lack of cooperation between all the parties involved in coming to some kind of agreement on this issue,” said Rep. Matt Heilman, R-Bismarck, on the House floor.
He said the last question the committee asked the Attorney General’s Office, the office that oversees charitable gambling, was whether the office coordinated on the proposed changes in the bill with the charitable gambling industry and the answer was: No.
“The charitable gaming industry is a massive industry in our state and a key component to many smaller communities,” Heilman said. “Potentially changing the definition in this bill, without all the stakeholders giving their input, would be unfair to the charitable gaming industry.”
He added another reason the committee voted against the bill was the lack of a grandfather clause that would have exempted current charitable gambling organizations.
The bill had passed the Senate in January on a 27-20 vote.

(Video capture courtesy of the Iowa Supreme Court)  An Iowa magistrate who questioned in court whether a defendant was a “wetback” is now facing potential sanctions from the Iowa Supreme Court.
In a harsh, almost brutal, verbal exchange with the Iowa justices on Thursday, Magistrate David J. Hanson said he had not realized the term “wetback” was offensive — a claim the chief justice immediately rejected — before pivoting to a critique of the U.S. Senate hearings, years ago, on the nominations of U.S. Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas.
The Iowa Judicial Qualifications Commission, which hears complaints about judges’ conduct, has recommended that the Iowa Supreme Court suspend Hanson, a part-time magistrate who is based in Fayette County and practiced law for more than 36 years. The recommendation is tied to comments made by Hanson in two separate criminal matters.
Hanson was appointed to the position of magistrate in January 2022. On Aug. 5, 2022, he refused to sign an arrest warrant for a 17-year-old girl in a sexual abuse case in which the alleged victim was a male. According to court records, Hanson reviewed the matter and, with regard to the alleged victim, stated in writing, “The boy will automatically think, ‘Alright! I’m gonna GET some!’”
In denying the warrant application, the commission alleges, Hanson turned to the internet to conduct his own form of “research” and found information that supported his view of the victim’s “innate physical advantage” to conclude that if the victim had wanted to, he could have overpowered the defendant.
The commission argues Hanson’s decision was based on “stereotypical views and observations as to how a male victim of sexual assault should react when allegedly assaulted by a female offender,” and that the order “is unfitting of a judicial officer because it expressed bias (and) included unnecessary and inappropriate commentary about parties.”
Hanson later described his refusal as a “ruling in anger over what I thought was a specious request for an arrest warrant, and I own up to that. If I make a decision and somebody don’t like it, well, I’m sorry.”
In July 2023, Hanson was presiding over a case in which an individual was charged with driving without a license or insurance. A law-student intern who was prosecuting the case later complained that during the proceedings Hanson asked, “Is this guy a wetback? An illegal?”
According to the commission, Hanson also asked whether the prosecutor was sure the defendant, who wasn’t present at the time, hadn’t stolen someone’s identification.
The intern later complained that Hanson’s conduct made her “extremely uncomfortable” and raised concerns that Hanson, due to his use of a “racist slur,” was biased. Hanson later said he didn’t recall the incident and told the commission it could “make whatever decision it wants to make, and I will roll with the punch and take whatever you give me … So just do what you think is right.”
The commission recommended the Iowa Supreme Court impose a 90-day suspension without pay and require Hanson to submit to educational training on anger management and bias.
Chief justice cites ‘damage’ to victims
At Thursday’s hearing before the Iowa Supreme Court, Hanson told the justices that with regard to the allegations made by the victim in the sexual abuse case, “I honestly thought, ‘This is a lie. It reads like bad pornography.’ I hate pornography. Pornography is lies … I still, to this day, am convinced that the arrest warrant request, the complaint, was resting on lies.”
Chief Justice Susan Christensen appeared to bristle at Hanson’s comment and questioned his equation of pornography with lies.

“Sir, are you aware that things that happen to people are pornographic in nature? And sometimes, in order for there to be an arrest warrant, someone might have to give details that are really ugly to give (and) heartbreaking to hear? Just because you’re giving the adjective ‘porn’ — what if those things actually happened to that person? Because it qualifies as porn in your mind and you hate porn, you think it’s a lie?”
“I seriously questioned it,” Hanson replied. “The other problem I had was the utter lack of interest, as far as I could tell, in the policeman attempting to corroborate what the young man said.”
Hanson then likened the decision he faced in that case with what he called the “travesty” of the testimony that was given during the U.S. Supreme Court nomination hearings for Justice Kavanaugh in 2018, and for Justice Thomas in 1991.
“Those were lies,” Hanson said, pounding the podium as he addressed the Iowa justices. “Televised lies! And I was appalled by that, and I thought, ‘I will not be an instrument of anyone seeking to destroy someone without any backing up of what (the alleged victim) said here.’ We’re talking about a couple of teenagers who I didn’t encounter and who apparently did some illegal things while they were in the process of it — because that’s what the fact pattern indicated — and I thought, ‘I just don’t see how this is, this is, happening.’”
Christensen appeared to express frustration with Hanson, suggesting he didn’t appear to recognize the issue wasn’t whether he had the right to deny the request for an arrest warrant.
“Do you understand the issue we’re dealing with is the light that you just put the entire Iowa Judicial Branch in?” Christensen asked. “And for you to say, ‘I didn’t say anything that was offensive’ — I am just going to pick one thing out (of the written warrant denial): that any self-respecting young male in this situation would leave the situation and that he probably thought, ‘Alright, I’m gonna get it.’ Now, I am speaking as a former juvenile judge. The amount of damage you did to any juvenile, and especially a male juvenile, to ever be brave enough to step forward say something happened — you may not have believed him. But the way you wrote it and denied it knocked him flat, no doubt. And anybody else who reads this now-public document, how can that not be offensive?”
“Well,” Hanson said, “all I can say is that when this was first run past the Judicial Qualifications Commission, they didn’t see fit to discipline me. I didn’t know what was right or wrong.”
Chief justice: ‘You really think we have to spoon-feed you…?’
As to the second matter involving the case in which Hanson used the term “wetback,” Christensen asked Hanson, “Do you think the term ‘wetback’ is offensive?”
“I’ve learned since using it that it is,” Hanson said. “I grew up in west side, working class Waterloo, and it was fairly common.”
Christensen cut Hanson off, shaking her head and telling him, “You definitely, that one, I am gonna call ‘foul’ on that, that you didn’t know it was offensive.”
Christensen also indicated that at some point during the disciplinary process Hanson appeared to have suggested that someone simply give him a “list of words” considered offensive so that he could avoid saying them in the future.
“Yeah, I think I said that,” Hanson told Christensen.
“You really think we have to spoon-feed you how to say appropriate things in your capacity as a judicial officer?” Christensen asked.
Hanson argued that if he was going to be held to a certain standard, “I need to know what the standard is,” adding that he is “perfectly prepared to meet that standard.”
Christensen then asked Hanson whether he’d ever read the Code of Judicial Conduct prior to beginning his work as a magistrate, indicating the code articulates the standards he must uphold.

Justice Christopher McDonald asked Hanson why, the sex-abuse case, he couldn’t have denied the request for a warrant by simply citing a lack of evidence as opposed to “going out of your way, in my view, to be offensive.” Hanson said he didn’t intend to be offensive and was simply trying to explain the rationale for his decision.
Hanson told the justices he is agreeable to taking whatever educational courses the court might prescribe for him but asked that he not be removed from the bench due to the heavy caseloads in Fayette County.
Christensen questioned that approach, noting that the magistrates who preside over the minor cases heard in associate court represent the only element of the Judicial Branch with which most Iowans will ever have contact.
“You’re suggesting that you continue to work before any of this sensitivity training?” she asked Hanson. “If we put you back out there to continue to preside over cases, knowing what you have put in writing, and knowing what you have done with this black robe that comes with such a responsibility and (knowing) what you have already shown us you’re capable of — how can we do that?”
“I suppose you could remove me entirely,” Hanson said.
Christensen said she was waiting to hear some indication from Hanson that he regretted his actions. In response, Hanson said was sorry “from the depths of my soul” that he had offended others.
Justice David May noted that judges and magistrates are required to ensure that all attorneys and court personnel, in addition to themselves, don’t use racial slurs in court. “I don’t know how to trust you with that responsibility,” May said.
“You are a judge in a robe sittin’ on a bench,” Christensen told Hanson. “I cannot fathom the amount of courage it took for that young law student to rat you out (on behalf of) that 15-year-old student — or, rather, that alleged victim — who was looking for an arrest warrant.”
The court has yet to rule on the commission’s recommendation of a 90-day suspension.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hanson.jpg,,,2025-03-28 18:04:08.603765

(Courtesy of Vizguerra family)Lawyers for Jeanette Vizguerra intend to amend her habeas corpus petition, alleging that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained her in retaliation for speech that’s protected under the First Amendment.
The amendment would set off new administrative deadlines and could delay the oral arguments in her case for up to a month.
Vizguerra, a nationally known immigration rights activist who lives in Denver, has been in ICE custody at an Aurora facility since March 17, when she was arrested outside her job at Target. Her attorney, Laura Lichter, said in federal court in Denver Friday that public statements and media reports since then make it seem like Vizguerra’s arrest and detention are in response to her activism and public criticism of the country’s immigration policies.

Lichter has until April 8 to amend the petition against Vizguerra’s detention to reflect the First Amendment claim. The government then has 21 days to respond.
A previous order from U.S. District Court Judge Nina Wang blocks attempts by the federal government to deport Vizguerra until oral arguments can be considered. Those arguments were originally set for Friday afternoon.
Vizguerra, 53, has lived in the United States since 1997 after her husband was threatened at gunpoint in Mexico, her home country. Her immigration case stems from a 2009 charge for having a false Social Security number. She was granted an offer of voluntary removal in 2011, left the country in 2012 and came back in 2013, when she was arrested for crossing the border without proper documentation.
She has since been granted several stays of removal, and she took sanctuary in two Denver churches during the first Trump administration to avoid deportation, which made her a high-profile figure in the immigration rights movement.
Federal prosecutors claim that a reinstated order of removal for Vizguerra from 2013 is valid and grounds for her deportation. Vizguerra has argued the order was not properly executed.

Olmscheid/ Senate Media Services.Minnesota Senate Democrats released two-year budget targets Friday that would enact nearly $2.5 billion in cuts over the next four years as the state faces a multi-billion dollar deficit unless lawmakers take action.
The Senate Democratic caucus’ targets say they would leave $2.4 billion on the bottom line over the next two years, and would avert a deficit in the following two-year cycle.
But there’s a major caveat: They don’t account for inflation, which is expected to drive up costs by around $1.1 billion in the upcoming budget, although some economists expect even faster inflation given the Trump administration’s tariffs.
That means cuts will be more widespread and deeper than reflected in the targets, as agencies will face rising costs without money appropriated to cover them. State workers — whose compensation typically comprises the bulk of many agency budgets — are sure to demand pay raises that keep up with inflation, for instance.
Budget targets are guidelines for legislative committees that determine how much money each committee has to spend or needs to cut for the 2026-2027 budget. Targets are subject to change, and often do, as lawmakers create their biennial budget in the remaining weeks of session. The Legislature must pass a budget by June 30, though the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn May 19.
Minnesota’s increasing costs are outpacing revenues and could cause a projected $6 billion budget deficit in fiscal years 2028-2029. 
Senate Democrats want to avoid the deficit by forcing agencies to eat the cost of inflation. That could lead to staff reductions, program cuts and other cost-saving measures.
The Senate Democrats’ budget targets cut spending on health and human services, environment, energy and transportation, while cutting education in the second biennium.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, said in an interview that the budget targets are based on the latest forecast and don’t take into account cuts at the federal level. Murphy said the state’s $3.2 billion in budget reserves will help Minnesotans fare whatever future federal cuts, freezes and uncertainties affect Minnesota.
“We’ve kept the budget reserve … intact so that we have some cushion and the ability to manage at least some of what we might get from the trifecta in Washington, D.C., that seems hell bent on making deep cuts that could hurt families, schools, communities and our health care system,” Murphy said.
Murphy didn’t offer specifics about how lawmakers will achieve the cuts included in the budget targets.
The Senate Taxes Committee, according to the targets, has a target cutting $365 million from their budget, i.e., by either raising taxes or cutting tax subsidies or Local Government Aid, which is in the Taxes Committee’s purview.
Gov. Tim Walz has proposed lowering the state’s sales tax from 6.875% to 6.8% — saving Minnesotans 75 cents for every $1,000 they spend on taxable goods.
Walz has also proposed taxing professional services that are currently exempt from sales tax, including legal, banking, brokerage and accounting services. Combined, the sales tax changes would generate around $185 million over the next two years.
Murphy would not say whether Walz’s sales tax proposals would be included in the Senate Taxes Committee’s budget target.
The biggest increases in the Senate DFL’s targets include $100 million for the Higher Education Committee and $106 million for the Judiciary and Public Safety Committee.
Murphy said that in higher education, lawmakers will earmark some funds to the Minnesota State Grant program — i.e., college financial aid — which is facing a $211 million budget shortfall.
For the Judiciary and Public Safety Committee, much of the money will go toward the courts and Department of Corrections, Murphy said.
The Minnesota House, which is tied 67-67 between Republicans and Democrats, will present joint budget targets early next week, a House DFL spokesperson said.
Republicans and Democrats had a long running debate about how to treat inflation in state budgets. For many years, Democrats sought to include inflation in the state’s projected costs as a more accurate depiction of the budget outlook.
Inflation is reflected in the rising cost of everything from construction to gasoline to fleet vehicles — and especially in areas where the government spends the most: health care and education, and especially wages. By not including inflationary costs, Democrats argued, the budget forecasts were giving the public a deceptive picture of the government’s ability to provide services.
So, in 2023, Democrats passed a bill to require inflation to be included in both sides of the ledger in the budget forecasts of Minnesota Management and Budget, which is the state’s budget agency.
“If we want to create an honest and responsible budget for Minnesota, we need an honest picture of our state’s finances,” said Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville, in 2023. “Just like a weather forecast, we want a budget forecast that has the most accurate information available to us, which will allow us as policymakers to make the most informed decisions possible with our budget. No business would make budget decisions based on budget projections that factor in inflation on the revenue side of their business, but not the expenditure side. Neither should state government.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/250210_AO_0070.jpg_1739384633-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 18:04:08.603765

J.B. Akers, R-Kanawha, said House Bill 3016, which limits what forms of photo ID are acceptable to use while voting at polling places, seeks to prevent voter fraud. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)At the urging of the Secretary of State, West Virginia could tighten laws on acceptable forms of photo identification that can be used at polling places.
The House of Delegates passed a Republican-sponsored measure, House Bill 3016, on Friday that would require a photo ID — typically a driver’s license, passport or a resident identification card — to vote in-person. It would eliminate several current options accepted at polling places that can validate identity, including a Medicaid card and utility bill.
“What this bill seeks to prevent is voter fraud of any kind to the extent that it’s able,” said Del. J.B. Akers, R-Kanawha, who said the Secretary of State’s office said people have voted illegally with a photo ID. “We did hear that,” he said. 
The measure, sponsored by Del. Erica Moore, R-Roane, passed the House with a vote of 84-8. It now goes to the Senate for consideration.
It’s one of several GOP-backed elections bills this session, some supported by Secretary of State Kris Warner, that Republicans say are in order to protect election integrity. House Democrats say conspiracy theories have driven the measures that could keep people from accessing the polls. 
West Virginia has abysmal voter turnout. Opponents of this legislation worry that it will make it difficult, particularly for older West Virginians and those who don’t drive or lack access to the internet, to vote in the state. 
“No evidence exists that a photo voter ID requirement would address any problem. Like non-citizens voting, voter impersonation is virtually nonexistent,” the West Virginia Citizens Action group said in a statement. 
Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, emphasized that the state already has voter ID laws. 
“We haven’t had any issues,” he said. “I think this is likely to disenfranchise some of our older members of our society, and for what? We’re preventing a problem that’s not taking place.”
Bill supporters said West Virginia voters will still have options for proving identification on election days, including a voter registration card with a photo that can be obtained free of charge from a county clerk’s office. A resident must request this option. 
“This bill clarifies that if you request a voter ID from the Secretary of State, it is free of charge,” Akers said.
Del. Gary Howell, R-Mineral, added, “There is no excuse not to have a photo voter registration card, which is a photo ID that can be used to vote, and it secures our election.” 
The measure permits voters 65 and older to use an expired ID, including an expired driver’s license, as long as it was valid on their 65th birthday. Additionally, poll workers may allow a voter, whom the poll worker has known for at least six months, to vote without presenting a valid ID.
Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia, said the bill would result in fewer legal West Virginians voting in-person on Election Day or during early in-person voting. 
“Now, the Republican supermajority is … turning their attention to in-person voting,” he said. “Fewer votes will be cast.”
“This is one of a series of bills that restricts West Virginians’ access to vote,” Hansen continued. “We should be passing bills that actually expand people’s right to the ballot and not restrict it.”
Akers said that if people can’t access a photo ID, they can vote using an absentee ballot without a photo ID.
“The ability to vote is not minimized at all,” he said. 
The House already passed House Bill 2117, which would prohibit people from mailing or handing out more than 10 absentee ballot applications to people who did not ask for them, including people who may hand out the applications in nursing homes. 
It would also change how the state handles absentee ballots, including setting a deadline of 7:30 p.m. on Election Day for absentee ballots to be received.

The federal government, under President Donald Trump, announced Tuesday it was revoking $11.4 billion of unspent, leftover, post-pandemic COVID-19 relief funding from state and local governments, $80 million of which is coming from New Hampshire.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” Andrew Nixon, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ director of communications, said in a statement. “HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”
Gov. Kelly Ayotte told WMUR and others Wednesday that she’s asked the Trump administration to reconsider the decision but was told it is irreversible. State officials believed they would have until the end of 2026 to spend the funding.
“As I understand it, at the federal level, they’re just saying these were pandemic funds and they were only meant to be temporary,” Ayotte, a Republican, said. “And the pandemic’s concluded and we’re gonna claw them back.”
This worsens what was already an extremely difficult budget year for New Hampshire. The state has dealt with years of lagging business tax revenues, is set to be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement money to victims of a yearslong child abuse scandal in its juvenile detention centers, and was already running out of pandemic-era federal funding. Amid these challenges, Ayotte unveiled her $16 billion two-year budget proposal in February. Since then, legislators have been proposing further cuts to that proposal after the House Ways and Means Committee decided her revenue projections were too optimistic by hundreds of millions of dollars.
This week’s cut from the federal government creates a new hole in the state budget that lawmakers will have to figure out how to address. Ayotte said she disagrees with the federal government’s decision to revoke this funding so abruptly.
“Of course I think it is much easier for states if resources have been appropriated for a period that at least we fulfill that period,” Ayotte said.
Effects felt in Tilton
On Friday, U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan met with leaders of community organizations from across the state in Tilton at Archways Community Resource Center to discuss how this will affect their programming, which also relies on the funding that was cut.
“This is about the administration taking away critical things from the American people who need them to give more tax cuts for billionaires who are already billionaires,” Hassan, a Democrat, said.
Archways, as well as several other organizations at the event Friday, were using the federal funding that was revoked to provide a number of services, including those aimed at treating substance use disorder as well as helping people get the Medicaid and SNAP benefits they qualify for.
“These are not just nice things you do for the community,” Michelle Lennon, president and CEO of Archways, said. “There’s evidence that it saves money and it saves lives.”
Lennon said a lot of people don’t realize how difficult it is for those who need welfare services to obtain those services. Her organization relies heavily on federal funding to help people receive their services.
“The assumption is that the resources are readily available, and I can tell you, 99% of the time, they are not,” Lennon said. “The assumption is that, ‘Oh, you can go to town welfare when you’re in trouble and you’re good.’ And it doesn’t work that way. It is so complicated. Rejections come fast and furious, sometimes to the point where we have to engage with legal aid to get people the help they are entitled to as American citizens.”
Among the specific programs being cut is the Health Disparities Grant, which funds employees at Archways who help impoverished people navigate the state’s health care system.
“We have to train our workers in terms of navigating that (system),” Mark Watman, vice president and COO of Archways, said. “These are people who are trained, and it’s still difficult. To have individuals out there trying to navigate this on their own, this is going to be disastrous.”
Watman said the programs that have been supported by this funding “help families survive.”
“The lack of these resources is going to have very practical implications on the health and survivability of New Hampshire families,” he said.
Several leaders of community organizations present Friday said these cuts will devastate their operations at the same time that need in their communities is rising.
“Now that they’ve done this, it’s like, ‘Oh my god, they can do anything to just wreck us overnight,’” Joelyn Drennan, assistant vice president of impact at Granite United Way, said. “And that is super concerning to me, because we are seeing the needs rise, and we’re having such a hard time keeping up with the capacity now.”
“It is one thing to plan for budget cuts in future budgets,” Hassan said. “We go through that at the state level, at the local level, at the federal level all the time. … This is different. This is the administration cutting already committed funds, laying off people in the middle of a budget, doing things that really are going to harm the people of this state and make our communities less able, less resilient to deal with the challenges that they’re facing.”
Hassan said she’s fighting back by spotlighting the importance of the services being cut in New Hampshire, and she’s trying to persuade her Republican colleagues to help the Democrats oppose these actions. She pointed out that they’d need only four Republicans in the Senate and a few more in the House to overcome the GOP majority. She wouldn’t say whether the onus is on Ayotte as a Republican to appeal to the Trump administration to stop this funding cut.
“This clawback of money, this taking away of money that was already promised to New Hampshire and that New Hampshire has already planned to use, will really harm families, people in mental health crisis, people with chronic illness, young children whose disabilities are just being identified and need that bit of extra help so that they won’t need special education later on,” she said. “Those are all services at risk.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/maggiehassan80million-1024x736.jpg,,,2025-03-28 18:04:08.603765

When a reporter with the Idaho Capital Sun asked House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, early Friday afternoon for his best guess when the legislative session will end, Moyle said he has no guess and it just depends.
“I would have liked to stay and finish Saturday – I’m not going to lie – push it through and be done,” Moyle told the Sun. “But now it makes it harder, because when you come (back in session) on Monday, they’re going to want to stay the whole week and I don’t want to stay the whole week.”
 Idaho Senate showing signs of disagreements on the floor 

Moyle said his hopes of working into the weekend were dashed when the Idaho Senate wrapped up its daily floor session before noon on Friday and Senate leaders announced their intention to adjourn until Monday while the Idaho House of Representatives was still in session.

Before adjourning for the weekend on Friday, the Idaho Senate showed signs of disagreement and dysfunction, including members of the Senate limiting debate, some senators refusing to answer each other’s questions and, finally, a freshman senator forcing a clerk to read a bill aloud on the floor. For nearly every single bill that comes before the Idaho Legislature, legislators almost always skip the formal full reading of a bill to save time.
“No, guess (when we will finish) because we could have been done today or tomorrow, so it just depends on what happens,” Moyle said.
Moyle said he expects the Idaho House to continue taking up budgets on Monday when legislators reconvene.
“We’ll wait for (the budgets to reach the floor) in here,” Moyle said. “They’ll have them ready for us by Monday, the staff will keep working (drafting the budget bills). They’ll be ready to go… It’s just, we gotta get them done, right? We gotta get them passed. If they don’t pass, some of them have to come back (and be reconsidered). Some of them don’t.”
Major budgets that could reach the floors next week include the colleges and university budgets that seek to reduce funding for Boise State University and the University of Idaho by $2 million each and the budget for Gov. Brad Little’s office. 
The Idaho Senate is scheduled to reconvene at 9:30 a.m. Monday, while the Idaho House of Representatives will reconvene at 10:30 a.m. Monday.
Monday will be the 85th day of the 2025 legislative session. There is no requirement to adjourn legislative sessions by a certain date. However, most sessions run for about 80 to 95 days. 
The 2024 legislative session lasted 94 days, and adjourned for the year April 10.
The 2021 legislative session, which was marked by an extended recess, was the longest in state history. It ran for 311 days and did not adjourn officially until Nov. 15 – just eight weeks before the start of the 2022 legislative session.

(C-SPAN screengrab)Nevada Republican National Committeewoman and former political candidate Sigal Chattah  has been nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as interim U.S. Attorney in Nevada, her office confirmed Friday.
The interim status will be removed if she is confirmed by the Senate.
In a post on X, Nevada Republican Party chairman Michael McDonald said Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi “have the warrior they need in Nevada. Sigal will rigorously advocate for the President’s priorities and investigate corruption throughout the Silver State.”
Chattah did not respond to phone calls or texts seeking comment on her nomination.  
“Sigal is a fierce defender of personal liberties, best known for her work reopening churches in Nevada after their unconstitutional shutdown,” the Nevada Republican Party said on X. 
During her unsuccessful run in 2022 for Nevada attorney general, Chattah declared her Democratic opponent, incumbent Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Black man, “should be hanging from a f–king crane”; longed for fewer “pronoun badges” and transgender individuals in America, while describing them with an offensive slur; and invited comparisons with Sen. Joe McCarthy and former Pres. Donald Trump by calling for the imprisonment of political foes. 
Chattah insists she never considered apologizing to Ford for what was widely viewed as a racist comment.  
“I think he’s a corrupt public official and I think he’s betrayed Nevadans. I’m not going to apologize for that,” she said. 
While campaigning in the AG race, Chattah told the Current that if elected, she’d be a bipartisan nightmare for anyone engaged in public corruption, adding she’d “absolutely” investigate Trump as well as Nevada’s fake electors. “I don’t care whether you have an ‘R’ or a ‘D’ by your name. If you’re in a criminal enterprise, public corruption, you’re getting investigated.”
As a candidate, Chattah pledged to “protect Nevadans’ lawful right to keep and bear arms” and “uphold the Constitutional rights to peaceable assembly and petition the government for a redress of grievances.”  
In an opinion column in January, Chattah blamed President Barack Obama for “gross abuses of the Patriot Act,” resulting in the proliferation of domestic terrorism rooted in Islam. “At best, this encore administration has four years to correct the course of the last 15 years of homegrown Islamic threats to America.”

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)NEWARK — An activist facing deportation after leading pro-Palestinian protests on Columbia University’s campus will remain in custody as a federal judge decides whether New Jersey’s federal court system is the proper venue for his case.
Judge Michael Farbiarz said after a Friday hearing that he would decide “as quickly” as he can on whether Mahmoud Khalil’s plea to be freed from detention should be heard in New Jersey or moved to Louisiana, where he’s currently being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Trump administration wants the case heard in Louisiana.
Attorneys for Khalil and the federal government appeared before Farbiarz Friday for nearly 90 minutes to argue over which court has jurisdiction over the case. Khalil’s wife, Noor, who is eight months pregnant, sat in the first row of the crowded courtroom that was filled with media, attorneys, and Khalil’s friends.
The judge’s decision on jurisdiction will come before any hearing on Khalil’s petition to be released from detention.
Khalil, a Syrian native, is a green card holder who has not been charged with a crime.
After immigration officers arrested Khalil in New York City March 8, he was transferred to the Elizabeth Detention Center in New Jersey. That’s where he filed his bid to be released — known as a writ of habeas corpus — with a federal court in Manhattan. Khalil was then taken to a detention center in Louisiana.
Last week, Judge Jesse Furman in the Southern District of New York said he doesn’t have jurisdiction over the case because Khalil filed his petition for release while he was in New Jersey, so Furman transferred the case here. The Trump administration opposed moving Khalil’s case to New Jersey.
Khalil has been held in Louisiana for roughly three weeks, and is set to appear before an immigration judge April 8.











































































































Bahar Azmy, one of Khalil’s lawyers, told Farbiarz that Khalil’s arrest is rooted in the government’s aim to “retaliate” against his free speech. Khalil was an outspoken leader of anti-Israel protests on Columbia’s campus last spring.
Azmy accused federal prosecutors of “forum shopping” to get the case before a more sympathetic judge. Azmy noted that Rumeysa Ozturk, a student at Tufts University who was taken into custody by immigration officials this week, was sent to a Louisiana detention center despite a court order barring the transfer.
A ruling in the government’s favor in Khalil’s case could have a “chilling” effect as more university students are picked up by immigration enforcement officials who would feel free to send them far from their families and legal teams, he said.
August Flentje, an attorney representing the Trump administration, noted that Khalil was only in New Jersey for “a few hours” before moving to Louisiana.
Flentje told the judge there is no intention to move Khalil again right now, and that it “made no good sense to transfer the case to this court, where Mr. Khalil is not detained.”
“Our view is, for jurisdictional certainty, this case belongs in Louisiana,” said Flentje, who declined to speak to reporters outside the courthouse.
The Trump administration has said that Khalil and other students involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests should have their visas or residency statuses revoked because they showed support for terrorist organization Hamas.
Azmy told reporters after the hearing that argument has “dangerous” implications.
“This is a case where the United States government has created a policy targeting Palestinian activists, and specifically for Mahmoud Khalil, for arrest, detention and potential removal because the United States government disagrees with his constitutionally protected right to dissent from U.S. foreign policy,” he said.
During the hearing, hundreds of protestors rallied outside the courthouse in support of Khalil, waving Palestine flags and holding signs reading, “ICE off our campuses” and “Release Mahmoud Khalil!”
Khalil’s legal team praised the judge for his “smart” questions and said they believe the ruling will be in their favor. One of his attorneys, Ramzi Kassem, said the goal is to get Khalil released in time to witness the birth of his first child.
“Every day matters, and that’s why we’re leaving no stone unturned,” he said. “We have a number of motions pending with the court, and we hope the court will agree with us on jurisdiction so that we can move forward on those motions.”

“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.
In the hours and weeks that followed, the federal government launched a series of investigations into Maine institutions. Below is a running list of the federal government’s actions against the state:

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

U.S. Department of Justice threatens to sue Maine


By: Maine Morning Star -  12:27 pm












In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Title IX investigation


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:25 pm












On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 18:04:08.603765

The most housing-related legislation in years was introduced in the recent 60-day session, but there is little to show for it, according to an advocate who paid close attention. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)At the beginning of the 60-day legislative session, housing advocate Winter Torres remembers feeling like the issue of housing affordability and homelessness had reached such a crescendo that lawmakers were jumping over each other to introduce bills.
By the session’s midpoint, housing advocates watching the session closely said they were tracking more than 60 bills, a huge increase over previous years. Lawmakers introduced nearly 200 bills mentioning the word “housing” this session. That’s the most since at least 2005. 
“There’s never been bills like this,” said Torres, who runs an eviction diversion program in Santa Fe and also tracks housing-related legislation on her website during the session. “People just came out of the woodwork with them.”
But now that the session is over, Torres said she can’t help but feel like the Legislature missed a chance to catch up to other states’ efforts to reform housing policies and address the crisis here before it gets worse. 
The state lacks more than 32,000 housing units, homelessness is on the rise and federal cuts threaten to deprive housing aid to thousands of New Mexicans.
“I feel disappointed,” she said. “Some of the other advocates may have a different view, but I feel like, you know, we had our shot.”
Legislative leaders have touted this year’s session as building on recent record investments in making housing more affordable and building more of it. Lawmakers last year appropriated nearly $200 million for various housing projects and programs. 
This year, lawmakers have earmarked at least $140 million for housing programs, including up to $80 million of that for Albuquerque and Bernalillo County.
Outside of the budget, both chambers of the Legislature also passed 21 bills mentioning “housing,” including Senate Bill 267, which caps late and application fees for renters, and House Bill 571, which creates incentives for municipalities that reform their zoning codes in ways that expands the construction of affordable housing.
Another bill creates a new governing subdivision to oversee the New Mexico State Fair grounds and empowers it to study the feasibility of building new housing there. 
Torres said she doesn’t want to minimize those significant bills, but the way other bills were moving early on in the session made their eventual deaths more frustrating. For example, a House bill that would have prohibited landlords from turning away tenants who carry Section 8 vouchers failed early in committees in at least the last two previous sessions, but this year made it all the way to its final Senate committee, Senate Judiciary, where it never received a hearing. 
Other House bills she tracked also died in Senate Judiciary, their final hurdle before the Senate floor, including ones that would have expunged old eviction records or given mobile home park tenants a chance to buy their park if it goes up for sale. 
New Mexico governor once again tries to create Office of Housing

“Fundamentally, I think the way we do sessions is an extremely irresponsible way to make law, when we are so far behind the rest of the nation on so many things, and the rest of the world just keeps speeding up,” she said. “We’ll never catch up.”
Rep. Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho) sponsored several housing bills and joined a working group with other lawmakers to discuss and propose housing-related legislation. She said the Legislature was abuzz with housing-related energy at the beginning and is proud to have supported another year of significant investments in housing and homelessness. 
Still, Cates also said significant legislation she supported languished without hearings, primarily in Senate Judiciary
“That’s where everything dies, Senate Judiciary,” she said. “It’s ridiculous.”
Sen. Joseph Cervantes, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, did not respond to a request for comment on Friday afternoon from Source New Mexico.
Other prominent housing-related bills that died this session include one that would have created a new  Office of Housing, Planning and Production in the executive branch. Advocates say the office is necessary to collect better data and coordinate various government agencies into a unified statewide strategy. That bill also made it to its final committee hurdle, Senate Finance, without being heard.
“Our priority bill SB205…had amazing support, compelling testimony, and endorsements from diverse organizations around the state. We won bipartisan support in four committee hearings and passed the House 49-17,” Daniel Werwath, housing policy adviser to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, wrote in an email to supporters on the last day of the session. “Sadly, in the last few days of the session, the Senate Finance Committee chose not to hear our bill and denied us a vote on the Senate floor.”
Werwath declined an interview request with Source New Mexico until after the governor decides which bills to sign, but his same email pointed to the money in the budget for housing and also HB571 as reason to call the session a success. 
“While we failed to win statutory authority for the Office, this doesn’t change our work,” Werwath wrote. “With record funding and mandates to work on statewide housing regulatory frameworks through HB571 …we will continue to work to ensure that state investments in housing are delivered quickly, efficiently and with a focus on innovation and outcomes.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_9539-1024x964.jpg,,,2025-03-28 18:04:08.603765

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — On the last day of the legislative session, the League of Women Voters of Kentucky renewed its calls for more transparency in how the General Assembly makes laws and sets policies.
Gathered in the Capitol Rotunda Friday, speakers highlighted the “Democracy Principle,” or the idea that citizens have a right to be involved in the legislative process and have their voices heard and considered. Citizens are being shut out of the process, the League contends, because the General Assembly uses fast-track maneuvers to speed bills into law, often counter to its own rules, and with little public notice or participation.
  The League of Women Voters of Kentucky highlighted the Democracy Principle during a Capitol rally. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)
The Kentucky chapter of the national organization has been tracking what it says are legislative maneuvers that undermine democracy and in 2023 issued a report,“How Can They Do That? Transparency and Citizen Participation in Kentucky’s Legislative Process.” It analyzed seven 60-day legislative sessions between 1998 and 2022 and found many instances when  the General Assembly did not follow its established process to give Kentuckians time to review and comment on proposed legislation. 
Ahead of the 2025 session, the League updated its report and found Kentuckians are still regularly shut out of legislative decisions that affect them. 
On Friday, the League pointed to six bills in the 2025 session as examples of fast-tracking, including House Bill 4, which eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion at Kentucky’s public universities.  The League also pointed to  Senate Bill 202, which began as a short, insignificant “shell bill” and quickly changed to ban the sale of hemp-derived beverages in the state until summer of 2026. The bill then was changed into its final form which places a 5 milligram limit on “intoxicating adult-use cannabinoids” in a 12 ounce beverage. 
Some of the “fast-track maneuvers” used to move legislation, the League said, included giving bills floor readings before they were heard in committee, introducing a committee substitute at the last minute, having an irregularly scheduled committee hearing, and giving a bill a floor vote the same day it was heard in  committee.
Ridhi Penmecha, a high school student and member of the Kentucky Student Voice Team (KSVT), said during the Friday rally that students advocating in Frankfort have encountered obstacles that make it “nearly impossible” for them to engage in the legislative process, despite their eagerness to be heard. Shortly after this legislative session began, KSVT filed a lawsuit alleging the state and General Assembly “have failed to maintain the level of commitment to education required” by Kentucky’s Constitution and past court decisions. 
“We’re not just being excluded from the present, but we are being cut out of shaping the future,” she said.

In her closing thoughts Friday, Becky Jones, the LWVKY’s first vice president, responded to a comment Republican Senate President Robert Stivers made Thursday on the Senate floor. He said if people “want to change the policy in this state, then they will change the makeup of this body.” 
“On that we agree,” Jones told the crowd, who then applauded. 
In recent months, the League has faced gripes from Kentucky Republicans who question whether it  is truly nonpartisan and who say the group is made up  largely of liberal Democrats.  The GOP holds a veto-proof supermajority in the House and Senate. 
When asked if she’s concerned the conversation about legislative transparency is becoming hyper-partisan, Jones told reporters “it could” and said that would be “an unfortunate circumstance.” She emphasized that the League does not endorse political parties or candidates. 
“It’s unfortunate when being political gets misconstrued with being partisan,” Jones said. “There is nothing partisan about protecting the process. That is political, just like fighting for the right to vote was a very political action, and that’s the foundation that we stand on.” 
The national League of Women Voters was founded after the 19th Amendment was ratified to help women navigate their new access to the ballot. 
In a Thursday press conference, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear echoed complaints by Democratic lawmakers about a lack of transparency in how Republican leaders moved legislation in this session.  Republicans have rebuked the notion, saying that time is limited in  a short 30-day legislative session, such as the one that adjourned sine die on Friday.

Statistics from these centers, which aim to deter pregnant women from having an abortion, come as some legislators question how the centers have spent millions in state dollars funneled to them in the last three state budgets.

Due to lax reporting requirements for these and other non-profit recipients of state dollars, the only information made available previously is that the money paid for “provision of pregnancy related care and resources,” as written on a form provided to the state’s Medicaid agency.
Now, in addition to $8 million in the last three budgets and $2.4 million proposed in the coming budget year, legislators are considering state income tax breaks for South Carolinians who make donations to these centers.
Speaking in favor of the tax credits that could encourage more private donations, as well as state budget funding, Kathryn Wade, chairwoman of the association that represents 18 such centers around the state, said the association divided past dollars among 15 of its member centers.
The statistics on services Wade provided are from 2022, before the centers received state money and before the Legislature enacted the state’s so-called “fetal heartbeat” law that essentially bans abortions six weeks into a pregnancy, though that timeline is the subject of a legal challenge before the state Supreme Court.
How SC Supreme Court defines ‘fetal heartbeat’ could reset abortion ban at 9 weeks

“We’ve only increased in our ability to provide these services,” Wade told a Senate panel last week.
Wade went on to say that when the centers received the state funds, legislators and state agency personnel gave little guidance on how the centers could spend it.
“The first year was probably the most difficult because we were scared to spend it on anything,” Wade said.
Her comments to senators came the day after Rep. Heather Bauer criticized the meager information provided in state-mandated reports.
“It’s very vague at best. I think we deserve to know what they’re using their money on,” the Columbia Democrat said. “How many people have they helped? What kind of resources and programing are they giving these people? And I’d like to see evidence of what outcomes they have for pregnant women in our state.”
Bauer gave the example of a travel van, owned by non-profit A Moment of Hope, which parks in the parking lot of Columbia’s Planned Parenthood clinic and seeks to divert and dissuade women from entering the clinic.
  Rep. Heather Bauer, D-Columbia, pictured in the South Carolina House chamber on Dec. 4, 2024 (Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)
But according to A Moment of Hope director Mark Baumgartner, his organization is not a member of the pregnancy center association, and therefore not a recipient of state funding.
But he told legislators the tax credits under consideration would be beneficial to his group, which he said has worked with nearly 400 pregnant women since its foundation in 2012. That includes the ultrasound van, as well as church-based teams who, for a year during a woman’s pregnancy, drive her to doctors’ appointments, throw her a baby shower, do weekly check-ins and invite her to prayer groups and church functions.
When it comes to the pregnancy center association, Wade said the group has “reported what we were instructed to report.”
The association also hired an executive director to oversee where the money is going and an attorney who drew up a contract with member centers saying they would not spend the funds on executive salaries.
In addition to testing and ultrasounds, Wade said the centers offer parenting and prenatal classes, which she valued at $2.6 million annually. The centers also hand out donated diapers, cribs and clothing.
A dozen of the centers, Wade said, are staffed by registered nurses, physicians assistants or nursing assistants. The state funding, she said, has prompted more centers to consider adding ultrasounds to their list of services, as well as researching the potential for opening more centers in rural areas.
“Ultrasounds and pregnancy tests do not equate to medical help,” Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Vicki Ringer told legislators in opposing the tax credits. “We have got to provide better health care for women who are pregnant and for the babies than they have.”
And when it comes to state income taxes, the only credits currently given for charitable contributions are related to donations of venison to food pantries and monetary donations to a fund for education of special needs children.
The bill, which the full Senate Finance Committee advanced Tuesday to the Senate floor, would add pregnancy centers, maternity homes, foster care and adoption charities and organizations that aid victims of human trafficking to that short list.
The state’s fiscal analysts estimate the tax credit could reduce state revenues by $10 million annually. That estimate only accounts for donations to crisis pregnancy care centers and adoption and foster care charities.
Planned Parenthood provides ultrasounds, pregnancy tests, and STD testing, as well as birth control, cancer screenings and vaccines. But because it also provides abortions, donations to the organization are ineligible for tax deductions.
“There are 33,000 nonprofits in South Carolina and we’ve cherrypicked one group to give contributions to,” said Ringer, who was spokeswoman for the state’s tax collection agency before joining Planned Parenthood.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1132562606-scaled-1-1024x724.jpg,,,2025-03-28 17:05:01.568880

(Photo by Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.

The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

	Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.




All of data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being.

Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”

A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”

	There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Senate gave preliminary approval Friday to a bill intended to codify in Colorado certain anti-discrimination provisions of the federal Voting Rights Act. 
Senate Bill 25-1 would mirror the VRA to “prohibit election practices that create disparities in participation for communities of color and other protected groups,” Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat, said. The Colorado Voting Rights Act also includes protections for LGBTQ+ voters, expands multilingual ballot access, and requires accommodations for people with disabilities at residential facilities. The attorney general’s office will be able to enforce the act so Colorado voters don’t need to depend on the federal government to enforce the VRA.

Gonzales sponsored the bill in the Senate, where it will need to pass one more vote before it goes to the Colorado House of Representatives for further debate. House sponsors are Assistant Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat, and Rep. Junie Joseph, a Boulder Democrat. Democrats hold strong majorities in both chambers.
Gonzales introduced several clarifying amendments, one of which says that if a voter files a complaint about a violation in a county other than the one where they reside, the Denver District Court would adjudicate the matter. 
Over an hour of debate was spent on Republican amendments to the bill to require the secretary of state to notify county clerks, the governor and the attorney general of any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive election information, such as voting machine passwords. 
Before the 2024 election, a worksheet containing election equipment passwords was inadvertently posted to the Colorado secretary of state’s website. While county clerks said that election security in the state remained strong following the breach, many were upset that Griswold did not inform them about the breach until after the Colorado Republican Party learned about and announced it.
The Senate adopted a version of the amendment that requires written notification within seven days of discovery of any such breach, after a proposal to require immediate notification was withdrawn. If a breach occurs within three weeks of an election, the secretary of state must send notice within 48 hours. 
Another amendment the Senate approved, introduced by Minority Leader Paul Lundeen of Monument, requires a process to ensure voters who cannot vote in person in primary elections — such as military personnel who are overseas — can still participate. Gonzales supported the amendment.

Getty imageA proposal to protect access to in-vitro fertilization has been sent to the governor as Georgia lawmakers are proposing a similar measure to protect the right to contraception.
Bipartisan calls to shore up access to IVF began in the wake of an Alabama Supreme Court ruling last year that declared frozen embryos children. The ruling temporarily closed clinics there and created uncertainty nationally.
Georgia’s bill, House Bill 428, glided through the Legislature thanks to support from the state’s most powerful Republicans, including House Speaker Jon Burns, who made the bill one of his priorities for the year.

“We’re one step closer to codifying access to IVF and ensuring that every family in our state facing infertility will never have a question about their access to this life-changing treatment,” Burns told reporters Friday.
The House finalized the bill Friday after the Senate tweaked it this week. Both chambers overwhelmingly passed the measure, and Gov. Brian Kemp has said he supports adding protection for the fertilization treatment.
The bill, sponsored by Statesboro Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, defines IVF in state code and says a person cannot be prevented from obtaining the treatment.
Franklin has openly shared his personal story as he has shepherded the bill through the legislative process. He and his wife Lorie struggled to build their family but are now expecting their first child because of IVF.
The bill’s final passage also happened days after House lawmakers held a more than two-hour hearing on House Bill 441, which would expand Georgia’s law to completely ban abortion and charge people with murder for terminating a pregnancy.
Several doctors who spoke at the hearing warned lawmakers that the proposal would end IVF treatment in Georgia. 
When asked about the hearing and that bill’s prospects Friday, Burns told reporters that there’s “nothing that we can’t talk about in the House.” 
“We’ll continue conversations about a wide range of subjects over the remainder of this session and the years to come,” Burns said. “Like all Georgians and like all individuals, we don’t necessarily agree 100% on everything, but I think we’ve worked towards a common good and a common goal, and that’s to make sure we ensure and protect life in Georgia.” 
New proposal would protect access to contraception
A new House bill filed this week mirrors the IVF bill and extends protections to contraception.  
Rep. Sharon Cooper, a Marietta Republican who chairs the House Public and Community Health Committee, said Friday that she filed House Bill 872 because she thought contraception was being left out of the broader conversation about reproductive rights. She said she sees it as a proactive measure.
Contraceptives are commonly used by girls and women throughout their lifetime and for a range of purposes, whether it’s for acne, managing pain, spacing out pregnancies or other reasons.
“They play a major role in a woman’s life,” Cooper said.
Cooper’s bill was filed Thursday with more than a dozen signatures of Republican women lawmakers, including Speaker Pro Tem Jan Jones. With the last day of the 2025 legislative session set for next Friday, rushing it through this year would be a tall order, but it will remain in play for next year. 
Jones, a Milton Republican, said the bill is more about addressing the perception that access to contraception could be in jeopardy.
“This certainly makes it clear that contraception is not up for grabs,” Jones said. “It’s very important to women all over Georgia, and we stand with them, and we are making it clear, whether it passes this year or next year, that the right to contraception is protected and honored in Georgia.” 
Democratic lawmakers and advocates began raising alarm bells about access to contraception after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. 
At the time, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion that the justices should reconsider all the precedents that rely on the substantive due process legal reasoning that kept abortion legal nationwide for nearly half a century. He specifically cited the 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut ruling that recognized married couples’ right to use contraception.
In Georgia, Democrats filed bills last year attempting to protect access to contraception and IVF in the wake of the Alabama ruling.

U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta, an Obama appointee in the District of Columbia, found unlawful a 73-million acre offshore oil and gas lease sale, one of the largest in history, that the Interior Department held in March 2023. Oil and gas leases are contracts in which private companies rent tracts of federal land or water from the government usually for the purposes of drilling or extracting raw materials.
The court ruled in favor of groups that had sued the Interior Department, finding that the agency failed to adequately consider the potential harms of climate changing emissions from fossil fuel production arising out of the lease as well as the impact to the nearly-extinct Rice’s whale, which lives exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico. The most recent scientific survey in 2017-18 estimated that only about 50 of the endangered whales are still alive, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Gulf energy industry could face challenges with some of Trump’s promises

The judge ordered additional briefing from the parties regarding what remedies the court should impose.
The Interior Department, through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management under the Biden administration, had previously canceled the lease sale nearly three years ago. However, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia, inserted a provision into the Inflation Reduction Act that forced the Interior Department to resurrect the sales along with two others that were similarly canceled. Separate litigation remains ongoing to decide the fate of the two other sales, one in the Gulf of Mexico and the other in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).
The next Gulf oil and gas lease is scheduled for auction in 2025, and two others are proposed to take place over the next five years. After leases are sold, it typically takes many years before platforms and other infrastructure are built and drilling begins. 
For various reasons, some companies purchase leases and don’t use them at all. Hundreds of oil and gas leases currently sit idle as fuel prices have been relatively stable for several years on the global energy market. The last oil and gas lease auction in ANWR this year drew no bids.

The lawsuit accuses longtime Billings Police Chief Rich St. John, both in his personal and professional capacity, of robbing Anderson Towing Company of due process, and helping former District Court Judge Russ Fagg in a vendetta against the company, which recorded several interactions and has presented them as exhibits.
Fagg, an institution in Billings along with his family, is at the heart of the lawsuit, having had a Mercedes sedan registered to his father towed after a traffic accident.
That led to a profanity-dotted encounter with several employees of Anderson Towing, allegations of price gouging, and “playing the judge card.” According to the lawsuit, that situation has led the state’s largest police department to ban a company from ever working for the city again.
A former police officer has also filed depositions in the case alleging Fagg and high-ranking members of the approximately 150-person department are close friends, going on annual horseback riding trips, and that Fagg has used those connections to conspire against the company, based on the premise that towing company was price gouging, something the company denies in the lawsuit.
The current controversy began on Feb. 8, but some of the allegations stretch back into November 2024, when the city suspended the towing company for two weeks.
Anderson Towing received a call from the Billings Police Department in the middle of the day for a traffic accident at the intersection of 6th Avenue North and North 27th Street in Billings, and the pictures show a Mercedes sedan and a good amount of snow. The company towed the vehicle, and two days later Fagg came to retrieve the car on Feb. 11.
That led to a dispute that started when the company informed the former judge that it only accepted cash or a cashier’s check, and he insisted on paying by credit card or personal check.
“That’s the kind of bullshit that you didn’t tell me a half-hour ago,” Fagg said.
“Sir, I didn’t speak to you, so please don’t cuss at me,” an employee told him.

The general manager shortly intervened and told Fagg the company’s policy was a result of “being burned too many times.”
During the conversation, the towing company officials also told Fagg the vehicle’s registration was expired and that the car was registered to someone else, later identified as Fagg’s father, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court. The towing company said it couldn’t release the vehicle without the proper paperwork to prevent vehicle theft or releasing a vehicle to the wrong person.
The towing company said it could retrieve an updated registration from the Montana Motor Vehicle Department, but would carry an additional $100 fee. Fagg then insisted on speaking with the towing company’s owner, according to the lawsuit, and made the following statement: “I hate to play this card — I was a district court judge for 22 years. I’m a lawyer in this town. There’s no damn way I am going to skip out on this bill.”
Eventually, Fagg paid the bill for $1,737.47.
The next day, Fagg, a former state legislator and unsuccessful candidate for federal office, filed a formal complaint against the company with the Montana Office of Consumer Protection in Helena.
“Judge Fagg’s complaint did not mention his credit card and personal check being rejected. Instead, he solely complained about the charges,” the lawsuit said.
The day after, Fagg wrote the City of Billings Police Department on his law firm’s letterhead, requesting Anderson Towing be removed permanently from the Billings Police Department’s towing rotation list. In the letter, he referenced conversations he had with Assistant Police Chief Shawn Mayo, and also his status as a “22-year state judge.”
On Feb. 14, the general manager of Anderson Towing reviewed the bill and agreed to refund $500 as a traffic control fee that was not necessary during the work on the accident. However, when he offered to refund the money, Fagg refused.
On Feb. 25, St. John notified Anderson Towing it had been permanently removed from the towing rotation, due in part to the complaints.
The lawsuit said that the chief of police has violated the company’s due process rights and state law, and seeks compensatory damages, reinstatement, attorney’s fees and possible punitive fees for depriving the company of its constitutional rights.
  Bad blood in the world of towing 

According to state law and the lawsuit filed on Thursday in federal court in Billings, the state mandates qualified towing companies formally ask (in writing) to be placed on a city, county or state towing list and must be placed on an equitable rotation. Those companies are overseen by a state board, the Tow Truck Complaint Resolution Committee.
In November, Anderson Towing was the subject of a complaint involving work the company had done in Gallatin County. In that decision heard by the resolution committee, it gave the state, county or local companies permission to suspend Anderson Towing for as long as six months due to the committee’s decision that it had engaged in price gouging. Anderson Towing says in the lawsuit and told the committee it disputes that finding . The lawsuit claims the committee sanctioned Anderson Towing, in part because Joanne Blyton, the manager and owner of Billings Towing and Recovery, was a competitor of Anderson and a comparable towing bill from her company was higher than the bill at issue for Anderson.
Nonetheless, a decision or sanction from the committee allows cities, counties and the state to sanction the company, although it doesn’t mandate any entity to necessarily enforce the sanction. It is a discretionary punishment. Still, the City of Billings Police Department suspended the towing company from its rotation from Nov. 1 through Nov. 14 for the sanction, but then reinstated the company.
  Permanently suspended 

In a four-page letter to Anderson Towing after the incident with Fagg, St. John said the company would be permanently removed from the list and city officials were not going to reconsider the decision. However, the company said it was already sanctioned for the previous incident, and was back to working for the city.
St. John told the Daily Montanan on Friday he had not seen the court filing, but that Anderson Towing was removed because of both formal and informal complaints.
“In general Anderson Towing was removed from the BPD wrecker rotation list for similar complaints referenced by the MHP,” St. John said via email.
The letter from St. John, sent certified mail to Anderson Towing and submitted as an exhibit to the federal court, said the city had completed an investigation of the company on its own.
“The City of Billings cannot allow Anderson Towing to unnecessarily and unreasonably charge Billings citizens for tow services,” the letter said.
Using the decision by the towing committee and the complaint by Fagg, St. John said the City of Billings sought the input of “two other tow truck operators” to come to its conclusions.
“This decision is permanent and will not be reconsidered,” St. John said, claiming the company had engaged in “willful and consistent failure by Anderson Towing to treat Billings citizens in a fair and equitable manner consistent with recognized tow truck standards.”
The lawsuit claims a city cannot decide to remove the company and sanction it without due process and without going through the state committee, set up to work through complaints and avoid favoritism.

The money involved is Wisconsin’s share of $12 billion to combat infectious disease and other serious health problems that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has summarily cut off, NBC News and the New York Times reported this week.
In Wisconsin, the funds were to be used for suicide prevention; substance abuse prevention; public health departments, programs and laboratories, including EMS services; and the Wisconsin Immunization Registry, the office of Gov. Tony Evers said Friday.
The governor’s office discussed the health funds cutback along with  other programs targeted for reductions or considered vulnerable under the Trump administration, including education funding, farm programs and in the Department of Veterans Affairs. On Thursday, the Trump administration announced it will cut 10,000 employees from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
“Reckless cuts by President Trump and Elon Musk to help pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires are causing devastating consequences for Wisconsin’s kids, families, and communities and services they depend on every day,” Evers said in a statement released Friday.
“With threats to Medicaid and Medicare, cuts to researching cures for Alzheimer’s disease and cancer, efforts to undermine food and drug safety, and continued attacks on the Affordable Care Act, the Trump Administration is jeopardizing health and access to health care in Wisconsin and across our country,” Evers said.
State Rep. Greta Neubauer (D-Racine), the Assembly minority leader, said Friday that the cuts “will be devastating for Wisconsinites who rely on these essential programs.”
“President Trump and Elon Musk are selling out Wisconsin families and communities, threatening our health and safety just to pay for unnecessary tax cuts for their billionaire friends,” said state Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison), the ranking Democrat on the Assembly Health, Aging and Long-Term Care Committee and chair of the Assembly’s Democratic caucus.
“This reckless move by the Trump Administration, coupled with cuts to vital medical research and threats to the future of Medicaid and Medicare, will have a devastating impact on the health of our state,” Subeck said.
Evers said his administration will explore “every legal option available to us” to fight the cuts.
The $12 billion that HHS cut this week was authorized by Congress through COVID-19 relief bills enacted in the first two years of the pandemic. The funds were later allowed for public health needs outside the pandemic, the New York Times reported this week.
The World Health Organization reports that “COVID-19 continues to circulate widely . . . presenting significant challenges to health systems worldwide. Tens of thousands of people are infected or re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 each week.”
The UN-affiliated public health agency emphasizes continued surveillance of the viral pandemic. “It is vital that countries sustain the public health response to COVID-19 amid ongoing illness and death and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, adapting it to the requirements based on the current COVID-19 situation and risk,” WHO says.

No structures have been damaged, and no injuries or deaths have been reported, officials said during a Friday media briefing, one week after the first of the two fires started.
Together, the fires in Greenville and Pickens counties had burned more than 10,600 total acres as of Friday morning, officials said. Both fires, which officials said were manmade, remained 0% contained. A statewide burn ban remains in effect.
Four teenage hikers have been questioned by police about the Table Rock fire, and “charges are pending,” according to the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office.

The fires prompted mandatory evacuations for people nearest the flames. About 1,400 homes were evacuated as of Thursday morning, according to Greenville County Emergency Management. A shelter set up at Marietta First Baptist Church had about 20 people staying there Friday morning, said Kim Stenson, director of the state Emergency Management Division.
The fire is the largest mountain wildfire in state history, surpassing a 2016 fire in the same area that burned 10,000 acres.
“We’ve never had a fire quite like this,” Gov. Henry McMaster said.
Downed trees and other debris knocked loose when Hurricane Helene hit the state as a tropical storm in September are complicating matters, said Scott Phillips, head of the state Forestry Commission. Firefighters are struggling to get equipment onto paths blocked by the storm. Some trees fell across established fire breaks, meaning crews have to saw through logs to keep the fire from spreading even further.
Dried-out timber also created more fuel for the fire. While that hasn’t been the primary concern yet, it could become a much bigger issue of the flames reach areas where timber cleared from roads still sits in stacks, Phillips said.

The debris “is going to change the way we have to attack fires in the mountains of South Carolina and in the Hurricane Helene-impacted areas,” Phillips said.
High winds combined with recent dry conditions have made the fires particularly difficult to contain. Crews have been working to create perimeters cleared of debris that the fire can’t cross, but the wind has carried embers from the Table Rock over barriers as wide as 40 feet, Phillips said.
“With these fires and the conditions we’re facing in the state right now, the dryness of the fuel, the extreme low humidities, the high winds that we’re having, containment is very, very difficult to achieve,” Phillips said.
Embers ignited parts of Table Rock State Park earlier this week, Phillips said. Table Rock, Caesars Head and Jones Gap state parks remained closed Friday, according to the state parks department.
State Law Enforcement Division and National Guard teams had dropped more than 700,000 gallons of water on the fire by Friday, agency directors said. Air tankers dropped thousands of gallons of fire retardant along the northern edge of the fires Thursday, according to the Forestry Commission. Among them was a very large air tanker, which the commission used for the first time in the state.
SLED has also been helping police monitor evacuated neighborhoods to prevent looting and keep roads clear of spectators who have been congregating, said SLED Chief Mark Keel.
Much of the firefighters’ focus has been on protecting nearby structures, officials said. One way of doing that is through burnout operations, in which crews intentionally light fires they can closely monitor to reduce the fuel leading up to buildings, slowing the uncontrolled wildfire.
The fires are visible from miles around, said House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, who lives about 7 miles from the blaze in Pickens. His home isn’t within the current evacuation zone, but he can see the glow of the fire on the side of the mountain from his front porch, he said.
Upstate SC wildfires burn upwards of 2,000 acres

“There’s smoke everywhere,” Hiott said.
The high winds died down slightly Friday, helping matters somewhat, officials said. The National Weather Service is predicting rain Sunday and Monday, which could help firefighters control the blaze.
“Pray for the men and women out here, and pray for rain,” Hiott said.
A fire near Myrtle Beach that ignited last month continues to burn. At about 2,000 acres, that fire is about 85% contained and has damaged no structures or killed any people, Phillips said.
This month, the Forestry Commission has responded to more than 370 fires that burned more than 18,000 acres total, Phillips said. That’s “orders of magnitude” more than the commission usually sees in a month, and more than it has seen in some years, he said.
April is typically the busiest month for forest fires, Phillips said.
“This is going to be a long season for us as we move forward,” he said.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Minneapolis on Thursday has become the fourth U.S. city to ban algorithmic rental price-fixing software, joining San Francisco, Philadelphia and Berkeley, California, in a growing wave of legislation aimed to protect renters from rental price-gouging.
While momentum builds at the city level — with Portland, Oregon; Providence, Rhode Island; and San Diego exploring similar laws — statewide bans have been slower to emerge.
The legislation targets tools such as RealPage’s YieldStar, which uses landlord-shared data to recommend rent increases — a practice critics say worsens unaffordable housing. Stateline reported last year that the algorithms have drawn increasing oversight attention as the country continues to wrestle with an affordable housing crisis.
“This wave of action shows that local governments are stepping up where federal enforcement takes time,” said Ivan Luevanos-Elms, executive director of Local Progress, the national network helping coordinate these efforts.
In 2024, proposed legislation failed to prohibit the use of these algorithms stalled in  Illinois, New York and Rhode Island.
Washington state has seen the most movement, with a proposed ban passing the Senate and awaiting a House vote. Colorado’s House approved a similar bill this week, and it’s now headed to the Senate.
Elsewhere, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation to ban algorithmic rent-setting tools, while Oregon lawmakers are considering an expansion of city-level bans. Lawmakers in Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Georgia, New Hampshire, Hawaii have introduced bills, but none has advanced.
The legislative surge follows lawsuits against RealPage and six major landlords, accused by the U.S. Department of Justice and 10 state attorneys general of collusion and anticompetitive practices. But with court cases expected to drag on for years, cities are opting for faster action.
Still, these bans have met resistance from real estate and landlord groups. In Oregon, landlords and property managers argue the software helps manage rentals more efficiently.
“Without these tools, we must rely on outdated methods,” said Oregon landlord Aaron Douglas in submitted testimony. “This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a step backward.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)House Bill 118, a proposal to solidify the Alaska Governor’s Council on Human and Sex Trafficking into a permanent fixture of the state government, is a deeply concerning one, fraught with potential for continuing abuse and a demonstrated lack of necessity and accountability. 
A close examination of the council’s track record, its potential for misuse, and the actual landscape of human and sex trafficking cases in Alaska, as revealed by recent data, paints a clear picture: A council is not the solution Alaska needs and should not be granted permanent status.
One of the most damning indictments against the council is its blatant lack of transparency. Community United for Safety and Protection, or CUSP, an advocacy group for survivors, has repeatedly encountered significant challenges in accessing public meetings and obtaining meeting minutes. 
In testimony to the Alaska House Judiciary Committee, CUSP members, including myself, outlined obstacles to participating in council meetings. In 2022, we were unable to join an online meeting, not informed about another, and denied access to requested public records. In 2023, we waited 30 minutes to be admitted to a meeting but were never let in, and another meeting was rescheduled at the last minute, limiting public participation. One CUSP member was only admitted after using a variation of their first name.
This conduct is in direct violation of Alaska’s Open Meetings Act. 
A state council dedicated to such a critical issue should hear from those with lived experience and expertise.
There is reason for concern that the council could create conflicts of interest for its members, who are handpicked by the state’s governor. While direct financial compensation for council members is barred under the bill, the individuals who have been appointed so far have had affiliations with organizations and projects that stand to receive state funding or grants. 
This creates an inherent conflict of interest, as the council’s decisions could be influenced by the potential for financial gain for its past members’ associated entities rather than the best interests of trafficking survivors. 
This potential for self-serving practices, shielded by a lack of transparency, is a significant reason to oppose the council’s permanent establishment.
Examining the actual prevalence of sex trafficking in Alaska, as documented in a CUSP report, “Prostitution and Sex Trafficking Charges in Alaska, 2020-2024,” further weakens the argument for the necessity of this council. 
The report reveals a startlingly low number of actual sex trafficking charges of adults at the state and federal levels, with only three state cases identified over the nearly five years of the research period and no federal charges. 
The data suggests that the legal framework is often applied in ways that do not align with the common understanding of forced labor and exploitation in the sex industry. 
Many federal cases labeled as sex trafficking of minors were essentially child molestation cases where payment was involved. An antitrafficking review report highlights that antiprostitution and sex trafficking laws, as they stand and are enforced, often fail to address the root causes of exploitation and can even harm marginalized individuals.
Given the council’s consistent lack of transparency, the potential for conflicts of interest, and the questionable application of sex trafficking laws in Alaska, the argument for making the council a permanent entity crumbles. 
Alaska’s ability to combat sex trafficking has remained unchanged despite the council’s inactivity for over eight months, further proving its irrelevance. Organizations like CUSP, composed of sex workers and sex trafficking survivors, are actively engaged in providing feedback and advocating for effective policies based on their lived experiences. Their exclusion from the council’s processes highlights a fundamental flaw in its structure and purpose.
Instead of solidifying a non-transparent and potentially self-serving body, the Alaska Legislature should prioritize evidence-based solutions and accountability. 
There is a need to reevaluate how sex trafficking laws are applied, focusing on genuine cases of force, fraud, and coercion, and separating child sexual abuse from prostitution statutes. 
Empowering and listening to the voices of those directly affected by the criminalization of prostitution and sex trafficking, rather than relying on an insular council, is crucial for developing effective strategies to address these complex issues in Alaska. 
Rather than institutionalize a council that lacks transparency and has demonstrated a failure to meaningfully address trafficking, the state could direct resources toward survivor-led initiatives, evidence-based harm reduction strategies, and comprehensive social services that address the root causes of exploitation. The passage of HB118 would only perpetuate ineffective policies while causing additional harm to the communities it claims to protect.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The bullhorn-powered war of words between satanists and Catholics boiled over into brawling and a handful of arrests Friday during an extraordinary event at the Kansas Capitol that pushed boundaries of free speech and the separation of church and state.
After about two hours of speeches, prayers and sign waving among hundreds of people mostly segregated by barricades staffed by law enforcement officers, Satanic Grotto president Michael Stewart, with supporters and reporters in tow, entering the Statehouse to conduct what he had described as a black mass. He was warned at the door to the visitors’ center that any formal protest inside the building that violated a permit limiting his religious expression to the lawn or steps of the Capitol would result in his arrest for trespassing.
In the rotunda, Stewart began the rebellious form of a mass and was interrupted by three people intent on stopping was could be interpreted as a mockery of their faith. An unidentified man and woman, with young kids at their side, physically intervened to stop Stewart. He turned away from them. Counter-protester Marcus Schroeder joined the fray and twice reached to take papers from Stewart’s hand. Stewart responded by punching Schroeder in the face twice. More than half a dozen Capitol Police wrestled Stewart to the floor to make the arrest.
“I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting,” Stewart repeatedly yelled.
Schroeder, who wore a shirt declaring “Death is not welcome here,” wasn’t arrested by Capitol Police. In an interview, he defended his maneuvering to thwart Stewart.
“I tried to take his papers. He punched me in the face,” he said.
After the area cleared, two other satanists tried to pick up where Stewart left off and were taken into custody. One other person was cuffed and taken away by law enforcement outside the Capitol on Friday. An individual grabbed Stewart by the legs in a bid to stop Stewart from stomping on crackers intended to represent those used in a Catholic mass to represent the consecrated body and soul of Christ. In that brief exchange, Stewart also punched the guy before law enforcement stepped in.
  Hundreds of Christians upset with an organization’s plan to conduct a satanic black mass at the Capitol delivered a robust counter-protest to emphasize their disdain for followers of Satanic Grotto. Both sides of the debate used bullhorns to punctuate their messages, creating a blended sound that was difficult for anybody to hear clearly. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)
“He was was trying to tackle me to get to the cracker underneath,” Stewart said. “I was able to kind of fend him off. I do think he may have picked up the crumbled cracker and ate it. Did I get physical with him? Yes.”
  The opposition 

The colorful display of affection and affliction for organized religion culminated attempts by Gov. Laura Kelly, Attorney General Kris Kobach, leaders of the Kansas Legislature and Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, to derail the demonstration planned by Satanic Grotto.
Kelly had the group’s permit amended so no protest could transpire inside the Capitol. Legislative leaders modified policy regarding use of the Capitol to specifically target Satanic Grotto. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Wichita, said the First Amendment didn’t protect offensive speech or violations of law.
Francis Slobodnik, a Topeka representative of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, told hundreds of Catholics gathered on the south side of the Capitol that state public officials shouldn’t have allowed satanists to assemble on public property. He said the event reflected a misguided understanding of freedom of speech and religion and a lack of appreciation for how a black mass represented worship of Satan.
“Today’s horrific event, the first of its kind in the history of Kansas, is a sacrilege,” Slobodnik said. “Of course, there have been terrible crimes and injustices that have happened in our state over the years. However, nothing in our past compares with what is happening today where God is being directly challenged on the state Capitol grounds. The state Capitol represents all of us.”
He praised the people present at the rally to stand in opposition to Satanic Grotto, referring to them as the Navy Seals of the Catholic faith. He said these activists were willing to confront God’s enemies head-on as if on a field of battle. He said the great sin perpetrated by Stewart and other worshipers of Satan meant that others had to step into the void.
“Satanists do not realize that Satan hates all of God’s creation, including them,” Slobodnik said. “Their reward for worshiping and serving him will be eternal fire.”
  And, an exorcist 

Former U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, who served in the Kansas Senate before elected to Congress, said he consulted with a priest with experience in exorcism to figure whether he should participate in a television interview with Stewart.
“Father had a simple question: ‘Why would you do this? What do you hope to gain?’ I stumbled around in my answer,” Huelskamp said. “I wanted to share the truth about Christ. The truth about the Eucharist. His summary response was quite stunning to me. He said, ‘There is no good that could come from being in the same room with a Satanist.’”
Huelskamp said it was suggested his participation in the interview with Stewart might serve interests of Satan. The former Republican congressman woke ill the next day, and cancelled the interview. In the end, Huelskamp said he decided it was important to run to the fire created by Satan rather than shrink from it. He said it was the same as making his views known about the evil of abortion and defending the sanctity of marriage between a man and woman.
“I am quite stubborn and hardheaded,” he said. “We cannot be silent. We are required, if we call ourselves Christians, if we call ourselves Catholic, we are publicly required to defend the faith and to stand up for the truth.”
In an interview amid calm before the storm of his arrest, Stewart said he was convinced Catholics assembled around him didn’t understand why Satanic Grotto was at the Capitol to talk about religious oppression.
“What we only want is the rights that every American has,” Stewart said. “I’ve heard people say we’re setting a precedent. Well, if the precedent is freedom of religion for everyone in public spaces, yes, that’s what we’re trying to establish. We are dragging this issue out in the light and we’ll let the people look at it. The issue is that we’re not all being treated the same here.”

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)A bill advancing in the Senate would make it a felony to prescribe or distribute medications used for abortion to people in West Virginia except for the narrow circumstances when the procedure is legal in the state.  
The Senate Judiciary Committee referred Senate Bill 85 to the full Senate on Thursday. Senators are expected to vote on the bill next week. 
With few exceptions, abortion has been illegal in West Virginia since 2022. Abortion by telehealth is also illegal in the state. 
Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, one of the bill’s sponsors, said the intent of Senate Bill 85 is to stop the flow of abortifacients into the state for the purpose of illegal abortions. The bill attempts to enforce the state’s abortion ban on out-of-state entities or physicians who would send the medication to West Virginia residents.
The penalty for violating the law would be three to 10 years in prison for a person who is not a licensed medical professional. Licensed medical professionals would face the revocation of their license, according to the bill. 
While the legislation is an attempt to stop out-of-state providers from breaking West Virginia law, federal courts are likely to decide the issue of enforcement, an attorney for the judiciary committee said.  
Louisiana last month charged a New York doctor with a felony for allegedly sending abortion pills to a pregnant minor in the state, according to reporting by the Associated Press.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul refused to extradite the doctor to face the charges. New York has a shield law to protect abortion providers who prescribe the medication to patients in states where abortion is outlawed. 
Kelly Lemon, a nurse midwife, testified that some medications labeled as abortifacients have a lot of other uses in health care. Lemon said the state’s existing abortion laws have already led to some of her patients not being able to get misoprostol for managing a hemorrhage and delays in care for treating a miscarriage. 
“My biggest concern with this bill is that it’s going to further create barriers to how we can get these medications to people when they need it,” she said. The bill, should it become law, would cause delays in care and drive health providers out of the state, she said.
Rucker responded that the bill indicates that pharmacists filling a valid prescription issued by a licensed medical professional or a physician performing a procedure for a legitimate reason are not breaking the law. 
Kristin Hawkins, president of Students for Life Action, testified that the bill would close a lot of loopholes for charging physicians and entities that send abortion medication to states where the procedure is not legal. Hawkins said there are websites where people can get abortion pills sent to them, seemingly without a doctor’s review.
Emily Womeldorff, director of policy and campaigns for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said the bill is part of an ongoing effort to create fear and stigma around reproductive health care.
“This bill is a gross overreach of state authority,” Womeldorff said. “It’s threatening enforcement against health care providers that are located outside of the borders of West Virginia, and our government does not have jurisdiction over health care providers that provide care outside of our state borders.
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, was the only lawmaker to speak against the bill, calling it bad policy that would harm a woman’s ability to get medical care.

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)It’s a lot of money — $7.3 billion.
Those are the federal dollars accounted for in the main budget bill for the state of Montana, nearly half of the $16.4 billion total for the next biennium.
Now, some of those dollars might be at risk, or at least subject to stricter scrutiny.
President Donald Trump, newly sworn into a second term, has embarked on an aggressive plan to cut federal spending with help from billionaire Elon Musk and DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.
Montanans have already seen some results — both praised and criticized.
Supporters see red tape slashed and less bureaucracy ahead, but others see dollars for food banks disappearing, U.S. Forest Service workers laid off, and closed bathrooms on federal lands.
In the meantime, the 2025 Montana Legislature is in session, and lawmakers are combing through billions of dollars in House Bill 2, the big budget bill, along with statutory appropriations.
So what happens to the state budget if federal dollars to Montana start drying up?
“I don’t want to speak too soon, but I definitely think that we might have to come back for a special session, because you can’t craft a budget when a large percentage of it is dependent on those federal dollars,” said Rep. Donovan Hawk, D-Butte, at a recent press availability.
He and other Democrats said they’d like to have more open discussions to plan ahead for federal cuts and even a possible downturn in the economy.
  Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad. (Provided by the Montana Legislature)
In the meantime, Republican Chairman of House Appropriations Llew Jones said he’d like to squirrel away reserves — a strategy he said can be controversial because some people would rather spend the dollars on social services.
Jones, of Conrad, also said he’s planning to put “triggers” in legislation to bring the Legislative Finance Committee back to Helena for closer budget scrutiny if changes in Washington, D.C., meet certain thresholds and become more than just “noise.”
“I would like to not run red ink,” Jones said.
Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office did not respond to an email about how the cuts at the federal level might affect the way the governor is thinking about the budget.
However, Jones said the separate finance teams for the governor and the legislature have a good working relationship — not always in agreement, but not adversarial — and will communicate about any hardships.
He said it may be that the budget for the current biennium ends up skirting any emergency, and the 2027 legislature ends up dealing with a drop in federal dollars.
So a special session isn’t a given, although legislators such as Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, have sounded warning bells about the possibility, specifically related to Medicaid expansion.
Federal money currently pays for 90% of Medicaid expansion, a program set to continue in Montana with a bill signed this week by Gianforte.
“We’re going to be back here, and I’m going to tell you, ‘I told you so,’” said Glimm during an earlier debate.
‘Sugar high’ won’t last forever
Federal dollars account for different portions of the budget for different agencies.
They’re a big chunk of the budget of the Department of Public Health and Human Services’ budget — an estimated $4.7 billion out of $7 billion for the biennium as proposed in the governor’s budget.
That’s an estimated 67%.
At a recent press availability, Rep. Mary Caferro, D-Helena, said one concern she has is that the rules for balancing the budget don’t include doing so without cutting things like health services.

Caferro said the state has plenty of money, and in the meantime, the Trump administration has been unpredictable, and she’d like to see preparations.
Federal dollars from the Covid-19 pandemic buoyed the state budget, but only temporarily.
“This sugar high, as they call it when they talk about human services stuff, is not going to last forever,” Caferro said.
She said a bill she’s sponsoring calls for a Medicaid stabilization fund and would help on one front.
House Bill 880, scheduled to be heard Monday in House Appropriations, would capture any excess money from the state for Medicaid that the health department didn’t use, Caferro said.
Usually, she said, that unused money goes back to the general fund, but HB 880 would set it aside and allow the governor to tap it to avoid cuts if needed.
Jones said protecting the health department is one reason he would like to ensure the state has adequate reserves, and in multiple places.
He said lots of money goes to education, but the state can’t cut a teacher’s salary halfway through the year, and some constitutional protections apply.
“(But) nothing says that you can’t cut provider rates. That just sucks to be you,” Jones said of the situation he wants the state to avoid.
The most recent special session took place in 2017, and the Montana Budget and Policy Center said the health department experienced some of the deepest cuts.
“The loser, when you run in red ink, is DPHHS,” Jones said. “It will be again if there’s not reserves.”
‘Scary’ worst-case-scenario
Federal dollars are a smaller part of other agencies’ budgets. For example, they’re just 5% for the Montana University System, albeit still $37 million.
“The Federal Special Revenue funds authorized in HB 2 cover programs like GEAR UP, Perkins and TRiO programs,” said Galen Hollenbaugh, spokesperson for the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, in an email.
GEAR UP stands for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs.

According to the Montana University System, the grant serves students in 7th through 12th grades to improve high school graduation and college enrollment rates, and it will have served 8,800 students altogether, including 5,800 Native American students, in its duration.
Perkins supports career and technical education, and TriO helps first generation, low-income or disabled students.
At the Department of Environmental Quality, federal dollars make up an estimated 37%, or $52.9 million of $143.9 million, based on the governor’s proposed budget for the biennium.
As proposed, federal funds account for 9% of the Department of Justice budget, $31 million out of $338 million for the same period.
At the Office of Public Instruction, federal money for the biennium is $368.7 million, or about 13.6%.
At a recent press availability, Rep. Eric Matthews, D-Bozeman, said legislators received assurances from OPI that funding streams for education remain intact in Montana for the moment, but he said uncertainty exists.
Even though the money from the federal government isn’t “a hugely significant portion” of the overall education budget, Matthews, who is a teacher, said schools already are behind due to inflation, and they’re already having a hard time hiring teachers and support staff.
He said cuts could make it more difficult to keep up with inflation and hire educators. Federal dollars fund special education, and he said it would be hard to provide services to students with IEPs, or Individualized Education Plans.
“It would just open up all sorts of potential for lawsuits from parents,” Matthews said. “The worst-case-scenario is pretty scary.”
Earlier this month, Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen said the Trump administration has assured her the money that’s supposed to flow to Montana will continue to be sent to the state.
Big budget, big reserve
Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said the budget started with a $552 million cushion.
But the governor proposed a “very healthy” budget, he said. If legislators approve a big tax cut and “seismic shifts” take place at the federal level, he could see the need to hit the “reset button” in a special session.
“In the big picture, change flips pretty darn quick,” Regier said at a press availability this week.
The triggers that Jones is working on would call for additional Legislative Fiscal Committee meetings if Congress passes a law or the president signs an executive order that means income from the feds hits a certain problematic threshold or the general fund runs into trouble.
That way, he said, lawmakers can figure out if they can work through it in the moment, if they need to have a special session, or if they can hold off until the next regular session, starting in January 2027.
To try to keep the budget steady, Jones also said he’s a “reserve freak,” although he said some legislators in his party disagree with his approach and would rather see spending decrease if federal money dries up.
He said a sizable portion of state income is volatile, 70% from income tax, so to him, that means setting more aside.
“The more variable you make it, the more reserves I want, because the more it gets reactive to recession,” Jones said.
To prepare, he said he requests support from the Legislative Fiscal Division: “I want you to model the amount of money we need to keep on hand to survive a 20-year recession without slashing and burning everything.”
Jones said it means roughly three to six months of income, similar to what a financial manager will tell a household. For the state, though, it’s $1.2 billion, and he said some criticism comes with that high amount.
“They say, ‘Geez, you’re keeping $1.2 billion in reserve. How dare you?’ Well, we’re a big budget,” Jones said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos04-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 16:03:23.156185

For several days, the detainee locator only stated he was “in ICE custody” but did not list any location. The facility in Jena is holding several international students targeted by federal authorities. 
David Rozas, Doroudi’s attorney, disputed claims by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that his client posed a national security concern.

Doroudi, an Iranian national pursuing a PhD in mechanical engineering, was taken into custody by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit on Tuesday around 3 a.m., Rozas said in a statement sent on Friday. Immigration authorities cited the U.S. State Department’s revocation of Doroudi’s student visa as the reason for his arrest.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Doroudi “posed significant national security concerns.” The spokesperson declined to provide further details about what the concerns were, saying “That is all we are able to share at this time.”
Rozas challenged that characterization, saying he was unaware “of any allegations concerning significant national security issues.”
“He has not been arrested for any crime, nor has he participated in any anti-government protests,” the statement from Rozas said. “He is legally present in the U.S., pursuing his American dream by working towards his doctorate in mechanical engineering.”
Rozas added that Doroudi’s student visa was still active and that he was in the early stages of applying for permanent residency as a researcher.
Student organizers from the Students for Justice in Palestine, a student organization at UA, said Thursday that Doroudi had no involvement in recent pro-Palestine protests at the university or with the organization.
Doroudi’s fiancé, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, started a GoFundMe to help cover his legal expenses, garnering over $21,000 in about a day. She said in a LinkedIn post that Doroudi’s is set to defend his dissertation next academic year and has been “fully engaged” in academic work and research projects in the department.
“His dedication and achievements have earned him recognition in his field and led to his selection to apply for permanent residency,” she wrote in a post.
The University of Alabama has not provided further details about the situation. Spokesperson Alex House did not respond to messages Friday after initially stating that the university was cooperating with immigration authorities. House did not address whether the university was offering Doroudi any assistance.

(Pool photo by Samantha Madar, Columbus Dispatch.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Friday signed into law a massive higher education overhaul to ban diversity efforts, regulate classroom discussion, and prohibit faculty strikes, among other things. The law will take effect in 90 days. 
 S.B. 1 will set rules around classroom discussion, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things. 
For classroom discussion, the bill will set rules around topics involving “controversial beliefs” such as climate policies, electoral politics, foreign policy, diversity and inclusion programs, immigration policy, marriage, or abortion. S.B. 1 would only affect Ohio’s public universities.
The bill moved quickly through the Statehouse. State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced S.B. 1, which passed the Ohio Senate in February and the Ohio House in March. Cirino introduced a nearly identical bill during the last General Assembly that went through several revisions, but the bill never made it the House floor and ultimately died. 
The bill received overwhelming opposition from college students and professors. More than 1,500 people have submitted opponent testimony against the bill. Hundreds of students around the state have protested against the bill. Students and faculty have said they would leave Ohio if the bill becomes law.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Another nail was hammered into the coffin of Certificate of Need repeal on Friday, as the West Virginia House of Delegates overwhelmingly voted down — after a drawn out “fiasco” over rules and procedure — a motion to discharge House Bill 2007.
With 10 members absent and not voting, lawmakers in the body voted 72-15 against discharging the bill.
The discharge motion, if successful, would have brought the original version of HB 2007 — a bill to totally repeal the Certificate of Need process in the state — to the House floor, where the full body would have considered it for the first time. 
The bill died last month in the House Committee on Health and Human Resources when lawmakers voted 13-12 against it.
Del. Chris Anders, R-Berkeley, made the motion to discharge the bill from committee and to the floor, saying members should support his motion because HB 2007 “will end the government created monopoly on health care.”
In response to Anders, Del. Carl Martin, R-Upshur, immediately made a motion to table his discharge motion. 
But Martin’s motion, said Del. Matthew Rohrbach, R-Cabell, who was acting as speaker, was out of order and not allowed based on rules of the chamber. This is despite a motion to table a discharge motion previously being successful earlier this session. That previous motion and vote, Rohrbach said, should have been out of order as well.
Del. Brandon Steele, R-Raleigh, called for a motion to overturn Rohrbach’s ruling, which was supported by House counsel as well as the House parliamentarian and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who was not present Friday.
“What are we even doing here?!” Steele exclaimed, before his motion failed 58-31. 
With that failed vote, and after several back-and-forths regarding the technicalities of the House Rules as well as Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure — the rulebook that dictates House actions this year alongside the chamber’s own rules — Rohrbach’s ruling that Martin’s motion to table the discharge motion was out of order stood as the rule of the chamber. 
The body then voted down Anders’ original discharge motion, laying HB 2007 to rest yet again.
Repealing Certificate of Need in West Virginia was one of only two health care policies that Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced as priorities for his first legislative session this year. The other policy — adding religious and philosophical exemptions to the state’s vaccine mandates — failed on the House floor earlier this week. 
During his State of the State, Morrisey called the Certificate of Need process “big government activism at its worst” and promised that by repealing it, the state would “move toward the free market.” 
Bills to repeal CON have been introduced in the Legislature annually since at least 2017. This year marked the second time ever that the bill made it to a committee, as well as the second time it was voted down by that committee.
CON is a regulatory process, overseen by the West Virginia Health Care Authority, that requires entities looking to create or expand health care services in the state to receive a legal document proving those new services fit an unmet need in the area. 
Through the Health Care Authority, those interested in obtaining a Certificate of Need receive technical assistance before applying to see what need they are meeting. Services are approved through a needs methodology and different services — such as hospice care, ambulatory centers, clinics, private practices and specialty services — have different methodologies.
Proponents for the repeal believe that doing away with the laws will allow more competition in health care across West Virginia. Those against repeal worry that doing away with the process will hurt West Virginia’s more rural and vulnerable populations, where a lack of regulation could threaten what services are offered to the 75% of residents who are government payers, meaning their health insurance comes from Medicare, Medicaid or the Public Employees Insurance Agency.
While the House’s version of the bill to repeal Certificate of Need seems relatively dead — all bills must be at least on first reading on the floor in their chambers of origin by Sunday — another bill has been introduced in the Senate that would do the same. Lawmakers there, however, have yet to touch it and seem unlikely to do so.
In past years, there have been Hail Mary attempts to amend a total repeal of certificate of need into other bills that deal with the same section of code. It’s possible the same could happen this year, as several bills that touch on Certificate of Need are still circulating as crossover day approaches next week.

Nott told Source on Friday the agency had identified $60 million in lost grants, and was still evaluating the impact on its programs. But “none of it is touching measles,” he said, noting that the state would use federal and state funds to “keep all positions. We did lose 37 temporary contract staff,” he noted, “but nothing is going to touch the measles battle.”
As of Friday, the state had a total of 44 cases, with one new report since Tuesday in Lea County, which now reports 42 cases. Eddy County has the remaining two cases.
While only two new cases were reported in total this week, Nott cautioned against complacency about the outbreak.
“We don’t want to be at all overconfident about this,” he said. “We want people to be aware, we want them to seek out MMR vaccines if they want them. This could be a lull, but this is an incredibly contagious disease and we are not taking for granted that it’s over or close to over.”
Of New Mexico’s cases, 23 afflicted people over the age of 18; 13 were among the ages of 5 and 17; and eight cases included children 4 years old and younger. 
The quirk of New Mexico’s nearly even split between children and adults with measles infections is due in part to the small number of reports, New Mexico Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source, particularly compared to Texas.
Texas health officials on Friday reported 400 cases since the outbreak began in late January: a 22% increase since Tuesday. 
Health officials have found identical strains in measles cases in both Kansas and New Mexico that match genetic samples from Texas, the World Health Organization reported on Thursday.
While the genetic data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remains preliminary, Smelser said, it shows a link to the outbreak which started in neighboring Gaines County, Texas. 
“We are comfortable linking the measles cases in Texas as having the same virus we see circulating in New Mexico,” he told Source.
The other reasons for the age spread here, Smelser said, may include factors like hesitancy to see a doctor and the challenge for NMDOH to count all the measles cases. 
“We don’t have lab testing on everybody and so sometimes that can make it a little difficult to count all the cases,” Smelser said. “Also, we know in this outbreak that we have folks who are hesitant to seek medical care and get tested, some of those are likely to be kids.” 
The agency has a team of nurses and epidemiologists trying to trace the spread of the virus by contacting patients currently with measles or suspected cases, and hospitals treating them.
“Working with us is the most helpful thing for us all to protect our communities and our loved ones, as well as being fully vaccinated,” Smelser said. “The Department of Health is ready to help people if they need to test as well as if they’re in need of getting caught up on their vaccinations.”
According to Nott, between Feb. 1 and March 25, more than 14,100 New Mexicans received the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine across the state, more than double from last year, “so we remain really encouraged,” he said.
Vaccines remain available to walk-in patients at numerous public health patients, and at vaccination clinics scheduled throughout the state.
NMDOH directs any questions about measles tests, symptoms or vaccines to the Helpline at 1-833-796-8773. The helpline is staffed by nurses who can answer questions in English or Spanish.
Measles, an extremely contagious respiratory virus, spreads via contact with droplets in the air, which can linger for hours. People can spread the virus several days before symptoms including fever, spotty red rash, cough, runny nose or red eyes appear. About one in five cases is serious enough to warrant hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Complications from measles include brain swelling, blindness, pneumonia and death.
The deaths earlier this year of a 6-year old Texas child, and a Lea County adult, both unvaccinated, are the first measles deaths in the U.S. in 10 years. 
Vaccine records can be found at the Vax View website or by calling the NMDOH immunization program at 1-833-882-6454, available weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

(Getty Images)As president of Poder Latino, I have witnessed firsthand how the rising cost of prescription drugs intensifies the struggles faced by Spanish-speaking Latina women living in unhealthy domestic situations. Our mission is to break down barriers so these women can access critical resources, gain independence, and build better lives across Utah. However, ever-rising medication prices add another layer of hardship to those already contending with limited finances, housing instability, and the complexities of leaving abusive environments.


 Domestic violence resources

Help for people in abusive relationships is available in Utah:

Utah Domestic Violence Coalition: A confidential statewide, 24-hour domestic violence hotline can be reached at 1-800-897-LINK (5465)
YWCA Women in Jeopardy program: 801-537-8600
Utah child abuse and neglect hotline: 1-855-323-DCFS (3237)
National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233



Over the past decade, pharmaceutical companies have steadily increased prices on essential and life-saving medications — often without meaningful improvements in effectiveness or safety. These corporate decisions to raise costs well beyond inflation disproportionately affect low-income families and individuals who cannot endure unexpected expenses. For Spanish-speaking Latinas facing domestic violence, every dollar must be allocated carefully, whether it goes toward safe shelter, legal aid, or counseling services. When prescription drug prices surge, these women face an impossible dilemma: Do they choose to pay for necessary medications or use that money to escape an abusive situation?
In Utah, where the cost of living is already climbing with inflation and rising housing expenses, soaring drug prices can tip the balance between stability and crisis. This burden is even greater for those who speak English as a second language, as they navigate additional challenges — such as finding translation services and managing an unfamiliar health care system. When medication becomes unaffordable, women often find themselves vulnerable to chronic illnesses, untreated mental health issues, and preventable illnesses — problems that only worsen if they are also dealing with trauma and abuse at home.
Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies continue to thrive, reaping enormous profits by charging Americans far more than patients in other countries for the same medications. This price disparity disproportionately impacts vulnerable communities who lack economic leverage, further trapping them in cycles of poverty and jeopardizing their future stability. The injustice is stark: Big Pharma benefits while families are forced to make impossible sacrifices, leaving their most basic health needs unmet.
Utah’s congressional delegation — lead by Republican Sens. John Curtis and Mike Lee — have the power to make a profound difference by championing federal legislation that holds pharmaceutical manufacturers accountable for unchecked price hikes. Reforms could range from capping out-of-pocket costs and tying price increases to inflation, to demanding transparent pricing structures that force drugmakers to justify steep hikes. Another crucial aspect is ending the “revolving door” between the industry and the agencies meant to regulate it — a practice that has long prioritized profits over public health.
By reigning in prescription drug costs, we can create a stronger safety net for the women we serve — ensuring they have access to the medications they need while they navigate housing, job training, and legal challenges. Affordability is not just a matter of financial relief; it is a necessary component of basic human dignity and empowerment. When women have the resources, they need to maintain their health, they are in a better position to break free from abusive environments and rebuild their lives.
I urge our senators and representatives to keep the needs of our most vulnerable Utahns at the forefront of the legislative process. Lowering the cost of prescription drugs is an essential step toward ensuring that every woman — regardless of language barriers, income, or life circumstances — has an equitable opportunity at a safe, healthy, and fulfilling life. The well-being of our entire community depends on it.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-185279294-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 16:03:23.156185

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN – For a second time, an effort by the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office to prosecute the former director of the state historical society has been rebuffed.
On Monday, the Nebraska Court of Appeals approved a request by attorneys for Trevor Jones dismiss a felony theft by deception charge that had been filed by the Attorney General’s office.
Summary dismissal

Court filings show the dismissal was approved without taking formal arguments from the AG’s office – a summary dismissal. The appeals court ruled that state prosecutors failed to follow proper procedure in appealing an earlier dismissal of the case by a Lancaster County District Court judge based on the state’s failure to afford Jones a speedy trial.
The case could be appealed to the Nebraska Supreme Court. A spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s Office, Suzanne Gage, said Friday that the office disagreed with the ruling and would file “an appropriate motion” laying out the arguments.
Jones’ lead attorney, Mallory Hughes of Omaha, said she had been “very confident” that the Court of Appeals would dismiss the case and said she would be just as confident if the state filed an appeal to the Supreme Court.
“We agree with the rules and case law relied upon by the Court of Appeals in reaching its dismissal decision, and we will be prepared to argue the same should this matter proceed to the Nebraska Supreme Court,” Hughes wrote in an email.
Jones, 52, had headed the agency he renamed “History Nebraska” for six years before abruptly resigning in 2022, just prior to the release of a critical state audit.
The audit accused Jones of misusing $270,000 in donations from the Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation. Instead of using it to cover operational losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Jones deposited the funds in a rival private foundation he had set up after clashing with the older, more established Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation.

Jones, who was paid $164,800-a-year in his state job, was charged with a felony in July 2023, a theft charge punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
The case moved slowly through Lancaster County Court after Jones’ lawyers challenged the evidence. His case was eventually bound over to District Court. But Jones’ attorneys argued that the state failed to bring him to trial by September, when the speedy trial clock tolled.
District Judge Susan Strong agreed, dismissing the charge. The AG’s office then appealed.
The failed prosecution was mentioned on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature recently, with State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln – an attorney – charging that the AG’s office appeared too preoccupied with other matters, including investigating ballot measures seeking to legalize medical cannabis, to properly monitor the Jones case.
Conrad urged the Attorney General – with whom she has frequently differed – to get the office’s “priorities in order.”
“While our attorney general is waging war on the Legislature, on the people’s right to initiative, running around all over the country, bringing politically charged litigation to further a radical political agenda, right here at home his agency couldn’t even prosecute this case to protect public funds,” the senator said.
The AG’s office had no immediate comment on Conrad’s criticism.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Bruce Spencer, a lobbyist representing the State Bar of Montana, did not need to elaborate on his organization’s position on a bill before the House Judiciary Committee on Friday — he’s said it all before. 
“I’m trying to think of something new to say,” Spencer told the committee. “I’ve got to be honest, I don’t have much.”
Spencer was testifying for at least the seventh time against a bill that seeks to make Montana’s judiciary more aligned with partisan politics. Another bill in the same vein was introduced earlier this week. 
Friday’s hearing was on House Bill 838, introduced by Speaker of the House Rep. Brandon Ler, R-Savage. The legislation would allow candidates for the Montana Supreme Court to run under a party affiliation, or under a nonpartisan label. 
The bill would also create a new primary system for Supreme Court candidates, putting all candidates on a primary ballot regardless of which party primary a voter participates in. The top two candidates, regardless of party affiliation, would proceed to the general election. 
“It’s my personal opinion that (judges) have already chosen a party to run under,” Ler said. “We see that time and time again with the way that the Montana Supreme Court operates, whether it’s them meddling in our rules, them pre-determining the outcome on the bench of different legislation we have, or the decisions that they make, which seem to be completely against the will of the majority of Montana voters.”
The bill had no proponents, but drew a dozen opponents during the hearing. 
Many of the arguments put forth have been hashed out repeatedly in both the House and Senate so far this legislative session. 
Three other pieces of legislation have sought to specifically make judicial races partisan. House Bill 295 failed to clear a House vote before transmittal, as did HB 751, which would have required Supreme Court candidates to declare a party affiliation. 
Senate Bill 42, however, has had more momentum, sailing through the Senate — albeit on partisan lines. SB 42 requires judges at any level to attach a partisan affiliation to their candidacy. 
Those bills’ proponents called them “voter education” bills, seeking to add transparency to elections that are conducted with seemingly less knowledge of candidates than other partisan races. 
Ler said since he believes the judiciary is already partisan, voters should be made aware of that before they reach the bench. 
But opponents pushed back against that characterization, saying judges make rulings based on the Constitution and the law, and should not be beholden to a party platform. 
“Judges don’t make decisions on the basis of a constituency, and that’s what political parties are. They’re setting out values for a constituency,” said Al Smith with the Montana Trial Lawyers Association. “That’s not what judges do. They look at the Constitution, the law, the facts of the case. They should be free from political pressure.”
Speaking specifically to the characterization of partisan elections as voter education bills, Anne Sherwood, with Friends of the Third Branch, an educational organization focused on the state’s judiciary, said the claim voters can’t find information about candidates is disingenuous. 
“This bill is also not going to increase voter education. It strains credulity that in today’s digital age, somebody cannot find information on these candidates,” Sherwood said. “… We have the internet. Now we have Twitter. Now we have Facebook. Now we have independent campaign spending.”
Spencer added the State Bar holds forums for Supreme Court candidates every election cycle — another way voters could learn about the candidates. 
The House Judiciary Committee passed HB 838 out of committee on a 12-8 party-line vote. 
Two additional bills related to a partisan judiciary met opposing fates in the Legislature. House Bill 39, which allows political parties to spend money on judicial races, was signed by the governor earlier this month, while House BIll 169, which would have let judges and judicial candidates take part in partisan activities, died in the Senate.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-03-28 16:03:23.156185

(Photo courtesy of Mary Braun)Surrounded by students, faculty and staff, University of Northern Iowa President Mark Nook told a crowd Friday they weren’t gathered merely to celebrate a building, but to honor what it will bring to those who use it.
The university’s renovated and expanded applied engineering building, which opened Friday with a ribbon cutting ceremony, will offer cutting-edge lab and learning spaces and hands-on learning opportunities, Nook said. He said it will help students be prepared to fill critical roles in the state and country’s workforce.
“We didn’t build a building to have a pretty building,” Nook said. “We built a building to be able to help these young people, through the faculty and staff that you see up here, reach their educational goals, start them on their ways to meeting their professional goals, and help them understand how to build lives of purpose in their personal lives.”

The building renovation project, which came with a $44.7 million price tag, began just over a decade ago, Nook said, when UNI Facilities Management identified the need to renovate the building, which is now almost 50 years old. State appropriations totaling $40 million helped fund the facility, alongside $3 million in private donations.
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a video played during the ceremony the renovations eliminated $10 million in deferred maintenance as well as providing necessary facilities for students to train for high-need jobs under the expertise and programming developed by the university and its industry partners.
With a job placement rate of 95% overall and 85% in Iowa, Reynolds said with the opening, UNI will be able to accommodate demand that has increased enrollment by 20%. It also will address changing needs from the engineering and construction industries, she said.
Reynolds said the new facility will create a “significant talent pipeline to these critical sectors,” and she can’t wait to see what the next 50 years has in store for UNI’s applied engineering programs.

“It goes to show what’s possible when the state and our outstanding regents universities work together on the most important issues facing Iowa,” Reynolds said.
Students gathered outside of the ceremony to protest Reynolds, holding signs supporting transgender people and calling for an end to attacks on education.
Originally 60,000 square feet, the renovations modernized the existing building and added 40,000 more square feet of new lab and collaborative spaces for programs in applied engineering, construction management and more, according to a news release.
Jim Kiesey, vice president of Estes Construction as well as a UNI alum and chair of the Construction Management Advisory Board, said during the ceremony the new facility “cements UNI’s legacy in applied engineering and construction management,” but goes beyond just the renovated building’s footprint on campus.
Through the legacy UNI is forging, Kiesey said the university is providing an education to future, competent leaders, helping them grow and learn how to advocate for themselves in their industry. The new spaces have also brought an energy fit to inspire the people in it.
“Prior to embarking on this rehabilitation, the 50-year old Applied Engineering Building received its AARP card in the mail, and through the efforts by many, this facility now has a youthful personality and energy that matches and serves the students that reside in this facility,” Kiesey said.
John Deere vice president and factory manager Fabio Castro said during the ceremony the long partnership between John Deere and UNI has “yielded a bountiful harvest,” with the corporation employing more than 1,200 UNI alumni and 90 part-time students. Deere also helps UNI through providing guidance on academic programs, Castro said, ensuring the curriculum will adequately prepare students for the field.
He said the company and university share many values, like integrity and commitment to excellence, and the pursuit of excellence both organizations push for is evident in the new facility.
“Not only does this physical building monumentalize that ambition, but the individuals whose educations, careers and lives will be impacted here carry on that legacy, that drive, that value of never settling,” Castro said. “I hope they will be inculcated with the burning passion to fight off complacency and move our world forward through the application of innovative solutions to our most complex problems. It is clear that our future workforce will need these critical skills to navigate the turbulent, unpredictable and somewhat novel challenges of our future.”

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — During moments of near silence among the Catholic archbishop of Kansas City and hundreds of people gathered in prayer inside the Assumption Church in Topeka, chants, shouts and sometimes sirens penetrated the church doors.
While competing religious protests clashed on the Capitol grounds across the street, as many as 400 people convened in the church to participate in prayer, ceremony and a mass that was meant to be an “antidote” to the “unbelieving secular society.”
The services were part of a series of counterefforts planned in response to a “black mass.” The black mass, planned by a nonprofit organization not affiliated with the Satanist Temple, the Satanic Grotto. After the event’s announcement on Facebook in February, outrage ensued. 
Leading up to Friday’s satanic protest, Christian counterprotests and Catholic services, the archbishop, Joseph Naumann, sued the grotto’s president, Michael Stewart, who was arrested Friday around 11:30 a.m. after entering the Statehouse. Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and legislative leadership tried in advance to limit the protest through modifications to Stewart’s permit to gather and new restrictions on Capitol building rules. A handful of Republican legislators attended the mass.

Naumann gave a sermon condemning the protests that were meant to cause “confusion” and “chaos,” he said. The efforts fostered confrontation and conflict, he said, and were designed to be “provocative.”
“What I do not understand is why we are giving our Capitol as a venue for what truly is hate speech,” he said.
He drew a connection between satanists and atheists after dissecting Stewart’s previous claims of religiosity, calling him a “so-called satanic worshiper but really an atheist.”
“The group — who is really pro-choice, pro-abortion and atheist — present their abortion advocacy as part of their fake religion so that they can claim religious rights are being violated by any efforts to provide protection to the unborn and their mothers,” Naumann said.
The antidote to the religious conflict unfolding in Topeka, Naumann said, was allowing people to see their faith.

“It’s sad, those who are trying to desecrate the Capitol today, desecrate symbols of faith — Bibles and crucifixes. Thank God, we don’t believe they have a consecrated host, but this is a sad state of life for them to be in. We need to pray for them,” he said.
Naumann’s lawsuit, which was dropped soon after it was filed, revolved around false claims that Stewart had obtained a consecrated host.
Inside and outside the church, law enforcement officers stood on watch as throngs of people gathered and moved on the Capitol grounds while those inside the church stayed mostly still.
Natalie Rowe, a 68-year-old lifelong Catholic, said she traveled Friday morning to Topeka from Wichita to be part of a strong showing. Before the mass began, she attended the archbishop’s eucharistic adoration, which involves praying before a consecrated host.
“The universe is very important to me,” she said. “My faith is very important to me.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Transgender children and teenagers would be barred from receiving hormone therapy and puberty blockers under a bill that passed the New Hampshire House Thursday on nearly party lines.
House Bill 377 would prohibit any medical procedures for people under 18 “for the purpose of altering or attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her gender or sex, if that perception is inconsistent with the minor’s biological sex.” That prohibition includes puberty-blocking and hormone medication. 
Democrats decried the bill as discriminatory against transgender children, and said parents should be able to decide whether their children should have the treatments. Opponents noted that the medications would be denied only to minors who are seeking to realize their gender identity but would still be available for certain physical conditions, which they said meant the bill is aimed at transgender people.
The bill “unfairly targets a very small number of minors from getting the care that their parents and their medical providers believe they need,” said Rep. Jessica LaMontagne, a Dover Democrat. “Despite what some proponents of this bill are telling you, these drugs are used safely and effectively for other reasons and their effects are reversible.”
A number of Democratic representatives read testimony from children who have received gender-affirming medication and have improved their lives. 
But Republicans argued the procedures are dangerous, are difficult to undo, and that too little is known about their side effects.
“These drugs are not perfectly safe,” said Rep. Erica Layon, a Derry Republican. “Anybody who says that is misleading parents, misleading kids, and misleading all of us.”
Much of the Republican caucus left the House chamber during Democrats’ speeches opposing the bill. 
The act specifically bans medical procedures “enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s biological sex and asserted identity.” Medical professionals who violate the proposed law could be charged with a Class B felony, which can carry up to seven years in prison and a fine of up to $4,000.
The bill has exceptions for procedures for minors “with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development.” And it would allow medical professionals who had already started a minor on such treatment before the bill takes effect to continue the treatment if stopping it “would cause harm to the minor,” but requires the dosage to be tapered and reduced. 
The bill would take effect Jan. 1, 2026.
HB 377 would expand upon a bill that passed in 2024 and that banned gender transition “bottom” surgeries for people under 18 in New Hampshire. Research indicates that gender-affirming procedures are rare for minors; a 2025 study from Harvard analyzing insurance claims from 2018 to 2022 found that about 0.1 percent of adolescents between age 8 and 17 have received puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy.
LaMontagne argued the bill prevented families from making the decision to support their child, and said the procedures usually follow years of therapy and discussion. 
“This body just passed the parental bill of rights that includes the right to make health care decisions,” she said. “So I call on all of you that voted for the parental bill of rights: Do you believe that parents know best, or do you not?”
Rep. Alice Wade, a Dover Democrat who is transgender, said the therapies helped her transition and saved her life during a period when she was suicidal. Wade transitioned after she turned 18 but argued that other teenagers benefit from the procedures. 
“Imagine receiving life-saving care, then having someone with no understanding or experience try to rip that away from you because they think they know better,” Wade said. 
She added: “When people in this body say that we need nuanced discussions and compromise, I agree. The problem is that my position is I’d like to have access to health care, equal treatment, and to mind my own business.” 
But Rep. Lisa Mazur, a Goffstown Republican, argued that children and families did not know the risks of what they are choosing to adopt.
“Children cannot fully comprehend the lifelong consequences of altering their bodies with powerful medications,” Mazur said. “… Gender dysphoria is real and it’s painful, and those struggling deserve compassion, but rushing minors into irreversible medical interventions is not the answer.”
Layon added: “Parents can’t give informed consent if they aren’t told of the risks of drugs and if they are told that the only alternative to treatment is as a dead child, because that is coercion and not consent.”
The bill passed 197-167, with two Democrats, Reps. Dale Girard of Claremont and Jonah Wheeler of Peterborough, joining Republicans in favor, and four Republicans, Reps. Nicholas Bridle of Hampton, David Nagel of Gilmanton, John Styek of Salem, and Susan Vandecasteele of Salem, joining Democrats opposed.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A state lawmaker wants to create a process to allow voters to recall elected state officials.
The Senate on Thursday passed Senate Bill 990, which is expected to be the vehicle to set up the process that Oklahomans can use to remove someone from office independent of the involvement from the Legislature.
“We all got to this room here by the will of the people, and currently, the only way a person can be removed from office is not by the will of the people,” said Sen. Bill Coleman, R-Ponca City. “It’s by our friends across the rotunda, and it’s on this body to remove somebody from statewide elective office.”
In Oklahoma, impeachment proceedings start in the House. If the House votes to impeach, a trial is held in the Senate and requires two-third of the senators, who serve as jurors,  to vote to remove a state official from office. 
Grounds for impeachment include willful neglect of duty, corruption in office, habitual drunkenness, incompetency, or any offense involving moral turpitude committed while in office. 
“What I want to do is change that to where the people, the people that elect somebody, decide whether or not somebody should be recalled,” Coleman said.
He said he envisions an initiative petition-like process requiring those seeking a recall election to collect signatures from 25% of the voters who cast ballots in the last gubernatorial election.
“It needs to be a high bar because overturning the will of the people is a big deal,” he said.
In order for citizens to qualify an initiative petition for the ballot, they must collect signatures from 8% of voters in the last gubernatorial election. 
To get a constitutional amendment on the ballot requires signatures from 15%.
Coleman said the final bill will have some guardrails so a person can’t be removed just because they are unpopular.
The current version of the bill only applies to statewide officers. Coleman said it will apply to state lawmakers.
Coleman said he has had a request to have it include county officers.
The current version creates a procedure for the Legislature to start the process, but Coleman wants to alter the measure so it can be done by members of the public.
“This is about a process, a process that the people of Oklahoma are locked out of,” Coleman said.
Sen. Dana Prieto, R-Tulsa, voted against the measure.
“This has the potential to be greatly abused,” Prieto said. “We have a process for it already and that is called elections.”
Some Democratic lawmakers have called for the impeachment of state Superintendent Ryan Walters, a Republican. But former House Speaker Charles McCall, R-Atoka, said the House would not pursue it unless Walters committed a crime.
In 2004, the Oklahoma House impeached Insurance Commissioner Carroll Fisher, a Democrat who had been convicted of embezzlement and perjury.
Fisher resigned before the Senate could hear the matter.
Senate Bill 990 passed by a vote of 31-15 and is available for consideration in the House.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Before the legislative session, Senate President Ben Albritton said tackling hunger would be one of his priorities. That is reflected in the $50 million slated for food bank grants in the Senate’s budget proposal unveiled this week.
While budget negotiations are just ramping up, the additional funding from the Senate could help food banks weather the loss of millions in federal funds they used to buy fresh produce.
Florida received $46.4 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture through the Local Food Purchase Assistance program, created in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act and later expanded by the Biden administration, according to a USDA database.
However, the Trump administration canceled the program earlier this month, meaning food banks won’t receive grants to purchase produce from farms they expected to get in the fall.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

What’s more, food bank directors learned this week of a funding freeze for federal food shipments through the USDA.
“It’s a big blow to our food bank network,” said Robin Safley, executive director of Feeding Florida, a network of nine food banks. “We have not seen a decline in demand. In fact, we’re probably seeing that inch up with some of the layoffs, as well. So it definitely is putting a huge and critical burden on our food banks.”
While Albritton teased the grant programs in the budget proposal before the session started, Safley says those funds are even more necessary in light of the federal funding cuts.
The Senate proposal includes two grant programs through the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services: $12 million to expand the infrastructure of food banks in rural communities, and another $38 million to help food banks buy products from Florida farmers.
“We’re running to this fight to connect hungry families across our state with Florida farmers who produce fresh, wholesome food,” Albritton wrote in a press release on Wednesday. “This is a much-needed hand-up for families and farmers across our state. As I travel the state, attacking food insecurity unites Floridians like nothing else can. Food matters.”
Feeding Florida would work with the agriculture department to identify which rural areas and underserved communities would get the funds for the infrastructure program.
“The cuts that are coming from the federal government are pretty severe, as well,” Safley said. “I guess it does soften the blow, because it’s money that we wouldn’t have had. Obviously, it has a long way to go in the Legislature.”
However, the House agriculture budget proposal doesn’t include either program, and House Speaker Daniel Perez is pushing for a $5 billion sales tax cut.

That’s according to a new state law Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed on Friday.
Senate Bill 73 changes New Mexico’s traffic law to allow cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs, and to treat red traffic lights as stop signs and proceed if there are no other cars, cyclists or pedestrians.
While it may seem counterintuitive to people who don’t use bicycles, this is already common practice among bicycle riders in New Mexico because a cyclist wants to carry their momentum on the bike, said Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, who carried the bill, during a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Doing this gets the cyclist out of the blind spot of motorists who have stopped at an intersection, Sedillo Lopez told the committee.
Eric Biedermann, a board member at-large of nonprofit advocacy organization BikeABQ, told the committee being able to treat a stop sign as a yield sign and a traffic light as a stop sign enhances cyclist safety because it reduces their exposure to cars, increases their visibility to cars and reduces the risk of being “right hooked” if a car doesn’t see them or a “left cross” from oncoming traffic.
“There are a number of ways in which being able to proceed through an intersection with a head start before the cars move really enhances cyclist safety,” Biedermann told the committee. He was also speaking on behalf of Bike Santa Fe and Velo Cruces.
The so-called “Idaho stop” — taking its name from the first U.S. state to ease traffic laws for cyclists — resulted in a 14.5% reduction in cyclist injuries a year after the state of Idaho enacted a similar law in 1982, according to a review of Idaho Office of Highway Safety data.
In New Mexico, between 2019 and 2023, 1,457 cyclists had crashes, according to the University of New Mexico Geospatial and Population Studies Center. Of those, 39 were killed, 115 were seriously injured and 694 were able to walk away.
Lynn Pickard, a retired New Mexico Court of Appeals judge and member of Santa Fe Seniors on Bikes, told the committee data show that as many as half of collisions between cars and bikes happen within intersections.
“So anything we can do to get cyclists into and out of the intersections quickly — leaving of course, for us, to determine our own safety if there are other cars there or pedestrians there — would be really helpful for us,” she said.

In a complaint filed this week with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, the Kennewick School Board said it’s in a bind: Either comply with state law and jeopardize federal funding, or follow President Donald Trump and risk punishment from the state.
“The Kennewick School Board is committed to ensuring the protection of biological female athletics, maintaining ‘all-female’ locker rooms separate from male locker rooms, and prioritizing the privacy rights of our students,” the complaint reads. “However, we find ourselves caught between conflicting directives that threaten not only our federal funding but also the rights and values of the families we serve.”
The board, with 19,000 students enrolled this school year, filed the complaint against the state, Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal, his office and the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association over “open and egregious Title IX violations.”
Last month, Trump signed an executive order seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports by, in part, withholding federal funding for districts that “deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.” 
The board specifically cites the state-sanctioned participation of a transgender track athlete as a violation of that order. They also see conflicts between state law and Trump’s orders in policies on preferred pronouns, parental rights, and restroom access based on gender identity.
Enacted in 1972, Title IX prohibited sex-based discrimination in schools receiving federal funding. The civil rights law increased the participation of female student athletes, and also provided an avenue for girls and women to bring complaints of sex discrimination. 
The school board approved the complaint in a 4-0 vote Wednesday, with board member Michael Connors abstaining. In the meeting, Connors told his colleagues, “we took a vow to follow the laws. Full stop.”
“The only way we do this is by finding a way to change the law,” he continued. “So if you guys think we can do that with this letter, then go nuts. I’m not taking any part of this deal because I have already stated we should not be going down this political road.”
In a statement, Reykdal said his office “has continued to advise Washington’s school districts to stay in compliance with state law, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity.” 
He added Trump’s order “attempts to override the authority of states and local school districts by requiring educational institutions to agree to discriminate against trans female athletes in order to continue receiving federal funds.”
“An executive order is not law, and it does not override state law,” Reykdal continued. “OSPI will enforce our current laws as we are required to do in a constitutional democracy until Congress changes the law and/or federal courts invalidate Washington state’s laws.”
He said the state is prepared to take legal action if the Trump administration withholds funding.
The U.S. Department of Education didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday on the complaint.
This is the latest in the developing federal-state showdown over trans athletes participating in sports in line with their gender identity. Broadly, the Trump administration has tried in its first two months in office to limit how transgender people participate in American society. 
This month, the Department of Education launched an investigation into the Tumwater School District, near Olympia, for letting a transgender athlete from another school compete in a girls’ high school basketball game. A district spokesperson had no update on the case Friday.
In a very similar letter to the one from Kennewick, the Mead School Board outside Spokane also asked for federal intervention on the issue, but stopped short of filing a formal complaint.
And the Moses Lake School Board also asked for federal help last week. 
The Washington Interscholastic Activities Association, tasked with setting policy for school sports, is scheduled to vote next month on two proposals related to trans girls playing sports. One would bar trans girls from participating in girls’ sports. Another would create a separate division where trans athletes can compete.

(Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images)Nearly 20 years ago, my wife and I were lucky enough to study abroad in England. We had been awarded graduate scholarships and obtained our student visas from the British government. At the time, there was a heartbreaking genocide happening in Darfur. As concerned students invested in the moral standing of our university, we joined peaceful protests calling on Oxford to divest from companies that profited from the genocide and urged the British Parliament to intervene.

I never feared that my exercise of free speech would get me arrested and kicked out of what I took to be the second freest nation on earth, after my own. And I certainly could not have imagined a swarm of British agents abducting me on the street and deporting me without cause. Perhaps in the time of King George III but not the age of constitutions.



On Tuesday, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University in Boston, was walking peacefully to the university’s Interfaith Center to break her Ramadan fast when six government agents in masks and hoodies surrounded her and took her away screaming in an unmarked SUV.
For a day or more, according to Fox News, Rumeysa’s family and lawyers had no idea where she was and were unable to contact her. No charges were filed against her. A federal district judge even ordered the government not to move her out of state. But she was moved anyway — to a detention center in Louisiana, awaiting deportation.
Rumeysa had a valid student visa, as Fox News also reported. She was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to complete her Ph.D. at Tufts’ Department of Child Study and Human Development, where she researches children and media. No charges were filed against her and there was no warrant for her arrest; warrants are issued by judges who require the government to show cause.
The best guess for why she has been detained is that her name appeared with several others on an article in the student newspaper last year calling on Tufts University to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies with ties to Israel. The op-ed never mentioned Hamas, which the U.S. government rightly considers a terrorist organization. There is no evidence that she harbored any sympathy for, much less aided and abetted, Hamas or other organizations opposed to the United States. It seems her only “crime” was to peacefully speak out, as a concerned student, in a manner disfavored by the current administration.
Americans may freely disagree about the heartbreaking conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has left thousands of innocent Israelis and hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians dead or injured in recent years. For my part, having traveled to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and believing in the state of Israel as a necessary response to the evils of the Holocaust (in which Jewish family members of mine were killed), I take seriously the conclusions of the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International that Israel’s war in Gaza is a “plausible” genocide.
But regardless of what we believe about Israel and Palestine, there is one thing on which Americans overwhelmingly agree: our constitutional right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment is sacred and immigrants who lawfully reside among us are not without rights of their own. As you uphold my right to call the war in Gaza genocidal, I defend your right to call Hamas an evil terrorist organization. In fact, I’ll join in that because it is also true.
Freedom of speech is as American as apple pie. It’s what has attracted many of the brightest minds from foreign lands to come here legally as students and help make America the richest, most innovative nation on earth — including Elon Musk.
Sadly, Rumeysa is not alone. She is one of hundreds of lawful immigrants so far who have been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration in recent weeks, without any pretense of due process. Their abductions on American streets by unmarked and unidentified “law enforcement” agents are being funded by our tax dollars to the tune of untold millions.
So far we have seen at least seven other students detained for showing sympathy for Palestinians; hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported to a Salvadoran prison camp against the orders of a federal judge, and extended detentions and physical abuse of lawful migrants at the American border. These and countless other acts represent an unprecedented abuse of federal power against individuals whose lack of citizenship gives them limited legal recourse, in spite of their legal status in this country.
Given the choice, I still believe my fellow Americans would choose the Constitution over a man who would be king. It’s time we make that choice — not just for Rumeysa but for this country we love.

Hundreds of Catholics conducted a counter-protest in opposition of Satanic Grotto's presence in Topeka. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — The bullhorn-powered war of words between satanists and Catholics boiled over into brawling and a handful of arrests Friday during an extraordinary event at the Kansas Capitol that pushed boundaries of free speech and the separation of church and state.
After about two hours of speeches, prayers and sign waving among hundreds of people mostly segregated by barricades staffed by law enforcement officers, Satanic Grotto president Michael Stewart, with supporters and reporters in tow, entering the Statehouse to conduct what he had described as a black mass. He was warned at the door to the visitors’ center that any formal protest inside the building that violated a permit limiting his religious expression to the lawn or steps of the Capitol would result in his arrest for trespassing.
In the rotunda, Stewart began the mass demonstration and was interrupted by three people intent on stopping an exercise that could be interpreted a mockery of their faith. An unidentified man and woman, with young kids at their side, physically intervened to stop Stewart. He turned away from them. Counter-protester Marcus Schroeder joined the fray and twice reached to take papers from Stewart’s hand. Stewart responded by punching Schroeder in the face twice. More than half a dozen Capitol Police wrestled Stewart to the floor to make the arrest.
“I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting,” Stewart repeatedly yelled.
Schroeder, who wore a shirt declaring “Death is not welcome here,” wasn’t arrested by Capitol Police. In an interview, he defended his maneuvering to thwart Stewart.
“I tried to take his papers. He punched me in the face,” he said.
After the area cleared, two other satanists tried to pick up where Stewart left off and were taken into custody. One other person was cuffed and taken away by law enforcement outside the Capitol on Friday. An individual grabbed Stewart by the legs in a bid to stop Stewart from stomping on crackers intended to represent those used in a Catholic mass to represent the consecrated body and soul of Christ. In that brief exchange, Stewart also punched the guy before law enforcement stepped in.
“He was was trying to tackle me to get to the cracker underneath,” Stewart said. “I was able to kind of fend him off. I do think he may have picked up the crumbled cracker and ate it. Did I get physical with him? Yes.”
 
  Hundreds of Christians upset with an organization’s plan to conduct a satanic black mass at the Capitol delivered a robust counter-protest to emphasize their disdain for followers of Satanic Grotto. Both sides of the debate used bullhorns to punctuate their messages, creating a blended sound that was difficult for anybody to hear clearly. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)
The opposition
The colorful display of affection and affliction for organized religion culminated attempts by Gov. Laura Kelly, Attorney General Kris Kobach, leaders of the Kansas Legislature and Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, to derail the demonstration planned by Satanic Grotto.
Kelly had the group’s permit amended so no protest could transpire inside the Capitol. Legislative leaders modified policy regarding use of the Capitol to specifically target Satanic Grotto. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Wichita, said the First Amendment didn’t protect offensive speech or violations of law.
Francis Slobodnik, a Topeka representative of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, told hundreds of Catholics gathered on the south side of the Capitol that state public officials shouldn’t have allowed satanists to assemble on public property. He said the event reflected a misguided understanding of freedom of speech and religion and a lack of appreciation for how a black mass represented worship of Satan.
“Today’s horrific event, the first of its kind in the history of Kansas, is a sacrilege,” Slobodnik said. “Of course, there have been terrible crimes and injustices that have happened in our state over the years. However, nothing in our past compares with what is happening today where God is being directly challenged on the state Capitol grounds. The state Capitol represents all of us.”
He praised the people present at the rally to stand in opposition to Satanic Grotto, referring to them as the Navy Seals of the Catholic faith. He said these activists were willing to confront God’s enemies head-on as if on a field of battle. He said the great sin perpetrated by Stewart and other worshipers of Satan meant that others had to step into the void.
“Satanists do not realize that Satan hates all of God’s creation, including them,” Slobodnik said. “Their reward for worshiping and serving him will be eternal fire.”
 
And, an exorcist
Former U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, who served in the Kansas Senate before elected to Congress, said he consulted with a priest with experience in exorcism to figure whether he should participate in a television interview with Stewart.
“Father had a simple question: ‘Why would you do this? What do you hope to gain?’ I stumbled around in my answer,” Huelskamp said. “I wanted to share the truth about Christ. The truth about the Eucharist. His summary response was quite stunning to me. He said, ‘There is no good that could come from being in the same room with a Satanist.'”
Huelskamp said it was suggested his participation in the interview with Stewart might serve interests of Satan. The former Republican congressman woke ill the next day, and cancelled the interview. In the end, Huelskamp said he decided it was important to run to the fire created by Satan rather than shrink from it. He said it was the same as making his views known about the evil of abortion and defending the sanctity of marriage between a man and woman.
“I am quite stubborn and hardheaded,” he said. “We cannot be silent. We are required, if we call ourselves Christians, if we call ourselves Catholic, we are publicly required to defend the faith and to stand up for the truth.”
In an interview amid calm before the storm of his arrest, Stewart said he was convinced Catholics assembled around him didn’t understand why Satanic Grotto was at the Capitol to talk about religious oppression.
“What we only want is the rights that every American has,” Stewart said. “I’ve heard people say we’re setting a precedent. Well, if the precedent is freedom of religion for everyone in public spaces, yes, that’s what we’re trying to establish. We are dragging this issue out in the light and we’ll let the people look at it. The issue is that we’re not all being treated the same here.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Stewart-arrest-peace-signs-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-28 15:03:19.983995

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The University of Louisiana System has named an interim president at its Monroe campus to step in and deal with the university’s budget shortfall while a search for a permanent president plays out. 
The UL System Board of Supervisors Executive Committee met Friday to make the unusual move of installing former UL-Monroe leader Nick Bruno to fill the role and putting current President Ronald Berry on administrative leave during the search for his permanent replacement. 
UL System Board Chairman Mark Romero said an interim president was chosen to deal with the university’s budget shortfall. ULM has to find a way to fill a $5 million to $6 million hole by the end of the fiscal year in June, according to UL System President Rick Gallot. The gap could be addressed through a combination of cuts and transfers from the university’s foundation and other supporting organizations, Gallot said, but Bruno will ultimately determine the specifics. 
Berry was placed on administrative leave effective immediately, with Bruno taking over Monday. Bill Graves, ULM vice president for business affairs, was deputized to make any decisions for the university over the weekend. 
Berry’s administrative leave is not punitive, Romero and Gallot said, and he will continue to be paid during the transition period. Berry receives an annual salary of $305,704, and he will return to the classroom as a professor at the university in the fall. 
Berry has served as university president since 2020, when Bruno retired after 10 years in charge. 
Romero said Bruno, 73, is not likely to seek the permanent position, which the board hopes to fill in May.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe opposes the pipeline, citing concerns for its water supply. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A federal judge dismissed the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking to shutter the Dakota Access Pipeline, finding that the tribe must wait until the Army Corps finishes a key environmental study to bring another legal challenge against the agency.
“No matter its frustration with Defendants’ sluggish pace, it is not yet entitled to a second bite at the apple,” U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a Friday order.
Standing Rock filed the lawsuit in October, arguing that Corps is violating federal law by allowing the pipeline to operate without an easement. The tribe also claimed that the Corps failed to properly study the environmental impacts of the Dakota Access Pipeline or require its developer to prepare adequate spill response plans, among other alleged violations.
The suit is a successor to a lawsuit the tribe filed against the same agency in 2016.
 
More Dakota Access Pipeline coverage


In that case, Boasberg in 2020 found the Army Corps had violated federal law by not conducting a full environmental impact study before granting an easement allowing the pipeline to cross underneath the Missouri River. He pulled the easement and ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline to be drained of oil pending the Army Corps’ completion of the study. 
An appellate court in 2021 reversed Boasberg’s decision to shut down the pipeline, but did not reinstate the easement.
Boasberg wrote in a 2021 order following that decision that he could not shutter the pipeline because the tribe hadn’t sufficiently demonstrated that it posed an immediate threat of irreparable harm.
He noted in his Friday memo that “remarkably little” has changed in the four years since.
“Once more unto the breach, dear friends,” Boasberg wrote at the beginning of the order, quoting Shakespeare’s “Henry V”.
The Army Corps still has not finished the environmental impact study. It published a draft version of its report in late 2023. Once the study is complete, the Army Corps will use it to decide whether to grant the easement again.
One of the main arguments the tribe made in its 2024 lawsuit is that the Army Corps’ yearslong inaction on the Dakota Access Pipeline is a violation of federal law.
Boasberg wrote previously that, given the pipeline is operating on Army Corps land without proper authorization, the agency in the interim could have done something to enforce its property rights.
“The Corps has conspicuously declined to adopt a conclusive position regarding the pipeline’s continued operation, despite repeated prodding from this Court and the Court of Appeals to do so,” he wrote in his 2021 order.
But the Army Corps for now is not legally required to do anything but finish the environmental impact study, Boasberg stated in the Friday memo.
He said that other arguments Standing Rock raised in its complaint seek to relitigate issues that were already decided in the 2016 case, and that the legal landscape is not likely to change until the study is completed.
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe files new lawsuit over DAPL

Boasberg noted that Standing Rock can file another lawsuit against the Corps once the study is published. The Army Corps of Engineers in legal filings also argued the tribe cannot sue the Corps over the easement when it had not yet made a final decision on the permit.
The tribe indicated last fall that it had new evidence to present related to the pipeline’s safety. The pipeline company has indicated previously it does not consider that information credible.
North Dakota, other states and pipeline owner Dakota Access intervened in the lawsuit on the side of the Corps. The intervenors called on the court to dismiss the case, arguing that the pipeline is important to the country’s economy, and that shutting it down would violate states’ rights and make road and rail transit less safe.
“The Dakota Access Pipeline has been operating safely for almost eight years now and is a critical piece of infrastructure for North Dakota and our nation’s energy security,” North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement regarding Boasberg’s decision.
A spokesperson for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Army Corps of Engineers declined to comment.
“The Corps has failed to act and failed to protect the tribe,” Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire said in an October press conference announcing the lawsuit.
The pipeline, which spans more than 1,000 miles, carries crude oil from northwest North Dakota to Illinois. Its pathway includes unceded land recognized as the Sioux Nation’s in 19th century treaties signed by the U.S. government.

Spencer Cox signed a legislative proposal into law Thursday night. The action comes amid a wave of skepticism toward public health measures exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Fluoride often occurs naturally in water systems, but some local governments have added extra to help prevent cavities. While dentists have attributed dramatic improvements in oral health to the practice — especially in vulnerable communities — some question whether ingesting the substance is safe, even in the relatively low levels water systems use.

HB81, sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, blurred party lines on its legislative path, but it ultimately passed the Legislature with comfortable margins. The bill’s approval also undoes a longtime practice of leaving it to municipalities in the state to allow their constituents to vote on whether to add fluoride to their water. 
However, the discussion, Gricius said during bill presentations, was still about freedom of choice.
Utah Legislature approves ban on cities adding fluoride in public water

“I would just say it doesn’t get more local control than my own body,” she said about potentially overriding the decisions of local governments.
Many members of the public lined up during committee hearings, showing a definite divide on the issue; dentists expressed concern about the adverse public health consequences of removing fluoride from the state’s drinking water, and some local government representatives supported the bill, citing economic woes and worries about controlling dosages.
Similar anti-fluoridation efforts have emerged across the country, while public health experts warn that the skepticism has been fueled by problematic studies and misinformation. 
The bill doesn’t prohibit Utahns from taking fluoride supplements if they choose, and opens the door for pharmacists to prescribe it.
However, dentists worry that may not be enough to fight tooth decay. 
“Despite my efforts in education, in prescribing fluoride and working with parents, the voluntary application does not always work for those that may be most vulnerable,” Dr. Sarah Woolsey, a family physician who has practiced for decades in Utah underserved communities, said during a House Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Committee hearing in January.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun on Friday announced business-focused Indianapolis attorney Jennifer Ruby will take over the state’s vacant public access counselor role.
“Transparency for Hoosiers is important for a healthy state government, and Jennifer Ruby brings decades of legal expertise to serve Hoosiers as Public Access Counselor,” Braun said in a news release. “She will do a great job promoting public trust through transparency and accountability.”
Ruby said she was “honored” to be chosen for the job — and to “uphold the values of government transparency and accountability.”
“Public access is essential for effective governance, and I look forward to serving our state in this role,” she added.
Ruby is president, CEO and lead attorney at her Indianapolis-based firm, Ruby Law. She counsels clients on estate and succession planning; real estate issues; contracts and “general business issues,” according to her LinkedIn — although her “favorite areas of interest” are identified as life sciences, information technology, education and business development. She also is a mediator.
Ruby holds a law degree and a master’s degree in planning from Indiana University, and an undergraduate degree in biochemistry from Purdue University.
Hoosier lawmakers decline to remove public records chief restrictions

The Office of the Public Access Counselor provides guidance on state public records and open meeting laws: it responds to informal inquiries on the laws, issues non-binding advisory opinions, recommends improvements to the Indiana General Assembly, educates officials and Hoosiers on rights and responsibilities, and more, according to the office’s website.
The General Assembly created the office in 1999.
Until last year, the officeholder served four-year terms — and could only be fired “for cause.” But lawmakers changed that during the last legislative session.
Now, the governor can remove the public access counselor at any time — leaving the appointee vulnerable to dismissal for opinions that powerful state leaders dislike. The officeholder is also now limited to using only the law’s “plain text” and official court orders in writing those opinions.
Indiana’s longest-serving public access counselor, Luke Britt, stepped down in February, several months after the changes went into effect. His resignation came after 12 years; he was first appointed in 2013 by Republican former Gov. Mike Pence and reappointed twice by former Gov. Eric Holcomb, also a Republican.
Britt told WFYI that his role was “fundamentally changed.”
“I’d always said that if I found that my voice was getting ineffective, it was time to leave. And that might have been my sign with that legislation,” he said.

Brad Ketcher, a St. Louis attorney who was chief of staff to Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan in the 1990s, said he hopes the effort spreads to other states to fight back against Tesla CEO Elon Musk for his lead role in mass federal layoffs and budget cuts for President Donald Trump.
“If Elon Musk was not cutting Medicaid and Social Security and veterans health to fund a tax cut for billionaires and doing it with a bizarre glee, we would not be asking Missourians to say this guy does not deserve to be doing business in this state,” Ketcher said. “We would not be trying to drive this in Missouri.”
Tesla did not immediately respond to an email from The Independent seeking comment on the initiative.
Soon after winning election in November, Trump named Musk to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency with instructions to find savings in the federal budget.
Since taking office, Musk has, among other actions, closed the U.S. Agency for International Development, been granted access to payment systems delivering benefits to millions of Americans, put the entire Department of Education on the chopping block and slashed the staff of the Social Security Administration.
Many of those actions have been challenged in court and temporarily halted. Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, are pushing through a budget resolution that would extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 while making deep cuts in Medicaid and food programs.
The initiatives filed with the secretary of state’s office would use Missouri’s law governing motor vehicle sales, which requires new cars, trucks and motorcycles to be sold through franchised dealers, to force Tesla out. Two versions were filed Friday, and more may be written before the signature drive begins, Ketcher said.
The petitions must be reviewed and put out for public comment before the signature drive.
Prior to the arrival of Tesla, all new motor vehicles sold in Missouri were purchased at authorized franchises with ownership independent of the manufacturer. In 2013, the Department of Revenue licensed a franchise owned by Tesla for a St. Louis showroom and followed it up the next year by licensing a Kansas City showroom.
The initiatives would cause those licenses to be revoked. The first version filed states that “it is the express intent of the people to prevent any manufacturer of new motor vehicles from circumventing the public policy as stated in (state law) by engaging in methods of retailing new motor vehicles which are designed to avoid the provisions” of that law.
To make the ballot, the committee called UnPlug Musk must gather at least 106,384 signatures properly distributed among six of the state’s congressional districts. The petition drive must be complete by the start of May 2026.
Ketcher said that so far, he and former state Rep. Deb Lavender, a St. Louis County Democrat, treasurer of the committee, are the only people enlisted for the effort. He hopes to build a coalition quickly, he said.
“This gives Missourians a chance to say this guy is not welcome to do business in our state,” Ketcher said.
The petition drive would not be the first attempt to use state law to keep Tesla from opening its company-owned showrooms in Missouri. In 2014, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, then a state senator, helped write a provision for a bill that fell just short of passing to require all auto manufacturers to sell their vehicles through a franchise dealership.
Kehoe owned Ford and Lincoln-Mercury franchises in Jefferson City from 1992 to 2011. He sold the dealerships before entering politics.
He told the Springfield News-Leader in 2014 that he was surprised the department issued a dealership license to Tesla.
“Our question as dealers and people I know in the business: how in the world when we’ve worked so hard to get franchise legislation, how in the world could that be possible?” Kehoe said to the News-Leader.
The Missouri Automobile Dealers Association and others sued the department over its licensing decision, winning at the trial court level before the Western District Court of Appeals ruled none of the plaintiffs had a legal right to challenge the licenses.
In its briefs for the appeals court, Tesla acknowledged that the legislature could block it from having manufacturer-owned dealerships.
“Plainly, if the legislature had wanted to erect a blanket direct sales ban, it could and would have done so clearly and straightforwardly by amending the existing partial ban in the franchise act,” attorneys wrote.
The auto dealers did not return a call seeking comment on the initiative.
There are some states where Tesla is not operating dealerships because of franchise laws. In Wisconsin, where Musk is spending millions on the state Supreme Court election, Tesla is suing to overturn the franchise law.
Ketcher said he wants the effort to be joined by groups from other states with the initiative petition process and Democratically-controlled legislatures.
“Even in red states, somebody can hold up an amendment, and say, here’s the amendment to drive Tesla, drive Musk, out of our state,” he said.
The language of the initiative, Ketcher said, is taken, with only technical changes, from the provisions Kehoe supplied for the 2014 bill. Tesla attorneys acknowledged during the litigation that it would effectively shut down their showrooms, Ketcher noted.
“They’ve given us plans for the Death Star,” Ketcher said. “And when when somebody gives you the plans for Death Star, you know what to do.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Providence Public School District (PPSD) finished sending out its annual batch of “displacement” notices earlier this week, letting teachers know they would need to find and apply for alternate positions in the city’s 37 schools. 
The number of teachers being shuffled around is nearly half as many as it was last year: There were 209 Providence Teachers Union (PTU) positions displaced this year, compared to 384 last year.
“To be clear, being displaced is not the same as being laid off or non-renewed,” Herman James, the district’s chief talent officer wrote, in a March 24 letter updating the Providence School Board on this year’s displacements. In his letter, James gave the hypothetical example of a school that’s slimming its social studies department, meaning a qualified teacher will have to find a relevant job elsewhere in another of the district’s schools.  
The three highest categories of teachers displaced this year were those working in high school English language arts (31 displacements) and special education (24 displacements), followed by 23 displacements issued for elementary school teachers. There were 16 displacements for both physical education instructors and early childhood teachers, and nine for English as Second Language teachers.
Jay G. Wégimont, a spokesperson for PPSD, said via email the displacement process happens annually each spring and is shaped by the teachers’ union contract. 
“It’s worth noting that this happens in large urban districts across the country and this annual staffing process occurs in districts across Rhode Island due to shifts in student enrollment, programmatic changes, budgetary considerations, and licensure compliance requirements,” Wégimont wrote. 
The Providence Teachers Union did not respond to requests for comment, but has expressed concern in the past to media outlets that displaced teachers aren’t always able to find equivalent positions and can potentially face layoffs. 
There are more available positions in the district than there are displacements, according to James’ letter. As of Wednesday, there are 260 open positions for PTU roles, according to James.
There were also 95 teacher assistants displaced this year. They’ll be able to vie for 104 open positions starting April 7, according to James’ letter. Last year, 206 teacher assistants received displacement notices. 
Last year’s considerable number of teacher displacements derived partly from school mergers and closures which saw educators shuffled around from schools like 360 High School and Gilbert Stuart Middle School, both of which closed last spring. 
In 2024, enrollment in the state-controlled public school district rose 2% — the first increase since the 2018 school year, according to data from the state education department.

(Photo by Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)A student at the University of Alabama was taken into custody by federal immigration authorities Tuesday, according to a university spokesperson.
The university did not name the student because “federal privacy laws [that] limit what can be shared about an individual student.” Alex House, a spokesperson for UA, said in the statement that international students are “valued members” of the university, but that UA will continue to cooperate with immigration officials.
House did not respond to questions about whether the university is assisting the student or the family with legal assistance.
“UA has and will continue to follow all immigration laws and cooperate with federal authorities,” House said in a media statement.
The student’s identity was not shared by the university, but Crimson White, the university’s student-run newspaper, reported Wednesday evening that Alireza Doroudi was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) early Tuesday morning.
According to ICE detainee locator, as of Thursday morning Doroudi was “in ICE custody,” but it does not list the detention facility. House did not respond to whether UA is trying to locate the student, but a person at the Pickens County Jail confirmed late Thursday morning that he was being held at the facility and should be transported to an ICE facility in the next couple of days, though they declined to provide their identity.
It’s unclear why Doroudi was detained, but Christian Martin, a student organizer with Students for Justice in Palestine, said in a statement that Doroudi had no involvement with the organization or the protests related to the organization.
“We recognize that there is minimal information about the cause for M. Doroudi’s detainment,” Martin said in a statement, adding that “Doroudi was not nor has ever been involved with Students for Justice in Palestine.”
International students across the country have been detained by ICE in recent weeks. Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia student, was detained by immigration officials in early March for his role in negotiations with the university over protests due to the war in Gaza. Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, was taken Tuesday night by immigration officials who had their faces covered. One resident who witnessed Ozturk said it looked like a “kidnapping.” Barnard College student Yunseo Chung was detained after she participated in the protests against the war. Chung has sued to prevent deportation.
According to the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, 1,207 international students were enrolled at the University of Alabama in Fall 2024.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) LSU released a list of budget belt-tightening measures Friday in response to the uncertainty of federal funding as President Donald Trump’s administration slashes research spending. 
The university will implement a hiring freeze, eliminate “duplicative” jobs and centralize some positions. It will also withhold 2% of each department’s budget starting July 1 and will convene a committee to explore using artificial intelligence to “reduce administrative burdens and enhance productivity.” 
“Uncertainty in federal funding and future support should not hinder our growth or momentum. Instead, we must transform challenges into opportunities,” LSU President William Tate wrote in a campus wide email sent Friday morning. 
Universities, particularly research institutions such as LSU, are bracing for tough times as the Trump administration makes dramatic reductions to agencies that fund research on college campuses, medical schools and affiliated research institutions. Many of these cuts are on pause, pending the outcome of litigation. 
LSU spent $488 million on research in fiscal year 2023, the most recent period for which data is available. Most of that money came from federal grants. 
LSU could lose $12 million if the Trump administration’s proposed cut to indirect costs for National Institutes of Health grants are allowed to go into effect, and it would lose tens of millions more if other agencies followed suit. 
The research universities conduct has an economic impact as well as an academic one. Federal research grants directly support hundreds of graduate assistants and other employees at universities. LSU estimates the economic impact of NIH funding alone is around $550 million. 
Departments can earn back 0.5% of the 2% being withheld if they meet certain benchmarks, Tate wrote, including the “removal of student hurdles to progression,” though he did not provide any specific details on what that will entail. The other 1.5% will go to a fund to support academic and research initiatives. 
In addition to the budget restrictions, Tate said the university is looking to expand LSU Online enrollment. LSU Online is distinct from the university, which does offer some online courses as part of its on-campus degree programs. Tate said this expansion will support the university’s growth. 
Tate’s email also announced initiatives for student success and growing research spending. LSU is seeking to gain entry into the prestigious Association of American Universities. To do so, it has to expand its research spending significantly, which will be difficult as the Trump administration puts university funding in its crosshairs.

DemasA decade after taking the lead on matters of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, at the university level, the University of Michigan announced Thursday it will cease all formal efforts in that regard. 
In an email sent to faculty, staff and the university community, officials said they were closing U of M’s Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Office for Health Equity and Inclusion, while also halting its DEI 2.0 Strategic Plan
The changes, which are effective immediately, come in the wake of executive orders from President Donald Trump ending all DEI “mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities” in the federal government, and forbidding federal contractors from considering “race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin” in employment, procurement, and contracting practices.
“These decisions have not been made lightly. We recognize the changes are significant and will be challenging for many of us, especially those whose lives and careers have been enriched by and dedicated to programs that are now pivoting,” stated an email signed by university officials, including President Santa J. Ono and Provost Laurie K. McCauley.
Noting that federal actions against DEI programming had intensified in recent weeks, including another executive order to “facilitate the closure” of the U.S. Education Department, university officials said the decisions were made after an “assessment of input from various stakeholders regarding our DEI programs…and after conversations with Regents, university leaders, deans and government officials”. It’s not known exactly how many employees will be impacted by the changes, but a 2021 report by the Heritage Foundation, the same organization that produced Project 2025, U of M employed 163 people on DEI initiatives.
The announcement is a complete turnaround for the university which previously touted itself as having led “an unprecedented campus-wide DEI Strategic Plan in 2015,” in which it had “shown uncommon leadership in its commitment to higher education access, equity, and positive cultural change.” That initial plan ran from 2016 to 2021.
The university’s DEI 2.0 Strategic Plan, launched in 2023 and initially set to continue through 2028, will be halted immediately. It had a stated “commitment to ensuring a diverse, equitable and inclusive community with even more sharply defined goals, new innovations and investments, and enhanced measures of accountability”.
U of M Board of Regents Chair Sarah Hubbard, a Republican, defended the changes, posting on social media that the money being saved by ending its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives would instead be used “to support making Michigan more affordable for our students and families through expansion of the Go Blue Guarantee to family incomes of $125,000 or less and other student facing supports.” Hubbard insisted that “eliminating bureaucratic overspending” would  make U of M more accessible.
That was echoed by Regent Jordan Acker, a Democrat, who said the policy changes were “fundamentally about improving our diversity efforts to make them work better.”
Acker, who began voicing concerns over the university’s DEI programs last year, said the university had spent $250 million on diversity efforts in recent years, much of it to administrative overhead, while the population of minority students had seen little growth.
“At Michigan, the focus of our diversity efforts needs to be meaningful change, not bureaucracy,” he posted.
However, the decision has also drawn criticism, including from ACLU Michigan, which released a statement late Thursday condemning what it viewed as acquiescence to authoritarianism. 
“In a moment when we need leaders to be vigilant in defending our collective communities, it is extremely disappointing to see a public institution like the University of Michigan succumbing to authoritarian bullying of the Trump administration without a fight,” read the statement.
“While the University certainly did not make this decision lightly, many of our community institutions – such as our local libraries, schools and other institutions of higher education – are fighting to adhere to their values under enormous pressure, while one of our largest, most well-resourced institutions with a history and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, has capitulated,” it stated.
Rebekah Modrak, the chair of the university’s Faculty Senate and a professor at the Stamps School of Art, referred to the sweeping executive orders as “the power of the government to engineer a sweeping culture change towards white supremacy,” and said the university’s leadership “seem determined to comply and to collaborate in our own destruction.”
Modrak questioned what the ultimate outcome of this decision would be. 
“These missteps by our university will not end here; they will lead, as they have done in Texas and Ohio, to the censorship of course and program content,” she said.

The survey of 656 Rhode Islanders conducted online and by text message between March 20 and 24, found 40% approve of Trump’s performance so far, while 59% had negative views of his handling of foreign and domestic affairs.
UNH’s poll has a 3.8% margin of error. 
The top reason for disapproving of the president was concern that he is undermining democracy or the U.S. Constitution, cited by 21% of opponents. Among those who approve of Trump’s second term, 27% pointed to his handling of immigration as their main reason for support.
Trump’s unpopularity was weighed by overwhelming disapproval — 94% — from registered Democrats, who made up 53% of those surveyed. 
Democrats make up 36% of the electorate, according to data compiled by the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s office. Republicans make up 15% of the state’s registered voters. The biggest swath of voters — 49% — are unaffiliated with either party.
Rhode Islanders also disapproved of his handling of the economy, use of tariffs and the potential for a recession, along with his handling of the war in Ukraine.
On the economy, only one-third of Rhode Island residents polled by UNH approve of Trump’s use of tariﬀs. Nearly all Democrats — 93% — disapproved of the taxes placed on imports. Eighty percent of Rhode Island Republicans and half of Independents surveyed support the policy.
UNH’s poll also found that 61% of Rhode Islanders disavowed Trump’s handling of the war in Ukraine and the president’s assertions over who is responsible for the conflict. Trump has alluded to the idea that Ukraine started the war in 2022, but 78% of those polled believe that Russia is either entirely or mostly responsible.
A majority of Rhode Islanders do approve of one plank of Trump’s agenda: banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. The UNH poll found 65% of respondents believe transgender female athletes should “definitely not” be able to compete in contests with cis women.
Rhode Islanders are slightly more accepting of transgender athletes in men’s sports, with 56% of respondents believing they should not be allowed to compete.
Those surveyed were divided on who should set athletic policies, with 44% favoring a federal decision, 40% supporting state-level action, and the rest unsure.

(Photo by Getty Images)Starting on June 20, police in New Mexico will no longer have the authority to determine whether to issue a public alert for a missing person suffering from Alzheimer’s, dementia or other cognitive decline.
Instead, the decision to issue a “Silver Alert” will be up to whoever is reporting the person missing, and the missing person will not require a formal diagnosis, under a new state law signed on March 21 by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
House Bill 197, which expands the eligibility for local police departments or the New Mexico State Police to issue the alerts, received unanimous approval by all three legislative committees that heard it, along with both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Previously, state law excluded from Silver Alerts people with general cognitive decline or impairment, limiting their access to emergency response resources for missing people without a formal Alzheimer’s or dementia diagnosis.
Anastasia Martin, general counsel for the New Mexico Aging and Long Term Services Department, which houses the Adult Protective Services division, told the House Judiciary Committee on March 10 that her agency had “run into challenges with the current law in having silver alerts issued.”
HB197 co-sponsor Rep. Joseph Sanchez (D-Alcalde) told the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee on Feb. 13 that when a friend’s relative from Albuquerque went missing, the friend asked police to issue a Silver Alert but they would not “because the person wasn’t medically diagnosed with a cognitive issue like dementia or Alzheimer’s.”
HB197 relaxes the criteria for the alerts so that the reporting party only needs to indicate they believe the missing person shows signs or symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia, cognitive decline or impairment, regardless of age.
The law previously gave the police the final say on whether or not an alert was issued, based on whether they found “clear indication that the individual suffers from Alzheimer’s.”
Almost all people who have gone missing in the last three years were found after Silver Alerts were issued, according to data compiled by the New Mexico Department of Public Safety. DPS reported in its analysis of the bill that between 2022 and Jan. 31, 2025, nearly 95% of people who went missing were found after police issued a Silver Alert.
“The revised criteria may enhance the responsiveness of law enforcement agencies to missing persons cases involving cognitive decline,” the DPS analyst wrote. “This could lead to quicker recoveries, reducing risks to vulnerable individuals and improving public safety.”

Now, President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress want to supercharge those efforts.
Trump in January issued an executive order directing several federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to tap into federal money for so-called school choice opportunities. Those can come in the form of education savings accounts, voucher programs, tax credits or scholarships. Trump’s order also aims to expand access to public charter schools, which are free from some of the rules that apply to traditional public schools.
Meanwhile in Congress, 24 Republican senators have signed on to legislation that would provide $10 billion in annual tax credits to individuals and corporations who make charitable contributions to organizations that provide private-school scholarships. A Nebraska Republican introduced a companion measure in the House.
Already this year, Idaho, Tennessee and Wyoming have approved school choice programs, and bills are advancing in Kansas, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. A bill in Mississippi died before advancing. Most of the measures still in play would open programs to all families regardless of income, though some states would cap the total amount of money available.
Supporters of school choice say it gives parents control of their kids’ education — and an escape hatch if they are dissatisfied with their local public school. Many conservatives, religious institutions and private schools are in favor of school choice, along with some people of color who live in districts with underperforming public schools.
“Every child is different. They learn in different environments. There are just so many factors, that I believe that parents should be the ones that make the decision on where their child is going to do the best and have the most success,” said Indiana Republican state Sen. Linda Rogers. A former educator, Rogers has sponsored a bill in her state that would provide additional money to charter schools, which are considered to be a form of school choice.
Opponents, including teachers unions, public school professionals and many rural lawmakers of both parties, say such measures undermine traditional public schools by shifting money away from them.
“When we start to take from public schools, we’re hurting our kids, our lower-income kids. They will not prosper from this legislation,” Tennessee Democratic state Rep. Ronnie Glynn said during the floor debate on a far-reaching voucher bill in his state.
Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University, said vouchers are a budget-buster for states.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Cowen said in a phone interview. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
The switch to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, which gave parents a front-row seat to watch what their children were — or were not — learning in their classes, contributed to the recent school choice momentum. So did parent frustration over prolonged public school closures.
“Parents got a good look into sort of what was happening in schools,” said Bella DiMarco, a senior K-12 education policy analyst at FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University. “There was a lot of talk during the pandemic around school choice … of what public schools aren’t doing for their kids.”
The first modern school voucher program, created in Milwaukee in 1990, was a bipartisan effort to help lower-income families afford private schools. In recent years, more states have moved from school choice programs focused on certain groups, such as low-income students or students with disabilities, to universal programs open to students of all backgrounds.
“Historically, the programs were always sort of targeted to students in need,” DiMarco said. “But in the last couple of years, the new push has been for these universal programs.”
Currently, more than 30 states and Washington, D.C., have at least one school choice program. More than a dozen states now offer universal or near-universal access, allowing K–12 students to participate in school choice regardless of income.
EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice, estimates that 1.2 million students are attending private schools this school year with the help of public tax credits, scholarships or vouchers.
 Different strategies

States that enacted school choice programs this year have pursued different strategies.
The program Idaho enacted last month, for example, will provide an annual tax credit of $5,000 per child ($7,500 for students with disabilities) to help cover private education expenses.
Tennessee’s new program will provide 20,000 scholarships of roughly $7,000 each. During its first year, half of the Tennessee scholarships will be reserved for households earning less than $173,000 for a family of four, but that restriction will be removed in subsequent years.
About 65% of the Tennessee vouchers are expected to be awarded to students who already attend private schools, according to a legislative analysis.
Critics say the cost of the program will grow quickly, creating a hole in the state’s budget. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who pushed hard for the proposal, suggested that Trump’s executive order might provide additional resources. Lee told reporters he hasn’t yet analyzed the order, “but I think there’s opportunity there.”
“The president wants to support states like ours who are advocating for school choice,” Lee said in a news conference after lawmakers approved the measure. Lee was at the White House on Thursday when Trump signed an order calling for the U.S. Department of Education to be dismantled.
Texas lawmakers also are actively debating a voucher program, a longtime priority for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who worked to defeat resistant rural Republicans in last year’s state legislative elections and who also attended the White House event. The Senate passed a bill that would provide $10,000 per student ($11,500 for students with disabilities) annually through education savings accounts. A similar House proposal is under review.
Kansas is considering a universal refundable tax credit — $8,000 per child for accredited private school tuition and $4,000 for non-accredited private schools. The program starts with a $125 million cap, increasing annually if participation hits certain thresholds.
 Ballot box defeats

School choice opponents question the wisdom of sending taxpayer dollars to schools that may lack certified teachers, follow nonstandardized curricula or discriminate in admissions. Many private schools have testing standards, maintain religious requirements or exclude LGBTQ+ students or those with certain disabilities, for example.
In some Republican-led states that have expanded school choice, Democrats have filed bills to increase oversight and place restrictions on these programs. A bill in Tennessee would require background checks for teachers at private schools that receive voucher money. And an Iowa bill would require that property tax statements include information on how much money education savings accounts subtracted from local public schools.
As voucher programs have grown, they have attracted greater scrutiny.
ProPublica, an investigative journalism outlet, last year found that Arizona’s universal voucher program has mostly benefited wealthier families. Some Arizona parents have tried to use voucher money to pay for dune buggies and expensive Lego sets, according to press reports.
Critics also note that despite recent legislative successes, school ballot initiatives fared poorly at the ballot box last fall.
Voters in Colorado rejected a measure that sought to enshrine school choice rights in the state constitution.
In Nebraska, voters partially repealed a state-funded private school scholarship program.
And in Kentucky, voters overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed the use of public money to support private schools, with 65% of voters — and a majority in every county — opposed.
“There’s a handful of these billionaires that have been pushing vouchers for 30 years,” said Cowen, the Michigan State University professor. “The school choice movement is not necessarily driven by public demand, but rather by wealthy donors and political maneuvering.”

(Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)As Missouri lawmakers debate the $47.9 billion state budget, they are also deciding how to spend an unexpectedly large chunk of cash from sales taxes collected from marijuana dispensaries.
The nearly $86 million paid by recreational cannabis users is constitutionally required to be divided up evenly between funds benefiting veterans, public defenders and programs that prevent substance use disorders. 
“Due to a strong cannabis market and effective, efficient regulation of that market,” said Amy Moore, director of the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation told The Independent this week, “the funds available for the ultimate beneficiaries of the cannabis regulatory program continue to outpace expectations.”
In February, Moore told the House budget committee that each fund could receive $28.6 million in the various budget bills debated this spring.
So far, the full $28.6 million has made it into budget legislation for both veterans and substance use disorder programs. Part of it will help fund new partnerships with the state courts, public schools and other providers to support children’s mental health. 
The Missouri Veterans Commission will receive an additional $13 million from medical marijuana money as well, and its total $41.6 million will go towards the operational needs and potential repairs for the state’s seven veterans homes.
However, the House has approved only $15.3 million for the public defenders system so far.
State lawmakers have the authority to decide whether to withhold the money, even though they can’t spend it anywhere else. 
The public defender’s office, for example, had hoped to use some of the cannabis money to increase their attorneys’ starting pay from $65,000 per year to $70,000. That would align the salary with the attorney general’s office entry-level pay.
“There’s a huge cost to employee turnover,” said Mary Fox, director of the Office of Public Defender, during a budget committee hearing last month, “and where we see that employee turnover is in years one through three, which is why that is where I would like to bring them in line with the attorney general salary.”
  Mary Fox, left testifies alongside Annie Legomsky during a February hearing of the House Health and Mental Health Committee (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
That $2.5 million request was shot down in the House, despite the funds being available. During a budget committee hearing, she also asked for $4 million to hire 45 full-time social workers to expand the agency’s holistic defense program, which employs social workers to connect clients with community resources. 
For several years, the system suffered from having long waitlists to get legal representation, which resulted in a successful lawsuit against the state. 
State Rep. John Voss, a Republican from Cape Girardeau and a budget committee member, pushed to add $1.6 million for pay raises and $1.2 million to hire 20 social workers.
The $1.2 million was added, but the pay raises were not.
“These attorneys represent the poor in our state, and they deserve the best representation that we can provide to them,” said Voss, during a budget committee meeting last month. “In terms of the holistic defense mitigation specialists, I believe that we’re actually investing in ways to prevent people from becoming incarcerated again, and we will wind up saving money across the entire state budget.”
Overall, Voss said part of the reason the public defenders’ total allocation is less than the two other funds is because about $11.7 million was included in budget legislation that required the funds to be spent by June — and the public defenders weren’t poised to do that. 
That money goes back to a fund in the Missouri Treasury to be appropriated to the public defenders in pending legislation, Senate Committee on Appropriations Chair Lincoln Hough told Independent last month.
“The money isn’t reallocated,” he said. “It stays dedicated to the public defender. The money is still sitting there and will be allocated in the operating bills.”
After the House votes to approve the bills, likely next week, Hough’s committee will debate them. While the House may not have included the public defenders’ requests for salary raises, the Senate has the ability to add more money back in before May. 
“The public defender will be taken care of in the operating bills,” Hough said. “It generally takes right up until the constitutional deadline to get these things done. And so we’ll have plenty of discussion on this.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Starting in the 2010s, many of the country’s reddest states began enacting serious criminal justice reforms, culminating on the federal level when President Donald Trump signed the First Step Act in 2018, which reduced excessive federal prison sentences and encouraged rehabilitation.
But despite those efforts in places like Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, the movement largely bypassed Florida, despite the best intentions by lawmakers like former Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes.
That mood has changed in recent years, however.
Homicides increased coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic and crime was a major issue in Donald Trump’s successful reelection campaign. Nevertheless, Tampa Democratic Rep. Dianne Hart is continuing her fight for reform of Florida’s prison system — a crusade she’s been on since being elected in 2018.
Joined by two fellow Democrats, family members of the incarcerated, and a former corrections worker, Hart led a press conference on the fourth floor Rotunda in the Capitol earlier this week to discuss her inmates’ “bill of rights” legislation (HB 185), which she has filed for the past five years in the Florida House.
The legislation calls for each inmate in the Florida correctional system to be provided a written copy of their rights, including:

Proper ventilation — either through an air-conditioning system or “exhaust and air circulators sufficient to provide a safe and healthful environment for inmates.”
Sufficient meal time.
Adequate food supply in case of an emergency.
Health supplies such as PPE and products like sanitary napkins, soap, tampons, and toothpaste.

The legislation says an inmate could file a grievance with the Department of Corrections if he or she believes a right guaranteed is denied by prison officials.
At the press conference, Hart expressed her dissatisfaction with the quality of health care in the prison system, and despaired that the last public data available from the Department of Corrections came in 2019.
She said that’s a violation of state law, which requires the department report “not less than annually” to the governor and Legislature about the Department of Corrections’ health care delivery system.
“Citizens and elected officials like myself are given the run-around when we attempt to see the latest numbers or ask simple questions regarding the state of our prison system and our loved ones,” she said, adding, “Florida is the Sunshine State, yet the truth of our government is shrouded in darkness.”
The Florida Department of Corrections did not immediately return a request for comment.
Broward County Democrat Mike Gottlieb is a co-sponsor on Hart’s bill. A criminal defense attorney for more than three decades, he said that prisoners are human beings and deserve human rights.
“Being incarcerated is a punishment, but it should not mean a loss of dignity, safety, or access to essentials like food, health care, or humane living conditions, such as air conditioning,” he said.
“Denying prisoners their rights does not make society safer. It makes us less just. When we mistreat those of our prisoners, we create the cycle of violence and dehumanization that extends beyond the prison walls. Studies have shown that humane treatment leads to lower recidivism rates, helping prisoners reintegrate into society as productive members, rather than returning to crime.”
The Senate version (SB 358) of Hart’s legislation is being sponsored by Broward County Democrat Rosalind Osgood.
 “Once the state of Florida takes possession of a person as an inmate, we have a responsibility,” she said. “When we take away somebody’s freedom because we’re holding them accountable for committing a crime, it doesn’t mean that gives us the opportunity to strip them of their dignity. A just society doesn’t abandon people once they’re behind bars.”
Florida Department of Corrections Secretary Ricky Dixon said in October 2023 that 75% of all housing units in Florida’s corrections system lack air-conditioning. A detailed report from the global consulting firm KPMG estimated that it would cost somewhere between $6 million and nearly $12 billion to repair buildings and construct new facilities, with hundreds of millions more needed to pay for staffing.
While many of Hart’s proposals to reform Florida’s prisons system haven’t reached fruition during her tenure in the House, a bill she is sponsoring this year that would allow more of the approximately 3,000 inmates who are eligible for parole to have a better chance of being released was passed in a House committee on Wednesday.
Florida eliminated parole for most inmates in the early 1980s, making most of the 88,000 prisoners in the corrections system ineligible. Another legislative proposal filed this year by Orange County Democratic Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith (SB 1786) would expand the pool of inmates still eligible for parole. That measure has not been heard in any committee so far this session.
The issue of how criminal justice reform lost clout with conservatives in recent years was reflected during the race for the Republican nomination for president in 2023. That’s when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis attacked Trump for supporting the First Step Act — although DeSantis supported it initially when he served in Congress.

Chuck Grassley is set to play a top role as the Senate Judiciary Committee chair in hearings next week on courts blocking President Donald Trump’s actions.
Members of Iowa’s congressional delegation also introduced legislation to make English the official language of the nation and to address a shortage of truck drivers.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to hold a meeting titled “Rule by District Judges II: Exploring Legislative Solutions to the Bipartisan Problem of Universal Injunctions” Wednesday, April 2, looking at nationwide injunctions on executive actions.
Many of the high-profile actions taken by Trump’s administration have been stopped in court in the months since he took office. On Thursday, a federal appeals court upheld an injunction blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan nationals, and a federal district court judge blocked the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Personnel Management and Treasury Department from disclosing “personally identifiable information” on certain parties to Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service in a Monday injunction. These are among numerous court decisions temporarily stopping the Trump administration from enforcing or enacting measures that challengers have argued in court are unconstitutional or unlawful.
But Grassley and other Republicans say these court actions are an overreach of power.
“District judges’ abuse of nationwide injunctions has hobbled the executive branch and raised serious questions regarding the lower courts’ appropriate jurisdictional realm,” Grassley told Fox News Wednesday.
The Iowa Republican said Congress “must step in and provide clarity” on the judicial branch’s ability to halt executive actions, saying the hearings will “explore legislative solutions to bring the balance of power back in check.”
Grassley also spoke Tuesday in opposition to a resolution proposed by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, that would require the federal executive branch to comply with federal court rulings. Grassley proposed amendments to the resolution stating the executive branch only has to comply with “lawful” court rulings, and that added language saying “it is inappropriate for courts of the United States to override legislative or executive action by the elected branches of government because of different policy preferences.”
Without these changes, Grassley argued on the Senate floor that “this resolution demands that the president comply with all court orders, but it’s completely silent about the role of the federal courts to adhere to the law themselves.” He also said he supported congressional action to limit courts’ ability to stop Trump administration policies from taking effect.
“The president of the United States shouldn’t have to ask permission from more than 600 different district judges to manage the executive branch he was elected to lead,” Grassley said. “The practice of sweeping nationwide injunctions, broad restraining orders, and judicial policymaking must end. It’s unconstitutional, it’s anti-democratic and it’s imprudent. If the Supreme Court won’t stop it, then Congress must.”
Durbin had argued immediate action was needed from Congress to support the court’s ability to keep the executive branch in check in light of calls from Trump and others like Musk to impeach judges over decisions. Grassley said Thursday he does not support calls to impeach judges over a decision.
“There has been a lot of debate about when we will cross the threshold into a genuine constitutional crisis. I pray that it will never happen,” Durbin said. “But it will come down to a basic principle. The question is not when we are going to face this, it is that we cannot afford to hold our breath and wait and see if the president will formally announce that he will defy a court order. We must respond to the dangerous attacks on our courts and judges now.”
English as official language
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks introduced a measure codifying Trump’s executive order designating English as the official language of the United States.
Trump issued the executive order March 1, rescinding an executive order by former President Bill Clinton in 2000 directing federal federal agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to improve access to services for people with limited English proficiency
Immigrant advocates criticized Trump’s order for potentially limiting services for people who speak other languages. Anabel Mendoza, communications director of the immigration advocacy youth group United We Dream, said in a statement that “Trump will try to use this executive order as a crutch to attack schools providing curriculum to immigrant students in other languages, gut programs and roles that help to promote inclusive language access, and embolden immigration agents to single out and harass individuals who speak a certain way.”
Currently, 32 states have made English their official state language, with some states like Alaska, South Dakota and Hawaii designating both English and a native language as official languages.
In a news release Friday, Miller-Meeks argued making English the official language of the U.S. is an important step in “reinforcing a shared national identity and strengthening civic engagement.”
“Since the inception of our republic almost 250 years ago, the English language has guided our nation. It was in English that our Founding Fathers wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. It was in English that Abraham Lincoln issued the Gettysburg Address as he preserved our nation,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement. “By making English the official language, we will build cohesion in America united by a common language and reap economic benefits.”
Nunn proposes tax credits for truckers
Rep. Zach Nunn introduced legislation Thursday to create new tax credits for truck drivers, a measure he said would help address current workforce shortages in the field.
The “Strengthening Supply Chains Through Truck Driver Incentives Act,” co-led by Rep. Pat Ryan, D-New York, would create a refundable tax credit of up to $7,500 for truck drivers who drive up to 1,900 hours each year, and an enhanced tax credit of $10,000 for new truck drivers and people in trucking apprenticeship programs.
Nunn said the measure was needed as the nation faces a shortage of truck drivers, which could lead to supply chain disruptions and higher costs for goods.
In 2023, the American Trucking Association reported there was a trucking workforce shortage of 60,000 drivers, down from a high of more than 80,000 in 2021. However, officials with the organization said they expect to see that number increase in coming years, caused by a number of factors including an aging workforce, difficulties recruiting women and problems retaining workers due to the difficult work lifestyle.
“Right now, we’re facing a serious shortage of truck drivers, and it’s putting pressure on Iowa families and our nation’s supply chains,” Nunn said in a news release. “We are experiencing both a recruitment and a retention problem in the trucking industry. This is a simple fix to help get more drivers behind the wheel – improving our supply chain and bringing down costs for every Iowan.”
Providing financial incentives for people to join and stay in the industry will help ease this workforce shortage, Nunn and supporters of the measure said.
Brenda Neville, president and CEO of the Iowa Motor Truck Association, thanked Nunn in a statement for “his leadership to remove roadblocks to driver training and help Iowans secure rewarding employment in the trucking sector.”
“Iowa’s trucking industry provides over 100,000 good-paying jobs and fulfills an essential role in our supply chain. Supporting our workforce is an investment in Iowa families and our economy,” Neville said. “By easing the financial burden for new drivers, the Strengthening Supply Chains Through Truck Driver Incentives Act will open the door of opportunity for more hardworking men and women who choose to embark on this career path.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/capitolnov262024miranda_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-28 14:06:00.519366

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
Maine’s support of transgender athletes already faced a federal investigation through the department’s Office for Civil Rights, with the state being found in violation of Title IX for allowing trans girls to participate in sports aligning with their gender identity. 
Whether Maine decides to sue or comply with the resolution agreement proposed by OCR remains to be seen, with the Maine Attorney General’s office declining to comment. School officials from MSAD 51 and the Maine Principals Association, which were also under investigation, have already said they will not sign the agreement.
The FERPA investigation is another example of President Donald Trump’s administration targeting Maine for protecting students’ access to affirming school environments through the Maine Human Rights Act. 
In a letter to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter. 
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR. 
Miller’s letter also highlights that because school counselors or school social workers are not required by Maine law to divulge information gathered during counseling, it may keep parents from “exercising their right to inspect and review education records relating to their child’s counseling with a school counselor or school social worker.”
Parents Defending Education, a far-right “parental rights” group, has been scrutinizing school districts and filing federal civil rights complaints nationwide against school districts — including Portland in 2023 —  for several years for their policies protecting students’ rights. The USDOE investigation cites the goal of Parents Defending Education President Nicole Neily “to hold school districts accountable and ensure no child is socially transitioned behind parent’s backs by teachers or administrators.”
The fight between parental rights and students’ privacy rights when it comes to gender identity at school has played out in courts for the past few years, prompted by lawsuits filed in at least six states by parents rights groups. 
Legal experts working with the school districts have argued that districts are trying to support students by having these policies in place, and are required to protect students’ privacy rights over parents’ rights to information about their children.
In Maine, one such lawsuit stemmed from parent Amber Lavigne suing her child’s school district for using affirming pronouns and a school counselor giving her child a chest binder. That lawsuit was dismissed, with Judge John Levy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine saying that while it is understandable that a parent might want to stay informed, the district and staff did not violate Lavigne’s rights as they were following the district’s transgender students guidelines.

Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.

If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.

A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”

Cutting care at home

All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

Nearly 20 years ago, my wife and I were lucky enough to study abroad in England. We had been awarded graduate scholarships and obtained our student visas from the British government. At the time, there was a heartbreaking genocide happening in Darfur. As concerned students invested in the moral standing of our university, we joined peaceful protests calling on Oxford to divest from companies that profited from the genocide and urged the British Parliament to intervene.
I never feared that my exercise of free speech would get me arrested and kicked out of what I took to be the second freest nation on earth, after my own. And I certainly could not have imagined a swarm of British agents abducting me on the street and deporting me without cause. Perhaps in the time of King George III but not the age of constitutions.



On Tuesday, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University in Boston, was walking peacefully to the university’s Interfaith Center to break her Ramadan fast when six government agents in masks and hoodies surrounded her and took her away screaming in an unmarked SUV.
For a day or more, according to Fox News, Rumeysa’s family and lawyers had no idea where she was and were unable to contact her. No charges were filed against her. A federal district judge even ordered the government not to move her out of state. But she was moved anyway — to a detention center in Louisiana, awaiting deportation.
Rumeysa had a valid student visa, as Fox News also reported. She was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to complete her Ph.D. at Tufts’ Department of Child Study and Human Development, where she researches children and media. No charges were filed against her and there was no warrant for her arrest; warrants are issued by judges who require the government to show cause.
The best guess for why she has been detained is that her name appeared with several others on an article in the student newspaper last year calling on Tufts University to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies with ties to Israel. The op-ed never mentioned Hamas, which the U.S. government rightly considers a terrorist organization. There is no evidence that she harbored any sympathy for, much less aided and abetted, Hamas or other organizations opposed to the United States. It seems her only “crime” was to peacefully speak out, as a concerned student, in a manner disfavored by the current administration.
Americans may freely disagree about the heartbreaking conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has left thousands of innocent Israelis and hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians dead or injured in recent years. For my part, having traveled to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and believing in the state of Israel as a necessary response to the evils of the Holocaust (in which Jewish family members of mine were killed), I take seriously the conclusions of the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International that Israel’s war in Gaza is a “plausible” genocide.
But regardless of what we believe about Israel and Palestine, there is one thing on which Americans overwhelmingly agree: our constitutional right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment is sacred and immigrants who lawfully reside among us are not without rights of their own. As you uphold my right to call the war in Gaza genocidal, I defend your right to call Hamas an evil terrorist organization. In fact, I’ll join in that because it is also true.
Freedom of speech is as American as apple pie. It’s what has attracted many of the brightest minds from foreign lands to come here legally as students and help make America the richest, most innovative nation on earth — including Elon Musk.
Sadly, Rumeysa is not alone. She is one of hundreds of lawful immigrants so far who have been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration in recent weeks, without any pretense of due process. Their abductions on American streets by unmarked and unidentified “law enforcement” agents are being funded by our tax dollars to the tune of untold millions.
So far we have seen at least seven other students detained for showing sympathy for Palestinians; hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported to a Salvadoran prison camp against the orders of a federal judge, and extended detentions and physical abuse of lawful migrants at the American border. These and countless other acts represent an unprecedented abuse of federal power against individuals whose lack of citizenship gives them limited legal recourse, in spite of their legal status in this country.
Given the choice, I still believe my fellow Americans would choose the Constitution over a man who would be king. It’s time we make that choice — not just for Rumeysa but for this country we love.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rumeysaozturk-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 13:07:49.579023

Free.,Trump asks U.S. Supreme Court to restore blocked deportation plan,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-restore-blocked-deportation-plan,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration submitted an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday in an effort to resume the rapid deportations of Venezuelans accused of gang ties under a wartime law that a lower court blocked.Acting U.S. Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued in a brief to the Supreme Court that a federal judge’s temporary restraining order this month, and an appeals court ruling Wednesday upholding it, wrongly denied President Donald Trump the authority to make decisions about national security operations, including the removal of Venezuelan nationals the administration says are subject to the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.“The district court’s orders have rebuffed the President’s judgments as to how to protect the Nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,” Harris wrote in her request to the court.The Alien Enemies Act had only been invoked three times, during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.The Trump administration has tried to use it in a novel way, when the nation is not officially at war. The administration designated the Tren de Aragua – a gang that originated in Venezuela – as a foreign terrorist group, and argued that any Venezuelan nationals aged 14 and older with suspected ties to the gang are subject to the proclamation.U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg placed a temporary restraining order on the Trump administration’s use of the law this month, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the order this week. The administration asked the Supreme Court to lift the order.“As long as the orders remain in force, the United States is unable to rely on the Proclamation to remove dangerous affiliates with a foreign terrorist organization—even if the United States receives indications that particular (Tren de Aragua) members are about to take destabilizing or infiltrating actions,” Harris said Friday.Extending restraining orderBoasberg’s temporary restraining order placed on the use of the Alien Enemies Act is set to expire Saturday. The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit, requested that order be extended for an additional two weeks.The ACLU also plans to request Boasberg issue a preliminary injunction, which would block the administration from deportations under the act until the lawsuit is complete. A hearing is set for April 8.Boasberg has rejected the Trump administration's move to lift his restraining order, on the grounds that those subject to the Alien Enemies Act should have due process to challenge those accusations.At the D.C. Circuit this week, Department of Justice attorneys for the Trump administration argued that those subject to the proclamation do not need to be notified they are being removed under the Alien Enemies Act. The Trump administration also argued that those who fall under the Alien Enemies Act can bring a challenge of their detention under a habeas corpus claim.Defied verbal orderThe White House quietly implemented the act on March 15 and a verbal restraining order given by Boasberg that day to block it went into effect hours later.In that order, Boasberg barred the Trump administration from applying the act but three deportation plans landed in El Salvador after the order was issued. The Trump administration has argued that his verbal order was not enforceable.Boasberg also ordered that anyone subject to the Alien Enemies Act be returned to the U.S., but federal immigration agents took more than 250 men aboard the three flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador.Boasberg has vowed to determine if the Trump administration violated his restraining order in sending the deportation planes to El Salvador, but Attorney General Pam Bondi invoked the “state secrets privilege” to refuse to answer detailed questions about the flights.Friday’s emergency request is one of several immigration-related appeals the Trump administration has made to the high court, such as the request to lift several nationwide injunctions placed on the president's executive order that ends the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.",,,,2025-03-28 13:07:49.579023

The firing squad chair (left) was added following a 2021 state law that made death by firing squad an option. The electric chair is under the cover. (Provided by the S.C. Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — Death row inmate Mikal Mahdi chose to die by firing squad, making him the second person in the state to do so since executions resumed, his attorneys said Friday.
Mahdi, 42, was sentenced to death in 2006 for shooting and killing off-duty police officer James Myers with his own rifle as part of a multi-state crime spree. The only remaining man on death row with no remaining appeals, Mahdi is scheduled to die at 6 p.m. April 11.
Brad Sigmon, executed March 7, was the first inmate in the state to die by firing squad, which legislators made an option in 2021. The three other inmates executed since September selected lethal injection.
By law, death row inmates have until two weeks before their execution date to choose whether they will die by firing squad, lethal injection or electrocution, which legislators made the default method in 2021. Mahdi chose “the lesser of three evils,” his attorney, David Weiss, said in a statement Friday.
“Mikal chose the firing squad instead of being burned and mutilated in the electric chair, or suffering a lingering death on the lethal injection gurney,” Weiss said.
SC inmate executed by firing squad, a first nationwide since 2010

Legislators added firing squad as an option after years of struggling to get the drugs used for lethal injection. Inmates challenged the method, as well as electrocution, arguing it violated the constitutional right to avoid cruel and unusual punishment.
The state Supreme Court ruled last year that firing squad and electrocution were constitutional methods of execution, allowing the process to resume after a 13-year hiatus. By that point, lethal injection was again an option, after Department of Corrections officials were able to restock their supply thanks to a law keeping everything about the drugs and the companies selling them a secret.
Inmates have challenged that secrecy law, arguing inmates have a right to know more about the drugs that would kill them. But the state Supreme Court and a federal judge have both turned down those arguments, ruling officials have disclosed everything the law requires for an inmate to make his choice.
Barring intervention from a court or the governor, Mahdi would become the fifth in the nation to be executed by firing squad, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Other than Sigmon, the remaining three took place in Utah, which last conducted a firing squad execution in 2010.
Mahdi will be strapped to a chair, facing three rectangular openings 15 feet away. Three firing squad members will shoot through those openings, using .308 Winchester bullets, which expand and fragment on impact, causing a more instantaneous death, corrections officials have said previously.
“Before Mikal committed these tragic murders, he was a child in desperate need of care and support,” Weiss said in a statement. “We will continue to fight for the child Mikal was and the man he is today. Executing Mikal on this record would ignore the many ways we failed him in favor of one final injustice.”
Mikal Mahdi
On July 14, 2004, in his hometown of Lawrenceville, Virginia, Mahdi stole a car and a gun before fleeing south. Stopping in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Mahdi shot gas station clerk Christopher Boggs point-blank in the head while Boggs was verifying his ID to buy a beer, according to court documents.
Mahdi continued on to South Carolina, where he carjacked a man in Columbia and drove to Calhoun County. He stopped at a gas station, where a clerk seemed to grow suspicious after the gas pump declined his card. Mahdi fled on foot to a nearby farmhouse, where he hid out in Myers’ workshop.
When Myers, a captain for the Orangeburg Department of Public Safety, returned home at the end of the day, Mahdi shot him nine times with one of the rifles Myers kept there, according to court documents.
Mahdi lit Myers’ body on fire and stole his police truck, which he continued driving south. Police arrested Mahdi in Satellite Beach, Florida, on July 21, 2004, a week after he stole the first car.
Mahdi pleaded guilty to the crimes in 2006, at which point Judge Clifton Newman sentenced him to death.
SC death row inmate’s attorneys ask court to halt execution over traumatic childhood

Mahdi’s attorneys have asked the state Supreme Court to halt his execution, claiming a traumatic childhood influenced his development and led him to a life of crime.
Mahdi’s original defense attorneys hardly touched on his past, which could have convinced Newman to sentence him to life in prison instead of death, Mahdi’s current attorneys argued in court filings.
As a child, Mahdi struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts, his attorneys claimed. He entered the juvenile justice system at age 14 for committing property crimes and spent most of his life in jails after that point, often in solitary confinement, his attorneys said.
Mahdi had been out of jail for about two months when he committed the crimes that landed him on death row.
“When we think of Mikal choosing his method of execution, we’re reminded of the tormented child who, at nine years old, told his teacher that he wanted to shoot himself. Or, on another occasion, to electrocute himself. Or, another time, to hang himself,” Weiss said in a statement Friday.
But Mahdi’s attorneys didn’t show anything the court hasn’t already considered and dismissed during the appeals process, the Attorney General’s Office responded in a filing this week. Mahdi’s difficult childhood and the impact it may have had on him have no legal bearing on his crime, the attorneys continued.
The state Supreme Court has not yet given a decision on the arguments.
The state’s highest court, as well as the U.S. Supreme Court, has yet to rule in favor of stopping a South Carolina inmate’s execution in the past six months. Mahdi can also appeal to Gov. Henry McMaster for clemency, which no governor has granted in the modern era.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-03-28 13:07:49.579023

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska state lawmakers advanced a bill Friday that seeks additional carveouts to the language of the new paid sick leave law voters approved in 2024 before it takes effect this fall.
Lawmakers voted 34-14 to advance Legislative Bill 415, with all Republicans and one Democratic senator voting to advance the bill in the officially nonpartisan body. 
The split vote came largely because of the folding in of LB 698, from freshman State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney, which opponents said would undercut the recently passed law. The amended LB 415 would not require paid sick leave to be given to 14 or 15 year olds, temporary or seasonal agricultural workers or workers in businesses with 10 or fewer employees. 
Businesses could still choose to offer such leave to these employees.

March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha did not vote for or against advancing the amended bill in part because he viewed the underlying LB 415, as introduced, as an important bill. He said his “present, not voting” position was a “show of good faith” that Strommen might listen to some concerns raised during debate in future rounds of debate on the bill.
Beginning Oct. 1, under the currently approved law, businesses with fewer than 20 weekly employees would allow employees a process to accrue up to five days’ worth of paid sick leave a year (40 hours), or seven days for larger businesses (56 hours). An hour of leave could be earned for every 30 hours worked.
Employees can use paid sick leave for themselves or a family member for mental or physical illness, injury or a health condition or for a medical diagnosis or preventive medical care. Paid sick time could also be used during a public health emergency that closes a business or school.
Voters adopted the paid sick leave ballot measure with nearly 75% of the vote in November, including majority support across all 49 legislative districts. The measure was heavily supported by Nebraska labor groups.
Strommen said he believed it was the Legislature’s duty to “iron out details” and make the laws “make sense for everyone, workers and businesses alike.” 
“It is incumbent upon the legislature to ensure it is workable,” he said.

The Paid Sick Leave for Nebraskans coalition said Friday that voters were clear in November about providing earned paid sick leave to all Nebraskans, regardless of age, sector, workforce status or business size.
“We are extremely disappointed by the Nebraska Legislature’s egregious disregard of the will of Nebraska voters,” the coalition said in a statement.
An initial ‘cleanup bill’
LB 415 was originally introduced by State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln as a “cleanup bill” that he worked on with the Nebraska Chambers of Commerce and advocates for paid sick leave. The campaign manager of last year’s paid sick leave measure told the Nebraska Examiner in January they were “not concerned” with the changes but would oppose any more expansive amendments.
Ballard’s bill would clarify that businesses that meet or exceed the new law would not need to change their existing leave policies, including accrual or carryover components. It would also clarify how leave can be requested and when employees could begin to accrue sick leave.
“LB 415 is a cleanup bill meant to clarify some of the concerns of members in the business community,” Ballard said of his introduced bill.
Multiple senators had spoken in favor of Ballard’s bill but withdrew their support after Strommen’s bill was attached.
‘Avoiding a few serious detriments’
While well-intentioned, Strommen said, he argued the new “mandate” — his word for what voters passed — could raise costs or lead to lost jobs or wages, or some small businesses shutting down altogether. 
  State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney meets with his staff on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
He said his bill recognized the will of voters while “avoiding a few serious detriments.”
“While the idea of paid sick leave is appealing, government mandates on businesses can create unintended negative consequences for employees, specifically those who work for small businesses,” he said.
Strommen’s additions would also give the Nebraska Department of Labor sole authority to enforce the act, rather than private lawsuits. 
The bill will likely need to be amended in the future to maintain at least 33 votes, the minimum amount needed to change the voter-approved measure, under the Nebraska Constitution. Strommen has filed to add back in the private lawsuits enforcement, as has State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont. Other supporters said they wanted that change to be added back in.
Two other amendments lawmakers could consider would keep the paid sick leave requirements for minors and ag workers and the right to sue if the paid sick leave is not granted. Both would continue to exempt the smallest businesses from the new requirement, as Strommen proposed.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln proposed keeping the 10 or fewer employee level, while State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha has proposed lowering that to three or fewer employees, which is the cut-off for minimum wage.
‘You should resign’
Across a full week of debate, opponents sought to frame the measure as one in a string of emerging bills that they said would hurt working families and roll back or sidestep recently approved ballot measures.

In a heated exchange with Strommen, for example, Conrad asked why he would “honor election elections for your race, but not for ballot initiatives?” Strommen said he voted against the measure in November.
“If you do not trust the election results, you should resign your position,” Conrad told Strommen.
Strommen, who was visibly taken aback, scoffed and told her, “That’s fantastic.” He immediately put the question back on Conrad, asking if she was comfortable telling her constituents she opposed his changes that “had the opportunity to ensure that they [her constituents] were going to have their jobs.”
Conrad interrupted and said that wasn’t her question, nor was it the question before voters.
‘Take it or leave it’
Whether lawmakers should amend any ballot measure shortly after its passage was another theme of the debate, teeing up an expected fight next week on whether to create exceptions or cap annual increases to the state minimum wage, which passed in 2022.
State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, the Democratic lawmaker who supported the Strommen and Ballard bills, is leading the minimum wage changes in her 2025 priority bill: LB 258. Raybould’s family created and owns B&R Stores, the parent company of Super Saver, Russ’s Market and more. The company announced this week that she will step down as vice president of the company Monday.
  State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. Dec. 7, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Raybould and State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse pointed to the Nebraska Constitution allowing lawmakers to change ballot measures with a 33-vote supermajority.
Raybould described that higher threshold as a “balance” that is necessary when voters have a “take it or leave it” option at the polls.
“To suggest that it is wrong for the Legislature to deliberate and bring thoughtful changes to legislation passed by initiative is like you’re saying it is wrong for the people to have the right to a referendum,” Raybould said.
If a ballot measure fails, supporters are prohibited under state law from advancing a similar measure at a future election for at least two years. The petition process must also be repeated.
State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area said that if lawmakers truly didn’t want to touch initiatives and consider them settled, he expected “pro choice” lawmakers to never push to expand abortion in the state.
“I’m just following up on your ideas,” Sorrentino said. “I have a feeling that probably won’t happen, but I think you have to hear both sides of the logic.”
‘Veto power over the people’
State Sens. Terrell McKinney and Wendy DeBoer, both of Omaha, argued there was no binary option and that voters had the right to vote as they wanted to.
DeBoer said if senators disagreed with voters, that’s OK, but that it is the people who get to decide what government looks like. She said lawmakers “do not have veto power over the people.”
“In every election as long as I can remember, there has been at least one result that I did not like, that I thought was foolish, that I thought was the wrong decision,” DeBoer said.
She continued: “If someone can say, ‘No, we veto what the people say,’ then we are no longer a government where the people choose.”

March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Hallstrom described that as a “false narrative” and said he didn’t think anyone was saying voters were wrong or misinformed.
Multiple senators said during the debate or off the floor that voters couldn’t have possibly envisioned the full implications of the law. Some senators said they believed voters were likely more focused on abortion, school choice or marijuana last fall, not paid sick leave.
No campaign was waged against the paid sick leave campaign, which Conrad said was “because they knew they couldn’t win” and that opponents wanted to “sneak into the Legislature to undermine the will of the voters.”
“They did not do so with their fingers crossed behind their backs,” Conrad said. “The election results were not notched with an asterisk saying, ‘Oh, yes, it received 70% support, but we in leadership think Nebraska voters were not smart enough to understand what they were voting for.’”
Conrad challenged those opposing the current law to run a ballot initiative themselves. Sorrentino, Conrad and McKinney are among those who brought measures this year related to recently approved ballot measures.
In Sorrentino’s case, he is seeking to revive a defeated school choice program via tax credits for scholarships, or vouchers, to private schools. Conrad and McKinney were among four senators to bring measures to clarify or change how medical cannabis should be implemented.
‘Not bottomless wishing wells’
  State Sen. Mike Moser of Columbus. Oct. 28, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Mike Moser of Columbus said being told to offer increased minimum wage to all employees, no matter their work ethic, is one thing, while the addition of another “mandate” like paid sick leave, “again, without merit,” he said, is “not an economic benefit to the employer.”
“Business owners are not bottomless wishing wells full of money for the benefit of their employees,” Moser said.
Hallstrom said some businesses would face a “double whammy” in paying someone out sick and paying a temporary worker.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward noted her children have done detasseling for several weeks in the summer, and she said they didn’t need sick leave during that time.
“If they were sick, they stayed home and didn’t get paid,” she said.
Supporters of the paid sick leave law have said businesses are better off offering paid sick leave by being able to retain employees and avoiding workforce churn. They’ve also argued workers benefit from the paid time off because it gives them the flexibility to attend to their families and recover from illness without financial loss.
McKinney and other opponents repeatedly read district-by-district election margins on the issue, which ranged from 60% in ruby-red north-central Nebraska for freshman State Sen. Tanya Storer all the way up to 92% support in McKinney’s North Omaha district.

“Supporting ‘family values’ means supporting families, and that starts with letting people take care of sick kids or elderly parents without losing their income or taking care of themselves in time of sickness,” McKinney said.
State Sens. Dunixi Guereca and Margo Juarez, both of Omaha whose districts were among those with the highest support for the measure, said they trusted voters to make the right choice. Guereca said the changes seek to exclude the “very people” that some voters had in mind, such as a single mother who is a waitress or a worker in a small fabrication shop, who “just need a little help.”
Sorrentino said Strommen’s bill was an “extremely friendly amendment.” He noted the federal Family Medical Leave Act, to preserve employee’s jobs up to 12 weeks of unpaid labor, applies to businesses with 50 or more employees in a 75-mile radius.
“It was administratively and financially a huge burden on them. There’s no reason to burden 10 lives or less with this law,” he said. “I think [LB] 415 was a good law. I think as amended, it’s a better law.”

Paid sick leave campaign filings
The Paid Sick Leave for Nebraskans campaign raised a total of $3.4 million, the vast majority in 2023, and spent $3.3 million on the campaign, according to most recent filings with the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission. Nearly all funds came from organizations; $460 came from individuals.
By December 2023, the D.C.-based Sixteen Thirty Fund had donated $1.92 million. The fund is managed by Arabella Advisors, which was founded by a former administration appointee by former President Bill Clinton. It oversees a hub of other left-leaning nonprofits that have received donations from billionaire George Soros in the past. It doesn’t disclose its donors. 
The campaign has also received $350,000 from the Open Society Policy Center, a principal financial arm founded by Soros, and about $280,000 from the D.C.-based The Fairness Project.

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Denial is not just a river in Egypt.
For those who are still in it, cutting through the chaos is one way out, even though the chaos is confusing, on purpose. In Topeka or D.C., just following bills is, well, debilitating.
Near-daily executive orders are in reality executive disorders. But we can wake to this truth. It’s not conservatism — it’s corruption. On steroids. Remember the frog in first lukewarm, then boiling water? The heat is coming up, less gradually every day. Will we jump out in time? Every day reduces the chance.
Through the fog, we must fully grasp — and admit — where we are. Unfortunately, President Trump’s mindset is easy to discern.
As felon-in-chief, he continues to purge the Justice Department. In the nouveau regime, crimes are not crimes if they say they’re not. They’ll first get rid of the people who once said they were. Removing truth-tellers’ salary, pension and security detail should do it. In short, they’ll make opponents’ lives as miserable and insecure as possible.
They are not stopping there.
No more wasting money on the little people. They’re on their way to cut our Social Security and Medicaid, and perhaps Medicare. The co-president of Public Citizen, weighing in on Trump’s Social Security lies in his address to Congress, said these are “the prelude to vicious cuts.”
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) summed it up: “This is their core agenda. (It’s) reverse Roosevelt. They are no longer even hiding it.”
Farmers, consumers and the entire economy are terrorized with tariffs, at the whim of Trump’s on/off button. (Pick your news source.)
National Republicans’ lockstep mentality is echoed by the Kansas’ monopoly party. Kansas legislative leadership seeks to dilute the vote by deluding the people. They and their docile (or worse, complicit) gang of enabler-legislators seek to block troublesome votes by removing the three-day mail ballot grace period, shutting out thousands of votes.
They would make our Supreme Court selection by election, with justices bought by the same mega-donor dollars that installed them. This would chill rights to education and women’s reproductive freedom.
How does this get a pass from the public? By misinformation. By appealing to collective (mostly white) prejudice. And by assaulting and defunding education, especially higher ed. Universities are called universities for a reason. Designed to promote universal understanding and values in education, too often they have suffered at the whim of moneyed interests. Public financing is key to even private college funding.
Nonetheless, the Trump Administration just cut $400 million from Columbia University’s budget, drastically affecting “research and other critical functions, impacting students, faculty, staff, research, and patient care” because students took a stand for Palestine. This is a blow. More than a quarter of Columbia’s $6.6 billion in annual operating revenue comes from federal sources, according to its 2024 financial statements.
Call it what it is. Mafia thuggery and bullying, until universities knuckle under.
The Kansas Legislature monopoly party marches in lockstep with their congressional colleagues. Salina’s Republican Rep Steven Howe got off on a good foot with his appeal for Republicans to re-examine their votes for Donald Trump come the 2024 election.
However, he was shortly back on the bandwagon. Howe’s crusade and “investigation” against universities’ diversity, equity and inclusion policies put him firmly in the Trump camp and resulted in that witch-hunt becoming state law.
This year, Howe introduced a bill aimed at weakening tenure protections at Kansas universities. His action was “at the behest of Steven Lovett, general counsel at Emporia State University,” where 30 tenured or tenure-track professors were fired in 2022. ESU is “embroiled in state and federal court battles” as a result. Lovett’s seeming conflict of interest in this action was questioned, even by an ESU spokeswoman.
There is little doubt whose side Howe is on. He even moved in his House committee “to add $2.2 million to the ESU budget for legal expenses in (Lovett’s) faculty firing case.
Spreading chaos and retribution is also blatantly obvious in Trump’s complete board replacement of the Kennedy Center. He named himself board chair for the country’s premier performing arts center, now to become the Trump Center for the Conforming Arts. In that action, he decried DEI and the center’s leadership and performances. It might feature WWE wrestling next.
As Nietzsche said, “Distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful.”
Once we get past denial, this bullying culture must be faced up to, to face them down. It can be as simple as no. As a legal immigrant friend of mine said yesterday, “The more no’s they get, the smaller they become.”
May it be so.

(Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program drastically raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.
The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.

Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”
A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks
Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.










The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.


– Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank


The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.
“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.

Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”

A boost for school lunches
For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.

West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)When COVID-19 first tore through our nursing homes five years ago, I’ll never forget seeing the photo Shanrika Nelson, a certified nursing assistant and union member from Philadelphia, posted online. She wanted the public to see the makeshift PPE that she and her coworkers wore every day to protect their residents and themselves the best they could: a trash bag over her body.
Led by caregivers’ hard work and advocacy, we have made progress since the pandemic to fix and transform Pennsylvania’s nursing home system. But now we are facing a new existential threat – potential – Medicaid cuts that will topple nursing homes still hanging by a thread.
A new study shows that any cuts to Medicaid could lead to double the number of Pennsylvanians without health insurance. Not only does Medicaid provide comprehensive health and long-term care to 3 million residents in our Commonwealth, it funds over 60% of our nursing homes.
I do not want to think about the future of our nursing homes without Medicaid. They likely won’t have one.
Our system is already unprepared for the number of Pennsylvanians growing older quickly. Talk to any nursing home worker: residents are arriving at facilities younger and with more demanding needs. High acuity, higher severity, and more psychiatric conditions. People are coming to our nursing homes sicker. It’s often because they did not have access to high-quality, affordable health insurance and have had undiagnosed conditions for years.
Rated one of the deadliest jobs in 2020, nursing homes saw caregivers leave for better-paying, less-dangerous, and less-stressful jobs. Those who stayed often work overtime or second jobs to pay the bills and cover their own medical debt. We fought for and won staffing ratios to ensure every resident receives quality care, but operators are still struggling to retain and recruit the skilled workforce needed.
Simply put: we do not have the beds, workers, and training needed to care for Pennsylvanians in the immediate future. And proposed Medicaid cuts are putting nursing homes in danger now.
April Chirdon, a CNA who’s worked at the same facility in Cambria County for 17 years, is especially worried about rural nursing homes like hers. Much like in other rural communities, an overwhelming majority of her residents depend on Medicaid. It covers the cost of their care, from their caregivers’ wages and benefits to the food they eat and lifesaving equipment like nebulizers and oxygen tanks. They don’t have an alternative to this care: their families cannot afford to take care of them at home, or they don’t have any family. If homes like April’s are forced to shut down, where will all of the residents go?
We need more funding, not less.
We need more accountability, reforms, and teamwork to make every nursing home a fully staffed, safe, and dignified one.
This system already relies on caregivers to buy supplies like toilet paper, shampoo, hand sanitizer, and favorite food items for residents out of their own pockets. Because the people in these homes are like family to them.
This year, 7,000 nursing home workers have committed to use the power of their union negotiations for new contracts to show the public how much our communities rely on Medicaid, ensure public funding goes to care, and work with responsible operators to defend the resources we need to elevate care for all Pennsylvanians.
Healthcare workers will never forget the pandemic and neither should we. Covid-19 showed us how important it is to listen to frontline caregivers sounding the alarm and protecting our loved ones.
We need to listen to healthcare workers who are calling on Congress to defend Medicaid. We must stand up to these brutal cuts to our communities and our most vulnerable. Medicaid is a lifeline for so many Pennsylvanians and we – legislators, providers, community members, and workers – must protect it.

State records show that in February 2005, a federal grand jury indicted Dr. Peter Boesen, an ear, nose and throat specialist from Windsor Heights, on 82 counts of health care fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud. The grand jury alleged Boesen billed multiple health insurance providers for procedures and tests that were either never performed or were not medically necessary.
After a jury convicted Boesen on all counts and Boesen appealed, the government dismissed three of the fraud charges and Boesen was sentenced to 51 months in prison on the remaining 80 counts. He was also ordered to pay $931,526 in restitution.
Boesen was released from prison in early 2011, and in August 2012, the Iowa Board of Medicine suspended his medical license for an indefinite period.
At the time, Boesen continued to claim his innocence and said the charges against him, his trial and the decision on his appeal were unfair. At a hearing before the Board of Medicine, he testified that his only regret was that his patients could no longer benefit from his care.
As part of the 2012 suspension order, the board stipulated that Boesen must complete a competency evaluation and pay a $10,000 civil penalty should the board agree to reinstatement.
Earlier this month, the board reinstated Boesen’s license subject to several requirements that prohibit Boesen from establishing a solo practice and require that his license be placed on probation for two years, during which time he will be subject to board monitoring.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BOARD-OF-MEDICINE.jpg,,,2025-03-28 12:11:48.980649

(Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.












If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging




The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
 A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
 Cutting care at home

All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)There was some good news last week when a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that “corner crossing” from public land to public land is not trespassing on adjoining private lands.  Thanks to that ruling, the efforts by another billionaire landowner to lock the public out of our own lands have failed – and corner crossing will now be legal in six Western states.
The issue is significant due to a horrendous policy mistake when the federal government deeded every other section of public land across the West to railroad barons between 1850 and 1872 as an incentive to lay track.  The joke was on the public since many of those deeded lands never saw permanent rail lines built. Indeed, it’s rare that one can see any railroads from most of the “checkerboard” sections.
Those lands in Montana were infamously logged mercilessly when Burlington-Northern Railroad’s subsidiary, Plum Creek Timber Company, decided to “liquidate its timber assets” in the 1980s.  Adding insult to injury, it then turned itself into a Real Estate Investment Trust in 1999 and is now subdividing and selling off those formerly forested parcels across the nation.
Other checkerboard sections were purchased by wealthy individuals or corporations, in many instances with the goal of surrounding and locking up public lands and their fish, wildlife, and recreational assets by locking out public access, including “corner crossing” from one public section to another.
That particular ploy has now fallen by the wayside after Wyoming hunters used a ladder to cross the private fence to the adjoining public land and never touched the private sections. Hence, the court’s decision that it was not trespassing.
Of course, the ruling has been applauded by public lands advocates who have increasingly placed “access” as their main goal rather than conservation of the public resources.  And therein lies the rub.  Access and conservation are simply not the same thing — especially not when those same public lands and waters are increasingly pressured.
A great recent example would be the Montana Legislature’s recent move to spend a whopping $2.7 million to study who uses Montana’s rivers, many of which are now so crowded that the once-common opportunity to enjoy a river in the quiet solitude of Nature no longer exists.
One wouldn’t have to study too long on the Yellowstone, Blackfoot, Bitterroot, Madison or Missouri Rivers to see the flotillas of outfitter and private drift boats, rafts, paddleboards, and inner tubes clogging the river.
But when politicians or agencies lack the courage to address a sticky problem, they appoint task forces, advisory councils, and do studies.  A great example would be the Upper Madison, where, after public outcry over too many outfitters on the river, task forces and studies have been ongoing for decades without resolution.
At some point, we have to weigh the impacts of use on the resource itself to determine the actual carrying capacity of our rivers and public lands to balance access with conservation.  As usual, however, the commodification of those assets by profit-driven entities continues to outweigh the impacts to the public resource.
The simple truth is that the conservation of those resources is going to require significant investment.  For instance, Montana’s list of “chronically dewatered” rivers and streams has been in existence for decades — yet, most of those rivers remain chronically dewatered.
If the Montana Legislature really wanted to do the right thing, they’d put half of that $2.7 million into buying and leasing water rights to keep those rivers flowing, the fisheries healthy, and actually conserve the resource — instead of splurging on yet another study to document the ongoing decline.

This [&#8230;]","Nuclear reactor assemblies pictured Sept. 12, 2024, in storage at V.C. Summer nuclear site near Fairfield. (Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)South Carolina has made considerable progress in strengthening its energy and transmission infrastructure, but much more remains to be done to secure a reliable, cost-effective and independent energy future.
A critical piece of this effort lies in expanding nuclear power, which offers the unique combination of low-carbon emissions, sustainability, 24/7 reliability, and long-term affordability.
This is why I fully support an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy, including the revitalization of the unfinished reactors at the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station, and commend the South Carolina’s state and congressional lawmakers for taking decisive steps to advance nuclear energy in our state.
Efforts to expand South Carolina’s clean energy portfolio have already incentivized energy-efficient practices, expanding nuclear capabilities, and attracted private-sector investment in emerging renewable energy.
Tax credits such as the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit and the Advanced Energy Production Credit fuel business growth in the Palmetto State.
However, more work remains as our state’s energy demands are growing rapidly due to population increases and economic expansion.
State leaders and utility officials have been increasingly focused on the growth in demand for energy.
Our major utilities are already experiencing unprecedented load demand growth.
South Carolina’s population growth and accelerating economic development have caused utility planners to drastically increase their load growth forecasts, with electricity demand expected to surge over the next 15 years.
This demand growth will require an “all-of-the-above” increase in electricity generation capacity, including natural gas, renewables, and nuclear. It will also require a more streamlined approach to the planning and construction of new energy generation, regardless of the energy source.
To meet these challenges, South Carolina’s policymakers are now considering legislation that strengthens our energy sector, streamlines permitting and accelerates energy generation capacity.
Last month, the South Carolina House of Representatives passed H.3309, the South Carolina Energy Security Act, a bill prioritizing nuclear expansion as an energy source, alongside natural gas, hydrogen and renewables.
The state Senate will next debate this measure.
The Senate can develop legislation that balances reasonable permitting reforms with environmental protections, ensures appropriate regulatory oversight of the utilities while accelerating new energy generation, and prioritizes an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that includes the expansion of nuclear energy.
Reviving the V.C. Summer nuclear project represents one of the most promising opportunities to meet South Carolina’s energy needs.
Sen. Lindsey Graham recently affirmed his support for nuclear power, stating, “We cannot give up on nuclear power … South Carolina needs as much power as we can get.”
His leadership and advocacy for small modular reactors (SMRs) highlight the potential of modern nuclear technology to supplement traditional reactors and provide scalable, efficient energy solutions for our state.
As Congress sets its legislative agenda, Graham and South Carolina’s delegation can prioritize continued support for policies that modernize the state’s energy infrastructure, revitalize manufacturing, and strengthen national security.
Sen. Tim Scott has also championed efforts to ensure nuclear energy can be deployed more efficiently.
His recently introduced Nuclear Permitting Reform bill takes a commonsense approach to cutting through the bureaucratic red tape that slows down nuclear project approvals.
By reducing unnecessary delays and modernizing regulations, this bill would pave the way for projects like V.C. Summer’s revival and the expansion of next-generation nuclear technology in South Carolina.
Beyond state efforts, federal investments are playing a crucial role in advancing energy security. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, has provided South Carolina homes and businesses with key tax credits and incentives that help increase energy efficiency, promote solar energy, clean hydrogen and nuclear power production, and support offshore wind development.
Funding from that law has also fueled a resurgence in American manufacturing, leading to the announcement of 29 South Carolina projects promising to bring 16,500 jobs to the state.
Leveraging these resources, alongside nuclear expansion, will ensure South Carolina remains a leader in clean energy innovation.
Federal and state collaboration is crucial to ensuring South Carolina remains at the forefront of energy innovation.
The leadership shown by our congressional delegation and proactive efforts from our state Legislature put us in a strong position to secure our energy future.
However, the job is not yet done.
The state needs energy legislation that includes strong provisions for nuclear expansion and balanced permitting reform.

Tina Kotek called a “milestone” for reaching the state’s climate goals.
But that milestone can also be a millstone around the neck of the state’s transportation system as lawmakers try to figure out how to produce an estimated $1.8 billion annually for the state’s transportation needs. Sputtering revenue from the state’s 40-cents-per-gallon gas tax as Oregonians drive more fuel-efficient cars — plus rising construction costs tied to inflation — contributed to that deficit.
Electric vehicles, which have made up about 5% of the cars registered in Oregon in the past decade, aren’t subject to the gas tax. They’re subject to higher title and registration fees than gas-powered cars, but the average driver of a gas-powered car still pays more in gas taxes than electric drivers pay in other fees.
In 2015, Oregon became the first state in the nation to launch a voluntary program that allowed drivers to opt into a per-mile charge in exchange for lower DMV fees. But the OReGO program is still rarely used — fewer than 1,000 drivers participate in it — and lawmakers are now looking for ways to expand it to more drivers.
It’s a matter of fairness, according to Jim Whitty, a transportation policy expert who now works in the private sector but spent years developing the OReGO program.
“A road usage charge is necessary because it directly ties the use of roads to what we pay for them,” Whitty told the Joint Transportation Committee. “Once upon a time, Oregon’s fuel tax did this too.”
Sen. Bruce Starr, a Dundee Republican who now serves as vice chair of the committee, anticipated the need for such a charge 24 years ago, when he was in his first term in the House and chaired the transportation committee. During a 2001 hearing, he learned about and test-drove hydrogen-fueled vehicles.
“It opened my eyes to a potential problem of what happens when we don’t fill up vehicles with gasoline,” Starr said.
Starr’s eye-opening experience resulted in Oregon’s response to most problems: a task force. More than a decade later, that task force’s work led to OReGO, which lets electric vehicle owners and those driving cars that get 40 or more miles per gallon save on DMV fees by paying two cents per mile they drive. Other drivers can also sign up for the program and receive a tax credit.
Electric vehicle owners now pay $192 to title their cars, compared with title fees ranging between $101 and $116 for other passenger vehicles. Drivers of electric vehicles pay $316 to register their cars for two years, while other drivers pay between $126 and $156. Enrolling in OReGO can reduce registration fees for electric vehicles to $86.
Drivers who participate in the program sign up with one of two private companies and can use GPS-tracking devices, odometer readings or their car’s computer to track miles driven. The companies bill for those miles — and can subtract miles driven out of state — then take a cut off the top and send the remaining fee to the state.
Tim Martinez, a lobbyist for GeoToll, one of the two companies that operate the OReGO system, also drives an electric vehicle and participates in the program. He said the automatic billing system works well.
“ODOT has created a public-private program that works, and the time is now for this body to scale up the program in a fair and equitable manner,” Martinez said.

(Photo by Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

House Bill 270 updates Idaho’s indecent exposure law, which already bans public exposure of genitals, to include female breasts, male breasts altered to look like female breasts, artificial breasts and toys or products that resemble genitals.
Breastfeeding is exempt.
The bill takes effect immediately — through an emergency clause. Little signed the bill Wednesday, according to the governor’s office legislation tracker.
Supporters say the bill will protect decency and modernize Idaho’s indecent exposure law. Opponents say it could unduly punish transgender Idahoans and males experiencing hormonal conditions that enlarge breasts.
The Republican-supermajority controlled Legislature widely passed the bill, with support from 87 Republican state lawmakers and opposition from 14 Democratic state lawmakers.
The bill was cosponsored by Rep. Jeff Cornilles, R-Nampa, and Sens. Brian Lenney, R-Nampa, and Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene.
Debating the bill in the Senate this week, Lenney said the bill deals with a real problem of people exposing themselves.
“I’ve heard arguments … on this bill that said this somehow sexualizes breasts. I don’t think we need a bill to do that,” he said. “I think that’s been happening since the Garden of Eden, and it’s going to continue to happen forever.”
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, argued the bill violates the First Amendment by criminalizing expression that “we don’t like.”
And she said the bill would allow people to call police over dangling faux scrotums hung on truck hitches, commonly called truck nuts. 
“They’re gross, they’re offensive, and kids on the road see them. So why wouldn’t the police get a call and say, ‘That offends me, pull it off the truck?’” Wintrow said. “Because now this bill will allow it. And I talked to police and they said, ‘Indeed it would.’
Nampa City Councilmember Sebastian Griffin helped craft the bill, telling lawmakers that the bill stemmed from him seeing a topless woman at an event at Lakeview Park in Nampa, where Canyon County Pride was held. He testified a police officer he approached at the time said the person wasn’t engaging in illegal behavior.
That’s because it is not illegal for a man with breast enhancements to walk around topless, the officer said, according to Griffin.
A first violation of Idaho’s indecent exposure law is a misdemeanor crime. A second offense within five years is a felony.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)The Maine Secretary of State said she is concerned by a sweeping executive order issued earlier this week to overhaul the administration of U.S. elections, including requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote.
“I have serious concerns about the policies proposed in the Executive Order that would make it harder to vote for women, military and overseas voters and rural citizens,” said Secretary Shenna Bellows, in a statement Friday. “I am also deeply concerned about the data sharing requirements listed in the Executive Order.”
The order from President Donald Trump directs the federal Election Assistance Commission, which distributes grants to states, within 30 days to start requiring people registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or state-issued identification that indicates citizenship.
The order also prohibits the counting of absentee or mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day. States set their own rules for ballot counting and many allow those that arrive after Election Day but are postmarked before.
Trump signs broad elections order requiring proof of citizenship

The order also instructs the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, along with Trump megadonor Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, to gain access to state voter rolls in order to reportedly ensure the voter lists are up to date. DOGE entities will also have access to immigration databases and states will be allowed to ask Homeland Security to verify if any noncitizen is on the state’s list of voters.
While the order mirrors the president’s rhetoric on the campaign trail about noncitizens voting in federal elections and his crackdown on immigration since returning to office, it is likely to face legal challenges from voting rights groups and Democratic state attorneys general.
“Mainers should be able to trust that their voter registration and driver’s license data will be protected by their government,” Bellows said. “Previous and ongoing actions by this administration have shown a disregard for information security and data privacy, so I will work with my colleagues in Maine and around the country to protect the rights of Maine voters and the security of our elections.”
Bellows, who announced she will run for Maine governor in 2026, also chairs a partnership of election officials from various levels of government focused on election security and cybersecurity called the Election Infrastructure — Information Sharing and Analysis Center. 
However, given that the partnership was recently defunded by Homeland Security, Bellows said it is “ironic” for Trump to assert that this executive order will protect election integrity.

This week: Trump moves to strip federal workers of union rights; Minnesota public unions vow to fight part-time return-to-office order; U of M resident physicians file for union; child labor violations on the rise; and 80 nursing home workers strike in Minneapolis. 
Trump signs order rescinding union rights of federal workers
Citing his national security authority, President Trump signed an executive order Thursday rescinding the collective bargaining rights of a massive swath of the federal workforce in a historic attack on public unions.
The order strips workers from the right to union representation across the federal enterprise, including at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Land Management.
While the order also includes the Department of Homeland Security, law enforcement officers including U.S. Border Patrol are exempted, as are firefighters, in a transparent gift to his political coalition.
Trump’s order cites the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which grants the president the power to terminate the union rights of workers in agencies with intelligence, counterintelligence or national security work as a primary function.
“Certain federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s agenda,” the White House said in announcing the order. “President Trump supports constructive partnerships with unions who work with him; he will not tolerate mass obstruction that jeopardizes his ability to manage agencies with vital national security missions.”
Following the order, the affected agencies filed a lawsuit against federal employee unions in Texas federal court seeking to terminate their union contracts.
The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal union representing more than 800,000 workers, promised immediate legal action to challenge what it called a “blatant attempt at political punishment.” The union estimates it affects more than 1 million employees — about a third of whom are veterans.
“This administration’s bullying tactics represent a clear threat not just to federal employees and their unions, but to every American who values democracy and the freedoms of speech and association. Trump’s threat to unions and working people across America is clear: fall in line or else,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.
AFGE and other public unions have filed numerous lawsuits against Trump’s executive orders,  including the indiscriminate purge of federal probationary workers, which was reversed by a federal judge. The union also sued the Trump administration for terminating the government’s union contract covering tens of thousands of security agents and other employees at the Transportation Security Administration.
The White House said the unions representing Veterans Affairs workers have filed 70 national and local grievances over Trump’s policies since the inauguration. Those are terminated along with the labor contracts, under Trump’s executive order.
Federal workers have also relied on their union protections to speak out publicly against what they believe are harmful policies to the workforce.
The order seems to go further than Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for a second Trump term, which proposed renegotiating public union contracts to further limit their power while Congress “consider whether public-sector unions are appropriate in the first place.”
Federal employee unions already have far more limited powers than private sector unions, and are barred from negotiating over wages, benefits and hiring decisions. Unionized federal employees are also prohibited from striking.
Unionized state employees vow to fight return to office order

The unions representing nearly 40,000 Minnesota state employees vowed to fight Gov. Tim Walz’s order for most workers to return to the office 50% of the time beginning on June 1.
“Our members are so fired up,” said Megan Dayton, president of the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees. “A lot of them are saying this is the thing to strike over.”
Union leaders say many employees have organized their lives around working from home — some were hired as fully remote — and are now scrambling to find child care or buy a second car in order to make it into the office two or three times a week.
Dayton said there may not even be enough office space or parking spots available, as agencies have downsized to adjust for remote work at a considerable savings. The Department of Revenue, for example, reduced its leased office space by 35% since 2021, saving $2.45 million annually. The agency also reported greater efficiency since 2019 and higher retention and recruitment.
The order may be particularly galvanizing for state employees as they watch the Trump administration attack the federal workforce while the governor has frequently been traveling out-of-state for speaking engagements, setting up a potential presidential run.
Walz said mandatory hybrid work, with an exception for those living more than 75 miles from the office, promotes collaboration and follows the trend in both the private and public sectors of bringing workers back to the office. St. Paul city employees will be required to return to the office three days a week starting April 1, while major employers including General Mills, 3M and U.S. Bank have also required workers to return to the office.
“I think there’s a power in teams when they’re together,” Walz said at an unrelated news conference on Wednesday.
Walz also said calling workers back could help revive downtown St. Paul, which is succumbing to a vicious doom loop as visitors disappear, businesses shutter and the commercial tax base evaporates.
There is nowhere to buy groceries downtown after Lunds and Byerley’s closed its doors for good on Wednesday. Walz said he told the grocery chain’s leaders that a return to office could be on the horizon, but it wasn’t enough for them to reconsider. (That came as a shock to union leaders, who said they were blindsided by the announcement, finding out at the same time as the public.)
DFL lawmakers stood alongside union leaders at a news conference on Thursday blasting the governor’s order as an assault on workers; House legislative staff are required to work full-time in office during the Legislative session and two days a week out of session. Legislative staff are also prohibited from unionizing.
Walz said around 60% of state employees already work in-person and did so through the entire COVID-19 pandemic. He said he was confident there would be enough space to accommodate a return to the office.
Walz also rejected the suggestion that the return-to-work order could be a way to thin the state workforce in the face of a souring budget outlook. He said he was more concerned about the high attrition of employees in their first six months, which he thinks could be improved with hybrid work fostering more connection and mentorship opportunities.
A strike couldn’t happen until late in the summer — after the state’s contracts with MAPE and AFSCME expire on June 30 and the unions have participated in mediation — and such an extreme action may not win broad public sympathy given many other office workers transitioned to hybrid schedules years ago, while frontline workers — like bus drivers, nurses and servers — never worked from home.
The unions may not have much recourse. Though they said they are considering possible litigation, their contracts only entitle workers to have meetings to discuss changes to remote work and the ability to appeal those decisions. Changes to remote work aren’t subject to a formal grievance process, however.
U of M resident physicians file for union
A supermajority of the nearly 1,000 resident physicians and fellows at the University of Minnesota filed to unionize in one of the largest union drives in the state in recent years, SEIU’s Committee of Interns and Residents union announced on Monday.
The move comes on the heels of more than 200 resident physicians at Hennepin Healthcare becoming the first to file to unionize in Minnesota earlier this month as part of a surge in organizing among young doctors in their final years of training.
Resident physicians complain of unsustainable working conditions, often putting in grueling 80-hour weeks and taking home what amounts to about the city of Minneapolis’ minimum hourly wage of $15.97.
Under state law, the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services will certify the union without an election if the agency is able to verify a majority of the bargaining unit has signed in support of the union.
Child labor violations on the rise in Minnesota

Child labor violations have increased significantly in Minnesota — and across the country — in recent years as a tight labor market has coincided with a surge in unaccompanied migrant children.
The number of underage workers found to be employed in violation of child labor laws increased nearly fivefold in the United States and more than twofold in Minnesota from 2015 to 2023, according to a new report from the left-leaning think tank North Star Policy Action.
One-third of the minors counted in 2022 came from just one case where investigators found children employed by Packers Sanitation Services cleaning hazardous equipment during overnight shifts at the JBS plant in Worthington, the Turkey Valley Farms plant in Marshall and the Buckhead Meat plant in St. Cloud.
It’s difficult to determine if the uptick is caused simply by more enforcement, but the researchers say there’s reason to believe illegal child labor has increased with the rise of migrant children arriving from Latin America. One study cited in the report found a state’s child labor violations increase 10% for every 1% increase in unaccompanied minors.
North Star Policy Action recommends that Minnesota lawmakers bolster labor protections for children by aligning state and federal law, which they say is particularly important now given the potential for the Trump administration to roll back child labor laws. Project 2025 calls for the Department of Labor to permit teenagers to work in hazardous jobs with parental consent.
80 nursing home workers struck for two days
Around 80 nursing assistants, cooks, housekeepers and other workers at Providence Place nursing home in Minneapolis struck on Tuesday and Wednesday as they seek higher wages and staffing levels.
The two sides remain “very far apart” on raises and don’t have more negotiations planned yet, said Rasha Ahmad Sharif, executive vice president of SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa, the union representing the workers. The union is seeking 17.5% raises over three years, while the company has offered 5% over two years, Sharif said.
SEIU had also called strikes at three other facilities but reached tentative agreements last week to avert a work stoppage. Workers at The Villas at St. Louis Park will receive a 4.5% increase and will negotiate raises in the following two years of the contract.
Wages for all nursing home workers in Minnesota are set to increase to $22 per hour on average across job duties in 2026 and $23.49 per hour in 2027, contingent upon funding from the state, under rules passed by the state’s Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board. The board also voted to guarantee workers 11 paid holidays, which nursing home industry groups are currently suing to block.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 11:08:20.127987

(Wesley Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana voters have seen political mail, online advertising and even television spots about the four constitutional amendments on the ballot Saturday, but weak public financial disclosure laws make it difficult to say who is paying for those election efforts. 
Groups supporting and opposing the amendments are trying to sway voters using money from nonprofit organizations that aren’t required to disclose their donors. The tactic makes it impossible to get the full picture of who is paying for the campaigns surrounding the amendments.

Gov. Jeff Landry has been traveling the state trying to gin up support for the four constitutional changes, which would affect taxes, state budgeting, court operations, criminal sentencing and judicial elections. 

Most of the public campaigning has taken place on Amendment 2, which reworks the state’s income tax structure, and Amendment 3, which could result in more minors being sent into adult prisons. 

A review of campaign finance reports shows that at least $588,000 had been spent to pass Amendment 2. Another $509,000 has been spent on an opposition campaign to all four amendments, with a priority on defeating Amendment 3. 

Based on the campaign reports available from the Louisiana Ethics Administration, the groups spending in favor of Amendment 2 include a Landry political action committee (PAC) called Make Louisiana Great Again ($292,000); the antitax organization Americans for Prosperity ($157,000); the Louisiana Republican Legislative Delegation ($125,000); and Louisiana House Speaker Phillip DeVillier’s Foundation PAC ($14,000). 
The opposition groups who submitted campaign reports are the Vera Institute of Justice ($482,000) and Southern Poverty Law Center ($28,000), organizations that focus on lowering incarceration rates and providing alternatives to prison. 
This spending likely represents just a portion of the money that has gone into the constitutional amendment campaigns so far. 

Rules for the disclosure of spending on amendments are more relaxed than they are for traditional elections that feature political candidates. A wider range of nonprofit organizations are able to spend money on constitutional propositions without having to submit campaign finance reports to the state, according to people working on both sides of the amendment campaigns.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
For example, conservative activist and former state representative Woody Jenkins does not intend to report any of his political activity opposing Amendment 2 on campaign finance forms. 
Jenkins, who helped write the current state constitution ratified in 1974, is upset Amendment 2 would weaken protections for religious organizations’ property tax exemptions. It would remove those property tax breaks from the state constitution, thereby making them easier to eliminate. 

He has run editorials and news articles critical of Amendment 2 in his two Baton Rouge-based community newspapers. Jenkins also shares content online opposing the amendment through his political accounts, though he doesn’t think that activity rises to the level of requiring an ethics disclosure. 

“We don’t have a campaign or anything,” Jenkins said. 
Likewise, the Protect Louisiana’s Children PAC sent out a mail piece this week supporting Amendment 2 and touting the amendment’s endorsement by the Louisiana Federation of Teachers. 
Republican political consultant Jason Hebert runs the group, which helped elect Landry in 2023, and it hasn’t publicly disclosed any political spending on the amendments. 

Even when political groups submitted campaign finance reports, it’s been difficult to figure out who is paying for their election efforts. 

Landry’s Make Louisiana Great Again PAC got all $300,000 of its amendment campaign money from just one contributor: a “social welfare” nonprofit called Protect Louisiana Values set up to support Landry. 
Protect Louisiana Values is probably best known as the organization that helped bring a live tiger from Florida to the LSU football game against Alabama last fall. Its donors are secret, meaning no one knows who put up the money for the live tiger mascot — or the recent PAC push for Amendment 2. 
Shane Guidry, a wealthy oilfield services executive and Landry confidant, defended the decision to keep those donors private, even after Guidry admitted he is one of the group’s contributors. 
“It lets people support what they want to support without being ridiculed,” Landry said in a telephone interview Thursday from the Bahamas. “All of us have businesses. We all have friends on both sides of the aisle.” 
Guidry spoke on the phone while attending a blue marlin fishing tournament this week with Steve Orlando, another close friend of Landry’s who is chairman of the Make Louisiana Great Again PAC. Orlando also heads Landry’s Fiscal Responsibility Program, which is modeled after Elon Musk’s federal-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 
Who’s paying for the amendments’ opposition campaign is also opaque.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 

The Vera Institute only listed a handful of contributors on its campaign finance reports. The Foundation for Louisiana and The Navigation Fund, a charity founded by cryptocurrency billionaire Jared McCaleb, was expected to give $25,000 to efforts to defeat the amendments, according to the forms. But there was no accounting for where Vera got the remaining $400,000-plus it had already spent on the campaign.  
Sara Omojola, who works for the Vera Institute in Louisiana, said Thursday the organization was putting its own money into the election. Headquartered in New York City, Vera focuses on reducing the country’s prison population and took in over $260 million in annual revenue in both 2022 and 2023. It didn’t disclose donors on its most recent tax form. 

Landry sought Thursday to link Vera and other groups opposed to his constitutional amendment push to liberal billionaire George Soros, a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor who has served as a bogeyman for Republicans for several years.
Soros’ Open Societies Foundations  gave $1.25 million in 2023 to Vera Action Inc., an affiliated group of the Vera Institute, but the donation is a relatively small sum of money compared with the nonprofit’s overall annual revenue. It’s also not clear, based on tax filings, whether any of that money would have been spent in Louisiana. 
Landry’s pro-Amendment 2 coalition has its own controversial billionaire in the mix as well. Conservative Republican Charles Koch is the founder of Americans for Prosperity, a group that has been knocking on doors, phone banking and sending out direct mail in favor of Amendment 2 over the last two months. 

A Kansas native, Koch is an anti-tax activist with libertarian leanings who often draws the ire of Democrats for spending in national politics. Americans for Prosperity is supporting Amendment 2, in part, because it would lower the maximum rate of the state income tax, said Scott Simon, the former Louisiana state representative who leads the organization’s Louisiana chapter. 

“Our efforts are all on Amendment 2,” Simon said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DJI_0150-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 11:08:20.127987

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Saying Utahns are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox will allow a bill aimed at banning many flags — including pride or LGBTQ+ flags — from schools and all government buildings to become law without his signature. 
Cox explained his reasoning in a letter to legislative leaders issued with just over an hour to spare before his midnight deadline Thursday to sign or veto bills passed by the 2025 Utah Legislature.

“HB77 has been one of the most divisive bills of the session, and I am deeply disappointed that it did not land in a better place,” wrote Cox, who also explained he agreed with the intent behind the legislation. “My understanding is that there was a deal on a compromise that would have removed problematic portions of the bill while retaining others that would support political neutrality in the classroom. Sadly the sponsors did not move that deal forward.”
Supporters of HB77, sponsored by Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, argued it was meant to promote “political neutrality” in government spaces. But critics argued a broad ban that extended to all government properties would invite free speech litigation while also leaving some Utahns, especially the LGBTQ+ community, feeling unwelcome and erased. 
Now slated to take effect on May 7, HB77 will ban almost all flags from being displayed on or in public buildings, except for flags explicitly allowed in a prescriptive list included in the bill, such as the U.S. flag, the state flag, military flags, Olympic flags, college or university flags, or others. Pride flags or other LGBTQ+ flags — which Utah lawmakers in recent years have repeatedly tried to bar from schools in various ways — would be prohibited.
It’s slated to make Utah the first state in the nation to enact such sweeping flag restrictions in government-owned buildings. The Idaho Legislature recently passed a similar bill, HB41, which Gov. Brad Little signed last week, but that legislation won’t take effect until July 1 and it only applies to schools. Idaho lawmakers are also advancing a separate bill to restrict government entities from displaying certain types of flags. 
Utah Legislature bans pride flags from schools, public buildings

Utah’s largest LGBTQ+ rights group, Equality Utah, had negotiated with lawmakers on the bill, which originally focused the flag ban on school classrooms. However, in a House committee last month, Lee changed the legislation to broaden the flag ban to all government property, leading Equality Utah to oppose the bill even though it was prepared to take a “neutral” position on its earlier version. 
Cox faced numerous calls to veto HB77 from advocacy groups including Equality Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, as well as from Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, whose city hosts the annual Utah Pride Festival. He could have vetoed the bill — but he indicated in his letter that it would likely just be overridden by the GOP-supermajority Utah Legislature. Instead, he’s urging lawmakers to work to fix it. 
“I continue to have serious concerns with this bill,” Cox said. “However, because a veto would be overridden, I have decided to allow the bill to go into law without my signature, and urge lawmakers to consider commonsense solutions that address the bill’s numerous flaws.”
Cox encouraged lawmakers to consider allowing the Utah State Board of Education to “go further in ensuring the political neutrality of our classrooms, while also considering repealing the local government piece of this legislation and allowing elected representatives to answer to their own constituents.” 
“If you are willing to pursue this kind of solution, you will have an open door in the executive branch,” Cox wrote. 
Cox’s comments on the flag ban came after the bill cast final-hour drama over Utah’s multimillion-dollar bid to entice the Sundance Film Festival to stay, with some saying it could impact Utah’s chances. 
Earlier Thursday, festival organizers announced they’d opted to move the event to Colorado to help the festival grow. By the time they’d reached their decision, Cox had not yet acted on HB77, but a veto was looking unlikely.
Sundance is leaving Utah, moving to Colorado

While Cox told reporters last week Sundance organizers had told state leaders “very clearly that political issues have nothing to do with the decision,” others, including Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, worried that HB77 could indeed be “harmful to our effort to retain Sundance.” 
In the end, Utah lost its bid. Cox — who earlier Thursday called Sundance’s decision a “mistake” — also included a note in his letter that he’ll be calling a special session to address, among other issues, what the Legislature should instead do with the $3.5 million it had set aside as part of Utah’s bid to keep Sundance. 
“Let’s reappropriate that money to efforts in Utah to create a new festival and a world-class film economy right here in our state,” he said. 
Cox says he agrees with ‘underlying intent,’ but HB77 has flaws
Cox, in his letter, dove deeper into why he had misgivings with HB77 but said he agreed with the “underlying intent” of the bill. 
“I deeply believe that our classrooms need to be a place where everyone feels welcome — free from the politics that are fracturing our country,” Cox wrote. “Parents are rightly upset when they bring their kids to publicly funded schools and see culture-war symbols in a place that should be apolitical. In an attempt to make some kids feel more welcome, other kids feel less welcome.”
Cox also said he appreciated that the bill is “neutral on the types of flags in question,” while adding that “I find it strange that no headline reads ‘MAGA flags banned from classrooms.’”
Drama over Utah’s bid to keep Sundance heats up over LGBTQ+ flag ban bill

“I agree with the underlying intent of those legislators who supported this bill in an attempt to bring political neutrality to the classroom,” he said, though he added, “Unfortunately, this bill does not do that.” 
He said because it’s aimed at only flags, “there is little preventing countless other displays — posters, signs, drawings, furniture — from entering the classroom.” 
“To those legislators who supported this bill, I’m sure it will not fix what you are trying to fix,” Cox said. 
He noted that many schools have already enacted their own “political neutrality” policies in classrooms, and he argued “we have a better place” to make regulations: the Utah State Board of Education. While he said the board has already set expectations for political neutrality in teacher code of conduct, “I believe more needs to be done by USBE to provide direction in this regard.” 
“I have asked the Board of Education to continue their work to find ways to make our classrooms both more politically neutral and more welcoming to every student to exercise their own individual freedom of expression,” Cox said. “The idea that kids can only feel welcome in a school if a teacher puts up a rainbow flag is just wrong. Let’s do everything possible to make our classrooms one of the last remaining politically neutral places in our state.”
Cox says bill goes ‘too far’ 
The governor added that the flag ban “goes too far” by extending the ban to local governments. 
“While I think it’s wrong for city and county officials to fly divisive flags, I believe that election have consequences and the best way to stop that behavior is to elect people who believe differently,” Cox said. “All this bill does is add more fuel to the fire, and I suspect it will only ratchet up the creative use of political symbolism.”
Ultimately, Cox urged legislators to focus on solutions rather than legislation that deepens divides. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“As tired as Utahns are of politically divisive symbols, I think they are also tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” he said.
The governor urged lawmakers to work with the LGBTQ+ community, as they have in the past, to find common ground. 
“Utah has always had a reputation of trying to find a way to work together and solve issues between sides that have strongly-held, opposing points of view,” Cox said. “There are so many examples of the LGBTQ community and the conservative community coming together to find helpful and hopeful compromise. I hope we can retain this as our model and North Star.”
The governor also shared a message directly to LGBTQ+ Utahns, acknowledging that “recent legislation has been difficult.” 
“Politics can be a bit of a blood sport at times and I know we have had our disagreements,” he said. “I want you to know that I love and appreciate you and I am grateful that you are part of our state. I know these words may ring hollow to many of you, but please know that I mean them sincerely.”

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
Race and place can contribute to shorter lives, research suggests

The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”
Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.










All of data is a story. It's a grandmother, it's a son, it's a story of a community's well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute


Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
How the state, tribes and federal government are working to curb SD’s syphilis epidemic

A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”
There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A St. Louis-based company with an Iowa grain dealer license has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Iowa farmers with unpaid grain sold to Benson Hill Holdings, Inc. prior to March 20, can file a claim for indemnity, according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.
Don McDowell, communications director for IDALS, said the department is not “immediately aware” of any affected farmers.
The grain indemnity fund will pay farmers 90% of their loss, up to $300,000, though claims related to Benson Hill must be mailed or personally delivered to IDALS’s Grain Warehouse Bureau by July 18.
The fund was established by the Iowa Legislature in 1986 and accrues via a per-bushel fee on purchased grain and fees on licensed warehouses and grain dealers.
According to minutes from the Iowa Grain Indemnity Fund Board, the balance of the fund as of Feb. 19 was $8.4 million.
Benson Hill filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy March 20 and has up to $11 million in debtor-in-possession financing to continue its day-to-day operations.
Christi Dixon, a spokesperson for the seed innovation company, said it is “restructuring” its finances.
“We will continue to meet our contractual commitments and support key farmers without interruption,” Dixon said in an email.
Dixon said the company maintains a seed processing facility in Bondurant and employs seven people in Iowa. Benson Hill previously owned a soy processing facility in Creston, but sold the facility in February 2024 to White River Nutrition.
McDowell said the grain license for Benson Hill included locations in Cherokee and Galva.
 Changes to the fund

In 2023, the grain indemnity fund fell below its minimum threshold, which triggered the farmer-paid fees to support the fund, after nearly 30 years without needing to fill the fund. It also triggered legislative efforts to reform the grain indemnity fund to reflect modern farming practices and pricing.
The efforts have stalled out in the past due to disagreements on including credit-sale contracts, which are currently excluded from the fund.
House legislation introduced this year, would increase the fund’s minimum from from $3 million to $8 million, and its maximum from $8 million to $16 million. It would also extend protections to farmers with credit-sale contracts, but would only reimburse these contracts at 70%.
The bill is not yet eligible for floor debate in the House and could be killed by the upcoming April 4 “funnel” deadline if it does not advance to the Senate and through committee.
The Senate version of the bill would increase the minimum and maximum to $5 million and $12 million, respectively, and would include credit-sale contracts as transactions covered by the fund.
The Senate bill is eligible for floor debate.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana (ACLU) filed a class action lawsuit on Friday challenging a Gov. Mike Braun executive order that ended the process for updating gender markers on state documents, specifically birth certificates. 
Complying with the executive action, the Vital Records Division of the Indiana Department of Health has halted the process for approving changes to gender markers that have been ordered by the courts. The plaintiff is a 15-year-old girl who was born in Indiana but now lives in Ohio and can’t get an amended birth certificate. 
“Transgender Hoosiers have a right to accurate birth certificates to live safely and authentically. Court-ordered changes to birth certificates are common for a number of reasons, and to deny trans people the right to change these important documents is discrimination,” ACLU Legal Director Ken Falk said in a statement.
  ACLU of Indiana Legal Director Ken Falk (From the ACLU of Indiana website)
Braun’s executive order mirrors a similar one from President Donald Trump, which he signed on his first day in office. 
“The Executive Order is disconnected from the reality that transgender persons and other gender-diverse persons exist in Indiana. The reality that gender identity may differ from the sex assigned at birth is a matter of science and medicine and also is recognized by courts, including the United States Supreme Court,” the lawsuit asserts. 
Adopted Hoosiers or those changing their name can get updated birth certificates, which are used to get driver’s licenses, open bank accounts, enroll in school and more. Having a document with another gender can complicate access to these services for gender diverse Hoosiers. 
“Have to present a birth certificate that identifies (the plaintiff) as ‘male’ will immediately create a risk of ‘outing’ her as transgender to all who view the birth certificate, or may result in others questioning whether her birth certificate is authentic or genuine as she has a female name and appears in all respects to be a girl and will only appear more feminine in the future,” the lawsuit said.
Previously, gender marker changes on birth certificates could occur following a court order.  
The 19-page complaint maintains that the executive order violates privacy rights and discriminates against certain classes of Hoosiers, a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
The underlying executive order directs state agencies to respect the “biological binary,” defining sex, gender, woman, man, female and male. According to the text, gender is synonymous with sex, defined as a person’s “immutable biological classification as either male or female.”
The order does not acknowledge the existence of intersex or transgender Hoosiers. 
“It is the official position of Indiana’s Executive Branch that modern gender ideology is inconsistent with this fundamental and deeply rooted legal distinction between men and women,” the order read. “Modern gender ideology attempts to replace the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity.” 
The ACLU will host a virtual press conference Friday afternoon.

The Trump administration has eliminated more than $1 billion for local foods programs, which has left food banks and school systems scrambling (Spencer Platt/Getty Images).For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program drastically raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.
The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.
Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”
 A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks

Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.
The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.
“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.
Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”
 A boost for school lunches

For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.
West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

Taylor/National Park Service)The Alaska Board of Game on Thursday approved state officials’ request to continue a controversial predator control program in Western Alaska, even though a judge ruled two weeks ago that the bear-killing program violated the state constitution.
The board granted an Alaska Department of Fish and Game petition for emergency action to carry out a third season of shooting bears and wolves to keep them from preying on the ailing Mulchatna Caribou Herd. In the past two years, the predator control program — carried out in late spring and early summer within the herd’s range — killed 175 brown bears, five black bears and 19 wolves, according to the department.
The emergency finding is warranted to help a herd that fell from a peak of about 200,000 in the late 1990s to about 13,000 now, too low to allow any hunting, board members said on the final day of a weeklong meeting in Anchorage.
“Right now, we have a herd that has shut down where a large number of people in Western Alaska can’t put caribou in their freezer right now. And it’s not going to grow if they don’t have calf survival,” said Stosh Hoffman, a board member from Bethel.
People in the region need to be able to hunt caribou because other food sources are uncertain, Hoffman said.
“We’re in tough times out here. A lot of things are changing. The salmon is in big decline. Our moose population, everyone knows it’s going to tip over real soon, like new moose populations tend to do. When they crash, they crash hard,” he said. He noted that the Alaska Federation of Natives, at its last convention, unanimously supported a resolution in favor of Mulchatna predator control.
But Nicole Schmitt, executive director of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, said she was “shocked” at what the department and the board did.
“We just think it was a complete betrayal of the public process,” Schmitt said. Emergency regulations in the past have closed hunting, not opened or reopened predator control, she said. “This says to me if the board wants something done, they will manufacture an emergency to that end.”
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance is considering how to respond, she said. We’re looking at something that includes a legal response, as well as other options,” she said.
The Department of Fish and Game submitted the petition for emergency action last Friday, on the first day of the regularly scheduled Anchorage meeting.
While department officials say the predator removals done to date have resulted in increased calf births that help the herd, opponents say factors like habitat change rather than predation are behind the herd’s population decline.
Opponents also say that the program threatens populations of bears, including those that frequent the well-known bear-viewing areas in Katmai National Park and Preserve.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance filed a lawsuit in 2023 that resulted in the ruling against the program.
Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi ruled on March 14 that it was carried out in violation of public-notice and public-comment requirements and that it violated the state constitution’s sustained-yield mandate by failing to adequately evaluate impacts to bear populations.
At the Board of Game meeting, there was debate among members about whether adequate public notice and opportunities for public comment had been given this time. Some members argued for a separate meeting. But the majority, by a 5-2 vote, decided to deal with the matter Thursday, the last day of the weeklong meeting.
The vote to authorize the program’s resumption passed by a 6-1 margin. Member John Wood, who agreed with others that the matter qualified as an emergency but had expressed some concerns about proper public notice, was the lone dissenter.
Ryan Scott, director of the department’s Division of Wildlife, said the program can start imminently. To be effective, it has to be carried out in the late spring and early summer, during the calving season, he said.
The department is poised to start its third season of the Mulchatna predator control, he told Board of Game members.
“It’s not about beginning to gear up. We are full tilt. We have contracts in place, we got fuel moving,” he told the board. Though the court ruling has implications for proper processes to follow, the department is treating the matter as having some urgency, he said. “I mean, 30 days from now, we’ll probably be putting people in the field,” he said.

Now, water agent Joel Ferry — who also leads the Utah Division of Natural Resources — [&#8230;]","The Colorado River is pictured near Moab on Sunday, Feb. 18, 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A new law signed by the governor this week lifts some of the constraints on Utah’s water agent, a relatively new position tasked with negotiating with other states, or even countries, to bring more water to the Beehive State.
Now, water agent Joel Ferry — who also leads the Utah Division of Natural Resources — will be able to include the Colorado and Bear rivers in his negotiations.   
Sponsored by Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, the bill frees up Ferry to work with neighboring states or entities that are currently governed by interstate compacts, like the Colorado River Compact, which divides the Colorado River drainage into an upper and lower basin and allocates water between seven states and Mexico — and the Bear River Compact, an agreement between Utah, Idaho and Wyoming that dictates how much water each state can use from the river.    
The water agent job has only been around for six months, created during the 2024 legislative session through SB211, a bill facilitating Utah’s long-term water planning. The water agent is charged with negotiating with other states and countries for ways to bring more water into Utah, while coordinating with the Utah Water Development Council, also created by SB211. 
But SB211 prohibited the water agent from entering into negotiations related to “interests governed by interstate compacts.” Essentially, water allocated by the Bear River and Colorado River compacts was off limits. 
  Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, speaks in the House Chamber at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Friday, Jan. 26, 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)
Now, that language has been cut from state code, allowing the water agent to recommend any water augmentation project — defined in the bill as an infrastructure project on interstate waters that will increase water availability in Utah — to the state’s Board of Water Resources. 
In an interview during the legislative session, Snider said his bill doesn’t threaten these interstate compacts, which will still dictate how water is divided among states. 
“We still have the Colorado River Commissioner, who is the chief negotiator on that,” he said. “We’re not going to be able to do anything unless there’s agreement from another state. We just want to make sure if there is something on the table, we are not hindered because of our statutes.”
Ferry said that language clarifies what the original legislation intended. By declaring the Colorado River and Bear River compacts as off limits, he says that effectively made it so the water agent couldn’t work with Utah’s neighbors. 
“The original legislation said if there is a federal compact, the agent can’t work in those states. Well, guess what states those are — Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, California — all of our surrounding states. So you’re basically saying, ‘hey, go do this task, but you can’t work with our neighbors,’” said Ferry. “We don’t want to be hamstrung, or make it so that the state water agent can’t work with neighboring states.”

It’s unclear what exactly Ferry is working on. SB211 shields the water agent from Utah public records law, making any document that reveals a legal strategy in water negotiations, or anything else that might “harm the ability of the Utah water agent to negotiate the best terms and conditions regarding the use of water” a protected record, per the bill text. 
Negotiations over water can be tense and difficult, hence lawmakers’ reasoning for the public records exemption. “When you talk about water most people bring a shotgun and a pony shovel with them,” said Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, in 2024. 
But Adams’ explanation does little to ease the fears of government transparency groups and environmentalists, who have criticized the shadowy nature of the position. Those fears are worsened now that the water agent can include the Colorado and Bear rivers in negotiations. 
“What this bill certainly does, especially in the context of the Colorado and the Bear rivers, is open the possibility for more negotiations behind closed doors that the public won’t know about until the cake has been baked,” said Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, a water policy and environmental nonprofit.  
Roerink said that could manifest in a number of ways — maybe it’s new development on the Bear River with Idaho, a project on the Green River with Wyoming, or an agreement with Arizona or Nevada to deplete more of the Virgin River.

“The bill clearly does not authorize a specific project. But what it does is open the door to a number of possibilities for a behind-the-scenes, cloak-and-dagger negotiation,” he said. 
Ferry, when asked about what he plans to do now that he’s free to negotiate with neighboring states, didn’t offer specifics. Things are in motion, and if he said anything publicly, he worried that would kill progress. 
“At the same time, these ideas are out there and we’re exploring,” said Ferry, who has led trips to California, Israel and Canada to explore new water infrastructure projects. 
“It’s thinking outside the box, looking at engineered solutions,” he said. “The water agent has been in existence for about six months, it’s an infant office. It’s really about learning and understanding the lay of the land, building relationships with neighboring states and looking at what opportunities other states have been implementing.” 
Desalination plants, pipelines and more: What is a water augmentation project? 
A key piece of the water agent’s job is negotiating for new water augmentation projects, defined as infrastructure or technology that increases water supply and availability — that includes rainwater storage, dams and reservoirs, recharging aquifers or building pipelines. 
Probably the best example inside the state’s borders is the Central Utah Project, a system of reservoirs, pipelines and rivers that transports water from the Colorado River basin in eastern Utah through Strawberry Reservoir to the Wasatch Front. 
Even though they live in an entirely different basin, there are residents in Utah County, for example, who have Colorado River water flowing through their taps. 
Another example is a hypothetical project that has been getting more attention recently — building a desalination plant off the coast of California in exchange for a portion of the Golden State’s Colorado River share. 
Snider said there’s nothing like that currently on the table, “but I wish there were.”
The proposed Lake Powell Pipeline, a controversial proposal to pipe water from Lake Powell to Washington County in southwestern Utah, also fits the definition of a water augmentation project. The pipeline has been on the back burner for years, with drought, a depleted Colorado River and federal red tape standing in its way. None of that is changed by HB311, said Snider. 
“That’s going to have hurdles that far exceed any of the state’s dreams,” Snider said about the Lake Powell Pipeline. “You’ve got hundreds of miles of statewide property you’ve got to cross, you have a Colorado River that’s at its lowest point ever and you have Lake Powell that’s at 30% (capacity) right now. There are things impacting that project that are just on-the-ground realities.”

(Getty Images)U.S. House members in two of Alabama’s three districts with major automotive plants Thursday criticized President Donald Trump’s plans to impose 25% tariffs on automobiles and automobile parts.
The tariffs could hit Alabama’s car plants hard. Most of Alabama’s leading imports in 2023 — including oil, engines, transmissions and ignition sets – went toward building automobiles. 
U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Selma, whose district includes the Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, wrote on social media Thursday that she has not supported tariffs on automobile parts since Trump proposed them in his first term in 2019.

In 2019, Sewell and 160 other lawmakers sent a letter to the National Economic Council Director opposing the tariffs citing increased prices on consumers and the possibility of loss of jobs. 
“We agreed that they would raise prices, hurt consumers and manufacturers, and weaken our economy,” she wrote on Thursday. “It’s still true today.”
U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, whose district includes the Hyundai plant outside Montgomery, echoed the concern of increased prices and lost jobs in a statement Thursday.
“The reality is that the companies are not going to absorb those expenses; they’re going to pass them off to people who purchase vehicles in my district, in the state, and across the country,” he said. 
Figures also noted that the tariffs are another policy by the Trump administration that will hurt everyday Americans. 
“These tariffs are yet another example of this administration acting without considering how it will impact everyday people, and most certainly not considering how it will affect people in industries in the state of Alabama,” he said.
Messages seeking comment from U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks, whose district includes  a Honda plant outside Lincoln, were left Thursday morning. 
Trump signed the executive order Wednesday. The tariffs will go into effect on April 2. 
Representatives of the state’s automobile industry were much more cautious about the tariffs on Thursday.
Jennifer Safavian, CEO of Auto Drive America (ADA), said the tariffs will definitely lead to higher vehicle prices across the country in a phone interview Thursday. The organization represents five automotive manufacturers in Alabama: Honda in Lincoln, Hyundai in Montgomery, Mazda Toyota in Huntsville and two Mercedes-Benz U.S. International plants outside Tuscaloosa.
“No question, there ‘ill be higher costs because of the tariffs, which will in turn increase prices for vehicles,” Safavian said.
Safavian said the company had a consulting firm model what the tariffs will impact. Under the 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and previously announced 10% tariffs on all imported goods, Safavian said the price of vehicles would increase about 8%, or $4,000. The model was done considering the entire automotive industry, not just Alabama. 
According to ADA’s 2023 economic impact report, Alabama auto manufacturers have 19 models that are built with parts from 42 countries and territories. Statewide, Alabama auto manufacturers employ 90,000 people. Safavian said those jobs could be at risk due to a projected decrease in sales and production.
“If there’s less production, whether it’s because there’s less sales in the United States or there’s fewer sales abroad, I don’t know what that ultimately means, but that’s why it’s a concern that it certainly could threaten jobs,” she said. 
Edith Müller-Callsen, manager of corporate affairs communications for Mercedes-Benz, wrote in a statement that the company employs 163,000 jobs across its manufacturing plants and dealerships across the country. She said the company is still assessing the effect of the tariffs.
“As a global company, we rely on constructive cooperation and policies that promote mutually beneficial trade across international markets,” she said. “Mercedes-Benz supports free and fair trade that underpins prosperity, growth and innovation.”
Requests for comment from Honda and Hyundai were sent Thursday. 
Ron Davis, the president of the Alabama Automotive Manufacturers Association, said Thursday he was “not free to speak on this topic.”
Messages seeking comment from the Business Council of Alabama were left Thursday morning.

(Jack Power/MSU Creative Services)Once Gov. Greg Gianforte affixes his signature to House Bill 190, Montana will become the fourth state to adopt American Rodeo as the official state sport.
Other states have adopted official sports representing a facet of their heritage, ranging from the common – baseball in New York — to the increasingly popular — pickleball in Washington — to the less traditional — pack burro racing in Colorado, and dog mushing in Alaska.
During the last week the Montana Legislature took its final votes on HB 190 and the bill will head to the governor’s desk for a signature.
Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, carried the bill in the Senate and wore her paisley scarf on the floor when she spoke about the bill, because “this is more rodeo than almost anything else.”
“I don’t know that I can convey, really, how fun rodeo is here in the Senate chamber,” McKamey said.
“This is very unique in that it represents our heritage, the outdoors, and it’s an opportunity to have have a really unique statement about our state,” she added.
Some senators voiced their opposition to the bill — Sen. Daniel Emrich, R-Great Falls, said that more Montanans hunt than rodeo, and Sen. Susan Webber, D-Browning, objected to the bill not specifically including Native American components.
“I just had hoped that they would have included the Indian Relay, which is a few centuries old here as part of this bill,” Webber said. “But we do have an Indian rodeo circuit that goes along with the National Rodeo Association. I just wish they would have done a little bit more.”
The bill was supported by the Montana American Indian Caucus, as well as by the congressional delegation and all six of Montanan’s statewide elected officials.

“There’s nothing better than a good rodeo all summer long. And the fine senator in the back near Kalispell said they have it all winter long going there,” Sen. Butch Gillespie, R-Ethbridge, said. “And as far as the Indian rodeos … nothing’s better than their rodeos and and the relay races, and they happen all over the place also. So let’s not let the other western states get the drop on us here.”
The Senate passing the measure 40-9, with an amendment making the law effective immediately. The House on Wednesday concurred with the amendment with only two votes in opposition.
Five colleges in Montana, including Montana State University, have rodeo clubs or teams. MSU hosted the collegiate rodeo finals for 24 years, until they moved briefly to South Dakota in the 1990s and then to Casper, Wyoming where they are still held.
At the high school level, Montana qualified 100 contestants to the National High School Rodeo Finals from the state championships held in Kalispell last J—une.
American Rodeo now joins the pantheon of state symbols, next to the duck-billed dinosaur (state fossil), Scobey soil (state soil), bitterroot (state floral emblem), blackspotted cutthroat trout (state fish), bluebunch wheatgrass (state grass), grizzly bear (state animal), and “Montana Melody” (state ballad) among others.

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)As potential federal cuts to Medicaid loom, City of Las Vegas officials are asking state lawmakers to expand Medicaid to pay for medical respite care for unhoused people. 
Senate Bill 54, heard Tuesday by the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, would require the state’s Department of Health and Human Services to apply for a federal waiver and amend the state Medicaid plan to cover medical respite care for people experiencing homelessness.
The bill would also require DHHS to adopt guidelines for respite care for unhoused populations.
Though Democratic legislators have been publicly fretting that congressional Republicans will drastically cut Medicaid spending to help pay for tax cuts requested by President Donald Trump, state lawmakers on the panel Tuesday didn’t directly discuss the prospect, though there were oblique references noting the Senate Finance Committee will be tasked with approving state Medicaid spending details. 
When unhoused people are injured or dealing with an illness not deemed serious enough for a hospital stay, they are forced to heal while unsheltered. 
Sabra Newby, the deputy city manager for the City of Las Vegas, said authorizing federal reimbursements for services would “improve health outcomes, reduce unnecessary hospital stays and readmissions, and strengthen Nevada’s continuum of care for its most vulnerable residents.”
“Medical respite care offers short term, residential community-based support specifically for homeless individuals who need a safe and sanitary place to heal,” Newby said. 
The Recuperative Care Center in the Corridor of Hope, the area in downtown Las Vegas that offers homeless services, opened in 2020 during the Covid pandemic to offer some medical respite care.
The city used funding provided by the American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2021, to expand and maintain the 40-bed facility. It also relies on general fund dollars to operate the facility.
The city contracts with the federally qualified Hope Christian Health Center to operate the facility within the homeless services corridor.
City officials told state lawmakers the facility has served 1,115 patients, with the majority referred by hospitals. More than half of those transition into “some sort of permanent functional housing at their discharge,” said Lindy Cooksey, a neighborhood outreach specialist with the city. 
The city plans to temporarily reduce capacity starting this summer as the center goes through construction to double capacity, which is expected to be complete by 2027. 
Once the expansion is complete, the estimated annual operating budget is expected to be $7 million.
“Covering the cost for the entirety of this program would place a significant burden on the city’s general funds,” said Arcelia Barajas, the director of Neighborhood Services with the City of Las Vegas. “Although respite care for homeless individuals is fairly new to Nevada, it is a best practice nationally and funded through various avenues with the most common being Medicaid.”
The bill, if passed, would not cover the entire budget of the center but “reduce the strain” of the city’s budget, Barajas said.   
Democratic state Sen. Fabian Doñate of Las Vegas, the committee’s chair, noted other states have obtained federal waivers for homeless respite housing, and those models hopefully would serve as a template for expediting federal approval. 
Republican state Sen. Robin Titus, whose district includes all or parts of six rural counties, asked whether the bill would only apply to services offered at the Las Vegas-based center or would apply to communities throughout the state.
Newby said theoretically it could apply throughout the state but she was “unaware of any other place that provides these services.
Local governments and health providers alike supported the legislation. 
Joanna Jacob, a lobbyist with Clark County who testified in support of the bill, said the county used covid relief dollars to convert motels into noncongregate shelter space. Two of the motels offer respite care, she said.
“There is enough need in our community that we need to build additional resources,” Jacob said. 
Cadence Matijevich, a lobbyist with Washoe County, said while the county doesn’t have a stand alone respite center, it does provide similar services to what Las Vegas offers. She said the county would also benefit if Medicaid covered costs to cover respite services.

The current academic year’s 1.61% dip in enrollment follows one year of modest 1.83% growth and two years of more significant 7% growth, which mirrored a nationwide trend of parents opting for private schools because they were better able to reopen physical classrooms and adapt to the COVID-19 restrictions.
In the six years preceding the start of the pandemic, private school enrollment only recorded one year of enrollment growth. The other five years, enrollment remained flat or dipped.
As of October, 22,442 students were enrolled in private schools in Nevada — 368 students fewer than the prior year.
﻿﻿﻿
The Nevada DOE compiles a separate report on K-12 enrollment within public schools. When data from the reports are combined, private school students make up 4.4% of students enrolled in Nevada schools. (The state does not aggregate the number of homeschooled students statewide.)
The total number of private school students remains higher than pre-pandemic. In October 2019, there were 19,325 students enrolled.
Last year, the Nevada DOE noted the modest 1.83% increase “might indicate a leveling off” of private school enrollment.
This year’s report, dated January 2025 but only recently released by the department, does not ponder potential reasons for the dip. The report also does not provide disaggregated data showing enrollment at each of the 131 private schools in the state.
The report does note that most grade levels saw a decrease in enrollment. Only fourth, eighth, seventh and ninth grade level totals increased.
When enrollment data is looked at by county, Washoe saw the biggest decline in private school enrollment — 10.7% or 339 students. One school, St. Nicholas Orthodox Academy in Reno, permanently closed its doors after the 2023-24 academic year, but it enrolled fewer than a dozen students, so its closure does not account for the drop.
The Nevada DOE, through its public information officer, said it had no data or additional information regarding the overall drop in Washoe County.
Washoe County now has 3,402 students enrolled in private schools.
In Clark County, private school enrollment dropped by 76 students, or less than half a percent of its total private school enrollment. Clark County now has 17,869 students enrolled in private schools.
Two private institutions in Las Vegas — St. Anne’s Catholic School and Spring Valley Christian School — shuttered after the 2023-24 academic year.
When it announced its closure in April 2024, St. Anne’s cited “continued diminishing enrollment and tremendous financial challenges,” according to KLAS. The school also blamed a 60% enrollment decline over a decade and the 2019 scaling back of funding to the state’s voucher program, known as Opportunity Scholarships.
St. Anne’s had been open for 70 years. One school leader told the Las Vegas Sun enrollment at the school began sliding in 2007 when Bishop Gorman High School moved from a property adjacent to St. Anne’s to its current Summerlin complex.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo held a press conference at St. Anne’s in 2023 to talk about his education agenda, which included massive expansion of Opportunity Scholarships. Democrats, who control both chambers of the state legislature, have drawn a hard line on the issue and have said they are not open to expanding the program, which was established a decade ago when Republicans were in charge of the Legislature and governorship.
Advocates of school voucher programs blamed Democrats for St. Anne’s closure.
 Teacher licensure

In Nevada, there are two classifications of private schools: exempt, which means the school is affiliated with a religious institution, and non-exempt, meaning it is not affiliated with a religious institution.
The majority of private schools are exempt.
Nevada requires secular schools to report the number of full- or part-time teachers and their qualifications. According to the annual report, of the 606 teachers at those private schools: 266 are licensed by the State of Nevada, 77 are licensed by another state, 21 have a master’s degree plus 1 year of experience, and 28 have a bachelor’s degree plus 3 years of experience.
Religious-affiliated schools are required to report the number of full- or part-time teachers but not their qualifications. According to the report, there are 1,371 teachers in those schools.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Schoolchildren-uniforms-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 08:00:06.254158

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Supporters of a bill that would force sheriff’s departments to cancel agreements with federal immigration officials said deputies could still enforce the law just as effectively, they would just not be doing so as an extension of federal authorities.
“There are counties that do not have these formal agreements that still cooperate with ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] still honor judicial warrants, still honor containers when they are presented to them,” Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s) said Thursday during testimony for her bill, House Bill 1222.
The bill would prohibit local law enforcement agencies from entering into so-called 287(g) agreements that allow ICE to delegate some federal enforcement authorities to local officers, including the authority to arrest and check a person’s immigration status through a federal database. The bill also requires those departments that have 287(g) agreements to cancel them by July 1.
Six counties — Carroll, Cecil, Frederick, Garrett, Harford and Washington — currently have 287(g) agreements with ICE. Frederick and Harford sheriffs turned up at Thursday’s Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee hearing to defend the program.
“Please allow the local counties to provide public safety as they see fit,” Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said.
Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins said his jurisdiction has been part of the 287(g) program since 2008 and “removed 1,795 criminals,” the majority of whom he described as “dangerous” and “violent.”

Gahler noted that since his department signed a 287(g) agreement in 2014, ICE has chosen not to initiate action in 35% of cases there. He also pointed to the popularity of the agreements, citing a January poll by Annapolis-based Gonzales Research & Media that found 76% of people surveyed said they would support requiring local governments to cooperate with federal efforts to enforce immigration laws.
But opponents of the agreements say 287(g) agreements “significantly undermined any trust in law enforcement” in immigrant communities.
“287(g) agreements literally turn local law enforcement into ICE agents,” said Nicholas Katz, general counsel for the nonprofit immigrant-rights organization CASA, based in Prince George’s County.
“In this moment, Black and brown families don’t know if it’s safe to go to work, if its safe to walk their kids to school, if it’s safe to go to the hospital,” Katz said.
Under Williams’ bill, which passed the House 98-38 last week, if federal authorities identify an immigrant who’s been convicted and is being held in a local jail, the local officials would have to give ICE at least 48 hours notice before release of the imate, and would have to turn the immigrant over when federal authoritis arrived.
At Thursday’s hearing, Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County) said the sheriffs would continue to do their job protecting the public, but asked if not having the 287(g) program would decrease their public safety work. It would, Gahler said.
“If we lose the ability to have these agreements with ICE, we lose what comes along with it,” Gahler said. “Which is finding out whether these people are indeed in the country illegally, and recommendations from ICE in relation to national security.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), chair of the committee, said he understood the perspectives from supporters and opponents of the bill. But he acknowledged “there is a distinct fear” under the administration of President Donald Trump (R), who has made an immigration crackdown a key element of his tenure. The 287(g) program began under former President Bill Clinton (D) in the 1990s.
“I guess our policy debate here is centered on the federal prerogatives and their implementation of deportation policy and the existence of 287(g) in Maryland,” Smith said.
“Is that creating such an atmosphere that people are not going to want to cooperate with law enforcement? Live life?” he asked. “Is that something that is beneficial to keeping the 287(g) program or getting rid of it?”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Frederick-County-Sheriff-Chuck-Jenkins-cropped-e1743161650612-1024x761.jpg,,,2025-03-28 08:00:06.254158

(Photo by Adam Gray/Getty Images)Lawyers for a man who is facing deportation after leading pro-Palestinian protests on Columbia University’s campus are set to appear in Newark Friday morning before a federal judge who may decide whether the man’s case should be transferred to Louisiana.
Mahmoud Khalil’s arrest by immigration agents earlier this month and his potential deportation drew swift backlash from student groups, immigration activists, and civil rights attorneys who noted that he is a lawful permanent resident. Khalil was targeted by removal from the United States because of his advocacy against the war in Gaza, they say.
Federal officials, meanwhile, allege Khalil has connections to terrorist organizations and lied on his application for a green card, claims Khalil’s legal team have denied.
Friday’s hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.
Khalil’s petition to be released was initially heard by a federal judge in Manhattan who moved the case to New Jersey last week, saying Khalil undoubtedly made that petition when he was being detained in Elizabeth (he was later moved to a Louisiana detention center, where he remains). Trump administration attorneys told the New York judge the case should be heard in the western district of Louisiana, an argument they are making again to the judge overseeing the case in New Jersey.
When Joe Biden was president, conservative groups routinely filed lawsuits targeting his administration in the western district of Louisiana as a way of virtually guaranteeing they would be heard by a conservative judge, according to Bloomberg Law. Appeals from that district are heard by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, perhaps the most conservative federal appeals court in the nation.
Khalil’s attorneys say public confidence in the judiciary would be undermined if judges allowed the case to devolve into a “perpetual game of jurisdictional ping-pong” until one side surrenders.
“That rationale applies with even more force in a case like this, involving an unprecedented exercise of executive power that, for two weeks, a detained Petitioner has been challenging as blatantly unconstitutional,” they wrote in a brief filed Monday, one of a flurry of filings both sides have made in the case since it was transferred to New Jersey last week.
Trump administration lawyers are not conceding that Khalil has the power to seek his release (known as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus). But they say the court that should decide that dispute is not New Jersey federal court, but the one in western Louisiana.
“This Court has never had habeas jurisdiction over this matter, because no proper petition has ever been filed in this Court. And it does not have habeas jurisdiction over this matter now, because it neither has jurisdiction over the proper respondent in this action, nor is this district the district of confinement,” they wrote in a brief filed last week.
On March 8, while returning home from dinner with his pregnant wife, Khalil was arrested by plainclothes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in New York. Khalil, a Syrian native, was detained and transferred from New York to New Jersey to Texas to Louisiana. He has not been charged with any crime.

“Like many ratepayers, I don’t have a lot of confidence in the (Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission) to protect the ratepayers,” he said. “… Sometimes it feels like they’re really in the pocket of the utilities and just cover the costs of utility shareholders — and consumers are too busy to complain.”
But Rep. Ed Soliday, the measure’s author, said opponents “want a zero-growth economy.”

“If you don’t want a growth economy, then vote against the bill,” Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said.
His House Bill 1007 would expedite approval processes for large-load customers like data centers and set out cost recovery mechanisms for projects utilities undertake to serve those big customers. It also would require a big prospective grid addition to make “significant and meaningful financial assurances” for such projects— reimbursing at least 80% of costs and protecting other existing and future customers from the expenses.
“We think it’s fair that they accept 80% of the responsibility. Now, if they build and keep their word, then all they’re doing is buying the electricity they said they want,” Soliday. “But we’ve given about 20% latitude in here, that we think is fair.”
Multiple witnesses feared customers would still take the brunt of costs.
“I’m afraid that there’s too many ways to get around that 80-20 split for those large-load customers, that there’s no guarantee that those customers would actually be paying that,” said Robyn Skuya-Boss, leader of the Sierra Club’s Indiana chapter. “(Maybe) if they could pay those costs upfront, if they could be put into long-term obligation contracts — what if the data center operator or the customer goes bankrupt?”
Advocates for residential and existing industrial ratepayers said the expedited processes didn’t offer them or regulators enough time to review materials and assemble responses.
Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson noted that some provisions require regulators to approve a utility plan within 90 or 150 days, and afford it just seven business days or less to deem filings complete. That’s although the utility may have spent months constructing the plan, and it may take stakeholders like Olson’s organization 60 days to “to put a case together, to find funding, to find experts.”

“If the commission doesn’t hit that 90-day timeline or that 150-day timeline, guess what? It’s approved (automatically),” Olson continued. “… Why have regulated monopolies when effectively we’ll have unregulated monopolies?
Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers representative Joseph Rompala said that’s a “quick turnaround.” Rompala also litigates on behalf of industrial customers before the IURC.
He said transmission, distribution and storage improvement charges — seven-year plans utilities can bring for those improvements — have a 210-day “clock.”
“While I understand the need for speed to market and … to meet customer demand, we are talking about at least comparably sized investments,” Rompala added. “… Certainly, more time is beneficial.”
But, he said any IURC order — including approval, cost-recovery and any trackers — could be appealed to a higher court.
Koch and Soliday emphasized that they developed the deadlines in collaboration with regulators.
“They said they could do it,” Soliday told the committee.
Scrutinizing transitions from coal
House Bill 1007 also gets tough with utilities planning to close — or convert to natural gas — any coal-fired plants of at least 125 megawatts. Current law — adopted during the 2024 legislative session — mandates utilities that are not generating at least 85% of peak demand to report three-year projections to the IURC.
  Indiana Energy Association leader Danielle McGrath testifies in committee on Thursday, March 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The legislation would instead require all utilities to annually report the amount of resource generating capacity they plan to take offline. If, after an investigation, the IURC doesn’t think a utility can provide reliable service, it would have to block the utility’s plan or order it to either acquire or build capacity.
“That makes the process very empirical. You … can’t just shut them down willy-nilly,” Soliday said.
Indiana Energy Association President Danielle McGrath said the requirements would complement utilities’ existing integrated resource plans, several other required reports and IURC-hosted reliability forums.
“That’s why, in providing this additional information, we stand by our analysis, and we’ll demonstrate how that planned retirement is going to be able to meet the requirements set forth in this bill,” she told lawmakers.
Going nuclear
Other provisions are intended to boost small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) development as electricity demand rises, including a 20% sales tax credit for SMR manufacturers.
Soliday said one such company — which he’d seen represented in the audience — has Indiana “high on the list” for an SMR.
“That factory will be at least 500 jobs, over $100,000 and I’d like to see them here. So, hence the incentive,” he told the committee.
Rolls Royce, which has a major manufacturing footprint in Indiana, is exploring construction of an SMR with a capacity of up to 470 megawatts.
But numerous witnesses complained SMR technology is “experimental” and “unproven.”
The United States hosts no operational SMRs. Across the globe, only China and Russia have functional ones. Some want Indiana to lead, but nuclear development is pricey.
A large part of the legislation would let public utilities ask regulators for permission to spend money on SMRs — and start recovering costs from customers — before getting certificates of public convenience and necessity. The language is identical to Koch’s Senate Enrolled Act 424.
Included are expenditures for design; engineering; environmental analyses and permitting; federal approvals, licensing and permitting; equipment purchases and more. A utility could recover 80% of approved costs under the resulting rate schedule within three years at most. It would defer the remaining 20% for recovery as part of its next general rate case.
Indiana proposal to boost nuclear development, recover costs from customers clears committee

Soliday said the “pay-as-you-go” approach would let utilities take out the debt more cheaply — or avoid bonding at all. He added, “It’s in our favor as consumers to keep that bond rate low or zero.”
Overspending would have to meet additional criteria to get passed onto customers. So would expenditures on canceled or abandoned projects — and a utility wouldn’t earn returns for such failed undertakings unless regulators also find the decision was “prudently made for good cause,” that profit is “appropriate … to avoid harm” to the utility and its customers; and that costs will be offset or reimbursed through other, listed means.
“To have reliability, you can’t have utilities going bankrupt,” Soliday said.
House Bill 1007 advanced on an 8-3 vote. It’s heading to the Senate’s Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee.
“I’m glad that it’s going to be recommitted … because what we really need to be focused on is the fiscal impact,” said Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis.
Debate, she added, isn’t about nuclear’s merits because Indiana legalized SMRs years ago.
“What this bill is talking about is the funding structure for how we’re going to fund small modular reactors. And that’s what I have an issue with — is that we’re doing it on the backs of ratepayers, that we’re doing it in a way that is not fiscally responsible,” Hunley said.

In the small-town schools and rural hospitals. On county roads and at the family reunion. 
We’ve watched our neighbors presume to speak for us, and our elected representatives pretend we don’t exist. And we’re tired of it. 
That’s how we ended up on a bridge across 35W on a recent Friday. Some of us raised pride flags to the wind, some hung the American flag upside down, others held signs for Ukraine or against DOGE. But all of us want a future where we welcome the stranger and are our brothers’ keeper, and a government that works for the people. 
The GOP dismisses us as “paid actors” and “outside agitators.” But that’s baloney and they know it. We are neighbors like:

Mary Kay Brautigan, Pine City: We need affordable, accessible health care, but the GOP is taking a sledge hammer to rural hospitals. They can’t survive without Medicaid and neither can our nursing homes or assisted living facilities. We Boomers need more care, not less. 
Kim Brubaken, Mora: I got into this because of Roe v. Wade, but now I see that’s just a small piece, part of a plan to get rid of the whole middle class and the rights and institutions we rely on. It’s women’s rights now, but then it will be the right to vote and decimating the middle class so that the rich get richer and just leave crumbs for us. 
Cathy Clune, Pine City: Social Security and veterans benefits — those are the easy answers to what we’re fighting for. I’m not retired yet, but I’ll rely on Social Security when I do, and I’ve been paying in since I was 15. That’s my money, fair and square. But what keeps me up at night is watching them strip our Constitution away. Our rights to free speech and to gather and protest are all threatened. When it comes down to it, it’s about losing our country. And I see how close we are.
Nancy Mach, Pine City: I grew up with compromise. They’re totally forgotten now, and that’s sad. So much good government came out of both. 
Kristen Kromer Waxberg, Rush City: I’m a Stage 4 cancer patient. My disability income covers my insurance and prescriptions with only a little left over. With DOGE stopping the funding that Congress directed, there is little hope of new treatments, but lots of threats to our already scarce resources. But what keeps me in the fight is my 24-year-old daughter. I don’t want her to die in a waiting room, bleeding out from an ectopic pregnancy. She does not deserve to have her liberty snatched away from her.

And there are more of us than you think. 
The chaos and hatred of President Trump’s first term pushed us toward each other. In that first term, we would look at the people who taught us to be good Christians and to always set an extra place at the table, and wonder: Where did they go? When we started finding each other in 2020, it was a glimmer of hope. 
Until then, we’d kept silent because we thought we were alone — tiny blue dots on a big red map. But as soon as we started speaking up even a little bit, over and over people thanked us and said, “me too.”  
When one house on a dead-end road put up a sign that says, “We believe in science…,” other supportive signs sprouted up on that road. When one courageous person spoke, it gave others permission.
Every time we can, we invite folks to join us. We engage with Trumpers who aren’t full-on MAGA. You can tell who they are because you know they’re conservative, but they don’t have the hats and flags. Instead, they look at you like “I’m sorry,” but you can tell from their eyes that they feel too far in. 
So we respond with facts. When they fault DEI, we run through the letters. They agree that diversity, equity and inclusion are all good things. So we tell them: “Great, you’re not against DEI.” 
When they say they’re not worried about Medicaid because they’re on Medical Assistance, we let them know it’s the same thing. And we invite them to join us, no matter what they believed before.
In 2016, we’d never even considered having to stand on a bridge or a corner. In 2020, we stood with signs on corners, but were scared of the oversized trucks that would spray us with exhaust, and wouldn’t stand up in our own small towns. 
That recent Friday, though, was different. 
This time, none of us were afraid.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The heat is on Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales. Questionable spending and missteps have, in recent weeks, captured the attention of lawmakers in charge of his budget for the next two years.
Things are adding up, and Republicans known for fiscal conservatism are taking note.
Morales’ office said Thursday he “stands by all the financial decisions the office has made.”
To be clear, some of the information isn’t novel — but seems to have gained new life recently. For instance, the Indianapolis Star broke the news in Feb. 2023 that Morales hired his brother-in-law for a position with a six-figure salary. It isn’t illegal under nepotism laws because in-laws aren’t covered. But optics are another thing altogether.
And in Oct. 2023, the Capital Chronicle first revealed Morales’ liberal use of “spot bonuses.” Indiana executive branch agencies adhere to guidance from the State Personnel Department when it comes to the bonuses, which dictates that awards range from $100 to $1,000 to recognize outstanding performance “on the spot.”
Secretary of State Morales doles out $308K+ in spot bonuses

That year, the Secretary of State’s office doled out 80 bonuses to 68 employees — out of a staff of roughly 75. They ranged from $500 to $12,000, for an average of $4,540 per employee. Nearly a dozen employees received two bonuses from Morales within the 10 months scanned by the Capital Chronicle, and one got two in one month. Morales’ brother-in-law received a total $12,500 from two bonuses.
Morales said the bonuses were needed due to promises made before his tenure for salary adjustments.
Rep. Ed DeLaney seized on these things when questioning Morales during a House Ways and Means budget hearing on Jan. 15. The video has made the rounds on social media.
The Indianapolis Democrat also focused on another Capital Chronicle story about no-bid technology contracts in which the winners then gave campaign contributions to Morales. No-bid contracts are not illegal.
Morales indicated he thought DeLaney’s questions were inappropriate for the setting, replying that “we don’t mix political and official business.”
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, another Indianapolis Democrat, continued the questions in Senate Appropriations on March 18. Only this time, Morales didn’t show up – sending his deputy instead. Lawmakers were told Morales was on economic development trip, according to State Affairs Indiana.
Qaddoura noted it was the second time Morales had missed a meeting before the panel, and that every other elected statewide official showed up.
“It’s not the job of the secretary of state to be traveling for economic development,” he said.

Morales was still on the trip Tuesday when he missed a prayer breakfast for which his office was a sponsor. But he sent his staff to take photos of his table for social media.
Well, it turns out he was in India. That’s according to a post on X from the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce, and a press release issued by Morales on Thursday.
Republicans also took Morales’ office to task.
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, started with questions on bonuses, leading to a promise that no new bonuses are planned.
Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, then pointed to paper maps that Morales’ office printed with his name in large, bolded letters.
Staff said less than $15,000 was spent on the maps, which were distributed at the Indiana State Fair and to county offices.
Garten said maps should be printed by the Indiana Department of Transportation.
“I have no idea why we’ve spent any amount of taxpayer money on a road map that nobody knows is a road map because, quite frankly, to me, it looks like a campaign sign,” Garten said. “The biggest thing on here is a name.”
He went on to say Morales’ budget should be decreased by whatever amount was spent on the maps, and dinged the office for overaggressive compliance fines.
That’s not Morales’ only promotional spending, though.
The office previously spent $35,00 to send glossy spiral-bound election security guides to hundreds of election administrators, lawmakers, law enforcement officers and others across the state. They were accompanied by a lanyard and card saying “Blow the Whistle on Election Interference” with Morales’ name. Federal election funds were used.
Morales’ office sent a statement to me on Thursday saying, “The Secretary of State’s Office is committed to its outreach efforts through the distribution of informational materials like papers, pamphlets, and brochures. Featuring the elected official’s name on the materials fosters trust and accountability, much like the annual mail sent by members of the Indiana General Assembly to their constituents.”
It added that the office returned $400, 000 to the General Fund at the end of fiscal year 2024. The office is currently on track to return a similar amount to the state at the end of the current fiscal year.
“It’s not unusual for questions to arise in legislative committee hearings that require research and follow up. We appreciate thoughtful questions from legislators about any aspect of our budget and operations and respond as promptly as possible,” the statement said.
It remains to be seen whether another Republican will step up to challenge Morales in 2026. He was chosen at a party nominating convention over sitting Secretary of State Holli Sullivan in 2022. GOP delegates voted against Sullivan, who then-Gov. Eric Holcomb had appointed into the role — as a revolt against him and his pandemic-era policies.
I wonder if they are now regretting that decision.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)A tense debate over the rights of public school students and their parents took another twist in the Washington Legislature on Thursday.
Democrats on a Senate committee stripped a House bill of provisions dealing with parental rights, while leaving parts covering students’ rights. A Senate-approved bill on parental rights is still pending in the House, setting up a situation where the two related sets of issues are on track to be handled with separate pieces of legislation.
The Senate Early Learning and K-12 Education Committee passed the amended version of House Bill 1296 on a party-line vote.
Sen. Claire Wilson, D-Auburn, put forward the amendment that removed the language about parental rights, and said it was part of a strategy to keep the bills moving forward to address some of the issues involved before the session ends on April 27. 
“It’s keeping all doors open and all windows open so we can make sure something ends on the other side,” Wilson said.
Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, sponsor of the House bill, said that she would have rather not seen this language removed from the bill, but that the end goal is still the same: to have policies covering students’ rights and parental rights. 
“There’s nothing in my mind that doesn’t allow for students’ rights to exist concurrently with parental rights, I don’t see any conflict there,” Stonier said. 
Examples of students’ rights included in HB 1296 include the right to learn in a safe, supportive learning environment, free from harassment, intimidation, or bullying; to receive copies of all school policies and procedures related to students; and to access academic courses and instructional materials with historically and scientifically accurate information.
Wilson’s rewrite also added language from another bill she sponsored, Senate Bill 5179, which is about reporting complaints to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction when certain policies are not followed by schools. 
The parental and students’ rights legislation now under discussion is tied to a citizen initiative lawmakers approved last year.
That measure, Initiative 2081, called for public school materials, such as textbooks, curriculum and a child’s medical records, to be easily available for review by parents. It also sought to clear the way for parents to opt their child out of assignments and other activities involving questions about the student’s sexual experiences or their family’s religious beliefs.
Democrats said when Initiative 2081 was approved, they would likely need to clean up some of the language to align with other state and federal laws. 
But Republicans argue that Democrats are now trying to roll back rights granted to parents in the initiative. Mixed into the debate are arguments over gender and transgender issues in schools.
“This bill continues the war against parents’ rights and puts girls at risk at schools,” said Sen. Jim McCune, R-Graham. 
Senate Bill 5181, the Senate bill on parental rights, is scheduled for a possible committee vote on March 31 in the House Education Committee.

Minnesota is at a critical moment. The state’s commitment to supporting people with disabilities is at a crossroads. 
Gov. Tim Walz’s proposed budget includes an array of cuts to disability waiver services, notably to the inflationary adjustment for service providers. 
This threatens to undo years of progress.  
These cuts — from an 11% adjustment increase in 2026 to just 2% — are not mere numbers on a spreadsheet. They represent a threat to the quality and accessibility of disability services across Minnesota and serve as a blow to an already reeling workforce that provides these life-saving services. The impacts of these budget targets may be greater than the governor is anticipating. 
Of chief importance are the impacts these cuts will have on the workforce that underpins disability services. These professionals, who are primarily women and people of color, are paid low wages as it stands, especially as inflation impacts every Minnesotan’s purchasing power. Reducing the inflationary adjustment to 2% every two years ensures their pay will fall further behind increasing costs. As a result, this field’s vacant positions will become increasingly uncompetitive to new workers and existing workers will leave in search of better pay. 
We frequently hear from direct care workers: “I love this work, but I can’t afford to keep doing it.” Now, under the governor’s proposed budget, that refrain will only grow louder. Low pay and rising costs will drive workers away, increasing turnover and further straining already limited resources. 
While we hear the governor’s optimism that these budgetary adjustments will not impede the quality of care, or the number of people served, in no other industry could one expect such a large cut to not affect the work. To ask an industry that already stretches its resources to its limits to absorb this cut will result in serious consequences for those receiving care.
The ripple effects of these cuts will not stop with workers. Those receiving services and their families will bear the brunt of this proposal. Strained support networks created from these cuts will leave families with fewer resources to care for their loved ones, forcing them to shoulder an even greater responsibility. Potential facility closures will mean that those receiving care may not have the opportunity to live near their loved ones, to live in the place they desire, or to receive the care that best meets their needs.  
The governor and the Legislature must grapple with challenging questions this session about how to meet Minnesota’s needs within the realities of the state’s budget. It’s imperative these decisions prioritize the dignity and well-being of Minnesota’s many people who live with a disability and the workers who support them.
My final message is this: Legislators, I encourage you to see the faces behind the numbers. Disability services are people in our community, friends, and family members. I know you care deeply about equity and progress. I know you see an indispensable workforce for what it is. These values are at stake in this budget cycle, and we need you to balance it with the same compassion that we have come to expect from Minnesota. 
We are a state that has long prided itself on being a leader in giving everyone a fair shot at living a fulfilled life. It’s time for us to invest in those values. 
A reevaluation is needed, one with the outstanding legal and moral obligations to care for people living with disabilities.

A case report the Examiner received from the Brown County Sheriff’s Office shows Vogel had  a history of racist and threatening behavior.
After Laureano died in late August at Green Bay Correctional Institution (GBCI), Vogel was charged with homicide with hate crime and repeat offender penalties, the Examiner reported. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Micah Laureano’s mother, Phyllis Laureano, has sued Secretary Jared Hoy and GBCI warden Christopher Stevens of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections. The federal civil rights lawsuit alleges “defendants’ willful and deliberate indifference to Mr. Laureano’s safety” resulted in the murder. 
The sheriff’s office said the suspect and victim had occupied the same cell for only hours before the incident. The statement said the medical examiner’s findings confirmed Laureano died of strangulation/suffocation by manner of homicide. 
Beth Hardtke, communications director for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, said both individuals involved in the incident were in temporary lockup status. 
Before Laureano’s death, Vogel, 25, had been found guilty of attempted first-degree intentional homicide, the Examiner reported in late August. Laureano, 19, had been found guilty of taking and driving a vehicle without consent and as party to a crime for substantial battery intending bodily harm, robbery with use of force and first-degree recklessly endangering safety.
Conduct reports
A narrative in a Brown County Sheriff’s Office case report described information from a few conduct reports Vogel received. The Examiner received the report last year through an open records request.
Sergeant Justin Raska reviewed conduct reports for Laureano and Vogel, according to the case report. He found nothing relevant in Laureano’s reports but wrote about three of Vogel’s infractions. 
The first report Raska described was dated March 5, 2024, and was completed by a staff member at the Racine Youthful Offender Correctional Facility (RYOCF). The staff had received inmate complaint forms filed by Vogel that “contained obscene, profane, abusive and threatening language,” some of which was written in German, according to the description of the incident. 
The complaints included swastika symbols. According to the report, Vogel’s writing included the words “you all need and deserve Death!” and “White Power (WLM).” He voiced support for Adolf Hitler and the Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist gang.
A second conduct report was dated March 6, 2024, according to Raska. A lieutenant received interview request forms from Vogel, which were written to several staff members at RYOCF and made “numerous disrespectful racial remarks.” 
The request forms included “several inappropriate remarks and symbols,” such as SS Bolts and “das Endlosung.” This referenced Hitler’s “Final Solution” of mass murder of Jewish people, according to the report. 
The third conduct report described by Raska was completed by a sergeant at GBCI and dated August 27, 2024, the day of Laureano’s death.
Incarcerated people were removed from a cell so that maintenance could fix a clogged sink, according to the report. Unit staff discovered the wooden bulletin board was broken, and the sergeant heard from unit staff that Vogel admitted to breaking the board because he was bored.
The bulletin board had jagged edges and it was unsafe to house incarcerated people in the cell, according to the report. This might have led to Vogel being housed in a different cell, with Laureano.
Laureano and Vogel’s cell was in a “segregated Treatment Center area,” according to a narrative in the case report by Raska.
Raska said he was told “the Treatment Center block” serves as a “step unit” to bridge the gap between restricted housing and general population housing. Restricted housing includes disciplinary separation — which occurs when an incarcerated person commits a violation. 
Raska said the treatment center serves as an alternative to single cell segregation in the restricted housing unit. He said incarcerated people could be housed in the treatment center due to clinical observation or because of a pending investigation. 
Lawsuit alleges ‘deliberate indifference’

Laureano’s lawsuit contains three Eighth Amendment counts. It alleges deliberate indifference to Laureano’s safety, failure to protect Laureano and failure to train subordinates. The lawsuit does not mention Vogel’s conduct reports or the racist statements mentioned in them.
The lawsuit alleges that the defendants didn’t consider and/or willfully ignored Vogel’s “substantial history of violent assault, mental health issues, and multi-decade length of sentence when assessing his compatibility with Mr. Laureano,” who was serving a lesser sentence of three years.
It also alleges that defendants failed to “adequately train, monitor and supervise GBCI staff” to make sure administrative requirements and protocols were being followed during housing decisions. 
Phyllis Laureano is represented by attorney Lonnie Story, who said he has spoken to incarcerated people who might be deposed prior to a trial. 
“It was very apparent to the inmates, as well as what — from what they communicate to me about staff, it would be kind of hard to deny by anyone… to say there was no knowledge of Mr. Vogel being a racist, and expressing other very negative opinions and ideas outside of just the race factor,” Story said, adding that this applied to sexual orientation.  
On Sept. 10, the Examiner made an open records request to the DOC, requesting reports regarding incidents involving Vogel and/or Laureano. The request’s status is “in progress” in the DOC’s open records request portal. 
Beth Hardtke, the communications director for the DOC, said it’s the DOC’s practice not to comment on cases where there is ongoing litigation.

House Bill 937 would force schools to create speech codes based on a widely criticized definition of antisemitism. Bill supporters talk about Jewish safety, but their real goal is to shield Israel from criticism as it commits unconscionable atrocities against Palestinian people.
If adopted, Missouri educational institutions would be required to add the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s controversial definition of the term into codes of conduct as a basis for investigating suspected acts of antisemitism. Alarmingly, this includes so-called “contemporary examples” of antisemitism, most involving criticism of Israel.
Under this bill, the discussion of Palestinians’ experiences, academic findings critical of Israel’s government or even quotes from Israelis that condemn their nation’s actions could all be considered “prohibited conduct as it relates specifically to antisemitism.” They could lead to student suspensions and loss of scholarships, faculty denial of tenure or firing, loss of research funding or defunding student organizations — all while doing nothing to make Jewish communities safer, as the bill claims to do.
Israeli officials and their supporters want to silence opposition and keep the U.S. public ignorant to what the International Court of Justice is investigating as genocide against the Palestinian people. Israeli military forces have killed more than 50,000 Palestinians since October 2023, according to the Gaza health ministry. That’s most certainly a vast undercount.
This is why Amnesty International says that Israel is committing genocide and why the International Criminal Court in November issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Foreign Minister Yoav Gallant.
If passed, the bill will stifle basic academic freedom on the subject of Israel and Palestine – exacerbating an already alarming trend. After adopting the IHRA definition, Florida began tracking and banning course syllabuses that were particularly critical of Israel. At the University of Minnesota, a Holocaust historian’s job offer was rescinded over his criticism of Israel. At New York University, Jewish professors were barred from campus for protesting the Israeli government’s violence in Gaza.
Among other criteria, the bill would ban calling the Israel a “racist endeavor” and comparing any actions of Israel to Nazi Germany.
In a recent article in Haaretz, one of Israel’s most respected newspapers, an Israeli soldier said about his experience in Gaza: ‘I felt like, like, like a Nazi … it looked exactly like we were actually the Nazis and they were the Jews.” Under the IHRA definition of antisemitism, quoting that soldier could be considered a punishable offense.
This kind of speech code is applied to no other country. If you want to, you can call the existence of the People’s Republic of China or Canada or Iran or even the United States a “racist endeavor.” You can compare these countries’ behavior to Nazis. With the passage of House Bill 937, only Israel would be protected from this type of criticism.
Like millions of people raised Jewish in America, I grew up believing that Israel was a model democracy, opposed and hated for no reason except irrational hatred towards Jews.
Then I traveled throughout Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. I witnessed a political system run by Israel that reminded me of the histories I learned in school about the Jim Crow south. I saw the segregated roads, the segregated communities, the segregated access to water, land and resources.
Palestinians and Jews, separate and unequal.
I that knew it was wrong; I saw that what I had been taught were lies and I knew I had to do something to oppose this injustice perpetuated in my name.
Even though supporters sell House Bill 937 in the name of protecting Jews on campus, Jews critical of Israel would also face sanction from its passage. This is one of the reasons many Missouri Jews, including myself, testified against the bill.
The real purpose of the bill is to make students and faculty constantly second guess themselves whenever they speak or write about Israel, wondering if they will be punished and if their words will fall outside of the boundaries put in place by the government.
This bill was sponsored by a Republican legislator and passed out of committee with Republican support. For years conservatives have railed against speech codes on campuses, when the codes were designed to prevent the sharing of potentially racist, misogynistic or homophobic ideas. They labeled as coddled snowflakes those who ask to be shielded from thoughts and ideas that might make them uncomfortable.
This bill makes a mockery of their professed concerns. Those who support it cite the discomfort of some Jewish supporters of Israel as an excuse to censor students and faculty, in order to protect a foreign state from criticism.
In recent days the Israeli military has killed hundreds of Palestinian children in Gaza who were trying to survive in tents and the rubble of their bombed-out homes. People are correctly speaking out about Israel’s atrocities.
Israel and its supporters know they are losing the argument with more and more Americans, so they are working to make it harder to speak up. We can’t allow them to abridge our First Amendment rights.

(Courtesy of Racheal Baker)Idaho business owners are launching a tool to help other business owners foster safe and inclusive event spaces. 
In partnership with the Western States Center, a nonpartisan organization, Idaho business owners created a guide called “Safeguarding Arts & Culture Spaces: A Pro-Democracy Guide for Idaho Venues.” The guide is available on the Western States Center’s website, and it provides guidance to business owners interested in hosting events that may attract controversy about how to prevent harassment and respond to threats. 
As public spaces in Idaho face increasing intimidation and harassment, the guide is a timely way to discuss the power of arts and culture spaces, Western States Center Executive Director Amy Herzfeld-Copple told the Idaho Capital Sun. In recent months, Idaho has received national attention over incidents related to free speech and inclusivity, such as when a North Idaho woman in February was forcibly removed from a local town hall and when earlier this month a West Ada teacher was asked to remove an “everybody is welcome” sign. 
Lawmakers have also tried to limit access to pride events, such as through House Bill 230, which would restrict youth from attending events with “indecent sexual exhibitions,” such as public drag shows at pride events. Despite these challenges, Andrea Marcoccio, the owner of Matchwood Brewing in Sandpoint and coauthor of the guide, said venue spaces can still serve as safe and inclusive spaces. 
“We have an expansive patio that is always full and bustling when the weather is nice, and it tends to attract community requests and needs for gathering, including the Sandpoint Pride Festival, Oktoberfest and SantaCon,” she said. “We do a lot of really great gatherings, some of them intentional about inclusivity, and some of them about just getting people out of their homes and off their phones to get together and have fun.”

Marcoccio said the guide will help business owners who perhaps have tried to hold an event but received pushback, and it will offer a network of other business owners who have held similar events. 
 Idaho business owners to discuss strategies to ensure safety, inclusivity in events

Along with Marcoccio, the guide was developed by Idaho venue owners from Bonners Ferry, Coeur d’Alene and Boise. 
This includes leadership from Treefort Music Festival, which is hosting a panel discussion about the guide for venue owners. 
“Our music venues and cultural spaces are the heart of our communities,” Eric Gilbert, the CEO of Duck Club Entertainment and director of Treefort Music Fest said. “This initiative is about ensuring that Idaho remains safe and welcoming for all.”
Those involved in the project will discuss strategies during a panel at Treefort Music Festival at 11 a.m. Saturday at Boise Centre East, room 420A. 
Earlier this week, Marcoccio said a young person thanked her for hosting inclusive events. That individual was born and raised in Sandpoint, and they recently moved back to town after seeing welcoming events.
“There’s always good that comes out from hosting those events,” Marcoccio said.

(Getty Images)ABC for Health, the public interest law firm, has filed a complaint with the IRS, charging a team of hospitals led by UW Health of falling short of federal standards when they filed a Community Health Needs Assessment required of health nonprofits under federal law.
Late last year, the hospitals  released their report on the health needs of Dane County.
Federal law requires nonprofit health care providers to file such a  document every three years. The December report covered reproductive care, chronic illness, mental health and substance abuse, along with special sections about health concerns for children and youth as well as the elderly.
But in 63 pages, the report included no discussion of how the cost of care and medical debt have burdened people without money and hampered their access to the health care system.

For Bobby Peterson, that was a glaring omission — and on Thursday, Peterson and ABC for Health, the firm he founded and directs, filed a complaint with the IRS, charging the report doesn’t live up to the federal law’s requirement for a Community Health Heeds Assessment (CHNA).
ABC for Health focuses on health care access along with helping people overcome or avoid medical debt.
The organization’s complaint argues that failing to address that issue in the Dane County health needs document violates the collective responsibility of UW Health and the other three nonprofit hospital systems that produced it.
“Their insistence to exclude medical debt from consideration during the CHNA betrays many principles and requirements of non-profit hospitals,” the complaint states. “We maintain that UW Health’s intentional indifference towards the medical debt epidemic stems from a value for their own revenue at the expense of their community. That value is at odds with UW Health’s duty towards its community.”
Sara Benzel, media relations manager for UW Health, defended the report Thursday as well as the hospital system’s handling of medical debt.
“UW Health stands behind the priorities identified in the community health needs assessment process,” Benzel told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email message.
“Regarding the UW Health Financial Assistance Policy, we are proud of the work we do every day to make this support accessible, and the work we have done to simplify the process and lower barriers to accessing financial support.”
She said the hospital system’s financial assistance program is posted online in English and Spanish.
“The application has been simplified over the years using an equity lens, requires minimal supporting documents, and goes up to 600% of the federal poverty level, well above others in the state,” Benzel said.
Medical debt critic
ABC for Health has been a longstanding critic of hospitals’ handling of medical debt and has published several reports finding fault with how hospital systems address the problem of patients unable to pay their health care bills.
While hospitals have programs for financial help when a patient has no insurance and can’t afford to pay out of pocket, ABC has argued those programs are too often needlessly complex. The organization also contends that hospitals’ financial counselors don’t take actions that could circumvent a problem — such as helping patients enroll in Medicaid if they qualify.
The requirement for a Community Health Heeds Assessment is a little-noticed provision in the 2010 Affordable Care Act — the legislation nicknamed Obamacare that has helped drive down the numbers of uninsured Americans since its passage 15 years ago. Nonprofit health care systems must  produce a CHNA report for their communities every three years.
“The IRS is regulating this because they are looking at their tax-exempt status,” Peterson said Thursday. “And to be a tax-exempt organization, to be able to step away from all the property tax requirements that many of us face, they have a responsibility then to give back.”
He sees a hospital’s approach to medical debt as a direct measure of how they give back.
“They have a community benefit that they need to provide, and part of that benefit is making sure that they’re providing enough charity care and services to the vulnerable in a community,” Peterson said.
The 2025-2027 CHNA report, like several previous editions, was the work of Healthy Dane Collaborative, a coalition of the county’s four hospital systems: Unity Point-Meriter, SSM Health-St. Mary’s Hospital, Stoughton Health and UW Health. The report’s drafters conducted a survey, collected and analyzed data, met with a variety of community organizations and held focus groups
The final report included discussions of health care disparities by race, income and gender. It called attention to the health care needs of the LGBTQ and immigrant communities, including undocumented migrants.
Early on, the text of the report emphasized concern for health equity — “ensuring fair distribution of health resources, outcomes, and opportunities across different communities.”
Seeking a voice
At an ABC for Health symposium Thursday on Medicaid and health care access, Peterson said the report’s priorities were “good things” and were all important.
“But what we wanted to see was access to health care coverage,” Peterson said, along with a discussion about improving financial assistance policies and better coordination among providers. “It wasn’t there. That’s not part of what they wanted to give out to the community.”
Peterson said ABC started reaching out more than a year and a half ago to offer input for the CHNA report.
“We wanted to make sure that the people that are in the planning process understand what the access to health care coverage needs are, what the barriers in the financial assistance process are, and how can we make it better. What can we do to improve that process?” Peterson said.
“We thought this is a real opportunity for us to make sure that all these issues that we see every day can be put up in this Community Health Needs Assessment process,” he added. “We wanted our voice and the voice of our clients to be heard.”
The IRS complaint includes email messages ABC Health sent various people about the assessment process starting in mid-2023.
In a message Aug. 13, 2024, Peterson told Adrian Jones, UW Health Director of Community Health Improvement, “ABC remains eager to engage in Dane County’s 2024 CHNA process.”
The message asked for updates on the CHNA “process and timeline” and mentioned that ABC for Health was “preparing a report with recommendations to provide input, from the perspective of our clients, to inform Dane County’s CHNA process.”
In her Aug. 14 reply, Jones invited Peterson to “share your report with us.” She wrote that “we have also held our own community input sessions and survey and have analyzed a lot of quantitative and qualitative data.”
Peterson followed up with an email Aug. 16 that included a half-dozen questions about the data being collected, when and where community meetings had been conducted, whether more community meetings were planned and the timeline for completing the assessment document.
“ABC for Health is eager to continue engagement with the Dane County CHNA process,” Peterson wrote. “Please keep us posted about future community input sessions and meetings.”
Correspondence ends
There was no further response, and “the Dane County hospitals quietly released the CHNA report in late 2024, without ABC’s input that we maintain failed to take into account the perspective of the many communities we represent,” the complaint to the IRS states.
“Unsurprisingly, this report ignored access to health care coverage issues. The report lacks any recommendations to improve financial assistance policies, practices, and processes to equitably serve populations negatively affected by health disparities. It fails to address the impact of medical debt on Dane County patients,” the complaint states.
“It lacks broad community input and instead reflects a hospital-driven marketing piece that ignores and sidesteps Affordable Care Act requirements. ABC was largely shunned despite our multiple efforts over the past 2 years to provide client-based input.”
ABC for Health released its report shortly after Peterson learned that the CNHA report was published. Its critique was unsparing.
“Dane County hospitals must do more to justify extensive tax breaks and better serve patients impacted by health disparities,” the report states. “In 2023, Dane County hospitals spent an average of only 0.7% of their gross patient revenues on charity care. The national average is 2.3%.”
ABC for Health bases its calculations for Dane County charity care on Wisconsin Hospital Association data, and the national average on a 2022 Wall Street Journal report.
Peterson sent a letter reiterating ABC for Health’s concerns and the organization’s complaint about its lack of input in the CNHA report to UW Health’s CEO, Alan Kaplan, in January. He said there was no response.
ABC for Health also invited Kaplan and other hospital leaders to the ABC for Health event Thursday. The invitations were ignored or declined, Peterson said.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).Lawmakers are considering a bill that would offer a tax credit to help ease the burden of the unexpected costs associated with one of the hardest days a parent could experience — the stillbirth of a child.
For two Maryland mothers who still mourn, years after the trauma of stillbirth, the bill sends a bigger message — that the children they lost mattered.
“One of the hardest parts about being stillbirth parents is that you feel this love for your child, but nobody can see that because they’re not here,” Jessica Brady Reader, a Kensington resident, said after a hearing Thursday on Senate Bill 414.
“And so from a symbolic standpoint, this bill is very important, I think, for giving families that satisfaction — that their child counted,” she said.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher (D-Montgomery), would create a one-time $1,000 tax credit for families of a stillborn child to help offset the unexpected medical and funeral costs that families endure.
Those financial burdens add to the costs invested in preparing their home for the arrival of their newborn – a day that, for those families, did not come.
“Giving birth to a stillborn baby is one of the most traumatic things a mother can go through. And of course it impacts the entire family as well,” Waldstreicher told the Ways and Means Committee Thursday.
  Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher testifies on his bill to provide tax credits to families of stillborn children to ease the financial toll on grieving families. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
SB414 received unanimous support in the Senate earlier this month. With a fiscal note of some $360,000 annually — a drop in the state’s $67 billion budget bucket — Waldstreicher hopes the House will move the legislation as well.
“That trauma is compounded by financial impacts,” he testified. “In preparing for a live birth, they prepare the nursery — buy the crib, buy a car seat, stock up on clothing and diapers. And of course, the financial costs don’t end there. Suddenly, there are funeral costs – the service, the casket and the burial plot.”
That’s what Reader experienced in 2021. She was nearly 38-weeks pregnant when she lost her daughter, Francesca.
“Nothing could prepare us for the devastation of coming home from the hospital without our baby, or that year of firsts as we grieved our precious daughter,” she told the committee. “We needed to make arrangements in a matter of days, while I was postpartum and recovering from birth.
“A thousand dollars of unexpected expenses is crushing. So when Tax Day came, and it felt like nothing about Francesca counted, I felt yet another low point,” she said.
Lauren Petit, who lives just outside Annapolis, shared a similar story in her testimony. She and her husband were “bombarded with information and forced to make rapid, heartbreaking decisions” about funeral arrangements after losing their daughter when Petit was 20-weeks pregnant in 2020.
“We had to decide what to do with Ava’s remains,” she said. “Could we afford a funeral? Would we want one? Would we need grief counseling? These were unimaginable choices for grieving parents to make in such a short time. Fortunately, may husband and I had the resources … but not every family is as fortunate.”
Petit has testified for the legislation before. In 2022, she came before the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee with then-Sen. Sarah Elfreth (D-Anne Arundel), who was sponsoring the bill at the time. Petit relayed the same story then, with the pain of her stillbirth just two years old.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIt was the same year the General Assembly was considering what would ultimately become a ballot question to add reproductive rights to the Maryland Constitution. Waldstreicher believes that the political climate then may have contributed to why the stillbirth tax credit bill stalled in 2022.
“That year was a complicated year, because we were dealing with unrelated issues that could accidentally be conflated with this bill,” he said. “And I think some people conflated issues — perhaps some people wanted to conflate issues — but we don’t have that issue this year.
“I think this bill is now standing on its own and people understand, from both the Republican and Democratic perspectives, that it should move forward,” Waldstreicher said.
If it becomes law, Petit and Reader hope the measure inspires more attention, funding and research into the issue of stillbirth in the state.
According to 2021 data from the Star Legacy Foundation, about half of stillborn cases in Maryland do not cite a cause of death. That was the case for Reader, who said “it’s deeply painful for the parents who want to understand why there was this loss.”
“And it’s quite frustrating because we could and should … dedicate more research into the prevention side, which includes doing research as to what causes stillbirth, what are some of the co-occurring conditions that can arise, and how can we treat those better.” she said.
“This tax credit is … an important moment to recognize that there is so much work that still needs to be done about stillbirth,” Reader said. “It is so important that this issue is receiving attention through our legislation.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC02217-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 06:59:05.775198

But the federal government is not as simple as those Republican presidents or their latest hatchetmen claim.  Truth is it’s much more like a web intricately interwoven with state and local governments.  So when you start whacking the strands, the entire structure becomes unstable, ceases to function, and might well collapse — quite the opposite of the “make government more efficient” or “get government out of the way” lines government-hating politicians love to spew.
When the St. Mary’s Milk River pipeline catastrophically failed last year, leaving Montana’s entire Hi-Line facing a growing season with no irrigation water, those farmers and ranchers surely weren’t howling to “getting government out of the way.”  Simply put, the irrigators who use that water to make their living can not and will not come up with the $80 million or more the repairs will cost. 
So who did they turn to, and who actually has the ability to provide the considerable funding necessary to repair the blowout?  Yep, the federal government.  And of course the same goes for natural disasters and infrastructure failures nationwide.  When you’re standing in the rubble of your flooded, blown apart, or burned down home, somehow hating the federal government isn’t the first thing that likely comes to mind.
Out of the entire nation, Montana is number two in the recipient of federal funds as part of the state budget — a whopping 43 percent of the state’s total government expenditures.  Back in February this column raised the very real question of how the Legislature is going to meet Montana’s constitutional mandate to produce a balanced budget if the amount of federal funds the state will receive cannot be guaranteed.
That question has not been answered as the Legislature heads into its last month in session.  The general expectation is that there will likely be a series of special legislative sessions called to somehow deal with the federal funds that have been cut.  Our all-Republican Congressional delegation doesn’t seem to have any answers on how this is all going to shake out either…not that anyone would know since they’re mighty gun shy of town halls these days.   
Fact is: Special legislative sessions are no way to run a state.  Why?  Because much like our benighted Congressional delegation, special sessions basically leave the public out of the discussion.  They are generally very short, a couple days or a week — and they move quickly. So by the time the public might even get an idea of what’s going on it’s too late to voice our opinion to those who are supposed to be representing “we, the people.” 
The government haters might hail the tens of thousands of federal employees, 2,000 of which are in Montana, that have been or expected to be cut.  But if you’ve tried to contact a federal government agency for something you want or need since the hatchet job began, you might have a different opinion.  Please hold…for eternity.
“You don’t miss the water ’til the well runs dry” seems a particularly apt warning these days as more federal taps go dry every week.  The good news?  People are increasingly fighting back as the vast interconnected web of federal, state, and local government continues to unravel — and the personal impacts increase.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Online-Service-Not-Available-1024x247.jpg,,,2025-03-28 06:59:05.775198

Wes Moore (D).  (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore said the fiscal 2026 budget needs to give a tax break to middle-class taxpayers, but he sidestepped questions on whether the plan currently steaming through the legislature provides meaningful relief.
Lawmakers have just over a week to finalize a $67 billion spending plan that includes $2 billion in cuts and $1 billion in new taxes. The plan includes meager – on average — income tax cuts for most individuals while raising taxes in a range of other areas.
“While we are working through all the final details, I’m very clear about what I want the conclusion to be, right?” Moore told a gathering of reporters Friday. “The conclusion is the middle class needs to get a tax cut, that we’ve got to give more breathing room to middle class, more than this currently, across the board. We’ve got to make sure that the middle class are getting more financial support, right?”
Lawmakers are racing against the clock to finish the budget by April 7, the last day of the 2025 session.
The House on Wednesday passed its version of the budget, and the Senate is expected to begin debate Monday, with an eye toward finalizing its work by midweek. That will allow lawmakers to go to a conference committee to work out their differences and have a final budget by April 7.
During the conference committee meeting, lawmakers are expecting a second supplemental budget from Moore that includes nearly $100 million in additional cuts the legislature asked the governor to make.
When asked to reconcile the $1 billion in new taxes in the House and Senate versions of the budget with his “North Star” priority of bringing  economic relief to the middle class, Moore focused on income tax relief.
Democratic majority muscles spending, tax plan through preliminary vote

“And so, when I hear things like, you know, who are we fighting for? The answer is pretty clear,” Moore said. “We’re fighting for middle-class families, and we’re fighting to make sure the middle-class families and working families can get a little extra financial breathing room.”
Moore repeatedly pointed to his tax plan — which was watered down by the General Assembly.
The plan, as it stands, will provide a meager tax cut to some middle-class taxpayers. An estimated 94% of taxpayers would pay less or see no change in their state income taxes under the plan while so-called high earners, those earning $500,000 or more, would pay more after being shuffled into two newly created tax brackets.
The House plan also eliminated Moore’s proposed corporate tax cut. The governor proposed lowering the rate from 8.25% to 7.99% in two years, contingent on the adoption of combined corporate income tax reporting. The House adopted combined reporting, but nixed the rate reduction.
“I think it’s necessary, and I think that it actually coincides with so many of the other things that we are doing to make Maryland more economically competitive,” Moore said in a separate meeting Friday with broadcast reporters. Audio from that meeting was shared with Maryland Matters by Fox45.
Republicans said the income tax cut is not significant and is ultimately gobbled up by other tax and fee increases in the budget.
For those who get a tax break, the average amount would run between $50 and $60, about one-third of what was in Moore’s January budget proposal.
But the budget also contains a number of tax increases including a tax on IT and data services that will hit consumers and businesses alike. Other new taxes include a 6% sales tax on vending machine purchases, a tax on rental cars, an increase in the sales tax on car sales and faster implementation of higher vehicle registration fees passed in 2024.
“We think it’s still a net more than it is a net less for taxpayers,” said Senate Minority Leader Sen. Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore). “He’s only looking at one side of the ledger and saying we reduced personal income tax rates here, rather than acknowledging that they’ve raised taxes and fees on the other side.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) cast doubt on any late attempts to increase the size of a tax cut in the final days of the session, however.
“The budget is very tight,” he said.
Moore is also taking heat from some quarters over the services sales tax. The $500 million that will be raised by the data and IT services tax is part of an effort to offset part of a $3 billion deficit in the coming fiscal year.
Moore did not propose the tax, and had hinted at a veto if it affected businesses only. But a deal announced last week with Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) said the tax would be levied on both businesses and consumers.
Del. Mark Fisher (R-St. Mary’s) Wednesday had a message for businesses.
“Don’t move into Maryland, and if you have a small business or a medium-sized business, get out of Maryland now,” Fisher said during House debate on the budget. “The Democrat Party sees you as an ATM machine, and they will never stop until such time as they have the perfect socialist government that will then collapse upon itself, because there is no revenue left.”
Moore, in his meeting with broadcast reporters Friday, called the comments “embarrassing and disappointing,” and called on Fisher to apologize to Marylanders and residents of Calvert County.
“This is what people hate about politics, that you’re willing to root against your hometown for political purposes, for click bait,” Moore told the broadcast reporters.
“I just think it’s embarrassing for him, and frankly, if he doesn’t believe in the state, if he doesn’t believe in his constituents, if he doesn’t believe in the democratic process and in having open debates, then I don’t know why you are in a seat … because the Marylanders I know, they believe in Maryland. They root for Maryland, and they want to support Maryland,” he said.
When asked for comment Thursday, Fisher shared a link to a video he posted on social media.
“Why do people want to leave, Wes Moore?” Fisher asked in the video. “They want to leave because all they see is it being harder and harder to live in Maryland.”

Concerns are not coming strictly from Republicans.
Del. Brian M. Crosby (D-St. Mary’s) is not only the vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee, he’s also a military veteran and a small business owner involved in defense industry IT contracts.
He checks a number of boxes when it comes to Moore’s priorities and North Star values, including being a veteran and a small-business owner in the technology industry.
Last week, Crosby moved much of his physical business out of Maryland. He plans to reincorporate in Georgia, where he has a warehouse, to avoid the tech tax in the budget, which he said would bankrupt his business.
Moore, when asked about the move, insisted Crosby’s business remains “a Maryland business.”
“We’re making historic investments in the business community, and also in industries like the one that Brian is a part of,” Moore told print and radio reporters. “So, I know that we have worked with the business community. We have worked with individual Marylanders, and we know this is a deeply responsible budget that we’ve landed on, and one that we think that the people of the state will appreciate.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSC_0377-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-28 06:59:05.775198

(Chris Vinn for Louisiana Illuminator)LAKE CHARLES — Sheriff’s deputies accompanied Federal Emergency Management Agency workers to Terra Hillman’s fenced-in property Jan. 29. They were there to remove the camper she’s lived in since Hurricane Laura plowed through her home in August 2020.
Hillman’s is one of three households in Calcasieu Parish who still need temporary shelter as they struggle to rebuild after the historic 2020 hurricane season. Their personal stories reveal gaps that remain in the disaster recovery process, even as the area sees a boom in multifamily housing construction.
FEMA set a Feb. 28 deadline to remove the remaining trailers from Calcasieu Parish, though the agency did not respond to questions about why it went to Hillman’s property a month early.
When FEMA arrived at her property, Hillman entered her damaged house and would not speak with officials except to request they leave. About an hour later, they left without taking the temporary trailer. 
Damage to Hillman’s home has made it difficult for her to repair. Her insurance company initially paid to repair her roof but denied the rest of her damage claims, including home leveling costs, which she said came to more than $300,000. But after her insurance company filed for bankruptcy, Hillman received no additional reimbursements. Court records show she’s suing the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association to recoup her losses. 
“I’ve tried to re-tarp it [the roof] a few times myself because nobody else would do it because it’s dangerous …” Hillman said. “The weather around here just makes a joke of the tarps and stuff, and so the water just pours in half the house.”

Reached last week, Hillman said she was still living in her trailer while repairs to her home continue. A freak winter ice storm in February 2021 damaged her plumbing, adding to the fixes needed.
Hillman applied for help from Restore Louisiana, the program providing federal grants for homeowners affected by natural disasters in 2020-21. She was initially awarded $19,000 but appealed the award amount. She has since been approved for $325,000 to cover the full demolition and rebuild. However, she said the process has been slow.
Restore Louisiana program’s deadline for issuing grant award agreements was Nov. 1, 2024.
The Louisiana Office of Community Development, which oversees the program, has closed over 13,000 grant agreements, obligating more than $1.06 billion, spokesman Marvin McGraw told the Illuminator. 
“Of the 20,803 submitted applications, 99.9% of grant award determinations have been completed, with only 12 homeowners awaiting a final award decision,” McGraw said.
The program expects to finalize any outstanding awards by March 31, he added.
“At this stage, all homeowners have been notified of their program status, and any remaining delays are likely due to missing documentation or unmet program requirements,” McGraw said.

Financial hardships hinder recovery
Before it was removed from her property, Diana Betters lived in a FEMA trailer in south Lake Charles, outside of city limits. She shared it with six other family members since her manufactured home sustained storm damage in 2020 that included busted pipes and a mold infestation visible around holes in the roof, walls and floors.
“I don’t know how much mold has built up. We’ve been buying the mold stuff and spraying and scrubbing,” Betters said.
Despite efforts to secure more permanent housing after the storms, she faced credit checks and financial hurdles, including a $650 sewer repair.
Betters said she was awarded $75,000 from Restore Louisiana. 
“I went and looked at the double-wide homes, and they want $149,000,” Betters said. “What I’m gonna do with it? Well, it’s a down payment, then the rest gonna fall on me. I already have a mortgage” for the damaged home.
Betters said she turned down housing options in nearby Sulphur and Iowa because she didn’t want her 11-year-old granddaughter to change schools. She considered two apartments near McNeese State University but didn’t qualify for a lease because of her low credit score.
According to documents Hillman and Betters received from FEMA and shared with the Illuminator, their trailer rents increased in January, with residents subjected to additional penalties should they continue to live in them beyond February. 
Hillman said her $50 monthly rent increased to $200 in January, but she was unsure of what fees she would owe for continuing to live in her trailer past Feb. 28. Betters said her rent rose from $359 to more than $700 in 2024.
Despite the Feb. 28 deadline, FEMA representatives showed up at Betters’ property Jan. 30 and ordered her family to vacate the trailer. As the family packed their belongings, contract workers started removing the trailer skirting to prepare it for removal. But just as they had at Hillman’s home, FEMA workers left the property without the trailer when reporters with the Illuminator and KPLC-TV arrived. 
Betters told the Illuminator FEMA officials returned without warning the next day to remove the trailer. She and her family are now back to living in their hurricane-damaged home while they save for something new.
“We’re bunched up in here like sardines,” Betters said, explaining that she’s using some rooms in her damaged home for storage space.
FEMA would not answer specific questions about Betters or Hillman but said in an email that its Direct Housing Mission program ended Feb. 28. When a move-out is completed, FEMA said its campers are “not typically removed from the property on the same day.

Nearly 20 years of disputes
Sulphur resident Ronnie Hossain has lived in FEMA trailers since 2005, when Hurricane Rita leveled the southwest corner of Louisiana. He has been involved in a lengthy dispute with local officials over rebuilding his storm-damaged home, and FEMA put his trailer on its removal list with the two others left over from the 2020 storms. 
Hossain said his FEMA  trailer was scheduled for repossession for 9 a.m. Jan. 31. However, no one from FEMA arrived when the time came. He attributes the no-show to reporters who were present during previous removal attempts earlier that week.
Hossain claims FEMA wrongly accused him of violations in an attempt to force him out of his temporary housing and that local officials have been unhelpful, further complicating efforts to rebuild his home. He also said that FEMA cited him for failing to meet with a caseworker, but he alleges no caseworker has ever visited his property.
Hossain said he had been paying rent for the FEMA trailer, which recently increased from $225 to $475 per month. Now, he claims, FEMA is demanding $1,600 in rent, an amount he says is unreasonable.
Sulphur Mayor Mike Danahay said Hossain has been entangled in zoning and permitting issues since Hurricane Rita. He has violated city ordinances by having multiple structures on a lot zoned for one single-family dwelling, according to the mayor. 
Hossain said the trailer he had been living in since Rita was damaged during Hurricane Laura in 2020. FEMA replaced it, and he removed the original one from his property six months ago. 
Hossain has yet to move into his house, and Danahay says he has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for completing construction. The mayor said Hossain had electrical and plumbing work done without the necessary permits, which has prevented city inspectors from ensuring the home meets safety standards. Despite years of attempted cooperation, officials eventually had to start enforcing ordinances, Danahay said.
The mayor maintains the city’s goal is compliance, not punishment. 
“I think we’ve been more than patient with this gentleman to get his house in order so he can move back in,” Danahay stated. “All we are asking him to do is complete the house and do it right to ensure safety.”
Hossein told the Illuminator he has permits to work on the house. 
Hossain was locked out of his FEMA trailer Feb. 23, and it was removed from the property March 3, he said. Additionally, he claims FEMA sent a notice to the Internal Revenue Service to garnish more than $1,600 from his monthly income. 
He said has been in contact with Restore recently to renegotiate the terms of his grant to continue rebuilding his house.



Multifamily construction boom replacing damaged housing stock  
Hurricanes Laura and Delta took dead aim at southwest Louisiana and damaged approximately 44,000 homes, according to a 2020 study. About half of the Calcasieu Parish housing stock was impacted.
More than 750 damaged homes in Lake Charles have either been repaired or rebuilt since 2020, city spokeswoman Katie Harrington said. Additionally,  more than 900 new multi-family units have come online or are in the process of being developed. 
Woodring Apartments in downtown Lake Charles just marked its grand opening and offers affordable rates for qualifying tenants. Construction is well underway at the 72-unit Calcasieu Heights and Capstone at the Oaks, with 120 apartments. Both properties are intended for senior housing. 
Mid-City Lofts, a 46-unit mixed income development, is under construction on a portion of what was once the Lloyd Oaks Housing Development.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The effort to plug a “hole” left behind from Nebraska’s 2024 special session on property taxes — a “missing year” of tax relief — will likely not move forward this year.
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, the sponsor of Legislative Bill 81, confirmed the status of his bill this week. If passed, LB 81 seeks to extend the previous refundable income tax credit for school property taxes paid the previous year for one more year. 
That program ended with the passage of a bill during the special session that ended in August.
‘A missing year’: No income tax credits for Nebraskans to offset school property taxes paid in 2024

LB 81’s goal is to capture relief for the roughly 85% of Nebraska taxpayers who pay property taxes in arrears, such as property taxes assessed in December 2023 but paid throughout 2024.
Hardin said State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, chair of the Revenue Committee, has opted to keep LB 81 in committee and not “exec” on it, the step toward voting whether to advance the bill.
“Unfortunately there’s nothing we can do if they won’t exec on it and send it out,” Hardin said this week. “If they don’t exec on it this year and leave it there, this will continue to be something we’ll pick at into the next half of the biennium.”
Delay keeps bill ‘alive’
If the committee were to vote, von Gillern explained, the state’s projected $457 million budget shortfall for the next two years, prior to any legislative action, means LB 81 “would certainly fail.” He and the former chair of the Revenue Committee, former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan, have said property tax relief is still coming each fiscal year, just at a different time.

Von Gillern added that should the state’s fiscal position improve by next year, and Hardin’s bill remains in committee for now, “the bill stays alive.”
“We have an opportunity to potentially move it forward at that time,” von Gillern said. “The best thing we can do right now is leave it in committee.”
Summer special session
LB 81 was spearheaded and later drafted by former State Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard before he was term-limited in January. Just weeks after the summer special session, as first reported by the Nebraska Examiner, he found what he blasted as a “plain and simple retroactive property tax increase.”
When lawmakers voted 40-3 in August to approve LB 34, they revamped the previous tax credit program created in 2020 to apply automatically to taxpayer statements. 
In December, that meant many Nebraskans who did not know or were previously unable to request the tax credits received relief for the first time, which lawmakers and the governor lauded as a major success of the 17-day session of many twists and turns over multiple months.
In doing so, lawmakers eliminated the tax credit for any taxes paid in 2024. About 15% of taxpayers who paid 2023 assessed property taxes by the end of that year were able to get relief when they filed their 2024 tax returns.
The Nebraska Department of Revenue estimated LB 81 would initially cost $4.5 million for technical changes and to hire nearly 100 temporary staff to handle amended returns and answer taxpayer questions about the change.
The new credits that would be distributed under LB 81 would be over a three-year period because most taxpayers would need to file amended returns, the department said, estimated as follows:

$102 million in credits during the current fiscal year (ending June 30).
$503 million in credits during the next fiscal year (July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2026).
$32 million in credits during the third fiscal year (July 1, 2026, to June 30, 2027).

“Given this will likely be a slow process, the majority of the refunds will take place during FY 25-26,” the fiscal note states.
‘We made a mistake’
With a chuckle, Hardin said he was one of the ones to miss out on the tax credit. Among taxpayers who did pay early: Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen.
  State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering. July 31, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Hardin, Erdman and their supporters say the tax relief is owed to all taxpayers.
“What is fascinating to me is that at no point have I really had anybody who has ever said, ‘No, you’re not owed that money.’ It’s just, ‘We can’t afford it,’” Hardin said.
LB 81 did not receive a “priority” designation this year, meaning even if advanced from the Revenue Committee, it would head to the back of the line, behind more than 100 other proposals, as well as the budget, unless it hitched a ride on one of those items.
Asked whether taxpayers should expect any changes before the April 15 tax filing deadline, Hardin said bluntly: “No.”
Hardin could opt to try to “pull” the bill from committee, which would require 25 votes, or 30 votes if the Revenue Committee in response voted to “indefinitely postpone” or kill the bill. Hardin is not planning to file a pull motion at this time but does hope to have some productive conversations in the future.
He said advancing the bill would be the most transparent approach for taxpayers who want an answer.
“We made a mistake, and we need to own that mistake,” Hardin said. “We need to come up with that money for those people that we passed over, and that would be the right thing to do.”

The Sundance Film Institute announced on Thursday that festival organizers have decided to move to Boulder, Colorado. The Colorado House earlier this month advanced a bill that would create up to $34 million in tax incentives over the next 10 years (or $3 million to $5 million per year) for the film festival. The same day as Sundance’s announcement, a Colorado Senate committee gave its stamp of approval on the bill, which now heads to the Senate Appropriations Committee for further consideration.

Utah was one of three finalists bidding to host Sundance after its contract expires following the 2026 festival. Earlier Thursday, news broke that organizers did not choose Cincinnati, leaving just Utah and Colorado in the running. Sundance’s announcement later Thursday afternoon sealed the deal for Boulder.
“This decision was informed by a detailed evaluation of the key components essential to creating our Festival. During the process, it became clear that Boulder is the ideal location in which to build our Festival’s future, marking a key strategic step in its natural evolution,” said Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute Board Chair.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, in a prepared statement, said Colorado is “thrilled to welcome” the film festival and thanked Sundance organizers and other partners including the City of Boulder who “worked tirelessly to make this possible.”
“Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator, and important contributor to our thriving culture,” Polis said. “Now, with the addition of the iconic Sundance Film Festival, we can expect even more jobs, a huge benefit for our small businesses including stores and restaurants.”
 Governor says Sundance leaving Utah is a ‘mistake”

Sundance’s departure from Utah is a blow not just to local filmmakers, but also the state’s economy. Last year, the Sundance Film Festival generated about $132 million in gross domestic product for Utah, 1,730 local jobs, $69.7 million in Utah wages, and $13.8 million in state and local tax revenue, according to its 2024 economic impact report.
While Utah Gov. Spencer Cox expressed disappointment in Sundance leaving the state, calling it a “mistake,” he and other Republican state leaders shared hopeful messages of plans to fill the hole Sundance will leave behind.
“As I’ve said from the beginning, we wanted Sundance to stay. We made that clear to their leadership and put together a highly competitive package,” Cox said in a statement. “Ultimately, this decision is theirs to make — but I believe it’s a mistake, and that one day, they’ll realize they left behind not just a place, but their heritage.”
Cox added: “In the meantime, we’ll keep doing what we’ve always done: supporting filmmakers and building a world-class film economy right here in Utah. We have already begun meeting with partners, stakeholders, and creative voices to create a new festival — one that honors our legacy and writes the next chapter of independent film in Utah.”
In response to Sundance leaving, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said in a joint statement, “Our state isn’t defined by one festival or organization.”
“Utah’s number one economy, breathtaking landscapes, the Olympics, our world-class snow, central location, volunteer spirit and business-friendly environment make it a top destination for families, tourists and businesses,” the top legislative leaders said. “We firmly believe that as one door closes, another one opens. We will work to create a new opportunity that enhances Utah’s identity as a hub for arts, culture and film, driven by the entrepreneurial spirit that fuels our growth, innovation and cultural vitality.”

Park City and Salt Lake City are both Democratic strongholds in an otherwise deeply conservative state. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, Park City Mayor Nann Worel, and Utah Film Commission Director Virginia Pearce issued a joint statement saying Sundance’s decision won’t jeopardize their commitment to the arts.
“While we are naturally disappointed by the decision, the State of Utah, Park City and Salt Lake City have long been proud partners of the Festival, and we are grateful for the lasting impact it has had on our communities,” they said. “We remain committed to fostering the arts right here in Utah, where the spirit of storytelling will always thrive.”
Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson, however, had scathing words for Sundance leaders.
“As one of the original employees of Sundance Institute, I appreciate the influence Sundance has had on my life and so many others in our state,” she said. “Unfortunately, the current leadership has lost sight of the legacy and spirit that has been a staple of the organization for nearly 50 years.”

 Why is Sundance leaving Utah?

Leading up to their decision, festival organizers had said Sundance had outgrown the Utah ski town of Park City. Robert Redford, in January, told the Associated Press he’d started to “hear some negative comments about how crowded it is and how difficult it is to get from venue to venue when there’s traffic and people in the streets and so forth.”
On Thursday, Redford — an actor and director who founded the Sundance Film Festival — said his mission to discover and develop independent filmmakers will continue on, while thanking Park City and Utah leaders and expressing excitement for Sundance’s future in Boulder.
“What we’ve created is remarkably special and defining,” Redford said. “As change is inevitable, we must always evolve and grow, which has been at the core of our survival. This move will ensure that the Festival continues its work of risk taking, supporting innovative storytellers, fostering independence, and entertaining and enlightening audiences. I am grateful to the Boulder community for its support, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for the Festival there.”
Sundance organizers said they were drawn to Boulder for its “small-town charm with an engaged community, distinctive natural beauty, and a vibrant arts scene, making it the ideal location for the Festival to grow.”
“Boulder is an art town, tech town, mountain town, and college town,” said Amanda Kelso, Sundance Institute Acting CEO. “It is a place where the Festival can build and flourish. This is the beginning of a bold, new journey as we invite everyone to be part of our community and to be entertained and inspired. We can’t imagine a better fit than Boulder.”
 Did Utah’s flag ban contribute to Sundance leaving?

Sundance’s announcement didn’t mention some political drama in deep red Utah that some say could have contributed to the festival’s departure and added a wrinkle to Utah’s bid.
The 2025 Utah Legislature approved a bill aimed at banning pride or LGBTQ+ flags in schools and all government buildings, which its supporters said is meant to promote “political neutrality” in government spaces.
Drama over Utah’s bid to keep Sundance heats up over LGBTQ+ flag ban bill

Earlier this month, the Hollywood news site Deadline reported that bill, House Bill 77, could pose “an eleventh-hour obstacle to the Beehive State’s hopes of keeping” Sundance. The outlet quoted an unnamed “Sundance insider” expressing frustrations with the bill and calling it a “terrible law, a terrible look for the state.”
“No matter what they say, we all know who it’s aimed at — the LGBTQ+ community, and that’s unacceptable,” the outlet quoted that insider saying.
While state leaders committed millions in funding for Sundance, other Republican lawmakers balked at the decision and were vocal about letting the film festival leave.
“Bye Felicia,” the Senate sponsor of the flag ban bill, Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, posted on X in response to the Deadline article. “Sundance promotes porn. Sundance promotes alternative lifestyles. Sundance promotes anti-lds themes. Sundance does not fit in Utah anymore.”
It’s not clear how much the pride flag ban factored into festival organizers’ decision to leave Utah. Gov. Cox has yet to sign or veto that bill, though Thursday is his deadline to act. He told reporters in a news conference last week Sundance organizers told leaders “very clearly that political issues have nothing to do with the decision.”
Mayor Mendenhall, who was involved along with other city and state leaders on Utah’s bid, told reporters Friday she worried that the flag ban could indeed jeopardize efforts to keep Sundance.
“I think there’s a strong track record of bills that have changed the outcome of locations of major sporting events and major conventions,” she said. “I think it would be harmful to our effort to retain Sundance.”
She also reiterated calls for Cox to stop the bill in its tracks.
“My encouragement from my lips to God’s ears is that Gov. Cox will veto HB77,” she said. “It is not reflective of the values of this community, of our capital city, and I think of many of the businesses who choose to locate here because of the welcoming and inclusive culture of Salt Lake City.

 Utah’s bid to keep film festival was ‘extremely competitive’

Sundance’s departure comes after Utah’s bid committee — made up of officials from Park City, Visit Park City, Summit County, Salt Lake County, Visit Salt Lake, the state of Utah, Salt Lake City and Utah’s philanthropic community — spent nearly an entire year forming a bid package that included tens of millions in in-kind and cash public funding, plus even more in private commitments.
In total, Utah’s bid included more than $54.1 million in public cash commitments over 10 years. That included an additional $24.9 million in new cash commitments over the life of a 10-year contract, on top of about $29.2 million that had already been committed to Sundance over 10 years, according to bid committee officials. That would have equaled nearly $2.8 million in new annual public funding committed to the film festival, on top of about $2.7 million that was already committed, bringing the total annual public cash that was on the table to more than $5.5 million a year for 10 years.
The 2025 Utah Legislature appropriated $3.5 million in their budget this year for the film festival, upping the state’s annual commitment by about $1.62 million a year.

That doesn’t even include tens of millions more in private donations. On top of nearly $2.8 million a year in private donations already committed a year, private donors were ready to provide a $10 million one-time lump sum if Sundance signed a contract with Utah. They also proposed $15 million in cash per year for 10 years, totaling $165 million for the next 11 years ( for 2026 plus 10 years after).
Plus, Salt Lake City offered to expand Sundance’s footprint by offering up a lengthy list of venues of all sizes, in addition to the venues in Park City, plus private shuttles to and from Salt Lake and Park City that would have run every 30 minutes
To members of Utah’s bid committee, it was a highly competitive package. But it wasn’t enough to entice Sundance to stay.
“I couldn’t be more proud of the bid we put together,” said Lindsey Nikola, Mendenhall’s deputy chief of staff, who was deeply involved in bid efforts. “The committee worked tirelessly to showcase the best Utah has to offer, while also providing an extremely competitive financial package to support the Festival. While this news is obviously disappointing, I’m encouraged for the future of the arts in Salt Lake City as we strive to expand opportunities for creative thinking and expression.”

A Lebanon man whose son died of an overdose at Trousdale Turner prison is accusing the state’s private-prison operator of “chronic and intentional understaffing” that could have contributed to the death. 
“There are not enough guards to run a safe and secure prison. Instead, it’s become a haven for gangs, dealing drugs, and these drugs are killing inmates,” said Tim Leeper in testimony before the House State and Local Government Committee Wednesday.
Leeper told the panel the state should take over Tennessee’s four privately-run prisons and remove CoreCivic because it’s putting profits ahead of prisoners.
The committee followed by unanimously endorsing House Bill 1144 by Republican Rep. Clark Boyd of Lebanon, which would require the inmate population at each CoreCivic-run prison to be reduced 10% if the death rate there is twice as high as the rate at a comparable state-run prison.
Tennessee levied $44.78 million in penalties against private prison operator in three years

State Comptroller audits show Trousdale Turner had a 146% employee turnover rate in 2023, making it more difficult to check on prisoners and avert murders and drug overdoses. Trousdale Turner, which is under a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, has a vacancy rate of 33.7%, compared with 26% at state-run prisons, officials said earlier this year.
Still, the state is seeking a $6.8 million contract increase for the private prison operator despite penalizing the company $44.78 million since 2022 for contractual shortfalls, $15 million in the last half year. 
CoreCivic doesn’t pay those penalties but simply forgoes state payments. And Boyd told the Lookout he doesn’t believe the penalties are stiff enough to make CoreCivic, a publicly-traded company, change course. 
The Department of Correction consistently defends the prison company, calling it a valuable state “partner” and commending it for trying to bolster staff. The state is having its own problems keeping officers. 
Leeper hired a private investigator to look into the cause of son’s death after the young man succumbed to a fentanyl overdose two years at age 25 while serving time for arson Trousdale Turner.
“The more I looked into how it happened the more frustrated I became, because these deaths were extremely preventable,” Leeper said to the Lookout. 
The young man suffered a stab wound the first day he was transferred to Trousdale Turner in May 2023 and died just six months later, his father said, adding his son suffered from anxiety because of constant fear he would be knifed again. A correction officer even told him he needed a shank or “butcher” to protect himself, Leeper said.
The elder Leeper called the state’s prison system the “catch-all” for people with mental illness, childhood trauma and substance abuse, a place where society “warehouses people away from us because it makes us feel safe.”
CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin responded to the criticism with an email statement saying prisoner safety, health and well-being is “top priority” and that each facility has emergency response teams to handle medical care. All deaths are reported immediately to the state for investigation.
“All of our Tennessee facilities are subject to multiple layers of oversight by TDOC and independent third parties like the American Correctional Association. TDOC employs full-time, on-site contract monitors at each of our facilities who work to ensure our full compliance with prescribed policies and procedures,” Gustin said.

Yet even with President Donald Trump pardoning crimes and cutting civil rights investigations, the probe into CoreCivic’s Trousdale Turner continues.
Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon, who is sponsoring the bill’s Senate version, said Thursday he wants to renew the legislature’s correction oversight board, which was removed six years ago by former House Speaker Glen Casada.
Pody said statistics show more deaths occur in CoreCivic prisons than in the rest of the state’s prisons.
“If it can’t get under control, I think we need to do something legislatively so we don’t put people at risk in the prisons,” Pody said.
For a start, Pody said he wants more timely and accurate information so lawmakers can make better decisions. But any bill resurrecting prison oversight will have to wait until next year. 
Lawmakers are shutting down committees and trying to adjourn by mid-April so they can skedaddle before the kickback corruption trial for Casada and former staffer Cade Cothren begins. About 20 members have been subpoenaed to testify, and the trial is becoming the elephant in the room. 
Their priorities are set, but other than the Boyd-Pody bill, they don’t appear to involve reining in CoreCivic.
Let ’em out?
A week after the Senate Judiciary Committee killed a bill supported by the Tennessee Innocence Project, the measure is coming back to life.
Senate Bill 256, sponsored by Republican Sen. Todd Gardenhire of Chattanooga, would set a procedure for inmates to seek post-conviction relief based on new evidence that wasn’t available at the time of their conviction.
It’s slated to be heard – again – in committee next week. House Bill 601, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Bob Freeman of Nashville, is to be heard Wednesday by the House Judiciary Committee.
The rebirth came after Chairman Gardenhire and other committee members signed a letter this week showing their support for revival. 
  Sen. Paul Rose (Photo: John Partipilo)
Republican Sen. Paul Rose’s support was critical after he voted against the measure initially. The Covington Republican said he was persuaded to change his stance after seeing an amendment that sends applications for post-conviction relief through district attorneys.
“This is something that needs to be fixed. We really wanted it, so we worked with the Innocence Project, the district attorneys and got to a really good place,” Rose told the Lookout.
Considering most of the legislature’s criminal justice bills lock people up for good, this is a reversal of sorts. Maybe they don’t have tin man’s disease after all. Nah, what am I thinking?
Remembering Roy Herron
In a shocking turn of events, the Senate Energy, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee endorsed a Democrat’s bill, one that would require personal liability insurance for watercraft such as jet skis.
Sen. Heidi Campbell of Nashville pushed the measure through the committee when the late Roy Herron’s wife, Nancy, testified about the need to insure personal watercraft because of the risks involved with riding them. A minimum age for driving them had been removed from the bill.

Herron, a West Tennessee lawmaker for more than a quarter-century then a lobbyist, died from a jet ski accident on Kentucky Lake. He was enjoying a family outing with family in July 2023 when an 11-year-old boy plowed into his jet ski at a high rate of speed. Herron died a week later at Vanderbilt hospital.
His son’s friend, Kala McDonald, was seriously injured as well and continues to receive treatment despite returning to medical school, according to Mrs. Herron.
“This financial responsibility provision may seem to some people like a small thing. But it would have meant so much to Kala,” she said, adding insurance costs only about $100.
Mrs. Herron implored the committee to take action, and shockingly, they did. Are we starting to see a new theme here? Maybe not.
“Get off of my cloud”
A heated exchange between Memphis Democratic Rep. Justin Pearson and Sevierville Republican Rep. Andrew Farmer forced the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee into recess Wednesday. Pearson, who has been absent from the hill following the death of his brother by gun suicide in December, brought a bill that would repeal permitless carry in Tennessee, calling on the legislature to act on gun violence instead of offering “some empty thoughts and prayers.”
Farmer replied it was unfair for Pearson to “lecture (the committee) on hard work and convictions” when “every member in this committee has been here this year … but you have not.” 
An incensed Pearson shouted back that hard work means passing better laws and fighting “for a state where everybody is able to live more freely from the pain of gun violence that me and my family are experiencing.” He said if Farmer “can’t take that,” he should “learn to shut up.”
Farmer responded that he also has a family and makes sacrifices every year to participate in the legislature. “It’s very common in your party when you disagree with a comment — and I was not disrespectful to you — that you resort to yelling,” Farmer said.

The two lawmakers were separated by their colleagues during the recess.
Pearson issued a statement later saying he has been working on constituent service while dealing with family tragedy.
Hallway talk, though, is that Republicans could be considering a way to punish Pearson for the incident, in part because he approached Farmer in the committee room and had to be restrained. 
Conflict between Farmer and Pearson dates back to 2023 when the Sevierville attorney helped lead expulsion hearings against Pearson, Rep. Justin Jones and Rep. Gloria Johnson. It wasn’t pretty as House Republicans expelled Pearson and Jones for leading a gun-control rally on the floor but narrowly voted to keep Johnson.
Memphis and Metro Nashville councils returned Pearson and Jones to the House the following week, and international publicity enabled them to raise nearly $1 million each.
The expulsion left House Republican leaders with more than egg on their faces, and kicking Pearson out again would only come back to haunt them. The problem is this week’s blow-up could have been avoided, plain and simple.
Switching horses
The House version of Republican Sen. Brent Taylor’s bill to investigate and potentially impeach Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy was taken off notice this week, for a supposed technicality.
The Tennessee Journal, though, is reporting that Taylor’s bill has devolved into creation of a disciplinary board to review that actions of district attorneys and court officers.
Asked where the matter stands this week, Taylor promised big doings. But this appears to be an attempt to study the matter rather than go directly after Mulroy, a Democrat, which means the impeachment or expulsion is dead.
Taylor kept running into opposition from Senate leaders who didn’t want to micromanage district attorneys, and others say there wasn’t much to the matter, except Taylor’s dislike for Mulroy.
Nothing like a good tempest in a teapot.
What chemtrails?
Lawmakers outlawed chemtrails last year, those pesky white plumes emitted from jets, which is why we need more skyhawks to survey the heavens. But that wasn’t enough.
Protectors of the atmosphere and everything we breathe wanted to stiffen penalties for entities that spread those lines across the sky. 
The House went along with Republican Rep. Monty Fritts’ bill, passing it with ease this session. But the Senate said, “not so fast, my friends.”
Republican Sen. Janice Bowling this week argued that Congress is continuing to fund geo-engineering weather modification efforts while so-called experts claim that aerosol injections into the atmosphere can help stop the “climate crisis” by reducing the intensity of sunlight hitting the Earth.
But alas, the Senate energy and ag committee killed the last chance for Tennesseans to “breathe deep the gathering gloom.”
And after all he’s done
The House voted 73-21 Thursday morning to honor the “estimable” Tennessee Coordinator of Elections Mark Goins for his efforts over the years to run elections – some say into the ground, considering the state ranks near the bottom in election participation.
The resolution prepared by Republican Rep. Tim Rudd of Murfreesboro said Goins worked with the General Assembly to enact laws ensuring “fair, secure, and free elections,” including requiring photo IDs, voting machine vendor ethics regulations and anti-election hacking.
If only he’d been in charge of elections in every state five years ago, we could have avoided the “stop the steal” campaign and the Jan. 6 insurrection.
While Republicans voted overwhelmingly in favor of recognizing Goins – even though it’s not a great practice to congratulate someone until they retire or die – Democrats weren’t as amiable.
Democratic Rep. Bo Mitchell of Nashville told the House chamber, if Goins had been a local school district, he would have been taken over and turned into a charter school.
Look the other way
The Cordell Hull Building is packed these days with folks from across the state coming to lobby lawmakers or, it seems, to hang out and ride the elevators. 
One soul, though, apparently decided he’d had enough of the legislature’s shenanigans outside the building and took it upon himself to urinate on the sacred Cordell.
People on the Hill are accustomed to people raising a ruckus or sitting quietly holding 8-by-11 signs, but one wise guy said, “This isn’t peaceful protest but pee-ful protest.”

The code changes would update Arapahoe County’s regulations to comply with state laws that were passed during the 2024 legislative session. Those regulations include creating new zoning districts for multifamily and mixed-use developments, removing minimum parking requirements, allowing for overnight shelter and transitional housing units for people experiencing homelessness, and revising manufactured home requirements. 
Governments across the Denver metro area have been considering how to comply with the new state laws for over a year. If adopted, Arapahoe County would be one of the largest government entities supporting the new state laws, which have sharply divided communities across the Front Range. 
“These proposed code changes will hopefully help us meet the new requirements from the state,” Kat Hammer, senior planner with Arapahoe Public Works and Development, said during the study session.

County commissioners also discussed creating a two-tiered set of incentives for new affordable housing development. Under the proposed guidelines, developments where at least 50% of the units are designated as affordable could be allowed to build buildings up to 75 feet in height, have their planning and engineering fees reduced, and go through an expedited land use review process. Developments that reserve at least 10% of their units as affordable would be eligible for more limited height and density benefits.
Arapahoe County has been studying how to make its land use codes more amenable to affordable housing developments since December 2023. However, balancing the county’s need for more housing with feedback from the community has proved difficult. 
County staff noted multiple concerns about the code changes. For instance, there were concerns about how the proposed changes would impact the progress of current developments, affect infrastructure and roadways, and whether the affordable homes would be marketable once they are completed. Staff also shared concerns about the county’s ability to monitor and enforce the affordable housing requirements and whether developments where 50% of the units are designated as affordable should be allowed to bypass neighborhood meeting requirements. 
The board decided to include the neighborhood meeting requirement in the proposed changes, but the discussion illustrated the concerns that lawmakers in other cities have raised about speeding up the development of affordable housing. 










We have a shortage of single-family homes, which is why people are leaving the state ... People don’t want to live in apartments from birth to death. I saw this stuff in Russia and it was built under Lenin.


– Westminster City Council member Kristine Ireland


Commissioner Rhonda Fields, a former Democratic state lawmaker, expressed reservations about allowing certain developments to bypass neighborhood meetings. 
“If something was moving into my neighborhood, I would want to know,” Fields said. “I would want to lend voice before the project, because once the project is approved, my opportunities to shape it are less.” 
Commissioner Jessica Campbell said she supports including neighborhood feedback about new developments, although she noted that public hearing requirements can increase the cost of development by delaying the project’s approval, thereby causing developers to pay more carrying costs. Sometimes, the discussions also veer into economic discrimination, Campbell said. 
“Part of why I think this deserves a different treatment is because when we are talking about affordability … the comments we hear are not just about density,” Campbell said. “They are literally ‘we don’t want those people here.’ And so we, as a government, are facilitating a conversation and are allowing economic discrimination to take place.”
Metro area housing shortage
The affordable housing debate in the Denver area has become bifurcated into what kind of housing should be built and which cities should bear the brunt of the new development. 
According to a 2024 Housing Needs Assessment from the Denver Regional Council of Governments, the metro area needs to add 216,000 housing units by 2032 to meet demand. The greatest need is for units that are affordable for people earning up to 60% of the area’s median income, or around $78,000 for a family of four. Arapahoe County needs to add around 2,270 units to meet demand by 2032 as well. 
State lawmakers have tried to promote more affordable housing development through legislation. For example, state lawmakers have passed bills encouraging local governments to allow accessory dwelling units, giving local governments the right of first refusal for certain types of land to build more affordable housing on, and increasing transit-oriented development.
Voters also approved Proposition 123 in 2022, which requires participating governments to build 3% more affordable housing annually for three years. 
In February, CPR reported that lawmakers in cities across the Front Range have pushed back against state laws that require cities to relax development codes and add more affordable housing. Some have gone as far as to say they won’t follow the new laws at all. 
During a regular City Council meeting on Feb. 3, Westminster Mayor Nancy McNally said the new state laws amount to state overreach. City Council member Kristine Ireland also expressed concerns about the city building more apartments. 
“We have a shortage of single-family homes, which is why people are leaving the state,” Ireland said. “People don’t want to live in apartments from birth to death. I saw this stuff in Russia and it was built under Lenin.” 
McNally and other council members directed city staff not to comply with the laws. 
“The issue is local control,” McNally said. “Are you going to let the state tell you what to do, no matter what any citizen says because they’re not going to your citizens? Or do we control it? That’s it for me.” 
On March 4, several residents of Lafayette spoke against the state housing laws during the city’s biweekly City Council meeting. Multiple residents said they supported the city joining a lawsuit against the state over the new laws. 
Afterward, council members agreed to meet in a closed-door session to discuss their legal options for ignoring the state housing laws. Lafayette Mayor Pro Tem Brian Wong said the state bills seem to be chipping away at the city’s home rule authority as well. 
“I’ve heard through my conversations with DRCOG that several communities are looking at litigation,” Wong, referring to the Denver Regional Council of Governments, said.

Family access to shelters is also not always reliable, according to the audit report that was published and sent to legislative leaders last week.
“Providers we surveyed indicated that the City and Unity need to improve communication, including better availability and responsiveness to providers, clarity regarding policies and procedures, and more timely reimbursements,” Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack wrote in the report. “In addition, information about available resources is difficult to find and may be out of date.”
The audit period stretched from January 2019 to June 2024. Over that stretch, the city and Unity of Greater New Orleans, a nonprofit organization that coordinates homeless initiatives, spent $216.3 million on homelessness initiatives. Most of the money came from federal funds, and over half of it went to permanent housing programs for people with disabilities.
During the review period, 275 people in homeless encampments were provided housing, the audit said. From January 2019 to January 2024, the number of unhoused individuals  in New Orleans increased 22.4% from 1,188 to 1,454. However, unsheltered homeless decreased 18.5% from 594 to 484 during the same timespan.
The audit report included 19 recommendations total for the Louisiana Housing Corp., Unity and the city agencies that address homelessness in New Orleans. The respective entities agreed with nearly all of them.
The New Orleans Office of Homeless and Services disagreed with the auditor’s suggestion that it develop official policies for removing homeless encampments. In October, city officials took issue with Gov. Jeff Landry’s directive to have Louisiana State Police clear out a large tent community near downtown ahead of Taylor Swift’s concerts at the Superdome.
Waguespack wrote that several factors drive homelessness in New Orleans, including a lack of affordable housing and a need for employment opportunities that provide a living wage.

Maybe not to “Scott A.” as Musk called him, the Green Bay voter to whom Musk gave $1 million as part of his campaign to reward Wisconsinites who sign a petition against “activist judges,” while at the same time handing over their personal data to Musk. Scott A.’s haul is one-fifth the size of Musk’s $20 million investment in campaign ads and door-knocking to support his preferred candidate, Brad Schimel. 
And Musk’s $20 million spending spree accounts for about one-fifth of the total, record-breaking $100 million that makes the April 1 contest the most expensive judicial race in U.S. history.
The race is a test of many things: Whether Musk, serving as unelected and unpopular co-president to Donald Trump, is a political asset or a liability; whether the new liberal majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court will endure; whether the highest bidder is destined to win state court races even as the ad war becomes a blitzkrieg; whether three months into the Trump administration, amid mass firings, the dismantling of federal agencies and voter unease about the destruction of their health care and retirement security, Wisconsin might be the place where things begin to turn around. 
The money pouring into the Supreme Court race is obscene and a bad sign for the health of democracy regardless of next week’s outcome. But the sickness didn’t flare up overnight. It has been getting steadily worse for almost two decades.
Schimel makes the claim that he is running to restore the Court’s “impartiality,” motivated by his disgust at how “political” the Court’s new liberal majority has become. In truth, the politicization of the Court goes back almost two decades and Schimel, a highly partisan Republican, is an unlikely candidate to take us back to pre-partisan times. On the other side, Susan Crawford is backed by the Democrats and big out of state donors including George Soros. In a recent debate she conceded that the public has an interest in ethics rules that would require judges to recuse themselves from cases involving their donors, but the current rules don’t require that. Neither candidate has promised to recuse from such cases.
The turning point that led us to the current moment came in 2008. That was the year disgraced former Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman defeated incumbent Justice Louis Butler in a dirty campaign that broke all previous spending records. The race cost $6 million — at the time, an astounding sum.
Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, Gableman’s biggest-spending supporter, paid for ads calling Butler “Loophole Louie” and accusing him of being soft on crime. Gableman himself ran a disgusting ad that placed Butler’s face next to the mugshot of a convicted rapist. Both men were Black. The ad misleadingly claimed that Butler “found a loophole” and let the man out of prison “to molest another child.” In fact, Butler was not the judge in the case. As a public defender assigned to defend his client, he lost in court and his client was imprisoned, then later reoffended after he was released, having served his full sentence. 
Gableman went on to help destroy ethics rules on the Court, refusing to recuse himself from cases involving WMC, which had spent more than $2 million to help elect him. He played a key role in passing the current ethics rule allowing justices to decide for themselves whether to recuse in cases involving their big-money campaign contributors. 
Gableman embarrassed supporters, including Dodge County District Attorney Steven Bauer, who publicly withdrew his support during the campaign because of the attack ad. Tellingly, after he left the Court, Gableman disappeared, never landing a job at a law firm or in public service. His brief return to the limelight, as Assembly Speaker Robin Vos’s chief investigator of nonexistent voter fraud, featured Gableman threatening to jail the mayors of Democratic cities and wasting more than a million taxpayer dollars on a farcical investigation that ended when Vos fired him.  
But the damage done by Gableman and the people who poured money into electing him endures.
The 2025 Supreme Court race, which is on track to double the cost of the last record-breaking election in 2023, is 15 times as costly as Gableman’s expensive and shamefully politicized campaign. 
Ads featuring scary crime stories are still a major feature of Supreme Court races, sponsored by people who know and don’t care that tough-on-crime issues aren’t coming before the Court. Instead, the ads are paid for by ideological groups, political parties and corporations interested in favorable treatment — like Musk, who has a current lawsuit in Wisconsin seeking to overturn a state law blocking him from opening Tesla dealerships here.
Back in 1873, Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice Edward Ryan worried about the rise of the robber barons, their accumulation of vast personal wealth and with it political power. Speaking at the University of Wisconsin Law School, he posed the question:  “Which shall rule — wealth or man; which shall lead — money or intellect; who shall fill public stations — educated and patriotic free men, or the feudal serfs of corporate capital?”
We are well on our way to becoming a nation of feudal serfs to Elon Musk. The liquidation of government agencies and institutions that serve the public interest are a giant step in that direction. The Wisconsin Supreme Court election will take us further down that road, or move us in the opposite direction. But until we do something about the arms race in campaign spending, Ryan’s vision of government by “educated and patriotic free men (and women)” will be increasingly out of reach.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Community College Association)LINCOLN — Tax credits to offset property taxes owed to local K-12 school districts are now automatically applied, but Nebraskans still need to file for income tax credits for community colleges for additional relief each year.
State lawmakers opted to “front-load” the tax credits for property taxes paid to K-12 schools in August, beginning with tax statements that went out in December, lowering property tax obligations. But Nebraskans seeking similar relief on property taxes paid last year to community colleges — before the state largely took over funding them — still need to take the extra step of requesting a refund via their tax returns by April 15. 
This includes the last round of general fund community college property taxes, as well as capital improvements or bonds assessed in December 2023 that most taxpayers paid throughout 2024. 
Under current law, the income tax credits for property taxes paid to community colleges are set to be available each year, but must be filed for one year after payment.
The state replaced the majority of local community colleges’ property tax authority with state dollars, effective this fiscal year, which zeroed out the general fund property tax-funded part of the colleges’ general funds in December but left a narrow levy authority to the six colleges.
This fiscal year, the state picked up more than $253 million, an amount that grows each year for each college.
Community colleges requested $289 million in property taxes in 2023, and the replacement state revenue helped drop that amount to $69.4 million in 2024. College boards retain a 2-cent tax rate per $100 of taxable property valuations for paying off bonds or establishing a capital improvement and bond-sinking fund, which all six colleges requested.
The 2023 agreement also automatically locked in community colleges for annual increases in replacement state dollars. State lawmakers must give community colleges an increase in that bucket of funds by 3.5% or in “reimbursable educational units” for each community college. If not, community college boards could raise property taxes to make up the difference.
The preliminary state budget proposals from both Gov. Jim Pillen and the Appropriations Committee fulfill those funding obligations.
Nebraska taxpayers can use this online tool through the Nebraska Department of Revenue to determine the eligible community college refund they are entitled to before filing tax returns this year. Credits are rounded to the nearest whole dollar.

North Carolina is among the states considering legislation designed to regulate health insurers’ prior authorization and claims reviews. (Chris Carlson/The Associated Press)Health insurance companies are under increasing scrutiny for allegedly using artificial intelligence bots and algorithms to swiftly deny patients routine or lifesaving care — without a human actually reviewing their claims.
The high-profile killing late last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has focused even more attention on so-called prior authorization, the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding. There had been protests and outrage over the company’s practices for months before Thompson’s death, and UnitedHealthcare has been accused in a class-action lawsuit of using AI to wrongfully deny claims.
As more patients and doctors voice their frustrations, states are responding with legislation designed to regulate prior authorization and claims reviews. So far this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states are considering measures that would, for example, limit the use of AI in reviewing claims; exclude certain prescription medications from prior authorization rules; ensure that emergency mental health care is not delayed for more than 48 hours; and require that insurers’ review boards include licensed physicians, dentists or pharmacists with clinical experience.


North Dakota bill
The North Dakota Legislature is is considering Senate Bill 2280 that relates to insurance prior authorization. The House Industry, Business and Labor Committee is expected to discuss the bill on Monday, March 31.


Insurers have long required doctors to obtain their approval before they’ll pay for certain drugs, treatments and procedures. They argue it is necessary to rein in health care costs and limit unnecessary services. But many doctors and patients say the practice has gotten out of hand, causing delays and denials of care that are harming and even killing people.
In a survey last year by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors said that insurers’ prior authorization practices delayed “necessary care” for their patients. Twenty-nine percent said such delays had led to a “serious adverse event,” such as hospitalization, permanent injury or death.
In 2023, insurers selling plans on the marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act denied a combined average of 20% of all claims. Of the 73 million in-network claims they denied, only 1% were appealed, according to KFF, a health policy research group.
The federal role
Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice took a firmer hand against health care corporations alleged to be engaging in behavior resulting in limited and more expensive care for patients. The administration also approved rules requiring that beginning in 2026, Medicare and Medicaid plans create a streamlined electronic process for reviewing claims, making decisions more quickly and providing specific reasons for denying care.
But it’s difficult to hold insurers accountable, according to Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“Each part of the health care industry — hospitals, pharmaceuticals, insurers — they all have a lot of concentrated power,” McBride said in a phone interview. “And unless somebody actually takes it on directly, it’s going to stay that way. I think the Biden administration tried to take it on, but didn’t make a lot of progress.”
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration and Congress will reverse course. During his confirmation hearing on March 14, Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, defended the use of artificial intelligence in reviewing claims.
“AI can be used for good or for evil, and it to a large extent depends on who’s using it and for what purpose,” Oz told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. “I think AI could play a vital role in accelerating preauthorization.”
In the past, Trump has supported measures to help patients, such as increasing hospital price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices, McBride noted. But “Republicans and conservatives generally are anti-regulation,” he said. “My gut feeling would be that they back off on the Biden push on this.”
States have limited power to act on their own. They have authority only over state-regulated health plans, which include Medicaid, plans for state workers and policies residents purchase from the ACA marketplaces. About 90 million people are covered that way. State laws do not apply to the 156 million workers, retirees and dependents who get their coverage through employer-sponsored health plans, which are regulated through a federal law known as ERISA.
Furthermore, health insurance companies are large and have deep pockets, allowing them to easily absorb state fines.
But Kaye Pestaina, the director of the program on patient and consumer protection at KFF, said states have an important role to play.
“Much of the focus around prior authorization at the federal level has kind of originated from state protections, so I imagine there will be continual activity by state legislatures to come at the problem,” Pestaina told Stateline.
What states are doing
Pestaina said states are trying a number of solutions. For example, states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have given their insurance regulators more authority to directly access claims denial information, in order to overturn decisions or potentially enforce state rules. And these efforts have largely had bipartisan support.
In Pennsylvania, Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill pushed through bipartisan legislation in 2022 to streamline prior authorization practices for state-regulated health plans after hearing numerous complaints from patients and doctors.
The legislation created an Independent External Review organization that allows Pennsylvanians to submit an online form to request a review if their insurer denies a service or treatment. If the review organization decides the service should be covered, the insurer must do so. Before then, patients could turn only to a federal review process, which may have been more challenging to navigate and taken more time.
“Our reforms created clear rules, clear timelines for the prior authorization process, and it removed ambiguity or uncertainty from the system that at times, insurers could exploit and providers could be confused over,” Phillips-Hill told Stateline. “Prior to that reform, if you had a denial from your insurer, you had very little recourse.”
The program began in January 2024, and in its first year the Pennsylvania Insurance Department overturned half of 517 denials, which amounted to claims from 259 people.
Jonathan Greer, president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said his trade group worked with lawmakers to come to an agreement on how to change the prior authorization process in a way that worked for insurers and patient advocates. Greer says he thinks Pennsylvania could be a model for other states.
“Prior authorization, I think unfairly, has been characterized as a reason to say ‘no’ by insurers,” Greer said. “The purpose of prior authorization is to make sure that you know the care that you get is consistent with the care that you need.”
In North Carolina, Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder is hopeful that his prior authorization bill will make it across the finish line this year. Reeder’s bill would set tight deadlines on insurers’ claim decisions and require companies to have licensed practitioners on their claim review boards. Insurers would also have to publicize a list of services they require authorization for.
“I’m not saying that we need to get rid of it completely,” Reeder told Stateline. “There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.”
But some state laws have proven to be less effective than advertised.
In 2021, Texas enacted a first-of-its-kind law creating a “gold card” standard, under which physicians whose care recommendations are approved by insurers at least 90% of the time are exempt from the prior authorization process. But as of the end of 2023, only 3% of Texas physicians had earned gold card status, according to the Texas Medical Association.
That’s why the group is pushing legislation that would require insurers to report which preauthorization exemptions they granted and denied and how many claims went to independent review. Dr. Zeke Silva of the Texas Medical Association’s legislative council said it would be “in the same spirit” as what Pennsylvania has done.
“Our focus with the [Texas Medical Association] is our physicians being able to provide the best care possible. And we want that to be free of burden,” Silva told Stateline. “We want to minimize third parties coming in and inappropriately denying care that our physicians and our patients think is in their best interest.”

Jeff Landry’s recent moves to undo the layers of separation between himself and the body that oversees flood protection for most of the New Orleans area. They’re apparently at the [&#8230;],"Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry gives his address in the House Chamber on opening day of the regular legislative session, Monday, March 11, 2024, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (John Ballance/The Advocate, Pool)It has all the makings of history repeating itself — and in the worst way imaginable. 
You’re hard pressed to find anyone who’s endorsed Gov. Jeff Landry’s recent moves to undo the layers of separation between himself and the body that oversees flood protection for most of the New Orleans area.
They’re apparently at the behest of Shane Guidry, a prominent business owner in the offshore energy supply sector and generous donor to Landry’s campaigns over the years. The governor has made Guidry, who describes the governor as his best friend, an unofficial adviser within his administration.
Guidry’s influence has become apparent within the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East. The New Orleans-area levee boards on both sides of the Mississippi River were overhauled and rebranded after Hurricane Katrina once local and state leaders saw the need to remove political influence from resiliency infrastructure decisions. Their new structure placed an emphasis on subject matter expertise on flood protection rather than the political connections that had been in place for decades.
The first instance of Guidry dabbling in inner workings of the Flood Protection Authority-East came when executive director Kelli Chandler resigned in January. She clashed with Guidry over the role of the levee board’s 60-person police force, The Times-Picayune reported.

While Chandler saw protection of the authorities flood protection assets in Jefferson, Orleans and St. Bernard parishes as the department’s top priority, Guidry wanted more emphasis placed on law enforcement in New Orleans’ levee-adjacent neighborhoods. Officers should be doing more than “watching grass grow,” he said. 
Thanks to approval from the GOP-dominated Louisiana Legislature, the governor now has authority to directly appoint the leaders of dozens of state boards and commissions that previously went through a formal vetting and state Senate approval process. For the Flood Protection Authority-East, Landry tapped Metairie civil engineer Roy Carubba to replace Chandler, who had no background related to flood protection. 
Carubba’s firm has worked in the past for Guidry, according to reports. 
All signs point to Guidry continuing to exercise control over the levee board, and he says flood protection will continue to be its priority. 
But so far this month, four members resigned from the levee board, most of them citing Guidry’s reversal of reforms made after Katrina, according to WVUE-TV Fox 8. Three of them, Roy Arrigo, Thomas Fierke and William Settoon addressed their resignation letter to Guidry, although he has no official status with the Landry administration or designated powers over the authority. 
“Contrary to board appointed President Caruba’s (sic) often expressed opinions of the FPA, we have observed the morale, readiness and focus on flood protection have been diminished during his tenure,” the letter reads.      
The fourth board member, Derek Rabb, has not explained his departure.
When The Times-Picayune reached Carubba for comment, he said he first had to clear the interview with Guidry. Once cleared to speak, the engineer’s comments about his de facto boss were glowing, with Carubba describing Guidry as “a brilliant business person.”
Guidry explained to the newspaper why he’s provided guidance to the governor. 
“Look at Elon Musk, right? There’s a reason why he’s doing something free for Trump — because he knows he can help him. And Trump wants that,” Guidry said. “There’s a reason why I do what I do free for Jeff because he knows I have nothing to gain.”  
One local good government group has concerns over Landry and Guidry wading into flood infrastructure management. In a statement, the New Orleans-based Bureau of Government Research (BGR) challenged claims from the administration that the Flood Protection Authority, both its East and West offshoots, has been mismanaged.  
“The governor’s advisers have alleged that the New Orleans area’s vital flood protection infrastructure hasn’t been kept in working order and that funding dedicated for this purpose has been wasted,” the BGR statement reads. “While blaming the leadership of the authorities tasked with managing the $14.5 billion levee system, they have not provided any details or evidence of the problems.” 
BGR called on the governor to provide “thorough explanations, not accusations” before his administration puts forward any legislation to change the post-Katrina makeup of the flood protection authorities. The bureau was among supporters of the coalition of civic and business groups, along with elected leaders, who pushed for the new framework that received voter approval in the form of a state constitutional amendment. 
“Chief among the coalition’s aims was ensuring that the authorities’ boards of commissioners were selected for their expertise in flood protection-related and other relevant fields – not their political connections or views,” BGR wrote.
It’s been almost 20 years since the federally built levee system protecting New Orleans failed at multiple points, covering some 80% of the city with stormwater that destroyed homes and businesses that had otherwise survived Katrina. Two decades is not nearly long enough to erase the trauma from the minds of those who went through the storm and chose to rebuild.
It’s this still-fragile mindset that Landry and Guidry have stirred with their approach to the Flood Protection Authority. The exit of four board members, just weeks ahead of the 2025 hurricane season, has been disconcerting for many who have yet to have their trust in government restored.
This behind-the-scenes approach from the governor and his best bud does nothing to quell anxiety levels that increase every June 1. Greater transparency and a renewed adherence to post-Katrina flood protection principles from Landry and Guidry would go a long way toward engendering confidence in their decision-making.
While leaders might come and go, what the levees protect is not as easily replaced.

(Photo: John Partipilo)A representative from the legal firm that fought for deregulation of American wetlands at the U.S. Supreme Court spoke Wednesday in support of a Tennessee bill that would roll back protections for up to 80% of the state’s isolated wetlands.
Tennessee lawmakers are considering a bill that would significantly reduce requirements for development on wetlands, swampy lands that support diverse ecosystems, soak up floodwaters and recharge groundwater.
The state’s current regulations predate the federal Clean Water Act, which imposed the first federal protections for wetlands in the 1970s, requiring developers to compensate for destroying wetlands by preserving or restoring them elsewhere.
But the erosion of federal regulations in the last two years has given states more power to decide how they will define and protect wetlands.
The Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in Sackett v. EPA stripped federal protection from “isolated” wetlands that lack surface connection to water bodies deemed waters of the United States. And the EPA recently announced its intent to scale back federal wetlands regulation to reduce permitting costs for landowners and businesses, according to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who was appointed in January by President Donald Trump.
The Pacific Legal Foundation represented plaintiffs Chantell and Mike Sackett in the case that constricted the scope of the Clean Water Act to only wetlands with continuous surface connections to waters of the U.S. 
Environmentalists: Second attempt at wetlands bill would leave 80% vulnerable to development

Kileen Lindgren, a legal policy manager at the nonprofit constitutional litigation firm, told Tennessee lawmakers Wednesday that the bill they are considering is about “property rights and regulatory accountability.”
“When governments restrict … use, they’re devaluing property and violating owners’ rights under the Fifth Amendment,” she testified before the House Agriculture and Natural Resources Subcommittee.
Lindgren was the sole supporter to speak to the subcommittee, though a representative for the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Home Builders of Tennessee testified in favor of the bill at a previous Senate committee meeting. Six representatives from environmental groups and the mitigation banking industry urged lawmakers to reconsider the bill, warning it would largely remove incentives for developers to design around wetlands rather than destroying them.
Lindgren said she preferred the bill’s first iteration, which would have stripped all state regulation back to the level of the Sackett decision. The bill’s current version preserves the ability to impose mitigation requirements for high-quality isolated wetlands and moderate- and low-quality isolated wetlands larger than two acres.
“This bill as introduced recognized that to regulate land for having water on it amounted to the government devaluing that land, and when the government devaluates land, it takes away property rights and should justly compensate owners pursuant to the Fifth Amendment’s promise that individuals will not be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation,” Lindgren said.
She said the amended bill is only a “first step toward protecting private property rights.”
“As amended, the bill assumes the state has the authority to limit use of private property, and if the state wants to regulate isolated wetlands, it should justly compensate owners, recognizing that the people who are the state of Tennessee must bear the burden of this type of government interference,” Lindgren said.
Memphis Republican Rep. Kevin Vaughan, the bill’s House sponsor, brushed off scientists’ warnings that deregulation spurs increased flooding and decreased water quality as hyperbole and speculation. Vaughan said his main issue is the current rules seem to rely on a person’s intended use for the land, not solely the action of disrupting a wetland — agricultural uses are exempt from mitigation requirements.
Developers, seeking to gain from building boom tied to Ford plant, push for weaker wetland rules

“All this comes down to humans determining where (wetlands) are, and it’s a game … deregulation needs to come, but it needs to be simplified through plainer regulation so people will know what’s expected of them when they encounter it,” Vaughan said.
Nashville Democratic Rep. Justin Jones questioned Lindgren’s motive for testifying.
“The thing that I’m seeing with this is that this is not about property rights or conservation,” Jones said. “This is about everyday Tennesseans versus the power of special interest lobbyists on this hill. Every email we received from all across the state — and I literally … printed every single email and went through each one — was against this bill.”
The subcommittee voted 7-2 to advance the bill to the full House Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, where it will be heard on April 1.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/WETLANDS001-1024x648.jpeg,,,2025-03-28 06:59:05.775198

They learn how to listen to their sixth sense, how to believe in themselves and, equally important, how to care for their classmates.” — Pam McNall, CEO and founder of Respectful Ways 
Several studies have come out that have blasted West Virginia’s K-12 schools, as well as our national education situation. One comprehensive report ranked West Virginia very poorly versus national standards in math, reading, writing and science. Only four states scored worse regarding grade level 4 academic achievements in 2024. Twenty-eight percent of West Virginia students did not even achieve basic proficiency levels.
Going back to pre-pandemic times, overall scores were much the same with only three states scoring lower than West Virginia.
However, as a direct result of the COVID pandemic, West Virginia’s fourth grade reading score fell by 8% between 2019 and 2024. That put it in the worst one-third of states, those experiencing the biggest drops in reading scores.
A dozen other states fared even worse, with Maine dropping nearly 12% in just five years. In fact, only two states had improved reading scores-Alabama (2%) and Louisiana (6%) between 2019 and 2024.
We must not simply blame our teachers. Many of my relatives are underpaid public school teachers, some in low performing schools. These highly motivated educators work long hours, making much less than they could make in the private sector. They are in this occupation because they are dedicated to improving the lives of the children that they teach. They are motivated to help school children succeed academically and build a better life. 
However, the situation with West Virginia’s K-12 schools is highly troublesome, regardless of one’s politics. The bad news is that this is a long-term issue which cannot be turned around overnight. In this age of cellphones and the internet, our school kids are having difficult behavioral problems which lead to poor academic achievement. 
The good news is that there are proven methods for turning the situation around and improving the state’s K-12 schools. We must focus on improving the social and emotional side of the problem by making our children feel better about themselves and their academic environment.
In this electronic age, students have difficulty knowing what is real and what is imaginary. They hear and see so much that they are in sensory overload. As a first step, our schools must teach students how to empathize with others — the key to humanity. 
If a fellow student is having problems, proactively help him or her rather than laughing derisively, pointing fingers and then recording the debasing incident on your cellphone to immediately post to TikTok. Our children must understand right from wrong, and want to do what is right, both for them and others.
Respectful Ways, a digital, trauma-informed, social emotional learning (SEL) program, recommends beginning with four strategies for students:

Monotask — Focusing on one task at a time.
Design your environment — Eliminating distractions wherever possible.
Clarify tasks — Breaking them into specific steps.
Recover quickly — Accepting slips, resetting, and moving forward.

Yes, our nation is going through trying times. Many of our basic institutions are under attack. All the more reason for us to establish programs within our K-12 school systems which will teach emotional and social education techniques. 
We must help our students to succeed and gain control of their lives through providing them with the tools to swim against the strong tides that will otherwise overwhelm them. By doing so, we will provide them with the tools to tackle the academic side of the picture.

DemasMichigan State University announced this week that the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, or DOE-SC, approved the construction of a $48.5 million project to improve studies of neutron-rich isotopes.
Housed on MSU’s East Lansing campus, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, or FRIB, has received more than $1.5 billion from the DOE-SC, the university said in a news release, leading to discoveries in nuclear physics and furthering research in medicine, national security, materials science and industry. It officially began operations in 2022. 
  U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm poses with FRIB Director Thomas Glasmacher, MSU President Samuel L. Stanley, Jr., MSU Board of Trustees Chair Dianne Byrum and federal lawmakers at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for MSU’s Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, May 2, 2022 | Laina G. Stebbins
With this new investment construction of a High-Transmission Beam Line, or HTBL, will commence with the expectation it will be completed in April 2030. The HTBL will aid in the High Rigidity Spectrometer project, which aims to allow scientists to examine neutron-rich isotopes normally only created when stars collide or explode.
The new beam line is crucial to future experiments at FRIB, the facility’s Laboratory Director Thomas Glasmacher said in a news release Wednesday.
“HTBL will greatly expand FRIB’s scientific reach, enabling groundbreaking discoveries in nuclear physics,” Glasmacher said. “HTBL is made possible by the continued support of the federal government and the American public, whose investment in basic research infrastructure is vital to advancing knowledge for American competitiveness. We are deeply grateful for their commitment to scientific excellence and the future of discovery science.”
FRIB employs 565 employees, 153 graduate students, and 134 undergraduate students, according to the university.
As one of 71 American research universities in the Association of American Universities, with research efforts in nuclear physics, food systems, environmental science and more, MSU has committed to reach $1 billion in annual research expenditures by 2030. The university’s Strategic Plan outlines the financial commitment as a dedication for the “common good” to produce research to address issues in society across sectors.

And they had the power to make it happen.
During the first week, the House and Senate minority argued that the Republican supermajority’s rules for both chambers would stifle debate and limit their constituents’ voices. The GOP side of the aisle did not want to hear it. 
Then Senate President Robert Stivers publicly lamented — right there in the sacred well of the Senate — that reporters might not write the stories he, personally, would most like to see. “They want to write about division,” Stivers said of the press. “They want to write about dissension. … Every day, I want to look at the people who write the stories, who speak the language, who go on the TVs and the radio to talk about all the positives that this body leans on, not the negatives that they want to sell advertising and get advertising dollars for.” 
Listening to his speech, it was hard not to hear echoes of President Trump who regularly calls the press “enemy of the people” when they report straight news (which is their job) in lieu of flattering puff pieces.
The elimination of DEI — because who needs other voices, equal opportunities or inclusiveness? — was the driving force this year in Frankfort. 
When a Black woman approached committee chair James Tipton following adjournment of an anti-DEI hearing — on video you can hear her say, “I study race. I teach students about critical race theory. Like, how am I supposed to explain that?” — Tipton called for state troopers to remove her.
Not to be outdone in the shut up-department, Rep. John Blanton championed House Bill 399 to make loudly interfering with legislative proceedings a crime, a bill that allows lawmakers, in addition to law enforcement, direct authority to decide who should be arrested. 
  Columnist Teri Carter silently comments on the new crime of interfering with a legislative proceeding.
Democrats in the minority argued House Bill 399 could stifle the voices of citizens who want to make their opposition to legislation known in Frankfort, but their arguments fell on deaf ears. HB 399 was easily passed. 
So much for free speech.
In a Senate committee during the final full week to discuss House Bill 495 — cancelling Gov. Andy Beshear’s restrictions on conversion therapy and prohibiting Medicaid from paying for some forms of gender-affirming care — committee chair Stephen Meredith got all up in a lather as he repeatedly interrupted and shouted down Fairness Campaign executive director Chris Hartman. And when Hartman said softly, as he finished testifying, “I am disappointed, Mr. Chairman,” Meredith’s flip, snarky response was, “Wouldn’t be the first time, thank you.” 
Everyone in the committee room sat quietly, in shock I think, obeying the rules of decorum with mouths agape at the blatant disrespect they’d just witnessed from Meredith. And yet what we all know is this: a woman or a Black person would not get away with such behavior in a thousand years, and they would certainly not be chairing a committee with manners like that.  
But so it goes.
During a heated Senate debate over House Bill 4, Democrats tried to show their Republican counterparts how prohibiting DEI programs would harm college students who are members of minority groups, but Republicans did not care to listen. They were on a mission to get the bill (which failed to cross the finish line last year) to the governor’s desk so they would have time to override his expected veto.
In the final hours of the HB 4 debate, Minority Floor Leader Gerald Neal, who is Black, argued that historically not everyone has had the same “level of playing field” before discussing slavery in America, which was followed by Reconstruction in the South, Jim Crow laws and legal segregation. What then ensued was a dustup between Neal, a man known as the soft-spoken gentleman of the Senate, and Floor Leader Max Wise, who is white, even as HB 4 would pass with ease.
And in that final, busiest full week of this session, House Speaker David Osborne found time to pen a 600-plus word response to the Kentucky Lantern (which does not publish pieces by elected officials) to one of my columns, titled “‘Pattern of commentary driven by ideology rather than facts,’ Speaker responds to false and misleading commentary.”
Ah well. To paraphrase the oft-repeated words of beloved writer Anne Lamott: If this supermajority wanted folks to write more warmly about them, they should have behaved better.
I did correct a detail in the column that the speaker pointed out and that I had gotten wrong. I apologize for the error. Contrary to the speaker’s assertions, I care about the facts; I want to know and write the truth. What I won’t do is shut up. 
I am a woman with a voice that refuses to be stifled.
I refuse to kowtow to those who would silence dissent.
I will continue to bear witness and tell my fellow citizens exactly what I witness in an arrogant Frankfort supermajority that bristles when everyone doesn’t stand up and applaud.
If their ideas are so good, should they not welcome robust discussion? 
It seems this GOP supermajority of mostly older white men would rather all of us pesky women and minority groups just shut up and go away and let them have their good ol’ boy fun. 
The inability of our Republican supermajority to hear, or even acknowledge, that other life experiences and views exist is what I witnessed throughout the 2025 Kentucky General Assembly. 
It was not democratic. 
It was racist, sexist, embarrassing and unprofessional.
It was shameful.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/240227Lantern007-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 05:57:58.013651

When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
 Withholding tribes’ data

As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.













All of data is a story. It's a grandmother, it's a son, it's a story of a community's well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute





Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
 State data agreements

In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
 Tracking disease

In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist. Shewbrooks hopes the new South Dakota access will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
 ‘We needed this yesterday’

During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”

There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

People may be going about their day-to-day lives, but they are also on edge. They can’t help wondering what the vans holding the ICE agents look like. Hearing sirens, whether they are close by or in the distance, brings worries about what may be happening to individuals they may be close to or someone they have had a brief, friendly encounter with at a restaurant, at their children’s school, or at a sporting event.
It is not only the threat to those who could face deportation. There are many federal employees in Colorado. They do important work, whether it is weather forecasting, agricultural research, or simply helping those eligible for federal benefits. A lot of them have lost their jobs and those still working are walking on egg shells, wondering when their position might be eliminated. Meanwhile, everyone is losing access to the research they do and services they provide.

There is also the disbelief that so much of what we have come to expect as normal — friendly relations with other nations who share our values, opposition to authoritarian dictators, rejection of corruption and bribery in our elected officials — has been turned on its head. How do you comfort the family of a member of the armed forces who supposedly died defending democracy when democracy itself appears to be dying?
It all brings on feelings of anger and disgust, but also helplessness. What can you do? It is easy to send a message to your senators and representative in the U.S. House, but they are either sympathetic and powerless or dismissive of your concerns.
Capacity crowds turn out in Colorado for Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez

The helplessness needed an outlet.
And that is what the rally held by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders last week in Denver provided. Of course, the real goal of their visit to Colorado was to go to Rep. Gabe Evans’ district and goad him for his unwillingness to hear from his constituents who oppose the Trump/Musk regime’s actions. The turnout to the event in Greeley set the stage for the challenge coming to Evans in 2026.
But the rally in Denver was different. Walking amongst the crowd, there was a sense that the people there were finally exhaling after holding their breath for the past two months. Everyone was looking around, coming to the realization they were not the only ones frightened and dismayed by what is happening to the nation where they reside. There was comfort in the size of the turnout, comfort in knowing there is a willingness to challenge the darkness of the Trump administration.
It really did not matter what Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders said when they spoke. The power of their message was not in their words. The power of their message was in the response to their invitation to gather together on a Friday afternoon in downtown Denver. They could not promise a quick or easy fix to the situation in which the United States finds itself as a result of the 2024 presidential election. But they did show there is a large contingent of those who live in the Denver area ready to turn out and make noise in order to bring back hope for a just and caring society.
There will continue to be bad news for Coloradans over the coming weeks and months. Regular payments to Social Security beneficiaries could be threatened. Clean air and clean water will be under attack. Assistance for families needing help to make ends meet or to care for aging parents may be drastically reduced.
The rallies in Greeley and at Civic Center Park will not change that grim prognosis by themselves. But for those who were there, as well as those who could not go but share the feelings of the crowds in attendance, the knowledge there is a desire by many to oppose our current descent into authoritarianism can lift spirits — and spur action.

(Photo courtesy of Eric Klotz)Eric Klotz, a combat-disabled U.S. Navy veteran with nearly two decades of service in special operations, was sitting at his home in Hardy, a quiet community near Smith Mountain Lake, when the phone rang. On the other end was Eric Mosley, a fellow veteran and Democratic organizer, asking Klotz if he would once again serve — this time by running for the 39th House of Delegates District.
A longtime Republican who switched parties when Donald Trump first assumed office in 2016, Klotz, 53, had watched the political landscape shift dramatically during the first few months of Trump’s second presidency. The erosion of the country’s foundational principles, especially after his years of military service, troubled him deeply.
“I did a lot of deployments overseas, and I have experience living in countries controlled by authoritarian governments. I witnessed the suppression of individual rights and liberties, something we used to believe was protected by the U.S. Constitution,” Klotz said in a phone interview. “I can’t stand idly by while that birthright is under attack here at home. I took an oath to defend the Constitution, and it’s not just for some, it’s for all.”
On Wednesday, Klotz filed the paperwork to run as a Democrat in a historically conservative seat, currently represented by Del. Will Davis, R-Franklin. Despite the district’s strong Republican leanings, Klotz’s military background and willingness to cross party lines to fight for the principles he believes in have made him a unique contender.
Klotz is among a growing number of veterans stepping up to run for office — as Democrats — in traditionally conservative districts. They hope that their stories and experience in military service will resonate with moderate Republicans and independents, especially amid growing concerns over Trump’s military leadership decisions, including recent firings of military leadership and the controversial national security leaks surrounding classified war plans.
“This is a very strong military area,” Klotz said of the 39th District. “People here take pride in their service, and that’s something I respect deeply. My military background allows me to relate to a lot of people, and it bridges across party lines.”
The push to field more candidates in conservative districts, particularly those with military backgrounds, is part of a broader strategy by several grassroots organizers to increase voter turnout in hopes of flipping key districts. At the same time, Democrats aim to bolster support for former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a retired CIA officer who is expected to be the party’s gubernatorial nominee, and her bid to claim the governor’s office this November.
One of these organizers is Mosley, a retired naval aviator and Republican-turned-Democrat from Bedford County, who earlier this month received a call from Dr. Fergie Reid of the 90 for 90 Voter Registration Project, about finding a veteran willing to run in District 39. Without hesitation,  Mosley thought of Klotz.
“I’ve seen an attack on democracy from Republicans, and that’s what pushed me to get involved. Eric Klotz is a proven leader with the courage to stand up for what’s right, regardless of fear,” Mosely said. “I believe veterans like Eric, who have devoted their lives to defending the Constitution, can speak to Republicans who may be disillusioned with the direction the current administration is taking.”
 At least eight House Democrats are veterans 

And while Klotz is focusing on District 39, he is not alone in his mission. Veterans are running for other conservative-leaning districts across the state. 
In District 67, Mario Haggerty, a former U.S. Navy officer and veteran of overseas service in Europe and Japan, is one of two Democrats seeking the party’s nomination. Haggerty, who now manages defense projects and works with the Missile Defense Agency, is hoping to bring his expertise and perspective to the General Assembly.
Stacey Carroll, a National Guard non-commissioned officer with 19 years of service, is running in District 64. She will be facing Del. Paul Milde, R-Stafford, in November. Shane Boswell, a former Navy chief petty officer, is challenging Republican Del. Delores Oates, R-Warren, in District 31, which includes parts of Clarke, Frederick, and Warren Counties. 
Meanwhile, in District 75, a once conservative district south of Richmond, U.S. Army combat veteran Steven Miller-Pitts is vying for the seat held by Republican Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield. Additionally, U.S. Marine Corps veteran Jasmine Lipscomb is once again seeking the Democratic nomination in District 49, which includes Danville and parts of Halifax and Pittsylvania counties, hoping to build on her previous campaign.
At least eight Democratic veterans are already serving in the House of Delegates, including Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, a Navy vet who has served on the USS John Hancock, Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, also a Navy veteran, and Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, a West Point graduate with combat experience in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Others include Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, Del. Marty Martinez, D-Loudoun, Del. David Reid, D-Loudoun, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, and Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William. 
Helmer, who serves as the House Democrats campaigns chair, on Thursday took on a new role as co-chair of The Next Mission, a national recruitment committee for veterans. This effort, part of the New Politics organization, aims to support candidates from military service backgrounds and is backed by $20 million in funding. Helmer sees this initiative as critical, especially given the current state of the nation’s political landscape.
“This is a national phenomenon, not just a Virginia phenomenon,” Helmer said in a phone interview. “This effort comes at an unprecedented time of risk to our democracy. To have those who’ve sworn an oath to uphold and defend the constitution step forward to serve again in a new way is essential right now.”
Helmer emphasized that veterans, having fought to protect democratic ideals, are uniquely positioned to lead during these turbulent times. 
“Time and again, those who have stood up for democracy, served side by side with those willing to put their lives on the line for it, and sworn an oath to defend our constitution, are stunned by what we are seeing today. And many of them have stepped forward to serve again.”
 Trump policies leave many veterans “terrified”

Herb Rubenstein, chairman of the Lex-Rock-BV Democratic Committee, a coalition of party committees from Lexington, Rockingham County, and Buena Vista, said efforts are underway to recruit veterans for political office at all levels, from Congress to local positions.
“We’re not just reacting; we’re rejecting the people who are bombastic and dangerous,” Rubenstein said, referencing current Republican leaders in Congress, including seven Navy SEALs. 
He voiced concerns over the Trump administration’s handling of national security. 
“Many veterans are terrified. This guy (Trump) is selling us out to adversaries, using unsecure encrypted systems to communicate, and he’s been doing it for a long time. The military has a lot at stake. We need adults in the room for political governance — especially when it comes to the civilian leadership of our military. Former military personnel represent those adults, and they bring a high level of integrity.”
Rubenstein pointed to the significant financial backing of VoteVets, a Democratic group supporting veterans in politics, which recently donated $500,000 to Spanberger’s gubernatorial campaign — the largest donation in the group’s 20-year history, according to the New York Times. 
Rubenstein sees Spanberger as the type of candidate capable of leading the Democratic Party back to power in Virginia.
“We’ve got to activate our veterans, not just have them run for state office,” Rubenstein emphasized. “We need them on city councils, planning commissions, and economic development boards. That’s the evolution of this effort, and seeing veterans run in House districts is the result of years of hard work, particularly in the wake of a really destructive president.”
Reid, of the 90 for 90 Voter Registration Project, noted that the push to recruit military veterans as Democratic candidates in conservative districts is part of a broader strategy to increase Democratic turnout, not just flip seats. He emphasized the importance of offering voters a real choice, especially in areas traditionally dominated by Republicans.
“Given what’s going on in the national political world, it’s important for every Virginian to have a choice on the ballot,” Reid said. “Whether they want to vote for the Republican or the Democrat, that’s on them, but they should have the option to vote for either, especially when the party in control of the country right now is messing up so badly. There should be the option to send a message to the other party.”
Reid noted that in “super-Republican” districts, where Democrats often face significant challenges, some “remarkable” candidates are ready to take on the challenge. 
“It’s really interesting who will step up in these districts, where people have a really good reason to be fearful to run if they’re a Democrat. So who do we see stepping up in these districts? We see women stepping up. We see Black people stepping up, and we see military people stepping up.”
Reid believes these candidates can play a critical role in not just flipping seats but also in bolstering Democratic chances up and down the ballot.
But David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, remains cautious about the potential impact of veterans running as Democratic candidates in deeply Republican districts, such as the 39th. 
“I am hesitant to say that anything will help Democrats in a district like that, where more than two-thirds of the voters are Republicans,” Richards said. However, he acknowledged the strategic significance of candidates like Klotz, the special operations veteran.
Richards pointed to the success Democrats had with Eugene Vindman, a U.S. Army veteran, in the 7th Congressional District, though he noted that Vindman’s national profile made his candidacy an exceptional case. 
“If we start to see more moderate, former military folks run, that could spell trouble for Republicans in Virginia,” Richards explained. He added that with Trump losing the state by less than 6%, Virginia’s political landscape is still competitive, particularly in local races.
While District 39 may seem like an unlikely battleground, Klotz is gearing up for a different kind of fight.
“I have been in combat, and I did this for our country, and it feels like it needs to be done here too,” he said. “This time, I will be fighting for the rights of all Virginians.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Kevin Nance)For 236 years the United States has benefited from a government built on effective checks and balances among its three branches. 
Now our system is under attack by the head of one branch, who wants to discredit another branch, the judiciary. That branch is not designed for the political and public-relations combat that President Trump relishes, because it speaks slowly and deliberately, through rulings the other branches are supposed to respect. Trump and his minions show little respect, so we should be hearing more objections from the third branch, Congress — not just about Trump’s assault on the rule of law, but his abrupt changes in foreign policy and the chainsaw approach that he and the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, are taking to the executive branch.
We’ve heard little from Republicans who control Congress, because most fear Trump and Musk will fund challenges to them in the primaries of 2026. They also fear abuse that could rain down on them from Trumpist information sources, the sort of abuse that can incite violence; there’s been a surge in physical threats to members of Congress. Clearly, Republicans fear that if they confront Trump, he will end their political careers with his money and the hold he has on Republican voters.
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska (Official photo)
Says who? GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. When a reporter there asked her March 18 if she had been sufficiently outspoken about Trump and Musk, though she’s been one of the most outspoken Republicans, she said some important things, even about her Republican colleagues:
“I get criticized for what I say, and then get asked, ‘How come nobody else is saying anything?’ Well, figure it out. They’re looking at how many things are being thrown at me, and it’s like, ‘Maybe I just better duck and cover. That’s why you’ve got everybody just like, zip-lip, not saying a word because they’re afraid they’re going to be taken down, they’re going to be primaried, they’re going to be given names in the media. You know what? We cannot be cowed into not speaking up.”
Leading into that, she said, “I’m not going to compromise my integrity by hiding my words when I feel they need to be spoken. I’m gonna take the criticism that comes, and it may be that Elon Musk has decided he may take the next billion dollars he makes off of Starlink and put it directly against Lisa Murkowski. … But I’m not giving up one minute, one opportunity, to stand up for Alaskans. But I’ve got to figure out how to do that, and I need Alaskans’ help to tell me what they are feeling, so that I can help deal with that.”
So speaks a servant leader, who wants to hear from voters. That’s not the approach of most congressional Republicans, whose House leaders have advised them not to have in-person, town-hall meetings that could put them on the defensive. On March 22, an ad hoc, bipartisan group in Lexington organized a town hall and invited 6th District Rep. Andy Barr. He didn’t show, and claimed without proof that it was organized and attended by paid activists, the line House leaders are using. Organizers denied that, and the crowd of 900-plus seemed to be a true grassroots uprising.
One speaker was “lifelong Republican” Edwin Gibson, 70, who recalled serving along the Iron Curtain: “Congressman Barr, you are complicit in the betrayal of our democracy.” He told me that he was referring to Barr’s “support of this rogue president and this rogue president supporting the war criminal Putin and how offensive it is to me and every other soldier.”
  Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)
Barr seems to consider such events dangerous because he wants to run for U.S. senator and is desperate for the endorsement of Trump — who backed the only declared Republican candidate, Daniel Cameron, for governor in 2023 — or at least wants to keep Cameron or wealthy newcomer Nate Morris from getting the president’s backing. So, he does “tele-townhalls,” a form of conference calls (you sign up on his website), and appears before friendly audiences like the Lexington Chamber of Commerce.
A less likely Senate candidate is 4th District Rep. Thomas Massie, who exhibits no fear of Trump. After he was the only Republican to vote against the latest bill to keep the government open, Trump said “He should be primaried, and I will lead the charge against him.” Massie appealed for contributions, saying “Telling the truth can get you in hot water,” and reported a few days later that he raised $261,000 in three days, a record for him.
Massie’s strength comes from his constituents and the online supporters he has cultivated. Trump’s comes from his cultish followers and the big money allowed by the campaign-finance system that Sen. Mitch McConnell wanted. I wonder what he thinks about it now.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0605-1_DxO-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-03-28 05:57:58.013651

Travelers will likely get some help navigating their journey with technology developed by Virginia native Gladys West, who was key in creating the Global Positioning System (GPS). While sharing insights from her groundbreaking career, like many Virginia school kids, West, like many Virginia school kids, also had spring break top of mind. She said her favorite place in the state to visit with her late husband Ira West was Williamsburg.
“It has history to discover, outlets for shopping, good food and a quiet atmosphere,” 94-year-old West said in an interview. 
Born in Sutherland in Dinwiddie County, West is a pioneering mathematician who made valuable contributions to several technological advances that helped transform the way humans navigate the world and understand its dimensions. The state honored her with a resolution passed by the Virginia General Assembly in 2018. 
Beginning in 1956, West began to carve out her most notable work at the Naval Proving Ground, now called Naval Support Facility Dahlgren in King George County.
The second African American woman hired at Dahlgren and one of only four African American employees at the time, she was known for her skill in calculating complex mathematical equations and computer programming.

West excelled working on satellite geodesy, which is used to make measurements of the Earth, and other satellite measurements that contributed to the accuracy of GPS. The technology is now used in cars and on devices globally.
She also received commendation as the project manager for the radar altimetry data processing project of Seasat, the first satellite designed for remote sensing of the Earth’s oceans.
West retired with 42 years of service.
One of her earliest motivations to be successful was simple: keeping tidy. When West was young, she had to help out on her family’s farm even if it meant getting dirty, which she despised.
“I aspired to do something outside of farm work and I knew that having a good education would be the key,” West said. “That motivated me to do well in school so that I could get a scholarship and go to college. I had a great support system and many mentors along the way who kept me motivated.”
She graduated from Virginia State University with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, and earned her masters of public administration from the University of Oklahoma and a doctorate in public administration from Virginia Tech. Between her studies, West also taught in Sussex County. Today, she continues to be recognized for her work. She published her memoir “It Began with A Dream” in 2020.
 Spring break travel outlook

Motoring around Virginia during spring break should be a relief to drivers, compared to a year ago.
According to AAA, the state average for a gallon of gas has dropped from last year’s $3.45 to $2.96. The national average is $3.15 as of Thursday.
Clean car drivers are subject to paying an average of 34 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity in Virginia and nationwide.
Juliana Thomas, a spokeswoman for Virginia Tourism Corporation, home of Virginia Is For Lovers, said “Virginia absolutely shines in the springtime.” Thomas touted several areas as great spring break destinations including Alexandria, named one of the Top Spring Travel Destinations by NBC, and Williamsburg, home to Busch Gardens — one of two theme parks in the commonwealth.
“From vibrant cities to charming historic towns, breathtaking outdoor escapes, and family-friendly coastal getaways, the commonwealth offers a diverse array of getaway options, with something that will appeal to every traveler,” Thomas said.
West said it’s always refreshing to hear how her work is now being used outside of the government and said she is still amazed by the technological advancements navigation has made since the GPS Project began in 1973.
“It never gets too old,” West said. “I am just so pleased that I was able to make a contribution. When I was working, I never imagined that the GPS would be used in the civilian world. I love seeing all the ways that it can be used and I probably have no idea how vastly used it is.”

Crosby (D-St. Mary's) said a tech tax will hurt businesses such as his that do federal contracting. Last week, on the same day a budget agreement that included the tax was announced, Crosby moved his business to Virginia. (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Del. Brian M. Crosby (D-St Mary’s) is vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee — a panel that handles many business issues — as well as the owner of a small business that is a subcontractor on Defense IT contracts.
Until last week, that business was based in Maryland.
But Crosby was already in the process of moving his business to Virginia last week when the governor and legislative leaders announced a budget deal that includes a 3% tax on IT, among other services, a tax that critics say poses an existential threat to businesses such as Crosby’s that contract with federal agencies.
“I listened to the announcement in the truck,” he said, describing the move that came on the same day as the budget announcement.
“I’ve raised these issues,” Crosby said. “I don’t know what to say. I think people are still convinced that you’re getting 50 cents of $1 or something.”
Instead, he said the tax would mean businesses such as his would lose money on every transaction.
“All I can say is you’re not taking 50 cents on $1,” Crosby said. “You’re taking $1.50 from $1.”

Crosby told his story Tuesday, minutes after his Democratic colleagues muscled through a two-bill spending plan on a preliminary vote. That plan includes the tax on data and IT services that is expected to raise nearly $500 million annually, part of the $1 billion in new revenues — and $2.5 billion in spending cuts — needed to close a $3 billion gap in the fiscal 2026 budget.
Crosby noted the irony of the situation. Gov. Wes Moore (D) and other legislators say they want to grow private industry and attract IT jobs to the area. One of the largest components of that industry are the numerous defense facilities in the state — Patuxent River, Fort Meade, Fort Detrick and others.
“On one hand, we’re saying we’re the IT-cyber corridor,” said Crosby. “On the other hand, the industry, which I’m a part of, is saying if you’re in the DoD [Department of Defense] segment, which is the state’s number one industry, you can’t make it on that (tax).
“The commercial companies, they can pass it off,” he said. “It’s not the same for the DoD guys, especially the smaller guys, it’s not as easy.”
Smaller companies such as Crosby’s often work as subcontractors to large prime contractors that are based out of state and, thus, not subject to the proposed tax, that is soon to head to the Senate. Subcontractors based in Maryland are not exempt.
Crosby’s five-year old company — he asked that it not be named — has been growing. He has a warehouse location in Georgia, where he plans to register his company while keeping a small presence in Maryland and a new office in Virginia Beach.
The new out-of-state company will deliver on its contracts as before to its larger prime, typically exempt, contractor partners that will deliver services to the federal facilities in Maryland.
“We know the numbers,” Crosby said when asked about how the change would affect companies that do the same type of contracting. “All I can say is that within a year, we’d file for bankruptcy.”
So Crosby acted fast. The House and Senate have an agreement on the tax. Delaying a move would mean needing more trucks, as materials needed for third-quarter projects are soon to arrive. There’s also the matter of bidding on future contracts.
Delaying a move was too risky, Crosby said.
Crosby may not be alone in his move should the tax pass as expected. The state Cybersecurity Association Inc. estimated that about 800 businesses similar to Crosby’s could be affected by a services tax. The Maryland Chamber of Commerce estimates more than 15,000 businesses, which employ an estimated 100,000 people, would be subject to the new tax.
During Tuesday’s floor debate in the House, Republicans tried to strip out the IT services tax — one of more than a dozen failed amendments offered during a sometimes testy four-hour debate.
Del. Todd Morgan (R-Calvert and St. Mary’s) stood feet away from Crosby as he described the choice faced by his Democratic colleague.
“Now I’m going to bring this home, ladies and gentlemen, to this room, to our colleagues, to one of my friends on the other side of the aisle,” Morgan said. “That individual is moving his business to Virginia.
“I’ll say this again, one of the colleagues in this room, who’s our friend on the other side of the aisle, is moving his business to Virginia as we speak,” he said. “So I just want that to sink in when we look at how big this picture is.”

(Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Health insurance for millions could vanish as states put Medicaid expansion on chopping block

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
‘Are nursing homes our only option?’ These centers offer older adults an alternative.

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

Fodera sobbed on phone calls with her parents. Between the fellowship application and scientific review process, she had spent a year of her life securing the funding, which helped pay for her study of the biomechanics of uterine fibroids — tissue growths that can cause severe pain, bleeding and even infertility. Uterine fibroids, an underresearched condition, impact up to 77 percent of women as they age.
“I’m afraid of what it means for women’s health,” Fodera said. “I’m just one puzzle piece in the larger scheme of what is happening. So me alone, canceling my funding will have a small impact — but canceling the funding of many will have a much larger impact. It will stall research that has been stalled for decades already. For me, that’s sad and an injustice.”
Fodera’s work was a casualty of new federal funding cuts at Columbia University, one of several schools targeted by the Trump administration. The administration is also reducing the workforce at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the agency that oversees public health research, while trying to slash NIH funding to universities.
Researchers say threats to federal research funding and President Donald Trump’s promise to eliminate any policy promoting “diversity, equity and inclusion” are threatening a decades-long effort to improve how the nation studies the health of women and queer people, or improve treatments for the medical conditions that affect them. Agency employees have been warned not to approve grants that include words such as  “women,” “trans” or “diversity.”
That could mean halting efforts to improve the nation’s understanding of conditions that predominantly affect women, including endometriosis, menopause, infectious diseases contracted in pregnancy and pregnancy-related death. It could also stall research meant to treat conditions such as asthma, heart disease, depression and substance abuse disorders, which have different health implications for women versus men, and also have outsized impacts on LGBTQ+ people and people of color — often underresearched patients.
“I want every generation to be healthier than the last, and I’m worried we may have some real setbacks,” said Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, a professor and clinician at Johns Hopkins University who studies the consequences of pregnancy-related infections and the causes of birth defects.










If we no longer include women or females in our research, we’re obviously going to go back to not having answers that are going to be applicable to both sexes. And I think that’s a big step backward.


– Jill Becker, University of Michigan neuroscientist



The United States already lagged in promoting scientific inquiry that considered how sex and gender can influence health — and has a recent history of focusing research on White men. Less than 50 years ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) actively discouraged researchers from including women who could become pregnant in clinical trials for new medical products, leaving it often unclear if U.S.-based therapeutics were safe for them. It wasn’t until 1993 that clinical trials were legally required to include women and “individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.”
Around that same time, the federal government launched offices within the NIH, the Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA that focused on women’s health and research. Since then, efforts to consider gender in medical research have progressed, if unevenly. A report last fall from the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine found that in the past decade, the level of federal funding devoted to women’s health had actually declined relative to the rest of the NIH’s budget.
The report, requested by Congress, also found that researchers still struggled to understand the implications of common conditions such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids, the long-term implications of pregnancy, or gender gaps in mental health conditions — all areas where Black women in particular experience worse health outcomes or face heightened barriers to appropriate treatment. Investments had stalled in looking at how sex and gender interact with race or class in influencing people’s health outcomes.
The report ultimately called for an additional $15.8 billion over the next five years to address the gaps. Now, efforts to cut federal research funding and limit its acknowledgment of gender could thwart forward momentum.
“If we are banning this study of these issues, or deciding we’re not going to invest in that work, it freezes progress,” said Alina Salganicoff, a lead author on the report and vice president for women’s health at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.
Already, researchers whose work touches on sex or gender are anticipating losses in federal funding, which they fear could imperil their work moving forward. Some have already had their grants terminated. Many specified that they were not speaking as representatives of their employers.
Whitney Wharton, a cognitive neuroscientist at Emory University, learned on February 28 that she would no longer receive federal funding for her multi-year study looking at effective caregiving models for LGBTQ+ seniors at risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Research suggests that queer adults may be at greater risk of age-related cognitive decline, but they are far less likely to be the subject of research.
Wharton is one of numerous scientists across the country whose work was terminated because it included trans people, per letters those researchers received from the NIH. “Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans,” the letter said.
Though Wharton’s work focused on queer adults, it proposed caregiving models that could apply to other people often without family support structures who are at heightened risk for Alzheimer’s as they age.
“The sexual and gender minority community is more likely to age alone in place. We’re less likely to be married or have children,” Wharton said. “These additional roadblocks are not only unnecessary but they are unnecessarily cruel to a community that’s already facing a lot of hardship.”
One of Wharton’s collaborators on the study is Jace Flatt, an associate professor of health and behavioral sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who also received separate notice from the NIH that their research beyond the study had been terminated. Flatt studies LGBTQ+ people and their risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, as well as thinking about their needs for care.
Flatt said NIH funding for three of their studies have been canceled in recent weeks, as well as a Department of Defense-funded grant looking at veterans’ health that included LGBTQ+ people. The defense letter stated the research did not align with Trump’s executive order that recognizes only two sexes, male and female.
Flatt estimates about $4.5 million in federal funding was cut from their research, requiring some staff layoffs.
“I made a personal commitment to do this work. Now I’m being told, ‘Your research doesn’t benefit all Americans, and it’s unscientific,’ and basically that I’m promoting inaccurate research and findings. The tone comes across as like it’s harmful to society,” they said. “I’m a public health practitioner. I’m about improving the health and quality of life of all people.”
Jill Becker, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, uses rodent studies to better understand how sex differences can affect people’s responses to drug addiction and treatment. Her work has helped suggest that some forms of support and treatment can be more effective for male rats and others for female ones — a divide she hopes to interrogate to help develop appropriate treatments for people who are in recovery for substance use disorder, and, in particular, better treatment for cisgender men.
Becker’s studies were singled out in a Senate hearing by Rand Paul, a Republican, who characterized it as the type of wasteful research that shouldn’t continue. Because she looks at sex differences, she anticipates that when her NIH funding finishes at the end of the year, the agency will no longer support her — a development that could eventually force her lab and others doing similar work to shut down entirely.
“If we no longer include women or females in our research, we’re obviously going to go back to not having answers that are going to be applicable to both sexes,” she said. “And I think that’s a big step backward.”
The NIH did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In interviews with The 19th, academics broadly described a sense of widespread uncertainty. Beyond federal funding, many are unsure if they will still be able to use the government-operated databases they have relied on to conduct comprehensive research. Others said the NIH representatives they typically work with have left the organization. Virtually all said their younger colleagues are reconsidering whether to continue health research, or whether a different career path could offer more stability.
But the Trump administration has remained steadfast. In his recent joint address to Congress, Trump praised efforts to cut “appalling waste,” singling out “$8 million to make mice transgender” — a framing that misrepresented studies involving asthma and breast cancer.
The government’s rhetoric is now deterring some scholars from certain areas of study, even when they recognize a public health benefit. One North Carolina-based psychologist who studies perinatal mental health and hormone therapy for menopausal people said her team had considered expanding their research to look at that treatment’s mental health implications for trans people.
“It’s important, and I don’t have any way of doing that work at the moment,” said the psychologist, who asked that her name be withheld from publication because she fears publicly criticizing the NIH could jeopardize research funding. “There is potential for that line of research in the future, but not in this funding environment.”
The concerns spread beyond those who receive government funding. Katy Kozhimannil, a public health professor at the University of Minnesota, doesn’t receive NIH support for her research on pregnancy-related health and access to obstetrics care in rural areas. Her work has looked at perinatal health care for Native Americans, including examining intimate partner violence as a risk factor for pregnancy-related death. The findings, she hopes, could be used to help develop policy addressing the fact that Native American and Alaska Native people are more likely to die during pregnancy than White people.
But future studies may not be possible, she fears, because of an interruption in data collection to PRAMS, a comprehensive federal database with detailed information about Americans’ pregnancy-related health outcomes. Within the first weeks of the new administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reportedly told state health departments to stop collecting data to maintain the system, while saying that it will be brought back online once it is in compliance with the new government diversity policies.
Kozhimannil and other scholars in her field are worried about what that means — and whether PRAMS will continue to publish information showing outcomes by race or geography. Those would be tremendous omissions: A vast body of data shows that in the United States, Black and American Indian women are at elevated risk of dying because of pregnancy. People in rural areas face greater barriers to reproductive health care than those in urban ones. Without the information PRAMS is known for, Kozhimannil said, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to conduct research that could address those divides.
It’s not clear if or when that information will be available, she added. One of her doctoral students requested access to PRAMS data in January and has still not heard back on whether it will be made available to her — a delay that is “not normal,” Kozhimannil said.
“It’s hard to imagine getting toward a future where fewer moms die giving birth in this country, because the tools we had to imagine that are not available,” she said. “I’m a creative person and I’ve been doing this a while, and I care a lot about it. But it’s pushing the boundaries of my creativity and my innovation as a researcher when some of the basic tools are not there.”
Paul Prince, a spokesperson for the CDC, acknowledged “some schedule adjustments” to PRAMS to comply with Trump’s executive orders, but claimed it does not affect the program’s continuation. He added: “PRAMS was not shut down.”
“PRAMS remains operational and continues its mission — identifying issues impacting high-risk mothers and infants, tracking health trends, and measuring progress toward improving maternal and infant health,” he said in an email.

It’s unclear the scope of long-term ramifications to health research, but Kathryn “Katie” Schubert is tracking it closely. She is the president and CEO of the Society for Women’s Health Research, an organization that has advocated on decades of congressional policy. In 2005, the group released a report that found just 3 percent of grants awarded by NIH took sex differences into consideration.
In February, her organization and other groups sent a letter to the administration highlighting the need to continue prioritizing women’s health research.
“We have gotten to the point where we know what the problems are. We know where we would like to try to solve for — so how are we going to find these solutions, and what’s the action plan?” she told The 19th.
In the past, Trump has shown a willingness to address women’s health inequity in at least in some arenas. A 2016 law, signed by former President Barack Obama, established a committee on how to better incorporate pregnant and lactating people into clinical trials. Trump continued that work under his first administration.
Still, when pharmaceutical companies began developing vaccines against COVID-19 in 2020, they at first did not include pregnant or breastfeeding people in clinical trials, despite federal policy encouraging them to do so and data showing that pregnant people were at higher risk of complications from the virus. Those same vaccine trials also initially excluded people who were HIV positive — a policy with particular ramifications for trans people, who are living with HIV at a higher rate than cisgender people — and only changed their policy after public outcry.
Trump returned to power on the heels of a renowned federal focus on women’s health research and gender equity. In 2023, President Joe Biden announced the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research to address chronic underfunding.
During his final State of the Union address, Biden called on Congress to invest $12 billion in new funding for women’s health research. He followed that with an executive order directing federal agencies to expand and improve related research efforts.
In December, former First Lady Jill Biden led a conference at the White House where she highlighted nearly $1 billion in funding committed over the past year toward women’s health research. She told a room that included researchers: “Today isn’t the finish line; it’s the starting point. We — all of us — we have built the momentum. Now it’s up to us to make it unstoppable.”
The Trump administration rescinded the council that oversaw the research initiative. The press office for the Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Schubert said prioritizing women’s health has bipartisan support, and she remains hopeful of its popularity across both sides of the aisle. She also recognizes it could mean a new era of investment sources.
“We’ll continue as an organization, of course, with our partners, to work to fulfill our mission and to advocate for that federal investment and to make sure that the workforce is there and make that policy change. We’ll do that under the best of times and the worst of times,” she said. “But I think when we think about sort of the broader community — we’ve seen other philanthropic organizations come in and say, ‘OK, we’re ready to partner and really make this investment on the private side.’”
Women’s health research has more visibility than ever, and not just because some high-profile celebrities and media personalities are investing time and money toward addressing it. Social media algorithms are also increasingly targeting messaging around women’s health and wellness. Economists estimate that investing $350 million in research that focuses on women could yield $14 billion in economic returns.
“Yes, we are in a very difficult time when it comes to the federal budget,” Schubert said. “Even in spite of that, there will be opportunities to see this issue continue to rise to the top.”
The speed and scope of those opportunities may not extend to researchers like Flatt in Nevada. They plan to appeal their NIH funding cuts, but they don’t feel optimistic — in part because the letters state that no modifications of their projects will change the agency’s decision.
Flatt noted that in recent weeks, some people have suggested that they exclude transgender people from their studies. Flatt said excluding people of all genders is not pro-science.
“I refuse to do that,” they said. “The administration is saying that it needs to be for all Americans. They are Americans.”
Fodera, the Columbia doctoral student, will continue her research on uterine fibroids for now, due partly to timing and luck: The fellowship had already paid out her stipend for the semester, and her adviser pooled some money together from another source.
But the future of her fellowship is in question, and such research opportunities are closing elsewhere. Fodera is expected to graduate in a few months, and plans to continue in academia with the goal of becoming a professor. She’s looking for a postdoctoral position, and is now considering opportunities outside of the United States.
“This is really going to hurt science overall,” she said. “There is going to be a brain drain from the U.S.”

And until Tuesday, the meetings inside had been regular and unremarkable. Each month, the local chapter of the League of Women Voters has hosted a listening session with the town’s political representatives, and each month, residents have shuffled in to hear the latest updates from the State House and Executive Council.

Then, on March 20, both of Peterborough’s Democratic representatives voted to support a bill that would roll back certain anti-discrimination protections for transgender people in the state, surprising many. House Bill 148 allows businesses and government agencies to separate bathrooms, locker rooms, prisons, and other facilities based on biological sex at birth, undoing portions of a gender identity rights bill passed in 2018. The Democrats, Jonah Wheeler and Peter Leishman, had bucked their party to support the bill and drew an emotional response; half of the Democratic caucus walked out of the House chamber during a speech by Wheeler defending his vote.
On March 25, the Peterborough library room was overflowing.
Throngs of residents packed into seats and spilled out into the adjoining hallway, taking turns at the microphone to chastise Wheeler. A smaller group, consisting largely of advocates visiting from out of state, appeared supportive of Wheeler. Reporters lined the room and onlookers held up phones, recording each interaction. Wheeler attended the meeting and fielded questions; Leishman did not show up. 
Many said they felt hurt and betrayed by Wheeler’s vote. Some applauded it. And others used the opportunity to ask Wheeler to which side he belonged. 
“I am a Democrat,” Wheeler said, his voice raised. 
The question highlighted a growing national rift for Democrats. In a year in which President Donald Trump and Republican state lawmakers have taken actions against laws and policies allowing access to gender-affirming care and other gender identity protections, some Democrats are breaking away to speak against those protections, and urging their party to do the same. Others in the party, including most gathered in the Peterborough library, have denounced those Democrats and accused them of selling away commitments to LGBTQ+ people to win over certain voters.
Wheeler received the brunt of that backlash Tuesday, including from the Peterborough Democratic town committee, whose members wrote Wheeler and Leishman an official letter expressing “deep concern and disapproval” in their votes.
“You are the only two Democrats in support of this bill that undermines our party’s fundamental commitment to equal rights and protections for all citizens,” said Dan Gross, a member of the executive committee, reading the letter to Wheeler. “While we respect your rights to vote your conscience, our conscience calls us to publicly voice our opposition.” 
Wheeler says he voted in favor of the bill to protect spaces for cisgender women, and said that their right to a space to themselves — without transgender women — should be respected. The bill would not require that businesses, organizations, or government entities separate bathrooms or locker rooms based on biological sex, but it would give them the option to do so.
“I did represent my constituents, because there were women in this town who told me that they don’t feel safe in their spaces anymore,” he said. “Despite what this crowd might say, I’m supposed to just label all those women as transphobic? These are Democratic women who have been called a Republican.” 
On Thursday, Wheeler also voted in favor of House Bill 377, which would bar doctors from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy to anyone in the state under 18. He was joined by Democratic Rep. Dale Girard of Claremont; Leishman voted no. 
Wheeler argued Democrats’ stance on some of the gender identity legislation has been intractable, and has hurt the party’s standing with cisgender women. 
His stance comes as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Massachusetts U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton, both Democrats, have attracted attention for speaking out against the participation of transgender girls on girls’ sports teams. Moulton has argued that Democrats’ focus on transgender rights in the context of sports teams has cost the party votes. 
During Tuesday’s meeting, Wheeler also sought to highlight his more mainstream Democratic legislative priorities, including his support for a moratorium on new landfills in the state, a bill banning glue traps, and another bill regulating leachate, sometimes referred to as “trash juice.”
But many participants said they were focused on Wheeler’s vote on the rollback of gender identity protections. And they said they felt he had ignored their previous attempts to speak to him. 
One transgender woman, who identified herself as Jane, said she had grown up with Wheeler. “While you were running, I urged you as a friend to do everything in your power to push back against the anti-trans rhetoric and stop laws like these from passing,” she said. “And you promised me that you would fight for us.” 
“…You gave me hope, and then you stabbed me in the back,” she said.
Another woman, who called herself Elizabeth, asked a basic question. “I think you know your constituents,” she said. “I believe that you do. Why did you vote in a manner that would upset us?”
Wheeler said he had also heard from women who feared attacks by transgender women in bathrooms and wanted the bill to pass.  
“I voted for this legislation knowing, yes, that it would be controversial, and that’s why I gave my speech. Because I wanted to try to explain to my constituents why … after extensive listening to both sides, I would (vote the way) I did.” 
But where Wheeler called for a change in direction for the Democratic Party, another Democratic official present, District 2 Executive Councilor Karen Liot Hill, argued the party has a duty to continue supporting transgender rights and to oppose the Republican bills.
“One of the real challenges right now is that this discussion about women’s spaces and women’s safety in bathrooms is distracting from the real dangers that women face,” Liot Hill said. “As someone who has experienced domestic violence as both a child and as an adult, I can tell you firsthand that it was not in public bathrooms that I was unsafe. It was in my family. It was in my home.” 
Members of an out-of-state advocacy group called the LGBT Courage Coalition — who were in the state to testify and support legislation banning gender-affirming care for minors — showed up in support of Wheeler, applauding some of his statements and using the microphone to voice their own thoughts. 
“One of the reasons people come to shout at him is so others will see it and feel afraid to say anything,” one member of the coalition, Cori Cohn, who is transgender and from Indiana, said in an interview after the meeting. 
Peterborough is a Democratic stronghold: Democrat Kamala Harris won the vote for presidency with 69 percent of the vote in 2024; in the same election, Democrat Joyce Craig won 63 percent of the vote for New Hampshire governor. 
But it remained an open question whether Wheeler would face consequences from his constituents for his votes on bills affecting trans people. Wheeler is not new to the controversy: In 2024, he gave a similar speech on the House floor in support of House Bill 619, a bill to ban certain gender transition surgeries for minors. At the time, he was one of 12 Democrats who joined Republicans in supporting the bill; the bill has since become law.
While that speech and vote received criticism, Wheeler was reelected months later, nearly tying Leishman with 39% of the vote in November.
Still, Wheeler himself says his vote this month has inspired the most blowback yet. And he said he isn’t sure whether his standing in the House Democratic caucus would improve. Many fellow representatives appeared visibly angry with him as they walked out of the chamber March 20.
Outside of the Peterborough library, some advocates were in tears after the meeting. One attendee, Carter Hammond, said he has known Wheeler and believes Wheeler is using the transgender rights issue to distinguish himself with an eye to future political gain. 
“He sort of stumbled on a golden egg with this,” Hammond said. 
For his part, Wheeler says he doesn’t know if he is going to run for reelection in 2026, he said to reporters Tuesday. But at one point during the town hall, he appeared defiant.
“Vote me out,” he told residents at the town hall. “Do whatever you want to me. But let’s move past these divisive conversations and try to have a real conversation.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3426-2-1024x554.jpg,,,2025-03-28 05:57:58.013651

It’s the fifth such report the group has published. ACLU Chief Lobbyist Gary Daniels said over that ten year stretch more than 500 measures expanding incarceration have been filed and 76 of those have become law.
“I started with the ACLU of Ohio back in 1995,” he said. “Our prisons were overcrowded then. Here we are 30 years later, and they remain above capacity.”
According to the report, Ohio’s prisons were built to house roughly 37,000 people, but as of December 2024, there were 45,490 people behind bars, or more than 120% of capacity.
What ‘pipeline’ bills look like
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Lawmakers filed nearly 80 proposals in the last General Assembly that create a new criminal offense, enhance the punishment for an existing one, or expand the scope of who can be charged. The ACLU classifies these as pipeline bills.
Of those, the governor signed 14 into law. Daniels explained those measures operate on two tracks — the micro and the macro. But both contribute to mass incarceration.
On the macro side, he pointed to House Bill 230, which after failing last session has returned as House Bill 88. The bill increases drug trafficking penalties with a specific emphasis on fentanyl.
“It’s not a popular bill to oppose,” Daniels acknowledged. “We get that.”
“The legislators are absolutely right and correct to be concerned about and searching for solutions and a way out of this,” he argued. But increasing penalties in 27 areas while adding more mandatory minimums isn’t the right approach with an already overburdened prison system.
At the same time that lawmakers advance wide-ranging sentencing changes they also regularly file narrower knee-jerk-reaction bills.
“Certain issues make the headlines and boom, all of a sudden, you’ve got legislation to address it,” Daniels described.
“In Ohio this most recent legislative session,” Daniels continued, “it was catalytic converter thefts and increasing the penalties for that. It was increasing penalties for retail thefts, assaults on sports officials and referees.”
Scope and stakes
The share of bills filed each session that would increase incarceration is relatively small. In the most recent General Assembly, the 79 pipeline bills represented just 7.5% of the total. The 14 signed into law account for only 1.3%.
But with the added dimension of time, Daniels argued, those proposals pile up, and they have a meaningful impact on prison populations.
When lawmakers see a problem, they often respond by increasing punishments. But understanding how their limited provision on catalytic converters fits into a broader program of mass incarceration isn’t always obvious.
“Term limits are certainly a factor here,” Daniels said.
“They learn this over time,” he explained. “And sometimes you get people who are well positioned to make an impact and really start fundamentally getting this issue, and then they’re right back out of office.”
The consequences of that steady accumulation, Daniels said, show up in the state capital budget.
“You have counties and cities that have been lining up, quite literally at the Statehouse to get new and additional funding to both build new jails and to renovate existing jails,” he explained.
In the last capital budget, lawmakers earmarked $50 million for local jails and more than $250 million for improvements to state prisons.
The ACLU report also highlights some positive moves from lawmakers. One example was legislation reducing the use of driver’s license suspensions as a form of punishment. Another directs state corrections officials to help those preparing for reentry to get documents, like a Social Security card, birth certificate or ID card, they’ll need to get a job.
But even these bright spots are bittersweet.
Lawmakers continue to “address the back end of this problem,” Daniels explained. “What are we doing with people already in prison, in jail, in the criminal legal system instead of looking at, and making those efforts, and turning that focus to can we keep them from getting there in the first place?”

Consider the following situation. You’re a middle-aged transgender man who transitioned decades ago. You’re balding, have a beard, and would never in a million years be confused for a woman.
Unfortunately, and bizarrely, however, this makes some North Carolina Republican state legislators uncomfortable, so they want to force you to use women’s restrooms.
Seriously. That’s what they’re seeking to do in a recently introduced Senate bill that would reprise the disastrous HB 2 debacle from a decade ago.
Under the bill, among other things, if a public facility allows a trans person to use a restroom that doesn’t match the gender on their birth certificate, it can be sued for damages and forced to pay untold sums of money.
And it’s hard to overstate just how cruel and ridiculous this is.
The bottom line: It’s been years now since North Carolina last ventured down this road and the opponents of trans rights have yet to document a single credible harm that legislation like this would address.
If ever there was ill-conceived proposal in search of a non-existent problem, this is it.

But services like contraception, STI testing, and preventative health screenings are also at risk with Trump administration plans to freeze “family planning” grants in Ohio and across the country.
At risk is funding through Title X, a federal pot of money that goes to clinics that “have played a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and preventive health services,” according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
A 2023 annual report from HHS’ Office on Population Affairs on the Title X program lists services provided under the grants, including FDA-approved contraception, pregnancy testing and counseling, “assistance to achieve pregnancy,” infertility services, sexually transmitted infection services and other “preconception health services.”
“Title X services are client-centered, culturally and linguistically appropriate, inclusive, trauma-informed and provided in a manner that ensures equitable and quality service delivery consistent with nationally recognized standards of care,” the annual report stated.
As part of a whirlwind of efforts to cut government spending, the Trump administration reportedly wants to freeze more than $27 million in grants from the program.
That cut would have the largest impact on Planned Parenthoods across the country, which receive $20 million of that funding.

In a March memo, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America underscored the importance of Title X funding, saying its clinics were the largest Title X provider in 2018, the year before the first Trump administration, serving 40% of patients under the program.
The group left the program in 2019, but came back in 2021 after former President Joe Biden rolled back some Trump-era policies.
“If Planned Parenthood patients can’t get quality, affordable health services … there would be grave nationwide consequences,” the memo stated.
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio was one of the recipients of Title X grants in 2024, when it was awarded $1.98 million. The Ohio Department of Health also received a Title X grant that year of nearly $7 million, about the same amount as it received in both 2023 and 2022.
“Any insinuation to take away critical family planning services from people with lower incomes to afford Trump’s tax cuts to billionaires is dangerous and unprecedented,” Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio said in a statement to the Capital Journal.
The group said they served 600 fewer patients than the Ohio Department of Health in 2023, but did it “for $5 million less in Title X funds.”
“Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio will continue to fight for our right to be a trusted, safety net provider in reproductive health care services like birth control, cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, among other Title X-eligible services.”
In their most recent annual report, the organization reported more than 66,700 visits to their health and surgical centers, providing care for 47,480 patients between 2022 and 2023.
Of those visits, the group provided 86,346 tests for sexually transmitted diseases, administered 16,817 pregnancy tests, served 11,803 patients for contraception-related care and conducted 9,340 HIV tests. The facilities also had 7,734 preventive care visits, 7,136 telehealth visits and 3,255 visits regarding gender-affirming care.
At the greater Ohio arm of Planned Parenthood, 56% of the patient base lives at or below 200% of the federal poverty line. That’s $62,400 for a family of four. Seventy four percent are between ages 18 and 34, 85% identify as female and 46% of patients rely on Medicaid for care, according to the annual report.
The Ohio-based group receives 12.4% of its revenue through state and federal grants, with Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements making up 17.7% of revenue and 14.5% of funds coming from private or commercial insurance payments.
The main source of revenue for Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio in 2022-2023 was individual, institutional and “legacy giving.” It made up 35.3% of the agency’s revenue stream.
As for spending that money, the annual report stated that 80% of the expenses are for program services, including the health services at clinics, education and outreach, and government and community relations. Another 14% went to management and “general” expenses, with 6% going to fundraising over that period.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine discussed higher education, the Cleveland Browns stadium, and LGBTQ policy during the most recent Columbus Metropolitan Club weekly forum.
Statehouse News Bureau reporter Jo Ingles asked DeWine several questions during Wednesday’s hour-long forum and here is a rundown of what the governor had to say:
Higher Education 
Ohio lawmakers recently passed Senate Bill 1 — a massive higher education bill that would, among other things, ban diversity and inclusion and prohibit faculty from striking. DeWine received the bill Wednesday and has 10 days to sign the bill into law or veto it. If DeWine vetoes the bill, lawmakers would need a three-fifths vote from each chamber to override it.

“I made it clear I probably will sign the bill, but I want to go through this bill again and and take a look at it,” DeWine said. 
College students and faculty have said the bill will harm higher education in Ohio. 
“It wouldn’t be the first time that something gets passed and everybody looks at it six months later or a year later and says, ‘Hey, that wasn’t what we intended, or it didn’t turn out the way we wanted to,” DeWine said. “I think with any bill …  we should always be open to re-examining everything.” 
Students, faculty are asking Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to veto massive higher ed overhaul bill

DeWine’s budget would continue the Governor’s Merit Scholarship, which gives the top 5% of each high school graduating class a $5,000 scholarship each year to go to an Ohio college or university.
“We want to keep our top kids in the state of Ohio,” DeWine said. “The data clearly tells us that if you go to school in the state of Ohio, you have dramatically increased your possibility of getting your first job in the state of Ohio and actually staying in the state of Ohio.”
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship was enacted through the last state budget two years ago. Ohio’s high school graduating class of 2024 included 6,250 eligible students and about 76% of them accepted the scholarship, DeWine said earlier this year when he introduced his budget. 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship is estimated to cost $22.7 million for fiscal year 2025. It would cost $47 million for fiscal year 2026 and $70 million for fiscal year 2027, according to the governor’s proposed budget. 
The budget is currently going through the Ohio House and it will be sent over to the Ohio Senate before going back to DeWine. He must sign it by July 1. 
K-12 school funding
DeWine danced around a question about funding for K-12 schools and if schools will have enough money. The governor’s budget would decrease funding for traditional public schools by 0.9%, according to a workgroup analysis. Voucher programs including the private school program would see a 15.8% increase.  
“The state legislature is going to decide, maybe with some input from me, they’re going to decide what that formula is,” DeWine said.
House Speaker Matt Huffman has called the current formula “unsustainable.”
Cleveland Browns stadium 
DeWine’s proposed budget would double the tax on sports betting from 20% to 40% with the proceeds going to fund professional sports stadiums and Ohio youth sports. Doubling the tax on sports betting would generate between $150-$180 million per year, he said. 
Nearly all gambling in Ohio is done online and “99.5% of the money goes to out-of-state gaming companies who don’t employ anybody in the state of Ohio,” DeWine said. 
Gambling companies pay the sports-betting tax, so DeWine said the increased tax would not affect bettors.
“It’s going to be paid directly by the companies that are outside the state of Ohio,” he said. “This is money that’s on the table … We’re crazy if we don’t do this.”
This proposal comes as the Cleveland Browns are asking the state to help cover a quarter of the estimated $2.4 billion cost of building a new domed stadium in Brook Park, about 20 minutes away from their current stadium downtown. 
“I don’t think we can afford to continue to go into the general fund of our budget and take this money,” DeWine said. “This money directly competes against education. It directly competes against mental health, drug addiction, all these things that we actually need money to try to help people achieve their ultimate goals.”
How to fund professional sports stadiums will continue to come up with other teams throughout the state, he said. 
“This is not just a question about the Browns, it’s a question about every other stadium,” he said. “This will permanently solve our problem. If we don’t do this every legislature, every governor in the future is going to have to face the challenge of do we put $20 million here? Do we put $40 million here for this stadium or that stadium?”
Lawmakers are trying to give $600 million to the Browns by issuing bonds to build the new stadium. DeWine avoided directly answering the question of if he would line-item veto that proposal if it ended up in the budget. 
“We have a long way to go,” he said. “We haven’t seen the House budget yet, let alone the Senate.”
LGBTQ policy 
DeWine signed a bill into law last year prohibiting transgender students from using school bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity. Despite this, DeWine was adamant during Wednesday’s forum that Ohio does not have an anti-LGBTQ climate. 
“This is a state that welcomes everyone,” DeWine claimed, “And we want you to come to the state of Ohio. We want you to feel welcome here.”

The Buckeye State is known for its water benefits, dentist Dr. Matthew Messina said.
“We’ve had that kind of a profound increase in public health that comes from modern dentistry and fluoride is a part of that,” Messina said.
Naturally occurring in water, fluoride is a mineral that years of research has shown strengthens teeth and prevents cavities and tooth decay. As the four-decade-long serving dentist explains, most public water systems add fluoride.
“It’s hailed as one of the top public health measures in the last century, because really, for a very low cost and very low amount of effort, the massive benefit that this produces for the community is tremendous,” he said.
He has worked in communities that didn’t have fluoride, he said, and the difference between children from cities and ones from rural areas that didn’t have public water fluoridation was night and day.
“We got a chance to see rampant dental decay in children,” he said. “It was like going back to the dark ages, so I really hope we’d never go back there again.”
There has always been a back-and-forth for decades on fluoride, much like vaccines. In recent years, there has been a campaign to push back on the mineral in water.
Although U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not a doctor, he has claimed that the mineral is toxic.
“Fluoride is an industrial waste,” he wrote on X.
The effort has trickled down to Ohio.
State Rep. Levi Dean, R-Xenia, has proposed House Bill 182, which would ban public water systems from adding fluoride.
“It just says that individuals can then choose whether they want to ingest it or not — it’s not forced on them,” Dean told me.
Current law requires water systems to fluoridate water if the natural content is less than .8 milligrams per liter.
“It’s just for some people for health reasons or just even for individual freedom reasons, they don’t want the local governments to force this into their drinking water,” he said.
Dean and his GOP cosponsors want to prohibit this. He argued that fluoride is bad for you. We asked him where he got this idea from since dozens upon dozens of research papers for decades disagree.
He cited a recent research study sharing that fluoride may be linked to lower IQ in children.
A study published by JAMA Pediatrics in January did a review and meta-analysis of whether exposure to fluoride was associated with kids’ IQ scores.
The authors found that there is a link between slightly lower IQ in children that have more exposure to the mineral.
But Messina explained that this research article is being taken out of context.
“It brings up a study of parts of the world where naturally occurring fluoride levels are much higher than in most of the United States, and they’re higher than the target levels that we have set,” the dentist said.
Looking into the paper, the authors acknowledged that a majority of the studies they looked at were considered “highly biased,” none of the data is from the United States, and that there was “uncertainty in the dose-response association.”
When the fluoride in the water was less than 1.5 mg/L, the link wasn’t apparent. As mentioned, Ohio has a cap of .8 mg/L.
“Now, there’s disagreement on the concentration of where that starts and how, but that’s why I think it should be up to the individual to choose what levels they engage with fluoride at,” Dean said.
The lawmaker argued that if people really want fluoride, they can buy toothpaste, tablets, or drops.
“I’m not arguing with the fact that it could be beneficial to some people for dental health,” he said. “I’m arguing with the fact that should we be ingesting it, if the benefit is for your teeth, shouldn’t you be applying it just to the teeth and not consuming it?”
Toothpaste has significantly more fluoride than water does, which is why you are told to spit it out, according to the CDC.
The Republican continued that this is about Ohioans having a choice — just like he does, as he uses fluoride-free toothpaste.
“What kind of concerns do you have with Ohio considering to remove fluoride from all public water?” we asked Messina.
“Well, if Ohio did that, we would be stepping back in time,” he responded. “We have a known beneficial, preventative part of our tool kit, and for us to continue to go forward without that — we’re really leaving one of our best weapons behind.”
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, seemed interested in the proposal because when asked if the state should keep fluoride in public water, he acknowledged that he “didn’t know.”
“Fluoride naturally occurs in water, I just found that out this week,” he said. “They started adding it.”
He said that people over the past few years have been “dismissed.”
“Now there appears to be some science that says too much fluoride, including adding fluoride, is bad for folks,” he said. “I’m not a scientist, I’m not a chemist… We’re going to sort of litigate that question… in the legislature here over the next couple of months. I don’t know the answer to your question.”
House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, whose background is in public health, was not thrilled to hear about the bill.
“I entirely support fluoride in water,” she said, noting that the benefits are clear in dental health.
We asked her if she saw this as an effort to privatize water.
“I see this as a basic human right,” she continued. “I think the expectation of every household in this country is that you have access to clean tap water in your households.”
Gov. Mike DeWine, who is routinely against non-doctors making health decisions, is not commenting on this bill yet.
Knowing the governor, this would not be out of the realm of a possible veto. He consistently states that he supports science, vaccines, best practices of doctors in gender-affirming care, prevention of tobacco for kids and the stopping of medical misinformation.

Another proposed energy-saving program is on the chopping block in Ohio.
Duke Energy Ohio quietly dropped plans late last year to roll out a broad portfolio of programs that would have boosted energy efficiency and encouraged customers to use less electricity during times of peak demand. The plans, which would have saved ratepayers nearly $126 million over three years after deductions for costs, were part of a regulatory filing last April that sought to increase charges on customers’ electric bills.
The move came after settlement talks with other stakeholders, including the state’s consumer advocate, which opposes collecting ratepayer money to provide the programs to people who aren’t in low-income groups.
State regulators are now weighing whether to approve the settlement with a much smaller efficiency program focused on low-income neighborhoods.
The case is the latest chapter in a struggle to restore utility-run programs for energy efficiency after House Bill 6, the 2019 nuclear and coal bailout law that also gutted the state’s renewable energy standards and eliminated requirements for utilities to help customers save energy.
Studies show that utility-run energy-efficiency programs are among the cheapest ways to meet growing electricity needs and cut greenhouse gas emissions. Lower demand means fossil-fuel power plants can run less often. Less wasted energy translates into lower bills for customers who take advantage of efficiency programs. Even customers who don’t directly participate benefit because the programs lower peak demand when power costs the most.
Energy efficiency can also put downward pressure on capacity prices — amounts paid by grid operators to electricity producers to make sure enough generation will be available for future needs. Due to high projected demand compared to available generation, capacity prices for most of the PJM region, including Ohio, will jump ninefold in June to about $270 per megawatt-day.
“At a time when PJM is saying we’re facing capacity shortages, we should be doing everything we can to reduce demand,” said Rob Kelter, a senior attorney for the Environmental Law & Policy Center.
Since 2019, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio has generally rejected utility efforts to offer widely available, ratepayer-funded programs for energy efficiency. Legislative efforts to clarify that such programs are allowed under Ohio law have been introduced but failed to pass.
In the current case, Duke Energy Ohio, which serves about 750,000 customers in southwestern Ohio, proposed a portfolio of efficiency offerings that would have cost ratepayers about $75 million over the course of three years but created net savings of nearly $126 million over the same period.
The package included energy-efficient appliance rebates, incentives for off-peak energy use, education programs for schools, and home energy assessments. The company also proposed incentives for customers who let it curtail air conditioning on hot days through smart thermostats.
In November, Duke Energy Ohio filed a proposed settlement with the PUCO staff, the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, industry groups, and others. The terms drop all the programs for energy efficiency, except for one geared toward low-income consumers at a cost of up to $2.4 million per year. The Environmental Law & Policy Center and Ohio Environmental Council objected, as did a consumer group, the Citizens Utility Board of Ohio.
The PUCO will decide whether to approve the settlement plan by evaluating whether it benefits ratepayers and the public interest, whether it is the result of ​“serious bargaining” among knowledgable parties, and whether it violates any important regulatory principles or practices. Witnesses testified for and against the settlement at a hearing in January. Parties filed briefs in February and March.
Duke Energy Ohio argued in its brief that the settlement will still benefit customers and serve the public interest, even without the energy-efficiency programs for consumers who aren’t low-income. It also suggested that cutting out most of the energy-efficiency measures was needed to reach a deal with other stakeholders and the PUCO.
Staff at the PUCO said the settlement would benefit customers by cutting some projects and limiting how high other charges could go. They dismissed objections about dropping broadly available programs for energy efficiency. “[T]he standard is whether ratepayers benefit, not whether they could have benefitted more,” state lawyers wrote in their brief.
The Environmental Law & Policy Center, Ohio Environmental Council, and Citizens Utility Board of Ohio all argued there is no evidence to support dropping the energy-efficiency programs. They questioned the approach by a Consumers’ Counsel witness of counting only avoided rider costs as benefits, without considering the projected savings from energy efficiency.
The Consumers’ Counsel defended its perspective in an email to Canary Media. ​“We oppose subsidizing energy efficiency programs through utility rates when those products and services are already available in the competitive marketplace,” the office’s statement said. ​“And when the programs are run by the utility, there are added charges to consumers, such as shared savings and lost distribution revenue.” The statement also noted that other PUCO decisions have refused to allow energy-efficiency programs that would serve groups other than low-income households.
Last year, for example, the PUCO allowed FirstEnergy to run a low-income energy-efficiency program but turned down its proposal to include generally available rebates in a rider package. Those are ​“better suited for the competitive market, where both residential and non-residential customers will be able to obtain products and services to meet their individual needs,” the commission’s opinion said. The commission did, however, say the company should develop a rebate program for smart thermostats to help customers manage their energy use. FirstEnergy included that in its latest rider plan filed on Jan. 31.
Ohio has been particularly devoid of programs like those dropped in Duke’s settlement since HB 6 took effect, said Trent Dougherty, a lawyer for the Citizens Utility Board of Ohio. Calculations as of 2019 estimated the law’s gutting of the state’s energy-efficiency standard costs each consumer savings of nearly $10 per month.
“Continuing a pattern of wish-casting, that the market will provide the savings that HB 6 took away, is not a solution,” Dougherty said.

You have our permission. In fact, you have our encouragement.
Kansas Reflector’s explicit invitation — posted at the end of every news article and commentary — encourages everyone to steal our work. Please and thank you.
The notice reads, “Our stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. We ask that you edit only for style or to shorten, provide proper attribution and link to our website. AP and Getty images may not be republished. Please see our republishing guidelines for use of any other photos and graphics.”
The Reflector’s parent organization, States Newsroom, spreads this generous policy across its network of publications, from the Nevada Current to the Maine Morning Star. Thousands of stories on dozens of websites — for free.
Because Kansas Reflector allows all publications — from Yahoo News to the Peabody Gazette-Bulletin — to reprint its reporting and commentary, these words reach an audience that is often 10 to 100 times larger than a single publication.
Sometimes Reflector writings get printed on honest-to-goodness paper. This is a particular hoot for me when my hometown metro newspaper, the Kansas City Star, prints one of my columns. When they do, I know my wife’s eagle-eyed coworker will clip it out and send it along (Thanks, Dave).
Some folks, including me, believe that this republication policy is a central virtue, power and impact of these publications.
I have been writing for the Reflector since 2021 (141 columns and counting). Still, I have a bit of journalism vertigo when I explain this republication philosophy to others. The idea of giving away your intellectual work for free lacks a contemporary vocabulary. It’s not monetizing. We aren’t selling. No subscription required.
Because of the cognitive leap, I interviewed Sherman Smith, editor in chief of the Reflector and the person who approached me a few years ago in search of a new commentary writer. (I recruited myself.) If anyone understands the tensions and benefits of allowing other publications to republish the work of the Reflector staff, it’s Smith.
“We believe in doing journalism as a public good and making this accessible as part of our public service model,” Smith said. “We let everybody read us for free, and we let other publications republish us for free, because we want to get our work out to as broad of an audience as possible, and this allows us to do that.”
Smith’s data, provided to him in Google News alerts and weekly email reports, shows that more people than ever read the Reflector, whether through republication or on the Reflector’s website. February 2025, as a matter of fact, was the largest month for readership on the website, Smith said, besides the August 2023 readership spike from a particularly viral Kansas news story.
“What I see so often is this idea that news is dying, but the reality is we reach more people today than ever before,” Smith said.
A few decades ago, Smith continues, a brilliant story in a community newspaper might have been restricted to a local audience. Meanwhile, stories on the Reflector are both on the internet and without a paywall.
“Today, when we write that story, we reach a million people nationwide and even internationally,” Smit said. “It ripples across the globe in a heartbeat. That’s a very powerful thing.”
Of course, the benefits of a free product are easy to list for the consumer. Low-income readers can get their Kansas news for free. International readers who just want to read one story about Kansas don’t need to subscribe for $15 per month just for the privilege of reading one article that they might — or might not — like.
Smith also said that the Reflector’s growing readership forces some prominent people to agree to interviews. Kansas state representatives, for instance, know that their hometown newspaper is likely to run a free Reflector article — so they may feel pressure to be a source.
“Leveraging information,” Smith calls it. Of course, a complete report with relevant sources is another benefit for readers.
Many of my current and former University of Kansas journalism students have worked for the Reflector in one way or another. Smith sees the Reflector’s republication policy as serving these young journalists in particular.
“Part of our public service mission here is trying to work with the next generation of journalists to elevate them,” Smith said. “If you’re a young college student, you’re trying to establish a portfolio to take to an employer. You could write three stories for us and present it as three different publications, showing, ‘My work has been in Hays and Manhattan and Dodge City and Hutchinson, and not just the Kansas Reflector.’ ”
Like the young journalists Smith mentioned, many other journalists are obsessed by the impact that their work has. Why write if no one is reading? Why podcast if no one is listening? Why publish a photo if no one is looking?
In that way, the grand bargain that the Reflector has made with the world — that its reporting and commentary are free — reimagines the typical transactional relationship between a journalist and their audience.
My first days in journalism were during the 1990s at a series of community newspapers. The way that I knew people were seeing my work (back then, photojournalism) seems Andy Griffith-era folksy today. I would watch people — at coffee shops, at sporting events and in the local muffler shop — reading the headlines, their chins turned up in a skeptical expression that furrowed their brows.
The feedback on our work in the 1990s? They slung those jabs at us in a way that seems antiquated today: As I lugged camera gear into a high school basketball game, moms and dads would walk up to me, telling me exactly what the newspaper got right or wrong yesterday. Some, but few, would write letters to the editor.
The publisher of a newspaper in the 1990s had a pretty exact sense of how many people their paper reached. Simply track subscription numbers. Then, ask the circulation folks downstairs about single-copy sales at grocery stores and newspaper racks.
Modern journalism, especially when paired with the Reflector’s republication policy, upends this previous journalism world. It’s unlikely that you are reading this column on a printed page. It’s unlikely that you will run into me at your local hardware store. And my work — so tightly guarded by my first employers decades ago — is free for you here.
This limitless distribution of the Reflector’s content also sends me Google-ing for my headlines to discover who ran them. The publications in the search results form a motley parade of websites.
One of these online searches inspired me to write about our republication policy. A few months ago, I wrote about how Donald Trump’s make-up routine confused me. 
Like many pieces by the Reflector, my column was republished by Yahoo News. At the bottom was the biggest response I have seen to anything I have done in journalism, whether photography, editing or writing. I assure you it’s not my best writing.
Nevertheless, it found an audience. Yahoo recorded 2,200 comments in response to my column before it switched them off two days later. The first comment — “More unreadable Trump hating fake news from the lib infested fake news media” — sums up the comment-section death match between MAGA and the left, between real people in the heartland and bots in a server farm.
An audience like this — even if it’s not my dear neighbors — is part of what keeps me writing for the Reflector. I love knowing that you, dear reader, can critique my work without a subscription from just about anywhere on just about any website.
The bitter irony of writing this column about our republication policy: It’s perhaps the least likely column to demand republication.
As Kurt Vonnegut wrote: “So it goes.”

How did I know this? Well, my storytelling can be long-winded, but I’ll sum it up quickly for digital attention spans.
First Lesson: Quiet, Humble, Hardworking Appalachian
In 2009, I met a quiet, humble Ph.D. student at Louisiana State University’s Manship School of Mass Communication. He was sandy-haired, reserved, and from Core, West Virginia — deep in the heart of Appalachia. He was shy, humble, and quiet; when he spoke, I listened.
The day before I started my Ph.D. program, I was still working at an ABC television station, surrounded by outspoken quick storytelling personalities. Yet, this quiet soon-to-be scholar could hold his own when discussing gender issues. I was in my 30s, I felt well-versed in theory and research, and here was this guy who could match me in conversations about women’s issues. I thought, “Who is he?”
He had graduated from West Virginia University. He later told me when I began my program, he could see I had my guard up, a necessary skill honed from years as a producer in television news. If I hadn’t, I would have been run over by anchors who had been there since my childhood. But as time passed, he started talking to me more about our shared research interests. I started trusting him. Later, we got married.
Grew up in a Trailer Park, Hunted to Survive, and Limited Medical Care
Through Ben, I learned about Appalachia. During our first winter together, I visited the mountain trailer park where he grew up. There was no cell service, but my Boston Terriers were thrilled, finally having space to run free. I can still picture Bruno, the more bulldog-like of the two, cheeks flapping as he chased after a deer downhill.
Inside the trailer where Ben grew up, I found myself hesitant to use the bathroom under the gaze of a mounted deer head. I learned deer weren’t just eyeballs to frighten me but a necessity — a crucial food source for many families in Appalachia. Without it, there would have been nothing to eat. I learned he had collected cans as a kid for money. As far as medical care growing up, that meant butterfly bandages and dunking yourself in watered-down Clorox if you swam in something questionable.
Instilled with Grit, Dedicated to Family, and Stood Tall When Hard Times Hit
West Virginia was different to me as I wasn’t from there and I loved my visits because it was something I had with Ben. The simplicity, the absence of pressure, the joy of eating pepperoni rolls, and being surrounded by nature offered a sense of peace from our Ph.D. program.
And Ben had grit. I liked to think of him as a clutch. When things got tough, he could help get us through them. When we didn’t have enough money for rent in the summer during our Ph.D. program, he took a yellow book (yes, when people used to use those) and said I won’t be back until I have the rent money. When I was in a car accident because of the ice this winter, he put the pieces of my car back together himself in three days, while watching a five-year-old. He can fix anything. For example, a garage door piece needed replaced suddenly on his February birthday. It was single-digit temperatures, the wind whipped through the house because repair people couldn’t show up due to the snow. Along with this, he can Tetris anything into the car or other spaces and when things are really against the wall, he remains calm and figures it out. I attribute that to his Appalachian character.
Second Lesson: From LSU to Ohio U., Dr. Ralph Izard
My second lesson in Appalachia came from Dr. Ralph Izard, former director of the E.W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University; however, he was my professor at LSU. He founded the National Media Diversity Forum, and with a handshake, I promised to contribute to it forever. He taught me about the First Amendment, and I loved peeking into his office, where he would be eating his lunch — whatever he had grabbed from the fridge, including, on one occasion, a raw turnip. Dr. Izard became my dissertation area head for diversity — another West Virginian who broadened my understanding of interconnectedness, philosophy, and policy. He encouraged me to question how people were affected and to engage closely with communities when seeking answers.










Diversity wasn't just a buzzword — it was a commitment.


While at LSU, the Manship School was the first recipient of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication Equity & Diversity Award in 2009.
Third Lesson: Ohio U. Students Who Have Walked the Bricks Since 2017
My third lesson in Appalachia has been taught at Ohio University since 2017, my fourth university. Until I arrived, I hadn’t heard “food insecurity” used so frequently. Here, I saw firsthand how deeply poverty affects students and residents.
When I read about Ohio Senate Bill 1 and its potential impact, I think of Dr. Izard, Ben, and my students. Ben has taught cross-cultural communication, advocacy, and issues of gender, race, and class. Dr. Izard taught about the First Amendment and the philosophies that shape these conversations. Both are white, male Appalachians who have positively impacted lives — mine included. There are countless student letters to prove it.










If the resistance to diversity means that someone like me will never learn about Appalachia — if these experiences never influenced my understanding of rural poverty, resilience, and identity — then Ohio politicians are acting against the very people they profess to represent.


Because of these diverse experiences with Appalachians, I am a better person, researcher, and professor.
The funds that won’t be allocated to scholarships will directly affect Appalachian students. The opportunities that will vanish due to decisions made by those unfamiliar with higher education will only reinforce stereotypes about gender, race, and class in Appalachia. In the end, it is Appalachian students who will suffer the most.
At a time when the university adopted an interim policy to recruit (and I assume continue to maintain) those with disabilities and veteran status is essential to think who is impacted by DEI. As this interim policy adopted on Feb. 26, 2025 states:

“In compliance with requirements as a federal contractor, Ohio university will make lawful efforts to recruit persons with disabilities, veterans, and Vietnam era veterans, for position openings. In accordance with federal law and Chapter 124 of the Revised Code it is the policy of the university to engage in recruitment practices that yield the best applicants for vacancies.
This policy covers all faculty and staff positions at Ohio university.
This policy also establishes an official diversity statement to be utilized as appropriate during recruitment activity:
Ohio university is proud of its rich history and as part of our ongoing efforts to provide and support a transformative learning experience, we affirm our commitment to fostering a welcoming and respectful workforce and community. All qualified applicants are encouraged to apply and will receive consideration free from discrimination on the basis of age, ancestry, color, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, genetic information, military service or veteran status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, status as a parent or foster parent, or any other bases under the law. Ohio university is an equal access/equal opportunity employer.”

Diversity isn’t a threat to Appalachia. It is Appalachia.
The Importance of DEI in Healthcare and EducationLeanne Chrisman-Khawam, MD, MEd
By Leanne Chrisman-Khawam, M.D., M.Ed., Family Physician and Assistant Professor Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine Cleveland Campus, Medical Director Doctors on the Street
Recently, I started typing, “Whereas, the healthcare sector relies on DEI initiatives to cultivate a workforce capable of addressing the needs of diverse populations, and the prohibition of such initiatives may worsen existing health disparities among the elderly, rural and urban underserved communities, racial minorities, veterans, individuals with disabilities, food-insecure families, and women, thereby reducing healthcare access and quality of care.”
How do I know this? Well, I’ll sum it up as best as I can.
I grew up in a small town in Oregon. My dad was a seasonal entrepreneur who worked in construction — mainly paving. My mom stayed at home. My school didn’t offer many advanced courses, AP classes, or college credit programs. As a low-income white family, I benefited from DEI initiatives. A summer work program provided grants for employers to hire students like me. I worked with my family doctor, who introduced me to medicine. Without that experience, I might never have attended college, let alone medical school.
Despite my good grades, becoming a doctor wasn’t something my family considered possible. But here I am, 30+ years later — having spoken nationally and internationally, trained hundreds of medical professionals, and recruited students like me to address the shortage of primary care physicians.
Do I recruit them because they are DEI hires? No. They are bright, hardworking medical students. Do I prefer them because they remind me of myself? No. I prioritize them because research shows that when doctors share a background with their patients, health outcomes improve.
Why representation in health care matters
Building strong doctor-patient relationships leads to better care. I’ve seen this firsthand with my husband’s medical journey. He suffered a spinal cord injury ten years before we met, and three years ago, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. His condition has led to complications — pressure sores, infections, and worsening mobility.
When people first meet him, they love his warm smile and long, flowing white hair. (He’s often mistaken for Robert DeNiro — a compliment I take to heart!) But as soon as they see his confusion and inability to speak, they dismiss him. That is, until I share his story — how he lovingly cared for his mother, was an amazing father and respected disability advocate, and always supported my career. Suddenly, hospital staff treats him with the dignity and respect he deserves.
He is not alone in needing that dignity. Throughout our careers, we have worked to advocate for the forgotten — the poor, the immigrant, the disabled, the rural worker, and the veteran struggling with PTSD. Together, we created Doctors on the Street (DOTS) — a student- and resident-run program that provides medical care to individuals experiencing homelessness. These patients are often dismissed because of their appearance, yet they are people who have faced immense hardship—accidents, job loss, mental illness, or economic downturns.
Personal struggles and the bigger picture
Now, at the end of my husband’s life, I feel the weight of financial stress. His care is expensive, not covered by insurance, and I struggle to pay our bills. I may have to take out a mortgage to afford a new furnace and property taxes. I grew up in poverty, and I may return to it — not because of poor choices, but because of circumstances beyond my control.
Our government was created to serve its people. This country was built by immigrants, farmers, and laborers seeking freedom — of speech, of religion, of opportunity. My family came as those farmers and laborer and has fought to protect those freedoms in every American war since the Revolutionary War.










This is why I'm deeply concerned about Ohio Senate Bill 1. It does not protect freedom of speech, it limits it. DEI programs have been falsely portrayed as only benefitting BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals. In reality, diversity programs support everyone who lacks a voice — veterans, rural white communities, disabled individuals, and those facing food and housing insecurity.


Rather than focusing on what higher education shouldn’t do, our government should focus on what it can do to help people. When we invest in inclusion, we all do better. I have seen it firsthand.
We may not be able to fix everything, but we can each do something. That is far better than standing by and shouting at others about what not to do.

 Reporting Highlights


The Ohio Model: Rarely seen letters show how the voucher movement started in the 1990s as a concealed effort to finance urban parochial schools and expanded to a much broader push.
Helping the Affluent: An initiative promoted as a civil rights cause — helping poor kids — is increasingly funneling money to families who already easily afford private school tuition.
The Voucher Deficit: Expanding programs threaten funding for public schools and put pressure on state budgets, as many religious-based schools enjoy new largesse.

On a Thursday morning last May, about a hundred people gathered in the atrium of the Ohio Capitol building to join in Christian worship. The “Prayer at the Statehouse” was organized by an advocacy group called the Center for Christian Virtue, whose growing influence was symbolized by its new headquarters, directly across from the capitol. It was also manifest in the officials who came to take part in the event: three state legislators and the ambitious then-lieutenant governor, Jon Husted.

Jon Husted during the Ohio March for Life rally against that November’s Issue 1 reproductive rights amendment, October 6, 2023, outside the Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio.

After some prayer and singing, the center’s Christian Engagement Ambassador introduced Husted, asking him to “share with us about faith and intersecting faith with government.” Husted, a youthful 57-year-old, spoke intently about the prayer meetings that he leads in the governor’s office each month. “We bring appointed officials and elected officials together to talk about our faith in our work, in our service, and how it can strengthen us and make us better,” he said. The power of prayer, Husted suggested, could even supply political victories: “When we do that, great things happen — like advancing school choice so that every child in Ohio has a chance to go to the school of their choice.” The audience started applauding before he finished his sentence.
The center had played a key role in bringing about one of the most dramatic expansions of private school vouchers in the country, making it possible for all Ohio families — even the richest among them — to receive public money to pay for their children’s tuition. In the mid-1990s, Ohio became the second state to offer vouchers, but in those days they were available only in Cleveland and were billed as a way for disadvantaged children to escape struggling schools. Now the benefits extend to more than 150,000 students across the state, costing taxpayers nearly $1 billion, the vast majority of which goes to the Catholic and evangelical institutions that dominate the private school landscape there.
What happened in Ohio was a stark illustration of a development that has often gone unnoticed, perhaps because it is largely taking place away from blue state media hubs. In the past few years, school vouchers have become universal in a dozen states, including Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. Proponents are pushing to add Texas, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and others — and, with Donald Trump returning to the White House, they will likely have federal support.
The risks of universal vouchers are quickly coming to light. An initiative that was promoted for years as a civil ­rights cause — helping poor kids in troubled schools — is threatening to become a nationwide money grab. Many private schools are raising tuition rates to take advantage of the new funding, and new schools are being founded to capitalize on it. With private schools urging all their students’ families to apply, the money is flowing mostly to parents who are already able to afford tuition and to kids who are already enrolled in private schools. When vouchers do draw students away from public districts, they threaten to exacerbate declining enrollment, forcing underpopulated schools to close. More immediately, the cost of the programs is soaring, putting pressure on public school finances even as private schools prosper. In Arizona, voucher expenditures are hundreds of millions of dollars more than predicted, leaving an enormous shortfall in the state budget. States that provide funds to families for homeschooling or education-related expenses are contending with reports that the money is being used to cover such unusual purchases as kayaks, video game consoles and horseback-­riding lessons.
The voucher movement has been aided by a handful of billionaire advocates; it was also enabled, during the pandemic, by the backlash to extended school closures. (Private schools often reopened considerably faster than public schools.) Yet much of the public, even in conservative states, remains ambivalent about vouchers: Voters in Nebraska and Kentucky just rejected them in ballot referendums.
How, then, has the movement managed to triumph? The campaign in Ohio provides an object lesson — a model that voucher advocates have deployed elsewhere. Its details are recorded in a trove of private correspondence, much of it previously unpublished, that the movement’s leaders in Ohio sent to one another. The letters reveal a strategy to start with targeted programs that placed needy kids in parochial schools, then fight to expand the benefits to far richer families — a decadeslong effort by a network of politicians, church officials and activists, all united by a conviction that the separation of church and state is illegitimate. As one of the movement’s progenitors put it, “Government does a lousy job of substituting for religion.”

In the early 1990s, Ohio’s Catholic bishops faced a problem. For more than a century, religious education had been deeply entrenched in the state; in Cleveland, the parochial system was one of the largest in the country. For decades, though, the Church’s urban schools had been losing students to suburban flight. To keep up enrollment, many were admitting more Black students, often from non-­Catholic families. But these families typically could not afford to pay much, which put a strain on church budgets.
Catholic leaders elsewhere faced the same challenge, but Ohio’s bishops had an advantage. The new Republican governor, George Voinovich, was a devout Catholic who went to Mass multiple times a week, an expression of a faith that was inherited from his Slovenian American mother and deepened by the loss of his 9-year-old daughter, who was struck by a van that ran a red light. An unpretentious Midwesterner who loved fishing in Lake Erie, Voinovich had worked his way up from state legislator to mayor of Cleveland before becoming governor in 1991.
  “If we could reconstitute the family and get everyone into Church,” the late Ohio Gov. George Voinovich told the bishop of Columbus in a private letter years ago, “60% of the problems we are confronted with would go away.” (Credit: Najlah Feanny/Corbis/Getty Images.)
In office, Voinovich corresponded frequently with the state’s most prominent bishops, in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. Their letters, which are collected in Voinovich’s papers at Ohio University, show a close and collaborative relationship. The bishops wrote to thank Voinovich for the regular donations that he and his wife made to the church, which ranged as high as $2,000. They traded get-well wishes and condolence notes. “The last two times I’ve seen you you looked a little tired,” Voinovich once wrote to Anthony Pilla, the bishop of Cleveland. “Please take care of yourself.”



Most of all, they strategized about increasing state funding for Catholic schools. As a legislator, Voinovich had worked to launch a set of programs that helped private schools pay for administration, special education, transportation and other services. His support for these expenditures, which by the early ’90s amounted to more than $100 million, stood in contrast with his aggressive efforts to cut the rest of the budget. At one point, he banned peanuts and other snacks from official state flights. Legislators passed around a story about seeing him pluck a penny out of a urinal.
But Voinovich saw spending on parochial schools as fundamentally different, driven by his belief in the value of a Catholic upbringing. “If we could reconstitute the family and get everyone into Church, about 60% of the problems we are confronted with would go away,” he wrote to James Griffin, the bishop of Columbus. “I can assure you that the money you spend to deal with all the problems confronting the community is much better spent than the way government would spend it.”
Soon after Voinovich became governor, he and the bishops began discussing another way to fund Catholic schools: vouchers. The notion of publicly funded subsidies for private schools wasn’t totally new. After courts ordered school integration in the South, in the 1950s, some municipalities helped finance “segregation academies” for white students. At around the same time, the economist Milton Friedman argued that education should be subject to market forces, in part by paying parents to send their children to a school of their choosing. But no city or state had funded a true voucher initiative.
For the state government, there was an obvious risk to funding Catholic schools; the Ohio Constitution says that “no preference shall be given, by law, to any religious society.” Voinovich and his aides worried not only about political repercussions but also about the potential for legal challenges from groups like the ACLU. In April 1991, Voinovich intimated to Pilla that he was recruiting proxies who could obscure their alliance. “We are quietly lining up ‘heavy hitters’ in the business community and are trying to identify someone in the legislature who would be willing to become our advocate,” he wrote.
Voinovich had an ideal partner in David Brennan, a well-connected local businessman. A towering presence at 6-feet-5 (not counting his customary cowboy hat), Brennan had attended Catholic school in Akron before earning degrees in accounting and law, and made a fortune forming corporations for doctors seeking tax benefits. When Voinovich ran for governor, Brennan was a major fundraiser for the campaign. Now he started cultivating allies, donating heavily to a Republican from the Cincinnati suburbs who was a promising sponsor of voucher legislation, as reported by the Akron Beacon Journal, which covered the early voucher push.
In May 1991, Voinovich and Brennan met to discuss creating a commission on school choice, which Brennan would chair. Soon afterward, the bishops provided 18 suggestions for possible members. Six of them ended up on the commission — with no mention of the fact that they had been selected by the church.
As word of the commission spread, it raised concerns. The following spring, an executive at Procter & Gamble, one of the state’s largest employers, urged Voinovich to couch “this sensitive issue” in a broader effort at school reform. “Vouchers on their own could lead to unnecessary divisiveness,” he wrote. The head of the Ohio teachers’ union warned that unilateral action “could explode any chance at building a statewide consensus.” Voinovich responded that he was prepared for discord: “I am confident that whatever recommendations they come back with, it will be difficult for the Ohio Federation of Teachers to support.”
The commission was moving fast. Brennan “is doing an outstanding job,” Voinovich wrote to Pilla. “He is on a mission from God.” Voinovich and Brennan took care to disarm political objections. One briefing document argued that any plan the commission produced “must be substantially tilted in favor of low income ­parents and children” and must require private schools to administer the same ­proficiency tests as public schools. By year’s end, the commission produced its recommendation: Ohio should create a voucher pilot program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Representative C.J. Prentiss monitored the commission’s work with foreboding. Elected to the Ohio House in 1991, Prentiss had distinguished herself as a leading defender of public education and was steeped in the struggle for school integration. Her father had belonged to the Congress of Racial Equality, and after Prentiss graduated from Cleveland’s Marshall High School — where she was one of six Black students — she attended the 1963 March on Washington. Later, she joined local battles against school segregation, during which she met Michael Charney, a white teacher and union activist who became her third husband. She taught for a while in the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights and served on the State Board of Education. In 1993, she and other Black officials in Cleveland condemned Voinovich’s plan. “It is difficult to see how subsidizing private schools will improve public education,” she said. “Private schools have selective entrance requirements, serve only private purposes, and are not accountable to the public.”
Brennan deflected the criticism, noting that the plan was still provisional: “We believe when the education choice bill reaches the final stages, these fine legislators will feel differently than they do today.” In fact, he and Voinovich knew that it would be tough to secure backing for a stand-alone voucher bill; school board members, teachers and administrators were already sending letters to legislators to object. In May 1994, Voinovich contacted Brennan to strategize about how to slip a voucher pilot into the next state budget. “We are going to have to crawl before we walk,” he wrote. “I believe if we can really get it underway in one or two districts during my second term, we will have accomplished more than what [has] been accomplished thus far.”
A few weeks later, Voinovich’s assistant for education policy, Tom Needles, sent him a strategy brief on a forthcoming lunch with the bishops. “The Catholic Conference will continue to maintain a low profile in terms of its formal position on voucher legislation,” Needles wrote. “At the same time, the Conference recognizes that parent organizations in each diocese will play a very active role in lobbying for its passage.” On the last day of January 1995, voucher proponents paid for six buses to carry some 300 children and parents from Cleveland to the Capitol in order to lobby legislators. As parents walked from office to office in the Statehouse, one declared, “The public schools are preparing Black children for prison, the welfare office or the graveyard. As a Black parent, that’s unacceptable.”
Prentiss and a state senator from Cleve­land decided to address the throng. With the parents visibly angry, she knew better than to dismiss concerns about their children’s schooling. “There is a crisis,” she acknowledged. “The question before us is, how do we improve the public schools?”
The bishops, though, were far more organized, with efforts unfolding parish by parish across the state; a list in Voinovich’s papers records hundreds of phone calls and letters to legislators, making the case for vouchers and inviting them to visit local parish schools. Voinovich urged them to do still more. “I really need your help and would appreciate being kept informed as to what is being done so I can convey that to the leadership in both the House and Senate,” he wrote to Daniel Pilarczyk, the archbishop of Cincinnati, in February 1995. The next month, Pilarczyk responded with another list of the church’s actions, including some 20,000 letters sent to ­legislators.
Two weeks later, Voinovich let Pilarczyk know that the House had not only increased funding for Catholic schools but also authorized a “limited scholarship program in the City of Cleveland.” The program would start small, with several thousand vouchers worth about $2,200 apiece. Yet Voinovich recognized that it was a “significant pilot project.” At the time, the only other city that allowed private ­school vouchers was Milwaukee, and the initiative there had initially barred religious schools from participating. Cleveland’s program, in contrast, had been designed from the start to benefit Catholic schools.
In June, the budget won final approval. Six bishops wrote Voinovich to express their gratitude. “Everything we asked you to do was included in your budget,” they told him. “Without your leadership and gentle nudging of legislative leaders, none of this would have been possible.”
Prentiss and Charney quickly grasped the pilot’s import. “This is the beginning of the end for public education,” he told her, only half joking. Prentiss resolved to monitor the program to make sure that the money was spent as intended. After one voucher recipient, an Islamic school, was found to have housed students in unsafe buildings, she successfully sponsored a bill requiring schools that received vouchers to meet the same minimum standards as public schools.
Meanwhile, Prentiss kept pushing for public school reforms: all-day kindergarten, smaller classes, mentorships for at-risk boys. She and Charney were encouraged by test results showing that kids in public schools were performing at least as well as those with vouchers at Catholic schools.
In 1998, Voinovich was elected to the United States Senate; Needles, his aide, went to work as a lobbyist for Brennan. And the push for vouchers entered a new phase, as an aggressive generation of proponents took up a battle in the courts.
In both Ohio and Wisconsin, opponents, led by teachers’ unions, were challenging the programs on the grounds that they violated the separation of church and state. The Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld vouchers; a federal appeals court in Ohio ruled against them.
The U.S. Supreme Court took up a First Amendment challenge to vouchers, based on one of the Ohio cases, in February 2002. Robert Chanin, a lawyer for the National Education Association, told the court, “Under the Cleveland voucher program, millions of dollars in unrestricted public funds are transferred each year from the state treasury into the general coffers of sectarian private schools, and the money is used by those schools to provide an educational program in which the sectarian and the secular are interwoven.” Chanin noted that ­virtually all the students in the voucher program were attending religious schools, rather than secular private schools.
But Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the likely swing vote in the case, interrupted to pick up on a point made by a state attorney who’d defended the vouchers. In evaluating Cleveland’s choice program, shouldn’t the court consider not only private schools but also other options available to students, such as public magnet schools and charter schools?
The question caught Chanin off guard. The issue was the constitutionality of private school vouchers, yet O’Connor was evoking public school options. The state pressed its advantage, with its lawyer stressing the limited scope of the pilot: “It didn’t take too much money away from the public schools, but gave enough for a limited program that is targeted to the most needy, to the poorest of the poor.”
On June 27, 2002, the Court announced that it had ruled, 5-4, in favor of the Ohio program, arguing that it was “part of a broader undertaking by the State to enhance the educational options of Cleveland’s school children.” Clint Bolick, a leading lawyer on the pro-voucher side, declared on the Supreme Court plaza, “This was the Super Bowl of school choice, and the children won.” Later, he and others gathered at the office of the Institute for Justice, a conservative organization, and toasted with Dom ­Pérignon.

Prentiss was on vacation with Charney in Washington state when she got word of the ruling. “PBS NewsHour” invited her to come to a studio in Vancouver and record a response, but she was too upset to think about what she would say on camera. “I’m not going to be the one,” she told Charney. “Let them get a lawyer.”
After the Supreme Court ruling, the momentum in seeking alternatives to traditional public schools shifted to charter schools — publicly funded institutions that are administered separately from school districts. Many Democrats had championed charters in the ’90s as a more palatable way to offer school choice, and Republicans had adopted the idea, too; Brennan, the chairman of Voinovich’s school choice commission, launched a for-profit charter ­school venture.
In 2005, with charters threatening to cut into parochial school enrollment, Ohio’s Catholic bishops secured a crucial expansion of vouchers beyond Cleveland: a new statewide program called EdChoice, which offered vouchers to students assigned to schools that were judged to be failing, many of them in Columbus and Cincinnati.
Prentiss stayed in the legislature until 2006, becoming the second Black woman to serve as Senate minority leader. Up until the end, she led the resistance to vouchers. As she left the legislature, though, an impassioned advocate for vouchers came in: a Republican representative named Matt Huffman.
Huffman was a lawyer from Lima, a small industrial city in western Ohio. Like Prentiss, he had grown up among activists, but with different political aims. His father, a lawyer and a county prosecutor, took a case against a local cinema that was showing “obscene” movies all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court; his mother co-founded one of the state’s first pregnancy ­crisis centers after abortion was legalized.
Huffman was the fifth of nine children, all of whom went to Catholic schools. This was possible, he said later, because the parish schools were so affordable in those days. But, as tuition climbed (partly to cover the salaries of lay teachers who replaced nuns), the student body skewed wealthier. “The middle class was pretty much shut out of alternatives in education,” he told the Columbus Dispatch in 2022.
One of Huffman’s brothers became the principal of a Catholic elementary school. Huffman, after following his ­father into law, served as a fundraiser for Lima Central Catholic High. He also got involved in local politics, rising to president of the City Council. In 2000, he endorsed a young former Ohio State wrestling coach named Jim Jordan as he ran for the state Senate. Jordan, who is now one of the most stridently conservative members of the U.S. House of ­Representatives, later returned the favor by backing Huffman’s campaign for the state legislature.
By this point, school choice was becoming Huffman’s overriding priority. In Lima, he participated in a standing gin rummy game with the Rev. David Ross, a local Catholic priest, and Leo Hawk, the owner of a metal-forming company, who, in Ross’ recollection, repeatedly pressed Huffman on the issue. “Leo Hawk was very influential in terms of trying to inculcate him with ‘Let the parents decide where to spend their tax dollars,’” Ross told me. “Leo was very forceful in those gatherings.” (Hawk could not be reached for comment.)
During Huffman’s first four years in the legislature, the governor was a Democrat, and the focus was on protecting existing vouchers. But after the Republican John Kasich took office, in 2011, Huffman proposed a significant expansion: making vouchers available to middle-­class Ohio families, too, regardless of whether they were in a failing district. “This is starting down the path of looking at funding education in a fundamentally different way,” he said.
The proposal met with impassioned resistance. Opponents pointed to a ­report in the Plain Dealer that showed voucher students had performed worse than students at the public schools that they would have attended. Among the critics were public school administrators in Lima, where hundreds of students were already receiving vouchers because a few local schools were rated as failing. The exodus of students resulted in a loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars in state revenue. As Lima’s school superintendent at the time, Karel Oxley, explained to me: Even if a class lost students, the school still had to pay for their classroom and teacher. To complicate matters, the students who left tended to be motivated kids from stable families, while special-needs students stayed. This made it harder for public schools to improve their poor test scores. “You have to have your A-team to help the school be as good as possible, but the A-team moves over to the other school,” Oxley, who also served as president of the state superintendents’ association, said. “It’s almost impossible to catch up.”
Oxley is herself Catholic, and consults for a Catholic school in retirement, but she testified against vouchers at a committee hearing around this time. She recalled that Huffman was adamant. “There was nothing I could have said that would have allowed him to see that he might be stripping resources from the greater community,” she told me. “He said, ‘You pay taxes, I pay taxes. Why can’t my taxes go toward my children’s school?’ I said, ‘Because you chose that private school.’ He said, ‘That doesn’t make sense, Karel. My taxes should pay for my child’s education.’” (Huffman did not respond to requests for comment.)
Huffman settled for a partial victory: In 2013, the state allowed EdChoice vouchers for families with incomes up to twice the poverty line in any district. It was a step forward, but Huffman wanted the program to be available to wealthier families, and it would take another ally to help him realize his full ambition.

Phil Burress was always candid about what had brought him to Citizens for Community Values: He was a former pornography addict. Burress had fought the addiction from the age of 14, until he finally swore it off, at 38. “I became a Christian that day,” he told me. From then on, he said, he was a “better father and husband” and “started speaking out about things that are wrong.” His background gave him insight into the enemy. “You have to look at your communities through the eyes of a pornographer and stay ahead of them,” he once told reporters.
Burress, a former organizer with the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks, joined Citizens for Community Values in 1983. By then, the organization, which started as a Cincinnati prayer group, had devoted itself to fighting pornography and strip clubs, including various enterprises belonging to Larry Flynt, who launched his Hustler brand in Ohio. In 1990, it gained national prominence by leading the opposition to an exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs at Cincinnati’s Contemporary Arts Center. Not long afterward, Burress took over as president. “We are not some radical, right-wing, fundamental bunch of Bible-­thumping nuts out there yelling and screaming,” Burress said at the time. “We do our homework.”
The group grew under Burress — by 1997, it claimed to have 25,000 supporters — and started taking on nationwide causes, such as pressuring hotels to stop offering pay-per-view porn. In 2004, it led a successful petition drive for an amendment banning same-sex marriage in Ohio, a factor in George W. Bush’s narrow win over John Kerry there. “I was thinking, No way we can get that many signatures,” Lori Viars, a conservative activist in the Cincinnati exurbs, told me. “But we ended up doing it.”
The victory attracted more funding, which the group used to hire full-time lobbyists in Columbus. Its top issues were abortion, same-sex marriage, gay rights and, increasingly, school choice. Though the members were mostly evangelical, not Catholic, they shared the conviction that the public should pay for kids to attend religious schools. Still, Burress told me, the group struggled to persuade legislators to expand voucher access. “We could not get any traction whatsoever,” he said. What changed matters was “electing the right people to office.”
In 2017, Matt Huffman arrived in the state Senate. He had served the maximum eight years in the House and, like many other Ohio legislators, simply ran for the other chamber. In the Senate, school choice remained his primary cause. That year, he sponsored a bill to expand eligibility for vouchers to families that made as much as four times the poverty level. Catholic leaders were thrilled. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a legislator who did more for school choice,” a former employee of the Catholic Conference of Ohio, the church’s public policy arm, said. “He’s just been a rock.”
Huffman still faced resistance from public school officials, but he now had influential assistance from Citizens for Community Values. In 2016, Burress was succeeded by a new director, Aaron Baer, who signaled a more expansive mission. Baer was a 29-year-old graduate of Ohio University, a hip-hop enthusiast raised by a single parent. “This is a Christian conservative movement for the next generation,” he told the Dispatch. “We talk about poverty, human ­trafficking, opioids, while still talking about ­marriage.” The organization moved its headquarters to Columbus and gave itself a forthright new name: the Center for Christian Virtue. Burress welcomed the change. “I was glad to see them admit that without God we’re nothing,” he told me.

Baer and Huffman were unlikely ­allies. Huffman liked to do impersonations and had a profane streak; he was once forced to apologize for making an ­off-color joke at an office party. But on vouchers they were effective partners, with Baer far more willing to advocate in public than the bishops were. In the next couple of years, Baer fought to get the state to define “failing” schools as broadly as possible, and called out suburban districts, many of which opposed vouchers, when they resisted accepting students from struggling city schools.
By early 2020, Huffman was still trying to make the case for a major voucher expansion. That January, he met with a few dozen public school officials in western Ohio. Craig Kupferberg, the superintendent for Allen County, which includes Lima, told me that he’d raised his hand and asked Huffman, “Have you put anything in the bill to stop the David Dukes of the world from starting up their own private schools and having our tax dollars fund their hateful ideology?” Kupferberg recalled that Huffman had looked at him “like I was from outer space” and said, “What stops homeschooling parents from doing any of that?” (Never mind that vouchers weren’t going to home­schooling families.) Then Huffman embarked on a lengthy complaint about how many people viewed Catholicism as a cult.

Huffman’s proposal stalled again that term. But, two months later, the pandemic arrived and schools closed. After nearly a year, about a third of Ohio’s 609 districts still hadn’t returned to full in-person instruction. The holdouts included many of the largest districts, Cleveland and Columbus among them.
The state’s parochial schools, in contrast, had mostly reopened after a few months. The Catholic Conference of Ohio highlighted students’ educational gains in the legislature. “A lot of legislators appreciated what we did for children, because a lot of legislators were frustrated, too,” the former conference employee said. “We were sort of a beacon in the COVID era.” It helped proponents that many legislators had their own children in Catholic schools. Although Catholics account for only about 17% of the state’s population, they constitute more than half of the Senate and a third of the House.
As the pandemic wore on, school closures inspired similar outrage in other states. They “sparked a parent revolution, because families saw that school systems didn’t care about them all that much,” Corey DeAngelis, a leading voucher proponent, said on “The Megyn Kelly Show,” last May. “This is the silver lining of the pandemic.”
Many parents were alarmed by virtual instruction. It was not just that lessons conducted by Zoom seemed frustratingly inadequate; they also offered a glimpse of what their children were being taught, which in some families caused consternation over a perceived progressive agenda. Viars, the Cincinnati-area activist, noticed a surge of interest in Christian schools. “The books being pushed on these little kids were so objectionable,” she said. “It was really sexually explicit material for little kids. We heard that a lot: ‘No, these kids should not be seeing any of this.’”
In May 2021, two Republican representatives in Ohio introduced a “backpack bill,” which would give every ­family voucher money to spend as they saw fit: $7,500 for each high school student and $5,500 for each younger one. At a press conference announcing the bill, Baer stood beside its sponsors. “In the pandemic, we saw the need to have innovative and different learning environments,” he said. “You had some families who, because their local public schools decided not to open for in-person education, they were forced into an online environment that wasn’t ideal for them.”
The bill went a step further than Huffman had before; whereas he had pushed for vouchers for all but the wealthiest families, the backpack bill included everyone. It was a bold move, but proponents had a new advantage: earlier that year, Huffman’s Republican colleagues had elected him president of the Senate. In that role, not only was he able to push for vouchers — he could also block efforts to reform Ohio’s redistricting system, which had produced maps heavily slanted toward the GOP. By 2022, the Senate had 25 Republicans and eight Democrats; the House was split 64 to 35. “We can kind of do what we want,” Huffman told the Dispatch.
Yet Huffman and his allies decided not to advance the backpack bill through regular legislative channels, which would require stand-alone votes in both chambers. Opposition lingered, even within their own party: Some rural Republicans were conscious that there were few private schools in their districts, and so their constituents’ tax dollars would go toward vouchers used mostly by wealthy suburbanites. And, if more private schools did open in rural areas, that would drain enrollment from public schools that often served as centers of the community.
Instead, Huffman and his counterparts used a maneuver that would have been familiar to George Voinovich: they slipped an expansion of vouchers into the budget, a 1,200-page document that they sent to Gov. Mike De­Wine just before the deadline. Families with incomes of up to 450% of the poverty level would qualify for full payments: $8,407 for high school students and $6,165 for younger ones. These sums came close to covering tuition at many Catholic schools, and far exceeded what many public districts received in per-capita funds from the state. Even families making more than that income threshold, which was $135,000 for a family of four, would qualify for some funding. “Every student in Ohio will be eligible for a scholarship worth at least 10% of the maximum scholarship, regardless of income,” Huffman’s office said.
More than 30 years after Voinovich and the bishops proposed vouchers as a solution for underprivileged children in a single city, public subsidies for private ­school tuition were now universal in Ohio, covering tens of thousands of families. “We’re going to have the money to pay for it,” Huffman said afterward. “I hope more people take advantage of that if they want to.”
C.J. Prentiss died last April at 82. She had spent her retirement with Charney in a cottage on Lake Erie, in Ashtabula County. In her final years, declining health kept her from engaging much in the battle over public education. But she did have a confrontation with Huffman when she returned to Columbus for a Senate reunion in 2022. Several speakers had been chosen for the event, and when Prentiss saw that they were all white she asked Huffman about it. According to Charney, Huffman responded that he didn’t have enough time to line up others. “Don’t lie to me,” Prentiss said, and walked away.
That same year, a coalition of school districts, now numbering more than 200, filed suit against the voucher expansion. The suit alleged that the program exacerbated racial segregation, by essentially allowing private schools to select their own students; 90% of the new voucher recipients are white, in a state where only about two-thirds of students are. The suit also alleged that the vouchers violated two principles of the state constitution: a bar against religious control of public school funds and a promise of an adequate education for all. A judge denied the state’s motion to dismiss the case; a trial is expected in the coming months.
Among the districts that joined the suit is the one in Lima, Huffman’s home town. Virtually all the students enrolled in Catholic schools there now receive vouchers. Enrollment at these and other parochial schools has not increased dramatically; as is true across the state, they have limited capacity, so they accept only those students they prefer. This undermines the narrative that vouchers allow families to escape their public school. But public schools still suffer. Kupferberg, the superintendent, estimates that in his county the voucher expansion is costing schools millions of dollars a year. Federal pandemic relief aid has helped mitigate the damage, but that is coming to an end. “We’re starting to feel the impact,” Kupferberg said.
Meanwhile, some private schools are raising tuition, knowing that vouchers allow families to pay more. In Centerville, south of Columbus, the principal of Incarnation Catholic School told parents last year that it would no longer offer a discount for families that had multiple students enrolled there. “Our parishioner tuition rate is nowhere near the true cost to educate,” she wrote. “This increased revenue will allow us to increase teacher and staff salaries, address deferred maintenance, and hire additional staff.”
Huffman and his allies are pushing for more. Huffman (who has now moved back to the House, and was recently elected speaker) inserted funding for new construction at private schools into the last state budget, with an eye toward creating private school options in rural areas. Also on the table is legislation to create education-savings accounts for families with children in unregulated private schools that now can’t receive vouchers.
For these coming fights, the Center for Christian Virtue is stronger than ever. The organization has assembled a network of dozens of religious schools, which pay the center $5 per enrolled student, up to $3,000 per school, to lobby on their behalf. In effect, the state’s religious schools can now use some of the public money they receive to advocate for the flow of funding to increase.
Between 2020 and 2022, the center’s revenue more than tripled, to $4.2 million. It used some of the money to purchase two buildings opposite the statehouse — one previously owned by the Dispatch — for a total of $2.35 million, giving it space to accommodate a staff that has grown to 20. (The Center for Christian Virtue did not respond to a request for comment.)
In early October, the center held a policy conference, called the Essential Summit, at the Greater Columbus Convention Center. A main topic of discussion was Christian education, with sessions led by the executive director of the Center for Biblical Integration at Liberty University, the college founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. One session would address the question “How should we plan for teaching knowing that humans are inherently corrupt?” Another asked, “Why do Christian educators have the most dignifying approach to all humans?”
Huffman was slated to join a discussion with the president of Hillsdale College, a small Christian school in ­Michigan that has become a powerful incubator of conservatism. Also in attendance was Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, which produced the policy blueprint for the second Trump administration. The plan, called Project 2025, includes a strong endorsement of vouchers, and Roberts’ presence was an affirmation of Ohio’s role as a model for the school choice movement. In Florida, the number of voucher recipients approached half a million this school year, up 74%. (The state distributes the same voucher — about $8,000 — regardless of income.) In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott helped to defeat nearly a dozen anti-­voucher Republicans in state legislative primaries last year. He had $10 million in campaign funding from Jeff Yass, a Pennsylvania hedge fund billionaire who has made expanding vouchers his central policy goal.
At the convention center, conference staff turned me away, even though I had paid to register. I hung around as attendees emerged from the morning session, their tote bags filled with brochures for Christian schools, investing advice and health coverage. Many of the event’s discussions were aimed at religious schools that were now supported with public funds. But, as I was about to approach Roberts, security guards blocked the path and told me to leave.

This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra and Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th. Meet Shefali and Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Daniella Fodera got an unusually early morning call from her research adviser this month: The doctoral student’s fellowship at Columbia University had been suddenly terminated.
Fodera sobbed on phone calls with her parents. Between the fellowship application and scientific review process, she had spent a year of her life securing the funding, which helped pay for her study of the biomechanics of uterine fibroids — tissue growths that can cause severe pain, bleeding and even infertility. Uterine fibroids, an underresearched condition, impact up to 77 percent of women as they age.
“I’m afraid of what it means for women’s health,” Fodera said. “I’m just one puzzle piece in the larger scheme of what is happening. So me alone, canceling my funding will have a small impact — but canceling the funding of many will have a much larger impact. It will stall research that has been stalled for decades already. For me, that’s sad and an injustice.”
Fodera’s work was a casualty of new federal funding cuts at Columbia University, one of several schools targeted by the Trump administration. The administration is also reducing the workforce at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the agency that oversees public health research, while trying to slash NIH funding to universities.
Researchers say threats to federal research funding and President Donald Trump’s promise to eliminate any policy promoting “diversity, equity and inclusion” are threatening a decades-long effort to improve how the nation studies the health of women and queer people, or improve treatments for the medical conditions that affect them. Agency employees have been warned not to approve grants that include words such as  “women,” “trans” or “diversity.”
That could mean halting efforts to improve the nation’s understanding of conditions that predominantly affect women, including endometriosis, menopause, infectious diseases contracted in pregnancy and pregnancy-related death. It could also stall research meant to treat conditions such as asthma, heart disease, depression and substance abuse disorders, which have different health implications for women versus men, and also have outsized impacts on LGBTQ+ people and people of color — often underresearched patients.
“I want every generation to be healthier than the last, and I’m worried we may have some real setbacks,” said Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, a professor and clinician at Johns Hopkins University who studies the consequences of pregnancy-related infections and the causes of birth defects.

The United States already lagged in promoting scientific inquiry that considered how sex and gender can influence health — and has a recent history of focusing research on White men. Less than 50 years ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) actively discouraged researchers from including women who could become pregnant in clinical trials for new medical products, leaving it often unclear if U.S.-based therapeutics were safe for them. It wasn’t until 1993 that clinical trials were legally required to include women and “individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.”
Around that same time, the federal government launched offices within the NIH, the Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA that focused on women’s health and research. Since then, efforts to consider gender in medical research have progressed, if unevenly. A report last fall from the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine found that in the past decade, the level of federal funding devoted to women’s health had actually declined relative to the rest of the NIH’s budget.
The report, requested by Congress, also found that researchers still struggled to understand the implications of common conditions such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids, the long-term implications of pregnancy, or gender gaps in mental health conditions — all areas where Black women in particular experience worse health outcomes or face heightened barriers to appropriate treatment. Investments had stalled in looking at how sex and gender interact with race or class in influencing people’s health outcomes.
The report ultimately called for an additional $15.8 billion over the next five years to address the gaps. Now, efforts to cut federal research funding and limit its acknowledgment of gender could thwart forward momentum.
“If we are banning this study of these issues, or deciding we’re not going to invest in that work, it freezes progress,” said Alina Salganicoff, a lead author on the report and vice president for women’s health at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.
Already, researchers whose work touches on sex or gender are anticipating losses in federal funding, which they fear could imperil their work moving forward. Some have already had their grants terminated. Many specified that they were not speaking as representatives of their employers.
Whitney Wharton, a cognitive neuroscientist at Emory University, learned on February 28 that she would no longer receive federal funding for her multi-year study looking at effective caregiving models for LGBTQ+ seniors at risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Research suggests that queer adults may be at greater risk of age-related cognitive decline, but they are far less likely to be the subject of research.
Wharton is one of numerous scientists across the country whose work was terminated because it included trans people, per letters those researchers received from the NIH. “Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans,” the letter said.
Though Wharton’s work focused on queer adults, it proposed caregiving models that could apply to other people often without family support structures who are at heightened risk for Alzheimer’s as they age.
“The sexual and gender minority community is more likely to age alone in place. We’re less likely to be married or have children,” Wharton said. “These additional roadblocks are not only unnecessary but they are unnecessarily cruel to a community that’s already facing a lot of hardship.”
One of Wharton’s collaborators on the study is Jace Flatt, an associate professor of health and behavioral sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who also received separate notice from the NIH that their research beyond the study had been terminated. Flatt studies LGBTQ+ people and their risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, as well as thinking about their needs for care.
Flatt said NIH funding for three of their studies have been canceled in recent weeks, as well as a Department of Defense-funded grant looking at veterans’ health that included LGBTQ+ people. The defense letter stated the research did not align with Trump’s executive order that recognizes only two sexes, male and female.
Flatt estimates about $4.5 million in federal funding was cut from their research, requiring some staff layoffs.
“I made a personal commitment to do this work. Now I’m being told, ‘Your research doesn’t benefit all Americans, and it’s unscientific,’ and basically that I’m promoting inaccurate research and findings. The tone comes across as like it’s harmful to society,” they said. “I’m a public health practitioner. I’m about improving the health and quality of life of all people.”
Jill Becker, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, uses rodent studies to better understand how sex differences can affect people’s responses to drug addiction and treatment. Her work has helped suggest that some forms of support and treatment can be more effective for male rats and others for female ones — a divide she hopes to interrogate to help develop appropriate treatments for people who are in recovery for substance use disorder, and, in particular, better treatment for cisgender men.
Becker’s studies were singled out in a Senate hearing by Rand Paul, a Republican, who characterized it as the type of wasteful research that shouldn’t continue. Because she looks at sex differences, she anticipates that when her NIH funding finishes at the end of the year, the agency will no longer support her — a development that could eventually force her lab and others doing similar work to shut down entirely.
“If we no longer include women or females in our research, we’re obviously going to go back to not having answers that are going to be applicable to both sexes,” she said. “And I think that’s a big step backward.”
The NIH did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In interviews with The 19th, academics broadly described a sense of widespread uncertainty. Beyond federal funding, many are unsure if they will still be able to use the government-operated databases they have relied on to conduct comprehensive research. Others said the NIH representatives they typically work with have left the organization. Virtually all said their younger colleagues are reconsidering whether to continue health research, or whether a different career path could offer more stability.
But the Trump administration has remained steadfast. In his recent joint address to Congress, Trump praised efforts to cut “appalling waste,” singling out “$8 million to make mice transgender” — a framing that misrepresented studies involving asthma and breast cancer.
The government’s rhetoric is now deterring some scholars from certain areas of study, even when they recognize a public health benefit. One North Carolina-based psychologist who studies perinatal mental health and hormone therapy for menopausal people said her team had considered expanding their research to look at that treatment’s mental health implications for trans people.
“It’s important, and I don’t have any way of doing that work at the moment,” said the psychologist, who asked that her name be withheld from publication because she fears publicly criticizing the NIH could jeopardize research funding. “There is potential for that line of research in the future, but not in this funding environment.”
The concerns spread beyond those who receive government funding. Katy Kozhimannil, a public health professor at the University of Minnesota, doesn’t receive NIH support for her research on pregnancy-related health and access to obstetrics care in rural areas. Her work has looked at perinatal health care for Native Americans, including examining intimate partner violence as a risk factor for pregnancy-related death. The findings, she hopes, could be used to help develop policy addressing the fact that Native American and Alaska Native people are more likely to die during pregnancy than White people.
But future studies may not be possible, she fears, because of an interruption in data collection to PRAMS, a comprehensive federal database with detailed information about Americans’ pregnancy-related health outcomes. Within the first weeks of the new administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reportedly told state health departments to stop collecting data to maintain the system, while saying that it will be brought back online once it is in compliance with the new government diversity policies.
Kozhimannil and other scholars in her field are worried about what that means — and whether PRAMS will continue to publish information showing outcomes by race or geography. Those would be  tremendous omissions: A vast body of data shows that in the United States, Black and American Indian women are at elevated risk of dying because of pregnancy. People in rural areas face greater barriers to reproductive health care than those in urban ones. Without the  information PRAMS is known for, Kozhimannil said, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to conduct research that could address those divides.
It’s not clear if or when that information will be available, she added. One of her doctoral students requested access to PRAMS data in January and has still not heard back on whether it will be made available to her — a delay that is “not normal,” Kozhimannil said.
“It’s hard to imagine getting toward a future where fewer moms die giving birth in this country, because the tools we had to imagine that are not available,” she said. “I’m a creative person and I’ve been doing this a while, and I care a lot about it. But it’s pushing the boundaries of my creativity and my innovation as a researcher when some of the basic tools are not there.”
Paul Prince, a spokesperson for the CDC, acknowledged “some schedule adjustments” to PRAMS to comply with Trump’s executive orders, but claimed it does not affect the program’s continuation. He added: “PRAMS was not shut down.”
“PRAMS remains operational and continues its mission — identifying issues impacting high-risk mothers and infants, tracking health trends, and measuring progress toward improving maternal and infant health,” he said in an email.

It’s unclear the scope of long-term ramifications to health research, but Kathryn “Katie” Schubert is tracking it closely. She is the president and CEO of the Society for Women’s Health Research, an organization that has advocated on decades of congressional policy. In 2005, the group released a report that found just 3 percent of grants awarded by NIH took sex differences into consideration.
In February, her organization and other groups sent a letter to the administration highlighting the need to continue prioritizing women’s health research.
“We have gotten to the point where we know what the problems are. We know where we would like to try to solve for — so how are we going to find these solutions, and what’s the action plan?” she told The 19th.
In the past, Trump has shown a willingness to address women’s health inequity in at least in some arenas. A 2016 law, signed by former President Barack Obama, established a committee on how to better incorporate pregnant and lactating people into clinical trials. Trump continued that work under his first administration.
Still, when pharmaceutical companies began developing vaccines against COVID-19 in 2020, they at first did not include pregnant or breastfeeding people in clinical trials, despite federal policy encouraging them to do so and data showing that pregnant people were at higher risk of complications from the virus. Those same vaccine trials also initially excluded people who were HIV positive — a policy with particular ramifications for trans people, who are living with HIV at a higher rate than cisgender people — and only changed their policy after public outcry.
Trump returned to power on the heels of a renowned federal focus on women’s health research and gender equity. In 2023, President Joe Biden announced the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research to address chronic underfunding.
During his final State of the Union address, Biden called on Congress to invest $12 billion in new funding for women’s health research. He followed that with an executive order directing federal agencies to expand and improve related research efforts.
In December, former First Lady Jill Biden led a conference at the White House where she highlighted nearly $1 billion in funding committed over the past year toward women’s health research. She told a room that included researchers: “Today isn’t the finish line; it’s the starting point. We — all of us — we have built the momentum. Now it’s up to us to make it unstoppable.”
The Trump administration rescinded the council that oversaw the research initiative. The press office for the Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Schubert said prioritizing women’s health has bipartisan support, and she remains hopeful of its popularity across both sides of the aisle. She also recognizes it could mean a new era of investment sources.
“We’ll continue as an organization, of course, with our partners, to work to fulfill our mission and to advocate for that federal investment and to make sure that the workforce is there and make that policy change. We’ll do that under the best of times and the worst of times,” she said. “But I think when we think about sort of the broader community — we’ve seen other philanthropic organizations come in and say, ‘OK, we’re ready to partner and really make this investment on the private side.’”
Women’s health research has more visibility than ever, and not just because some high-profile celebrities and media personalities are investing time and money toward addressing it. Social media algorithms are also increasingly targeting messaging around women’s health and wellness. Economists estimate that investing $350 million in research that focuses on women could yield $14 billion in economic returns.
“Yes, we are in a very difficult time when it comes to the federal budget,” Schubert said. “Even in spite of that, there will be opportunities to see this issue continue to rise to the top.”
The speed and scope of those opportunities may not extend to researchers like Flatt in Nevada. They plan to appeal their NIH funding cuts, but they don’t feel optimistic — in part because the letters state that no modifications of their projects will change the agency’s decision.
Flatt noted that in recent weeks, some people have suggested that they exclude transgender people from their studies. Flatt said excluding people of all genders is not pro-science.
“I refuse to do that,” they said. “The administration is saying that it needs to be for all Americans. They are Americans.”
Fodera, the Columbia doctoral student, will continue her research on uterine fibroids for now, due partly to timing and luck: The fellowship had already paid out her stipend for the semester, and her adviser pooled some money together from another source.
But the future of her fellowship is in question, and such research opportunities are closing elsewhere. Fodera is expected to graduate in a few months, and plans to continue in academia with the goal of becoming a professor. She’s looking for a postdoctoral position, and is now considering opportunities outside of the United States.

The Judiciary Committee is hearing public testimony starting at 9:30 a.m. on Friday on seven of these bills, which comes after about two dozen people gathered at the State House on Wednesday for the annual “Hands Around the Capitol” lobbying effort, during which organizers also called on young people to get involved in the anti-abortion movement.
House Minority Leader Katrina Smith (R-Palermo) and Sen. Dick Bradstreet (R- Kennebec) spoke at the event, calling for federal intervention to provide resources for women facing unplanned pregnancies and the establishment of pregnancy resource centers. These centers, also called crisis pregnancy centers, often present themselves as a resource for pregnant people, but most are run by anti-abortion groups and do not provide or refer for abortion services.
Smith and Bradstreet framed the event as supporting women’s rights while providers say the legislation being advocated for would harm women.
“Mainers have made it clear that access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare is essential to their lives. Since the fall of Dobbs in 2022, they have twice elected a pro-reproductive rights majority to the statehouse,” said Maine Family Planning President and CEO George Hill in a statement to Maine Morning Star.
Hill said, on the other hand, the bills before the Legislature “would harm patients’ health by limiting access to essential sexual and reproductive health care.”
Overturning existing laws
The most extreme of the proposals comes from Rep. Abigail Griffin of Levant in LD 975, which would repeal the state laws authorizing abortion.
The bill would also change the definitions of “human being” and “person” within the Maine Criminal Code to include “all human beings beginning at the moment of conception.” These definitions would apply to the statutes prohibiting murder, assault, domestic violence assault and other offenses against a human being or a person.
In light of these changes, the bill would also repeal the crimes of elevated aggravated assault on a pregnant person and domestic violence elevated aggravated assault on a pregnant person. 
Other proposals take a more targeted approach by seeking to walk back abortion protections added in recent years. 
Maine shield law protecting reproductive, gender-affirming care takes effect Friday

LD 682 would alter the 2023 law that allows abortions late in a pregnancy if a doctor deems the procedure to be necessary. The bill would change the statute to only when it is “medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother,” rather than when a licensed physician determines it is necessary, or when “the fetus is diagnosed with a fetal anomaly that will, with a reasonable certainty, result in the death of the child within three months after birth.”
The bill would also reestablish criminal penalties for performing an abortion without a license or after viability as well as require that the report of abortions made to the state include the race, marital status and level of education of the person on whom the abortion is performed. 
It is sponsored by Sen. David Haggan of Penobscot and nine Republican co-sponsors, including Assistant Senate Minority Leader Matthew Harrington of York and Assistant House Minority Leader Katrina Smith of Palermo.
Lawmakers’ ongoing debates about MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, are also manifesting in abortion law. 
Rep. Reagan Paul of Winterport earlier attempted to remove coverage of abortion under MaineCare through a floor amendment in the two-year budget that failed.

Maine started requiring MaineCare coverage of abortion in 2019 and has seen proposals to repeal the law every session since. 
This session, that proposal is in LD 253, sponsored by Rep. Kathy Javner of Chester and co-sponsored by Paul and others. 
Medication abortion
Three bills directly discuss abortion by medication, but two specifically aim to restrict access to it. 
The vast majority of abortions in Maine last year used medication. Over 80% of Maine Family Planning patients, more than 60% of Mabel Wadsworth patients, and roughly 63% of Planned Parenthood of New England’s relied on medication abortion for procedures in 2024, according to the providers.
LD 866 would prohibit purchasing or obtaining any abortion drugs online. It would also require a licensed health care professional to oversee medication abortions in person. It’s sponsored by Griffin and seven Republican co-sponsors. 
LD 887 would make it a Class C crime — a low level felony, punishable by up to five years in prison — to provide or attempt to provide an abortion drug to a patient without physically examining the patient, being physically present for the abortion, scheduling a follow-up visit with the patient and providing them with a catch kit and medical waste bag. The bill also would also make manufacturers liable for the improper disposal of abortion drugs, with a civil penalty of $20,000.
LD 887 is sponsored by Paul and five Republican co-sponsors, including Griffin and Haggan. 
Particularly since the overturn in 2022 of Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that had established the right to abortion, there have been ongoing attempts to restrict medication abortion across the country, including efforts to reinterpret the dormant Comstock Act to criminalize the mailing of abortion-related drugs and legal challenges to the Food and Drug Administration‘s approval of mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion.
In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously rejected attempts to roll back access to mifepristone. 
Reproductive health providers call for more state funding as federal threats loom

While President Donald Trump has reinstated some of the anti-abortion policies from his first term, the president has yet to act on the FDA’s loosening of restrictions to accessing abortion pills since then. On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Trump’s pick for FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, who wouldn’t commit to specific action on mifepristone during his confirmation hearing, though he’s been public about his anti-abortion views. 
Informed consent 
Related to medication abortion, Paul proposed LD 1007, which would add to what health care professionals are required to inform a patient to obtain informed consent for such a procedure. 
Currently, medical professionals are required to inform the patient at least the following for all abortion procedures: that the person is pregnant, the number of weeks since the probable conception date, the risks associated with the pregnancy and abortion technique to be performed, and, at the patient’s request, alternatives to abortion such as adoption and information about economic assistance that can be accessed to help carry the fetus to term. 
The bill would add to this list, solely for medication abortions, “specific information about the potential ability of qualified health care professionals to reverse the effects of the abortion.”
Paul also proposed LD 1154, which would require that for all abortions, providers also inform patients about something called perinatal hospice services.
As defined by the bill text, these services mean comprehensive support after a prenatal diagnosis indicating the fetus has a life-limiting condition and may die before or shortly after birth.
The support would start from the time of diagnosis through the time of birth and death of the child, including counseling and medical care by maternal and fetal medical specialists — or also a member of the clergy, social worker or “specialty nurse focused on alleviating fear and ensuring that the woman and the woman’s family experience the life and death of the child in a comfortable and supportive environment.”

This article was originally published by Barn Raiser and Floodlight News.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced late Tuesday it will release previously authorized grant funds to farmers and small rural business owners to build renewable energy projects — but only if they rewrite applications to comply with President Donald Trump’s energy priorities.
The move has left some farmers perplexed — and doubtful that they’ll ever get the grant money they were promised, given the Trump administration’s emphasis on fossil fuels and hostility toward renewable energy.
Some of the roughly 6,000 grant applicants have already completed the solar, wind or other energy projects and are awaiting promised repayment from the government. Others say they can’t afford to take on the projects they’d been planning unless the grant money comes through.
Ohio businesses were promised funding for solar but worry the Trump administration won’t pay

A Floodlight analysis shows the overwhelming majority of the intended recipients of this money reside in Trump country — congressional districts represented by Republicans.
After hearing of the USDA’s latest announcement Wednesday, Minnesota strawberry farmer Andy Petran said he suspects many previously approved projects won’t be funded. He’d been approved for a $39,625 grant to install solar panels on his farm. But like many other farmers nationally, Petran got word from the USDA earlier this year that his grant money had been put on hold.
“It’s not like any small farmer who is looking to put solar panels on their farms will be able to put a natural gas refinery or a coal refinery on the farm,” Petran said. “I don’t know what they expect me to switch to.”
Petran was counting on the benefits that solar power would bring to his farm.
After getting word in September that the USDA had approved his grant application, he expected the solar panels would not only reduce his electricity bill but allow him to sell power back to the grid. He and his wife figured the extra income would help expand their Twin Cities Berry Co. and pay down their debt more quickly.
Petran’s optimism was soon extinguished. A USDA representative told him earlier this year that the grant had been frozen.
His 15-acre farm about 40 miles north of Minneapolis operates on a razor-thin margin, Petran said, so without the grant money, he can’t afford to build the $80,000 solar project.
  Andy Petran, shown here in front of the barn at his Minnesota strawberry farm, had been counting on a USDA grant to help him build a solar array that would have saved the farm money. Now that grant is frozen, so Petran can’t move forward with the project. (Photo courtesy of Andy Petran)
“Winning these grants was a contract between us and the government,” he said. “There was a level of trust there. That trust has been broken.”
In its announcement, issued Tuesday night, the USDA said grant recipients will have 30 days to review and revise their project plans to align with President Trump’s Unleashing American Energy Executive Order, which prioritizes fossil fuel production and cuts federal support for renewable energy projects.
“This process gives rural electric providers and small businesses the opportunity to refocus their projects on expanding American energy production while eliminating Biden-era DEIA and climate mandates embedded in previous proposals,” the USDA news release said. “… This updated guidance reflects a broader shift away from the Green New Deal.”
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in the release that the new directive will give rural energy providers and small businesses a chance to “realign their projects” with Trump’s priorities.
It’s unclear what this will mean for grant recipients who’ve already spent money on renewable energy projects — or those whose planned projects have been stalled by the administration’s funding freeze.
The USDA didn’t directly answer those questions. In an email to Floodlight on Wednesday, a department spokesperson said the agency must approve any proposed changes to plans — but offered no specific guidance on what or whether changes should be made.
“Awardees that do not respond via the website will be considered as not wishing to make changes to their proposals, and disbursements and other actions will resume after 30 days,” the email said. “For awardees who respond via the website to confirm no changes, processing on their projects will resume immediately.”

 IRA funding targeted

The grant funding was put on hold after an executive order issued by President Trump on his first day in office. It froze hundreds of billions of dollars for renewable energy under President Joe Biden’s massive climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The law added more than $1 billion to the USDA’s 17-year-old Rural Energy for America (REAP) program.
About 6,000 REAP grants funded with IRA money have been paused and are being reviewed for compliance with Trump’s executive order, according to a March 5 email from the USDA’s rural development office to the office of U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland.
A lawsuit filed earlier this month challenges the legality of the freeze on IRA funding for REAP projects.
Earthjustice lawyer Hana Vizcarra, one of the attorneys who filed the suit, called the latest USDA announcement a “disingenuous stunt.”
“President Trump and Secretary Rollins can’t change the rules of the game well into the second half,” she said in a statement Wednesday. “This is the definition of an arbitrary and capricious catch-22.”
Under the REAP grant program, farmers pay for renewable and lower carbon energy projects, then submit proof of the completed work to the USDA for reimbursement. The grants were intended to fund solar panels, wind turbines, grain dryers, irrigation upgrades and other projects, USDA data shows.
At a press conference in Atlanta on March 12, Rollins said, “If our farmers and ranchers, especially, have already spent money under a commitment that was made, the goal is to make sure they are made whole.”
But some contend the administration is unfairly making farmers jump through more hoops.
“This isn’t cutting red tape; it’s adding more,” said Andy Olsen, senior policy advocate with the Environmental Law and Policy Center, a Midwest-based environmental advocacy group. “The USDA claims to deliver on commitments, but these new rules could result in awarded grants being permanently frozen.”
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a longtime farmer and Maine Democrat who sits on the House agriculture committee, said she thinks it’s illegal and unconstitutional for the administration to withhold grant money allocated by Congress. Beyond that, she said, it has hurt cash-strapped farmers.
“This is about farmers making ends meet,” she told Floodlight. “It’s not some ideological issue for us.”
 GOP lawmakers silent

Using USDA data, Floodlight identified the top 10 congressional districts that received the most grants. They’re all represented by Republicans who have said little publicly about the funding freezes affecting thousands of their constituents. It’s impossible to tell from the USDA data which REAP grants will get paid out.
The congressional district that received the most REAP grants was Iowa’s 2nd District, in the northeastern part of the state. Farmers and business owners there got more than 300 grants from 2023 through 2025. The district is represented by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who has previously voiced support for “alternative energy strategies.”
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}}))}();
“More than half of the energy produced in Iowa is from renewable sources, and that is something for Iowans to be very proud of,” she told the House Appropriations Committee in June 2022.
Hinson’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the matter.
The No. 2 spot for REAP grants: Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District, represented by U.S. Rep. Brad Finstad. In that district, which spans southern Minnesota, more than 260 farmers and rural businesses were approved for REAP grants.
Finstad’s office did not return multiple emails and calls requesting comment. His constituents have been complaining about his silence on funding freezes. They’ve staged at least two demonstrations at his offices in Minnesota. Finstad said he held a Feb. 26 telephone town hall joined by 3,000 people in his district.
In a Feb. 28 letter to a constituent, Finstad said Rollins has announced that the USDA will honor contracts already signed with farmers and that he looks forward to working with the administration “to support the needs of farm country.”
Finstad is no stranger to the REAP program. Before becoming a congressman, he was the USDA’s state director of rural development for Minnesota. In that role, he was a renewable booster.
“By reducing energy costs, renewable energy helps to create opportunities for improvement elsewhere, like creating jobs,” Finstad said in a 2021 USDA press release. That has since been deleted from the agency’s website.
Rollins, meanwhile, called herself “a massive defender of fossil fuels” at her confirmation hearing, and she has expressed skepticism about the findings of climate scientists. “We know the research of CO2 being a pollutant is just not valid,” Rollins said at the Heartland Institute’s 2018 conference on energy.
She has also said that she welcomes the efforts of Elon Musk and his cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency team at the USDA.
 Losing trust in government

Jake Rabe, a solar installer in Blairstown, Iowa, said he has put up more than 100,000 solar modules in the state since getting into the business in 2015. More than 30 of his customers have completed their installation but are awaiting frozen grant funding, he said. At least 10 more have signed the paperwork but are hesitant to begin construction. Millions of dollars worth of business is frozen, he said.
On top of that, Rabe said, the state’s net metering policies — in which solar users get credits for any excess power they send back to the grid — are set to expire in 2026.
“I kind of feel like it may be the beginning of the end for the solar industry in Iowa with what’s going on,” said Rabe, who owns Rabe Hardware.
Despite it all, he remains a Trump supporter.

“Under the current administration, I think we’re doing things that are necessary for the betterment of the entire United States,” he said.
On March 13, Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law group, filed a federal lawsuit against the USDA on behalf of five farmers and three nonprofits. They’re seeking a court order to compel the Trump administration to honor the government’s grant commitments, saying it violated the Constitution by refusing to disburse funds allocated by Congress.
Vizcarra, the Earthjustice lawyer, said she is disturbed by the lack of concern from Congress, whose powers appear to have been usurped by the administration.
She added, “These are real people, real farmers and real organizations whose projects have impacts on communities who are left with this horrible situation with no idea of when it will end.”
One of the plaintiffs, Laura Beth Resnick, grows dahlias, zinnias and other cut flowers on a small farm about 30 miles north of Baltimore.
Florists are her customers, and demand for her flowers blooms during cold-weather holidays like Thanksgiving. Each of her three greenhouses is half the length of a football field, and heating them during those months isn’t cheap, Resnick said. The power bill for Butterbee Farm often exceeds $500 a month.
So a year ago, Resnick applied for a USDA renewable energy grant, hoping to put solar panels on her barn roof — a move that she estimated would save about $5,000 a year. In August, the USDA sent word that her farm had been awarded a grant for $36,450.
The cost of installing solar panels was $72,000, she said. So she paid a solar contractor $36,000 upfront, expecting that she’d pay the rest in January when the federal grant money came in. The solar panels were installed in December.

But the federal government’s check never arrived. A Feb. 4 email from a USDA representative said her request for reimbursement was rejected due to the Trump administration’s recent executive orders.
Resnick said she sought help from her elected representatives but got “pretty much nowhere.”
After hearing about the USDA’s announcement Wednesday, Resnick said that based on the response she’s previously gotten from the USDA, she’s not confident she will get her grant money.
“I’ve lost my trust in the USDA at this point,” she said. “Our project is complete, so we can’t change the scope of it.”
Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat, said he supports the legal fight against the funding freeze.
“Donald Trump and Elon Musk are scamming our farmers,” Van Hollen said in a statement to Floodlight. “By illegally withholding these reimbursements for work done under federal grants, they’re breaking a promise to farmers and small businesses in Maryland and across the country.”
 Renewable projects on hold

Since 2023, when IRA funding became available, the USDA has given or loaned about $21.3 billion through programs to support renewable energy in rural areas, according to a Floodlight analysis of agency data, including the REAP program.
Those grant payments were processed until Jan. 20, when the Trump administration announced its freeze.
Trump’s decision was in line with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint crafted by the Heritage Foundation aimed at reshaping the U.S. government. That document called for repealing the IRA and rescinding “all funds not already spent by these programs.”
Environmental groups have sharply criticized the administration’s move, and several lawsuits are challenging the legality of the freeze of IRA funding.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At a recent public roundtable, Maggie Bruns, CEO of the Prairie Rivers Network which supports Illinois communities’ transition to clean energy, listed REAP grants that have been held up in Illinois, where her multifaceted environmental nonprofit is based. A $390,000 grant for a solar array at the grocery store in Carlinville; $27,000 for solar panels at an auto body shop in Staunton; $51,000 for a solar array for a golf course in Alton.
Since 2023, farmers and businesses in Illinois have been approved for more than 590 REAP grants, making the state the third highest in number of recipients in the United States, Floodlight’s analysis shows. In an interview with Barn Raiser, Bruns said the decision to freeze such grants has caused unneeded stress for farmers. Before the executive order, USDA’s rural development team had worked hard to bring dollars for renewable energy projects to Illinois farmers, she said.
“That’s the thing we should be celebrating right now,” Bruns said, “and instead we have to fight to make sure that money actually does land into the pockets of the people who have gone ahead, jumped through all these hoops and are attempting to do the right thing for their businesses and their farms.”
In January, Dan Batson’s nursery in Mississippi was approved for a $400,367 REAP grant — money that he planned to use to install four solar arrays. He intended to use that solar energy to power the pumps that irrigate more than 1 million trees, a move that would have saved the company about $25,000 a year in electricity costs.
Seated in a wooded area about 30 miles north of Biloxi, his 42-year-old GreenForest nursery ships potted magnolias, hollies, crepe myrtles and other trees to southern states. Until a couple of months ago, Batson had been excited about what the grant money would mean for the business.

But now the grant has been frozen and Batson says he can’t afford to move ahead with the project. (Photo courtesy of Daniel Batson)
But when he saw news about the funding being held up earlier this year, he called a local USDA representative who confirmed the funds had been frozen. Batson had already sent the solar contractor $240,000. Now, his plans are on hold.
“I just can’t do the project if I don’t get the money,” he said.
Tuesday’s announcement from the USDA makes him no more confident he’ll get the money, he said.
Batson said he’s a fiscal conservative so he understands the effort to cut costs. “But,” he said, “the way they’ve gone about it has disrupted a lot of business owners’ lives.”

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
 Withholding tribes’ data

As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.










All of data is a story. It's a grandmother, it's a son, it's a story of a community's well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute


Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
 State data agreements

In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
 Tracking disease

In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist. Shewbrooks hopes the new South Dakota access will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.

 ‘We needed this yesterday’

During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”

There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

Tim Fleming of Covington said he decided to remove a new election night ballot counting rule after local election supervisors testified Wednesday that a tight Election Day counting deadline would place unfair burdens on election staffers. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA Georgia GOP-controlled Senate panel Thursday greenlighted a revised version of a wide-ranging bill packed with controversial provisions that no longer include plans to hand voter challenge complaints to state election officials and  enforce new ballot counting methods.
House Bill 397, which still contains several controversial rule changes, passed the Senate Ethics Committee Thursday night with four Democratic senators voting against it.
The bill has been criticized for limiting voters’ ability to drop off absentee ballots on the final weekend before Election Day and other proposed changes to election law.
The bill’s sponsor, Covington Republican Rep. Tim Fleming said he also decided to remove a new election night ballot counting rule after local election supervisors testified Wednesday that a tight Election Day counting deadline would place unfair burdens on election staffers and present chain of custody challenges.
The bill still aims to ban the state from participating in third-party voter list sharing databases like the Electronic Registration Information Center, known as ERIC. Georgia secretary of state officials are asking legislators to maintain what they say has been a successful partnership that allows Georgia to share updated voter rolls with 24 other states.
Big overhaul planned for Georgia elections: Bills aired in state Legislature’s waning days

 
Under HB 397, the Georgia elections board would evaluate the procedures and policies for withdrawing from ERIC. and provide recommendations to the legislative committees.
Fleming’s updated bill would delay the state’s transition from the multi-state voter database. It now proposes July 1, 2027 as the implementation date for Georgia to transition to another system. It allows for additional time to find a new way during legislative sessions in 2026 and 2027 and following next year’s general election, Fleming said.
“If there is a new secretary of state, it gives them time to work with this legislative body to implement what we have asked them to do,” Fleming said.
The revised bill still would still give the controversial State Election Board new rulemaking authority and independence, however it no longer would hand appeals to voter eligibility challenges to the board. The appeals are currently resolved in Superior Courts.
Sen. Derrick Mallow, a Savannah Democrat, questioned whether the election board could take over  election rulemaking powers that rightfully reside with the General Assembly.
Ethics Committee Chairman Sam Watson, a Moultrie Republican, credited Fleming and HB 397’s co-sponsor Rep, Victor Anderson for incorporating some key recommendations into the election bill.
“They listened to a lot of concerns that we heard last night for two hours and they took those concerns back and now they’ve got a good bill that I think we can move forward with,” Watson said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)A controversial bill that would significantly roll back Kentucky’s ability to regulate water pollution will become law after the GOP-controlled legislature on Thursday overrode its veto by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. 
Senate Bill 89, sponsored by Sen. Scott Madon, R-Pineville, would considerably narrow the definition of state waters that are regulated by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. Madon, with the backing of the Kentucky Coal Association, has touted the bill as a move to relieve industries from housing construction to coal mining of bureaucratic barriers.
Environmental groups have lambasted the bill as potentially opening the state’s water resources to pollution, threatening the groundwater of hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians who rely on rural public water utilities and private wells. 
Rebecca Goodman, the secretary of the Energy and Environment Cabinet, had previously said she had “grave concerns” with the bill. Beshear in his veto message wrote SB 89 by “failing to protect all water sources” would result in “pollution, sickness and more dangerous flooding.” 
Sen. Stephen West, R-Paris, on the Senate floor said he believed changes to the bill made as it advanced through the legislature, after hearing concerns about groundwater pollution, helped improve the legislation. 
“We protected our (coal) operators from overreach of the agency, and after listening to constituents, after listening to comments on this floor, provisions to protect groundwater were put back in,” West said.
Environmental groups and the cabinet have said the changes made to SB 89 don’t go nearly far enough to protect groundwater resources across the state. Democrats opposing the bill referenced a letter from Goodman, the cabinet secretary, who wrote Kentucky would be the only state in the country to cede its authority to regulate water to the federal government. 
Sen. Robin Webb, D-Grayson, who voted against overriding the veto, said the “compromise” made to change the bill did not “go far enough.” 
“The origination of this measure arose from agency overreach, but the pendulum now has swung far to the other end,” said Sen. Robin Webb, D-Grayson, who voted. “I have utilities in my district that rely on groundwater sources. I represent sportsmen and women across this country in the state that have reached out.” 
Kentucky Waterways Alliance executive director Michael Washburn — in a statement also representing leaders from the Kentucky chapter of the Sierra Club, the Kentucky Resources Council and the Kentucky Conservation Committee — said the legislature sided “with polluters over Kentucky’s people and the industries that rely on clean, safe water.” 
“This decision gives coal companies greater freedom to pollute our headwater streams, at the expense of the tens of thousands of homes, farms and businesses that depend on groundwater from private wells in rural Kentucky,” Washburn said. “To the polluters who championed this bill: we are watching. We have built a resilient, determined coalition — and we are ready to act.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0524-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 00:57:53.378965

A bill backed by Republican leadership in the state Senate could soon return the commission to all-white. (Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources photo)FRANKFORT — The president of the GOP-controlled Kentucky Senate says a political Facebook post justifies removing the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission’s first Black member.
But Jerry Ferrell, who in 2021 became the first Black Kentuckian named to the board overseeing wildlife management, told the Lantern that his political views shared on social media should not disqualify him from continuing to represent hunters and anglers in his Central Kentucky district.
“My social media are just that: mine,” Ferrell said, suggesting Stivers was finding a reason not to reappoint him. “It’s none of his business.” 
Senate Bill 245, which became law on Thursday after GOP supermajorities overrode Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto, changes what happens when a Fish and Wildlife Commission member reappointed by the governor is not confirmed by the Senate. Ferrell is the only member the change in law could apply to this year. Under the new law, sponsored by Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, a member not confirmed for reappointment must leave the board when  the legislature adjourns Friday. In the past, members reappointed but not confirmed could serve until the end of the year.
  Sen. Reggie Thomas, D-Lexington (LRC Public Information)
As the Senate considered whether to override the veto Thursday, Sen. Reggie Thomas, D-Lexington, called the bill “pure politics at its best,” saying it targeted Ferrell because he made derogatory comments about President Donald Trump. 
“No board has been more politicized in this body than the Fish and Wildlife Commission,” Thomas said. “I think that’s wrong.” 
The Lantern  reported Wednesday that Ferrell believed SB 245 was intended to remove him because of social media posts he’s shared critical of Trump. 
Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, however, said more than “a few derogatory statements” prompted the bill. Stivers on the Senate floor then described an image purportedly on Ferrell’s Facebook page “of the Supreme Court of the United States with the majority of them in KKK hoodies.” 
“If this individual were in this body or anywhere else, there would be a hue and cry for them to be impeached, removed or censured. I don’t think putting Supreme Court justices in KKK hoodies is appropriate for anybody who sits on a board or commission of this state,” Stivers said.

A spokesperson for Senate Republicans shared screenshots with the Lantern that appear to show Ferrell making two separate posts on his personal Facebook page visible only to his Facebook friends. One of the posts shared a profile picture from another Facebook account that featured conservative members of the U.S. Supreme Court in Ku Klux Klan hoods. Ferrell said he doesn’t remember sharing the post, which appears to have been shared in 2024 or earlier, but doesn’t disagree with the sentiment.
Ferrell, who described himself as an “anti-Trumper,” said he believed recent decisions by the country’s highest court — including a decision giving presidents criminal immunity from prosecution for some official acts — were “nuts.” 
How Ferrell could be removed from the Fish and Wildlife Commission 
The commission is made up of nine unpaid members who oversee the KDFWR’s budget consisting of tens of millions of dollars in hunting and fishing license fees, boat registration fees, and federal grants. State law directs the commission to keep a “watchful eye” over the department, and the commission controls the employment of the KDFWR’s head executive, Commissioner Rich Storm. 
First Black member suspects politics is booting him from KY Fish and Wildlife Commission

Each commission member represents a different geographic part of Kentucky. Fellow sportspeople vote for commission nominees in district meetings. A list of the top vote-getters is sent to the governor who selects someone from the list. The Senate then decides whether or not to confirm the governor’s appointments or reappointments. Commission members are allowed to serve two four-year terms. 
Ferrell was originally appointed by Beshear to the commission in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in 2022. In January, Beshear reappointed Ferrell to a term ending in 2028. 
Stivers, when asked about Ferrell’s comments Thursday evening, said of the Facebook posts,  “you can’t be putting things like that in the public domain when you’re here to represent an entity or an agency of the commonwealth.” 
The confirmation process for  Fish and Wildlife Commission appointments by Democrat Beshear has been politically contentious before with the GOP-controlled Senate rejecting a number of them. Earlier nominees have been scrutinized for social media comments critical of the state’s fish and wildlife agency. One appointee was rejected by the Senate after being criticized because his wife was quoted saying complimentary things about Beshear in a Wall Street Journal article. 
Stivers said “we have found many occasions that people have posted things on Facebook.” He said talking about others in a “derogatory, demeaning and inappropriate way” is “a reflection of your person and your thoughts.” 
The commission, under state law, is designed as bipartisan in its makeup, and commission members aren’t identified by political party. Sportsmen have said the work of the commission is largely apolitical. 
Politics swirl around who will oversee Kentucky Fish and Wildlife

In another purported Facebook post by Ferrell that the Senate spokesperson showed the Lantern,  Ferrell shares a link to a TikTok. Above the link, Ferrell wrote he did not understand “how or why people vote against” their best interests in supporting Trump and that “every veteran that voted for him” needed to lose health care. 
Ferrell, a veteran, told the Lantern he deleted the post with the TikTok link after he received a call from someone advising him to “clean up his Facebook page.” 
“There’s rumors going around that I was a Trump hater on the Senate floor, so that was the reason for the deletion,’ Ferrell said. “I didn’t want to because how I feel is how I feel.” 
Ferrell had previously told the Lantern he was proud of his work serving on the commission and helping represent Black Kentuckians who hunt and fish and that he wanted to continue that work which he views separate from his personal politics. 
He also told the Lantern he was worried his potential removal is part of a larger “culture” against diversity, an assertion that Stivers dismissed. The board would have all white representation if Ferrell is removed. 
“I had no idea what his race was when this was brought to me,” Stivers said. “Now you can sit here and say, ‘Wait, I should get a pass because of that?’ No.”

The coronavirus pandemic, mainly, but also the chaos of last year’s election and the new administration of President Donald Trump.
So, when Kitchpanich heard about an impending volcanic eruption near her hometown of Anchorage — and the accompanying recommendations to equip herself with masks and air filters — it was time to vent. In a video she cut for her TikTok audience of 500,000, she had a stern message for Mt. Spurr, the 11,000-foot conical lava dome volcano that’s threatening severe disruption to life in urban Alaska.
“Mt. Spurr, read the f—king room. There is enough going on in Alaska, in the world,” said Kitchpanich, 30. “Take some antacids and put a cork in it, and come back in a decade. Come back in five years. Just not now, dude. Not now.”
Far more than most Americans, Alaskans contend with natural hazards as part of their daily lives.
Urban bear encounters don’t even make headlines. Avalanches and landslides close roads on the regular. Earthquakes? Anything less than a 6.0 on the Richter scale doesn’t rate.
Eruptions aren’t really exceptional, either: The Alaska Volcano Observatory lists 55 volcanoes that were “recently active.”
But many of those are in remote areas, like the Aleutian Islands and Katmai National Park and Preserve. Spurr, 78 miles from Anchorage, is unusual in its potential to foul air quality, disrupt jet service and otherwise snarl the lives of hundreds of thousands of Alaskans.
The volcano is far enough from Anchorage that destructive mudflows and avalanches pose no significant threat to people. The primary problem is ash, which can severely damage planes that fly through it and also poses risks to human health, pets and vehicles and other machinery — if winds carry it over Anchorage.

Scientists say an eruption looks increasingly likely, but on the vague timeline of “the next few weeks or months.” That uncertainty has provoked a wide range of emotions from the Alaskans living in Spurr’s shadow, who have turned to social media and therapists to help them get through it.
“It’s in the back of your mind all the time,” Kitchpanich said in an interview this week. “It’s going to be super annoying to me — but I think it also could be harmful for other people, as well.”
At the same time, Kitchpanich, like other Alaskans, acknowledged at least a twinge of curiosity about the potential for a once-in-a-generation event.
“This will be, like, our first volcano moment,” said Martin Phillips, another Anchorage resident. “I’m kind of excited. If I get the day off work, I’ll be a happy camper.”
An eruption from Spurr, Phillips conceded, would “cause a lot of trouble for folks.”
“But, personally, I think it’s going to be a really cool experience to live through,” Phillips added. “It’s not often that you can say, ‘Yeah, I was there when that volcano erupted and spat ash everywhere.’”
An eruption does not appear imminent, and may not happen at all.
The volcano observatory, earlier this month, detected “significantly elevated” gas emissions from Spurr, and it’s also seen other signs like higher earthquake activity.

Scientists say the most likely outcome is an “explosive eruption” that could last for a few hours and generate ash clouds, but they anticipate more intense warning signs before it happens. Just before Spurr’s explosive eruptions in 1992, a small lake at one of the volcano’s vents changed color and started to boil.
“We expect some other things to happen, and then we could revise our estimate to, maybe, a span of days. But right now we’re kind of waiting,” said David Fee, a scientist at the volcano observatory.
In the meantime, Alaskans are girding themselves for a major inconvenience.
An eruption from Spurr could deposit as much as one-fourth of an inch of ash on Anchorage and other Southcentral Alaska communities, the observatory says. It’s made of fragmented rock, minerals and volcanic glass — meaning that it’s highly corrosive and can cause respiratory problems, irritate eyes, infiltrate cars and trucks and clog their machinery.
In 1992, Spurr forced a 20-hour closure of Anchorage’s international airport, while the military ran out of hangar space and had to fly 28 planes to other locations, the Anchorage Daily News reported at the time. Ash drifted on the Seward Highway and caused “whiteout conditions” along the ocean southeast of town.
Hospitals reported no serious health problems, though one person interviewed by the newspaper complained that the ash “burns my throat.”
Like during the coronavirus pandemic, Anchorage residents have been stocking up on N95 masks, as well as extras like goggles and even pantyhose that can be used to filter ash from car engines.
One added complication is that, unlike the coronavirus, volcanic ash can affect pets, who experts say should be kept indoors during ashfall. Amazon and local stores have been doing brisk sales of PPPE — pet personal protective equipment — and Alaskans have found moments of levity as they’ve fitted their dogs with goggles, jackets, booties and even canine masks.
“They look ridiculous, because they’re slightly tinted. But the tinted were $11.99,” Anchorage resident Noah Star said of the goggles he bought for Morgan, his cattle dog-husky mix.

	Another option was a pricier pair of Rex Specs, which some dog owners buy for non-eruption-related outdoor activities. “But I just know my dog’s going to hate it, and I’m not going to put them on” under any other circumstances, Star added.
Other Alaskans have leveraged the Spurr uncertainty into entertainment. Multiple “Mt. Spurr Classics” have popped up in recent days — a volcanic twist on the popular Nenana Ice Classic, a century-old Alaska tradition in which people can bet on the date and time that winter ice breaks up on a river in the state’s Interior.
At a recent Anchorage house party, attendees were asked to submit their guesses of when ash would erupt from Spurr, down to the hour and minute.
Fee, the Alaska Volcano Observatory scientist, is also a professor at University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Geophysical Institute, and he said students have been making their own guesses.
The observatory also has internal polls where experts have predicted the likelihood and date of an eruption, Fee added. But he declined, apologetically, to reveal his own prognostication.

	“I guess I would stick with the party line,” he said, chuckling. “All signs still point to, likely, within weeks to months. Sorry.”
The guessing games and other forms of socializing aren’t just frivolous — they can be supports for Alaskans grappling with uncertainty and anxiety around a possible eruption, according to Dr. Anne Zink, a former chief medical officer for the state who helped lead residents through the coronavirus pandemic.
“Connection provides us great resiliency,” she said. “Prepare for the worst and hope for the best. But don’t overdo it in your preparedness and preparation, or doomscroll.”
Zink, like others, said she appreciates the “natural wonders” that come with living in the state. But she’s still not rooting for an eruption, she added, because she’s seen how natural disasters consistently have the harshest effects on society’s most vulnerable people.
“The people who will be most impacted by it will be those who have chronic lung conditions, or might be battling cancer, or don’t have access to transportation. And it will make already challenging aspects of their life that much harder,” she said. “So, for that reason, I’m very much hoping it doesn’t happen.”
Fee, the volcano scientist, also acknowledged Spurr’s disruptive potential, and he diplomatically declined to say whether he and his colleagues hope for an eruption. But he agreed that such an event would be “very scientifically interesting.”
“That’s why we do it, right? That’s why we study volcanoes — it’s exciting,” he said. “And hopefully we can help out.”

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two tax bills will head to the Kansas governor’s desk after clearing the Senate Thursday, but Republicans and Democrats differed on whether the tax relief made good on their campaign promises to Kansans. 
Senate Democrats condemned the legislation in back-to-back debates as lawmakers worked into the night to finalize the remaining legislation of the 2025 regular session.
The Democrats spoke of broken promises as the chamber considered Senate Bill 35, which cuts state property taxes, and Senate Bill 269, which reduces income tax rates. 
The House advanced SB 35 bill Wednesday in a 96-26 vote. It passed the Senate unanimously, despite criticism from Democrats, in a 40-0 vote.
The bill eliminates the statewide levy of 1 mills for the state education building fund and the .5 mills levy for the state institution building fund. 
“Promises, promises, promises,” said Topeka Democrat Sen. Patrick Schmidt. “And this is what we’re going to get. One-and-a-half mills.”
“Kansans, you get scraps from this majority,” Schmidt added, referring to Republicans.
State General Fund dollars would replace the lost revenue from eliminated tax collections. In fiscal year 2027, which begins June 2026, the state education building fund would receive about $56 million and the institutional building fund would receive about $25 million from the State General Fund.
Sen. Caryn Tyson, a Parker Republican who presented the property tax relief bill, said she was proud of the work the Senate had done in attempting to limit taxable property values, among other tax break measures.
“We can go home and hold our heads high (knowing) that we worked for our constituents,” she said.
SB 269 is designed to reduce the individual and corporate income tax rates to 4% and bank rates could drop as low as 2.6%. However, the cuts are contingent on maintaining the state’s budget stabilization fund. 
House lawmakers advanced the bill Wednesday in an 84-38 vote after debate from only Democrats. The Senate approved it in a 30-10 vote, with Republican Sen. Rick Billinger of Goodland joining Democrats in opposition. 
Tyson characterized the bill as a way to combat “out-of-control” government spending, although she acknowledged that taxpayers won’t immediately see its impact.
“Instead of continuing to grow government and feed the beast, we’re going to reign that growth in by creating a step-down,” she said.
The changes would go into effect in 2025, and taxpayers could see effects if the State General Fund revenue exceeds the previous fiscal year’s revenue, adjusted for inflation. 
The budget director would make that determination by Aug. 15, and the secretary of revenue would calculate tax rate reductions starting with individual income taxes.
Once individual rates in both the lower and higher tax brackets reach 4%, rate reductions for corporations and financial institutions would be triggered. Reductions would continue until the combined rate for corporations reaches 4%, the combined rate for banks reaches 2.6% and the combined rate for other financial institutions reaches 2.62%.
Sen. Ethan Corson, a Fairway Democrat, pushed the point that taxpayers won’t see immediate relief.
In response, Tyson listed a number of income tax reductions, praising the Legislature’s work in recent years. She then turned to Democrats.
“You can’t stand in one breath and say it’s not tax cuts and then in the second breath say ‘Oh, we’re going to lose $260 million of school funding,’ ” Tyson said. “You can’t have it both ways, guys. It’s either tax cuts, or it’s not.”
Corson said that Kansans have been “crying out” for property tax relief. Last year, during the special session, lawmakers passed income tax relief, and then legislators underwent election season campaigning on delivering property tax relief this session, Corson said.
“Well, here we are … on day 74 of the legislative session, and the only property tax relief we delivered is a measly one-and-a-half mills,” he said. “I was frankly surprised, Mr. President, that the majority party was able to even put that bill on the floor with a straight face.”
Harking back to SB 35, he said under the proposal, owners of a $150,000 home would save $25.88, and owners of a $230,000 home would save $39.68.
“You know, as my grandpa used to say, ‘Don’t spend it all in one place,’ ” Corson said. 
He compared the Legislature to Charlie Brown’s Lucy with a football.
“We keep promising property tax relief for Kansans, and then we yank it away,” he said. 
Tyson pushed back. 
“Oh my gosh,” she said. “Turn down your W-I-F-M station: What’s In it For Me. This is for the taxpayers. This is for us stopping government growth. This is absolutely needed.”
The Senate adjourned around 9:40 p.m. and will not meet again until the veto session begins April 10.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corson-Senate-3.26.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-27 23:58:21.464596

(Sophie Nieto-Munoz | New Jersey Monitor)ELIZABETH — The Union County Board of Commissioners took an initial step toward selling the county jail on Thursday, with critics who fear the facility will become a privately run migrant detention center chanting, “Shame, shame!” after the board’s vote.
The nine-member board approved by a 6-3 vote two resolutions — one that allows the county to subdivide public property that includes the jail and another that allows the county to consider proposals to sell the unused jail.
“I sit alongside our immigrant community, work alongside each one of you,” said Commissioner Sergio Granados. “With the possibility of a detention center being there, I must vote no on these two items.”
Commissioner Michèle Delisfort and Chairwoman Lourdes Leon also voted against the measures after immigrant activists and other members of the public spent nearly two hours urging the board to either oppose selling the jail or commit to not turning it into a migrant detention center.
Thursday’s vote comes as the Trump administration ramps up efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants.
Brian Lozano of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey told commissioners that soliciting bids for the jail without meaningful input from residents undermines “the fundamental principle that governments must answer to their constituents and operate transparently.”
“Institutions that detain and deport immigrants only serve to terrorize these communities, and ultimately under this administration, to hold their family members, everyday people, and increasingly political protestors in violation of the United States Constitution,” he said.
Elizabeth resident Giovanna Castaneda said she used to sit in school fearing that she’d come home to her mom being deported. Castaneda told commissioners to pay attention to other problems plaguing the city — homelessness, a lack of affordable housing, food scarcity — rather than adding another one.
“This could be one of the largest detention centers in the northeast, along with Delaney Hall in Newark, along with Elizabeth Detention Center, which is only two miles away from where we are right now. These sites are designed to deliver profit, not justice,” said Viri Martinez of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. “It’s a system that has no regard for the lives it destroys.”
The meeting turned tense at several moments. The police approached people who went past their allotted speaking time, while audience members shouted from the crowd when the board cut the microphone. The room also quickly filled to capacity, leaving nearly 100 people — including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka — outside the county administration building.
“Our fight here is a fight for humanity, a fight for all people, a fight for dignity and respect, a fight for all human beings, whether you’re documented or not,” Baraka said.
The county did not commit to selling the jail to a private prison company, though immigrant advocates fear that is what will happen. Commissioner Rebecca Williams said she hopes the county will get bids from entities hoping to use the former jail for mental health facilities, workforce development, or college classes.
“As the very first stage to see what interest there is, I am in favor of that,” William said. “But again, as I said, everyone who knows me and who follows me knows exactly how I feel about what’s happening broadly in terms of people being disappeared, people being detained without due process.”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Air Force veteran David Kelsen stood on a stage and decried Trump administration plans to privatize health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
“The VA should never be about making a profit any more than the active military force is,” Kelsen said to applause. 
Kelsen was among a group of speakers who listed off complaints about the Trump administration – and occasionally the North Dakota Legislature – at a town hall meeting organized by the Democratic-NPL Party. 
Rep. Fedorchak vows to protect Social Security during virtual town hall

Over the course of an hour, speakers covered topics such as potential impacts to Medicaid, the possibility of family members being deported and cuts to Social Security staff. Moderators then gave people an opportunity to voice their concerns. 
Organizers left empty chairs for members of North Dakota’s congressional delegation – Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and Rep. Julie Fedorchak – all Republican supporters of President Donald Trump. 
Speaker Kylie Oversen did give Fedorchak some credit for taking questions during a livestream town hall, but criticized the congresswoman for downplaying the concerns of constituents. 
Oversen is a former Democratic legislator and an attorney who deals with Social Security claims. 
She said the Trump administration’s goal is to make veterans benefits and Social Security “so unworkable and so inefficient that they have to find a way to privatize them.”

Several audience members addressed frustration with cuts to Social Security staff, long lines and long waits times when calling the Social Security Administration. 
Larry Schwartz of Fargo said he considers himself an independent but came to the event in part for a catharsis and to be with like-minded people.
“These are troubling times,” he said. “Some people are afraid. Some people are angry.” 
Paul Meyers, who spent 16 years on the Fargo School Board, said he was concerned about actions of the state Legislature on several issues, but especially education. 
“The whole business of giving public tax dollars to private schools is not what the constitution intended,” he said. 
The Legislature is considering bills that would establish Education Savings Accounts, which families could spend on private school tuition.
He also said the congressional delegation has not been listening to constituents. 
“We’d like to see someone stand up to Donald Trump. And so far, our congresspeople are kneeling down.” 
The event was held in conjunction with people’s town halls organized by Democrats being held across the country.
North Dakotans rally for town hall meetings with congressional delegation

The crowd exceeded the seating area in the Sanctuary Event Center in downtown Fargo. 
The crowd also exceeded the expectations of Cheryl Biller, executive director of the North Dakota Democratic-NPL. 
“Clearly people have a lot to say,” Biller said. “We have to keep the energy going to make a productive difference.” 
She said a similar event is planned for April 19 and a virtual town hall is in the works. Indivisible is another group that is protesting cuts in federal services. The group is planning a rally April 5 on the Veterans Memorial Bridge between Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota. That event is part of a national day of action organized through Handsoff2025.com.

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)As of February 2025, about 10% of Utah’s population rely on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program for health care services. The public health programs serve over 353,000 people in the state, according to a study by the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. 
“Since Utah adopted Medicaid in 1966, changes in federal requirements and within the Utah Medicaid program have expanded coverage to new population groups, such as low-income adults, and additional services like behavioral health,” Maddy Oritt, senior public finance economist at the Gardner Institute, said in a news release. 
Those Utahns, who are usually eligible for the coverage because of their limited income and resources, may be especially vulnerable in case of cuts to federal programs under the Trump administration.
The most likely Medicaid cuts would hit rural areas the hardest

The U.S. House voted to approve a budget resolution that instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to reduce the nation’s deficit by at least $880 billion through 2034. While the proposal doesn’t specifically name Medicaid, it is expected that the program will inevitably face substantial cuts so that the committee can reach that goal, since it’s a significant part of the committee’s jurisdiction.
The cuts would also mean other economic losses for Utah. According to Axios Salt Lake City, the state would lose 7,500 jobs in 2026 alone, $727 million to its GDP, and about $51.3 million in lost state and local tax revenue.
During the 2024 fiscal year, funding for Medicaid was approximately $5.3 billion in Utah — 68% of it came from the federal government, with the remaining 32% from state funds and other revenue, according to the report. 
“​​When viewed as a share of each county’s total population, Medicaid enrollment is highest in San Juan County (30.0%), Carbon County (22.5%), and Duchesne County (20.9%),” Gardner Institute analysts wrote in the report.
After Utahns voted to expand Medicaid eligibility for adults with annual incomes of up to 138% the federal poverty level, individuals with wages below about $21,600 annually and families of four earning less than roughly $44,400 per year qualify for coverage. The programs are also available for low-income children, some caretakers, pregnant women and people with disabilities.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Legislature adopted a spending plan Thursday that fully funds public schools, provides pay raises for state employees, eliminates DEI initiatives, polices pronouns in emails, and puts the state on a course to blow through billions in reserves and face a budget shortfall within three years.
Senate Bill 125 finalizes $27.08 billion in spending for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and provides the blueprint for how the state will spend $25.6 billion next year. Those figures include $10.85 billion from the State General Fund in the current year and $10.64 billion next year, a $210 million decrease in spending of state revenues.
When coupled with the five-year, $2 billion slash to income taxes from last year’s special session, and assorted new legislation that would deliver tax cuts, the state would be an estimate $461 million in the red in fiscal year 2028. That would be a stark departure from the $3.2 billion surplus from a year ago, which is already projected to decline to $2.1 billion as expenses for the current fiscal year exceed revenues.
Rep. Henry Helgerson, an Eastborough Democrat, said the state was in “a financial mess.” He warned House members they were “going to come to loggerheads with a new governor” as a result of last year’s tax cuts and an appetite for spending created by federal COVID-19 aid.
“The chickens are coming home to roost, and we are in a hole,” Helgerson said.
Rep. Troy Waymaster, a Bunker Hill Republican who chairs the budget committee, acknowledged “a tough road ahead.”
“That’s the reason why we had the new legislative budget process,” Waymaster said, referencing the decision by lawmakers to ignore the governor’s budget proposal and make their own.
The House adopted the budget on an 89-36 vote, followed by the Senate’s approval on a 24-16 vote.
“There’s things that people will like, there’s a few things people do not like, and I can find that in any budget we’ve ever done,” said Sen. Rick Billinger, a Goodland Republican who chairs the Senate budget committee.
Senate Democrats expressed concerns in a caucus meeting about adopting a budget during an abbreviated legislative session. A revenue forecast in late April will show the full impact of last year’s income tax cuts, but lawmakers were set to adjourn late Thursday and wrap up business April 10-11.
“This is deliberate that we pass things without having knowledge,” said Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes.
Republicans who crafted the budget attached numerous policy strings to the money allocated to state agencies, universities, boards and other government entities. The provisos include directives to ban the use of gender-identifying pronouns in state employee email signatures and to stamp out any diversity, equity and inclusion positions, mandates, policies, programs, activities and training.
Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Shawnee Democrat, said it was “troubling” that the state would hold Department of Administration funding hostage until the agency showed it had implemented the directives.
“I don’t know what it’s satisfying or who it’s satisfying,” Ruiz said.
Other provisos will end continuous eligibility for Medicaid recipients, ban purchases of candy and soda with money for food assistance, allow the state treasurer to invest rainy day funds, authorize the Kansas Developmental Finance Authority to issue STAR bonds, and prohibit Larned State Hospital from using contract agency nursing staff in 2027.
Sen. Cindy Holscher, an Overland Park Democrat, took issue with the decision to raise the rent of journalists who work from the Statehouse, a move spearheaded by Sen. Virgil Peck, a Havana Republican who said it was unfair that the six news outlets that have a Statehouse office could pay just $100 per year in rent while writing “inaccurate” stories. He successfully inserted language that will charge the news outlets, which do not include Kansas Reflector, $1 per square foot per month — a combined annual cost of about $16,000.
When Holscher asked for an example of a factual error in a news story, Senate President Ty Masterson told her she was a “little far afield.” Billinger, who presented the budget to the Senate, said he “didn’t hear of any stories that were inaccurate or anything else.”
Holscher said the decision to raise the rent for news outlets “feels extremely punitive, kind of small of us.”
“Just because we don’t like something the press has published doesn’t mean we can seek to punish them,” Holscher said. “This is concerning to me, the action that’s been taken in this regard.”
Lawmakers got rid of a proposed mandate that all executive branch employees work from the office, opting instead for a requirement that state agencies report how many employees are working from home.
The budget would fully fund public schools but eliminate funding for training and other items not required under the school finance legal settlement. It also provides just $10 million in new funding for special education services, short of the $73 million commitment made a year ago.
Spending items include the allocation of $106.3 million for state employees, mostly for 2.5% wage increases, $5.8 million for a top-secret military weapons project in Wichita, $24.9 million for a new Kansas Highway Patrol dispatch center in Salina, $19.3 million to complete renovation of the Docking Building, $10 million for firearm detection software in public schools, $179 million for local bridge construction, $71.2 million for a Wichita Biomedical Campus, $41.3 million for an Ag Innovation Initiative at Kansas State University, and $30 million for a Health Science Education Center at Wichita State University.
Sen. Chase Blasi, a Wichita Republican, said he planned to go home this weekend and tell constituents he voted for a budget that fully funds public schools, adds funding for special education services, and rewards state employees “with a salary increase that they deserve.”
“We can sit here all day and point out a few things that are just not perfect, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” Blasi said.
The budget eliminates funding for the Blueprint for Literacy, an initiative the Legislature adopted last year to train teachers and improve reading levels. The program is a collaboration among the Kansas Board of Regents, Kansas State Board of Education, state universities and K-12 teachers.
Rep. Nikki McDonald, an Olathe Democrat who serves on the Blueprint for Literacy advisory committee, said she was “ashamed” the Legislature would defund the initiative.
“It’s insulting to the work that we’ve done in good faith, and the more I talk about it, the more mad I get,” McDonald said. “So I think I’m just going to leave by saying a budget is a reflection of our priorities, and I had hoped that we would prioritize our children more.”
The budget also calls for the state to take on $128 million in debt for a veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Manhattan and $80 million in debt for a new Kansas Bureau of Investigation headquarters in downtown Topeka.
Adam Proffitt, the state budget director, told Senate Democrats that Republicans had taken “an across-the-board shotgun approach” to trimming the budget that lacks strategic planning. And he said he was concerned about adding debt after spending the past few years trying to pay it down.
“Now we’re going in the wrong direction,” Proffitt said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3111056-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-27 22:58:49.495490

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — With most of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s vetoes overridden Republican lawmakers in the General Assembly have shown the power they wield over policy in Kentucky. 
Legislators returned to Frankfort Thursday, the second to last day of the 2025 legislative session. Within hours, both the House and Senate overrode nearly all of Beshear’s 20-some vetoes, save for a few line items.
In his weekly press conference, Beshear highlighted his futile vetoes, as well as some of the bills he signed or let become law without his signature.
Beshear also aired grievances shared by some of his fellow Democrats  in the General Assembly regarding what they see as a lack of transparency in the legislative process. He criticized Republicans for using “shell bills” or lengthy committee substitutes to quickly move legislation, particularly in the final days of the session. The governor said it is “designed to limit public review” of policy. 
“We know that ain’t right,” Beshear said. “We know that we are always better with the sunshine, with the transparency, and I hope that this practice will be reduced or eliminated in the future.” 
Last week, Republican leadership rebuked Democrats’ complaints about legislation being changed and moved with little notice, saying time is limited in a 30-day session. 
Before Thursday, Beshear issued more than 20 vetoes and five line item vetoes to legislation. To override the governor, lawmakers must give final passage to vetoed bills by the end of Friday. 
During floor debate on the veto override of House Bill 552, Republican Senate President Robert Stivers chided Beshear for not working with lawmakers on a trade commission between Kentucky and Ireland that was proposed in the bill. 
“By constitution, it is this body and the one down the hall who makes the laws,” Stivers said, referring to the House of Representatives. 
The Republican closed by pointing to the Republican supermajority in the legislature. The GOP has 31 of 38 Senate seats and 80 of the 100 House seats. 
“People who see us — if they want to change the policy in this state, then they will change the makeup of this body,” Stivers said. 
Here’s what is now Kentucky law
House Bill 2 allows Kentuckians to sue the governor over taxes paid on gold and silver bullion. In his veto message, Beshear decried the legislation as “unconstitutional” and said it was “out of touch with reality” for most Kentuckians who are feeling the strain of inflation at grocery stores and the gas pump. The Senate voted 31-6 to override the veto and allow the legislation to become law. 
House Bill 4 eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at Kentucky’s public universities. Republicans have argued this session that such programs cause division on college campuses, while students and professors have testified DEI has made spaces for them in academia. Beshear signed his veto of the bill in front of advocates who opposed the bill and said it was “about hate.”
House Bill 6 limits state agencies in how they can issue administrative regulations and bolsters the authority of Kentucky’s legislative branch. Beshear argued in his veto message the bill “would likely stop and prevent the executive branch from implementing numerous bills passed by the General Assembly.” The House voted 80-20 to override the veto Wednesday afternoon. 
House Bill 90 adds language to the state’s near total abortion ban in an attempt to clarify that doctors can intervene in complex pregnancies without fear of criminal punishment for violating the ban. Doctors have said the language fell short of that goal and confused them more than current law. In vetoing it, Beshear said it “threatens the life of pregnant women in Kentucky.”

House Bill 136 requires the Department of Corrections to include more data about people released from prison or on parole, including information like gang affiliations, time served and education levels. Beshear said in his veto message the bill would breach a contract by requiring a new communications service for inmates. 
House Bill 216 allows some employees of the Department of Agriculture to apply for or receive funds or awards from the Kentucky Office of Agriculture Policy. No lawmakers voted against the bill in either the House and Senate. Beshear argued in his veto message the legislation would allow “conduct that has always been unethical and unlawful” under the executive branch’s ethics code. 
House Bill 240, which has had bipartisan support from lawmakers, requires Kentucky kindergarten and first-grade students to take a universal screener before advancing to the next grade. Beshear used his veto message to push an issue he’s long preferred for improving learning for young students — universal pre-K programs. “House Bill 240 is not the answer,” Beshear wrote. “We should prepare, not punish, our youngest learners.” 
House Bill 346 will prohibit the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District or the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet from considering whether emergency stationary internal combustion engine emissions are subject to fees. Beshear in his veto message said it was “at least one entity’s attempt” to get a refund on emissions fees, fees that the bill would cause to fall on ratepayers. The House and Senate overrode his veto.
House Bill 398 will further limit state labor protections to a less-stringent federal standard, a move touted by Republican proponents as a business-friendly move but lambasted by labor unions as an “attack” on workers. Beshear in his veto message said HB 398 said On Thursday afternoon, the House voted 78-22 to overturn the veto. The Senate then voted 29-9 to overturn the veto, allowing it to become law. Two Republicans, Sen. Stephen West, R-Paris, and Sen. Michael Nemes, R-Sheperdsville, joined the minority of Democrats in voting against overriding the veto. 
House Bill 399 makes interrupting a legislative proceeding a crime in Kentucky. Beshear argued in his veto message that sufficient laws are already on the books to cover such conduct. 
House Bill 424 — Kentucky professors have warned this bill would erode academic tenure at the state’s public universities and colleges. The legislation would give universities and colleges the ability to remove faculty members and presidents for not meeting “performance and productivity requirements” set by the institutions’ boards. In his veto message Beshear said it “will limit Kentucky’s ability to hire the best people and threatens academic freedom.” 
House Bill 495 cancels the Beshear administration’s restrictions on conversion therapy and prohibits Medicaid from covering transgender-affirming medical care. In his veto message, Beshear called it an “unconstitutional infringement” that “promotes a dangerous and discriminatory practice that has led to the deaths of Kentucky children.” Conversion therapy is a discredited practice that attempts to alter gender expression and sexual attraction that diverges from heterosexual normativity “with the specific aim to promote heterosexuality as a preferable outcome,” according to the The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.” In 2024, Beshear signed an executive order aimed at ending the practice on Kentucky minors. 
House Bill 552 changes the makeup of local tourist and convention center commissions to allow a chief executive officer to appoint someone representing local businesses if no formal business association exists and creates the Kentucky-Ireland Trade Commission of the General Assembly. Beshear said in his veto message that the state Constitution gives the executive branch the authority to make such boards, but he would be willing to make a commission through an executive order. 
House Bill 684 is a lengthy election rules bill that received bipartisan support.. However, Beshear vetoed the bill and noted in his veto message the legislation reverses a 2020 rule to allow voters to present a debit or credit card as proof of identification at the polls. He drew ire from Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams, who said on X the governor “just murdered bipartisan election reform.” 
Public education advocates opposed House Bill 694, which made changes to the Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement System, saying it would undermine previous legislation. Beshear wrote in his veto message that he opposed the bill because it “breaks a promise made to teachers” without their input. 
House Bill 695 requires the General Assembly’s OK for administration changes to Medicaid, will require able bodied adults ages 18-60 without dependents to work in order to get Medicaid health benefits, reinstates 2020-era prior authorizations for behavioral health and more. Beshear, who has supported Medicaid benefit expansions, vetoed it because, he said, it would “put up barriers to and delay health care for Kentuckians.” 
Senate Bill 19 mandates a moment of silence at the beginning of school days and allows public schools to let students leave school for an hour a week for “moral instruction.” Beshear questioned how the bill could be enforced, as kindergarten students who do not stay silent could be violating the law. “At best, the bill will cause students to miss out on important instructional time,” Beshear wrote in his veto message. “At worst, it is subject to abuse and threatens the safety of Kentucky children.” 
Senate Bill 28 will create a new economic development program within the Kentucky Department of Agriculture to promote agribusiness or the development of alternative fuels. Beshear in his veto message said the bill could lead to the secretary of the Cabinet for Economic Development to disclose confidential information on projects, and it was unconstitutional because the governor did not have any appointments to the board overseeing the program. 
Senate Bill 65 will nullify two executive branch regulations involving Medicaid that were found deficient by a legislative committee last year. Beshear in his veto message called the bill an unconstitutional overreach by the legislature and said it was unnecessary because the regulations were already withdrawn.
Senate Bill 84 requires courts to interpret laws without deferring to a state agency’s interpretation of them and mirrors last year’s U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down the precedent for the Chevron deference at the federal level. Beshear challenged the constitutionality of the bill, saying in his veto message it “violates the separation of powers” among Kentucky’s branches of government. 
Senate Bill 89 will significantly roll back the state’s ability to regulate water pollution in the state by narrowing the definition of state waters that officials oversee. Republican proponents backing the bill said it would relieve industries from housing construction to coal mining from permitting barriers erected by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet.Environmental groups and Democrats lambasted the bill as opening up the state’s water resources to more pollution and potentially threatening Kentuckians’ drinking water. 
Senate Bill 183 requires a proxy adviser contracted by a state retirement plan to complete an economic analysis before voting on or recommending a vote on a shareholder-sponsored proposal that is different from a board of directors’ proposal. Beshear wrote in his veto message the legislation undermines the authority of the Kentucky Public Pensions Authority. 
Senate Bill 207, known as the School Innovation Act, allows public schools to seek exemptions from the Kentucky Board of Education from certain state laws or regulations. It also directs the board to consider if granting such waivers would hinder or improve “student academic achievement.” Beshear said the legislation would give the board “unfettered authority” to suspend Kentucky laws in his veto message. 
Senate Bill 245 will require that pending reappointments to the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission that are not confirmed by the Senate during a legislative session would have to vacate their position on the commission when the legislature adjourns for the year. For this year , it would only impact 
Line item vetoes 
House Bill 546 sets terms to fund the Local Assistance Road Program. Beshear vetoed part of the bill that would establish tolls for a planned I-69 Ohio River Crossing bridge to Indiana. 
House Bill 566 makes additional changes to last year’s law creating the Kentucky Horse Racing and Gaming Corporation. Beshear had vetoed a few sections of the bill and said in his veto message he had concerns about a possible “significant conflict of interest” in how the corporation worked on the drafting of the bill. 
Senate Bill 25 began as a shell bill, but later became a bill with multiple pieces of legislation in it toward the end of session. While the General Assembly overrode most of Beshear’s line item vetoes, some were sustained. That included a provision about how lawmakers will deliver legislation to the governor while they convene in a temporary structure while the Capitol is renovated in future sessions. 
House Joint Resolution 30 would release funds for specific projects submitted by drinking water and wastewater utilities through a program created by the legislature and managed by the Kentucky Infrastructure Authority. Beshear vetoed parts of the bill to give two specific projects “flexibility” in being completed in more efficient ways proposed by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. 
House Joint Resolution 46 — This resolution sets up a list of priority projects for county roads. Beshear issued some line item vetoes to correct the names of some listed roads, but the House overrode the veto 80-20. Lawmakers created the resolution based on a list previously provided by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet.

  Sen. Max Burns. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
House Bill 127 is the revival of Senate Bill 120, which did not pass the Senate by a key legislative deadline and would otherwise be dead for the year. The original bill by Dawsonville Republican Brent Cox expanded the number of sick days teachers could use to be absent for personal or professional reasons from three to five.
The version that passed the Senate Education and Youth Committee Thursday instead builds on language by Tyrone Republican Sen. Marty Harbin that bars schools and colleges from practices like promoting the different treatment of or provides benefits to people based on their race, color, sex, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity or sexual orientation.
Committee Chair Billy Hickman, a Statesboro Republican, read the names of about a dozen people who came to speak at the hearing but said they would not be heard because there was not enough time.
Under the bill, postsecondary institutions would also be barred from promoting ideas such as “unconscious or implicit bias, cultural appropriation, allyship, gender ideology or theory, microaggressions, group marginalization, antiracism, systemic oppression, social justice, intersectionality, neopronouns, heteronormativity, disparate impact, racial privilege, sexual privilege or any similar or related formulation of these concepts” as their official opinions.
The sponsor, Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns, compared the concept to college basketball.
“It’s March Madness, and we’re all watching the tournament,” he said. “I have 6’11” basketball players. I have 5’11” basketball players. They’re not all the same size, but they all compete on the same floor. Some would suggest that’s not equitable because they’re not all 5’11” or they’re not all 6’11”. At the end of the day, the equality issue is their ability to compete and achieve based upon their performance, so you can’t treat people differently or provide special benefits to them based upon their protected class.”
Democratic opposition
  Sen. Freddie Powell Sims debates Sen. Max Burns’ DEI bill. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Democrats including Dawson Sen. Freddie Powell Sims opposed the legislation.
“Very few Blacks embrace DEI,” said Sims, who is Black. “Let me tell you why. We never thought after civil rights bills were passed that we would have to acquiesce to that because we thought that there would be a fair, level playing field. The DEI is here for opportunities only. I don’t want to go to your country club. I don’t want to go to church with you. I don’t want to sit at your dining room table. I enjoy being with my Black girlfriends –”
“– I want you to know you’re welcome at my church,” Burns interrupted.
The two talked over each other.
“But I’m not done yet, no no no,” Sims said.
“Yeah, you are (welcome),” Burns interrupted again. “I have members of my church –”
“But we wanted opportunity,” Sims said. “And we wanted to be able to have those opportunities, especially in the workplace.”
Sims said instead of equality, Black people experienced other forms of discrimination like white flight and characterized DEI as a means of attaining economic opportunity.
“Again, Blacks don’t particularly care for DEI. We want to be considered as intelligent, as equals –”
“– as peers, as colleagues,” Burns interrupted.
“ –but we know that that’s as long as we live on this earth,” Sims continued. “It’s not going to be accepted. So having said that –”
“– I hope we both live long enough that that is not true,” Burns interrupted.
The University System of Georgia has not used race as an admissions factor since at least 2001, but Atlanta Democratic Sen. Elena Parent questioned whether the bill could ban affinity groups like the University of Georgia’s Black Law Students Association.
“The University of Georgia can have any association that is appropriate, that does not discriminate,” Burns said. “If that Black student law association is willing to accept individuals of any color, that’s not discriminatory.”
American history
Cumming Republican Sen. Greg Dolezal said the bill fits in with the values of the times. President Donald Trump signed an anti-DEI executive order in January, and major companies have announced they are scaling back or eliminating DEI initiatives.
“I think that part of the reason that we are seeing Fortune 500 companies abandon DEI policies in droves – in fact, the Fortune 500 companies that are keeping DEI policies in place are now the outlier – and I think the reason for that is the equity piece has really been co-opted by neo-Marxists who are focused on this concept of equal outcome,” Dolezal said.
  Sen. Ed Setzler discusses the 2025 DEI ban bill. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler said the bill would ensure those who died in the struggle for civil rights did not die in vain.
“Before the victories of the Civil Rights Movement, isn’t it true, there were, in particular, there’s people of other backgrounds, but in particular, people of Black descent, African American descent, Blacks in our nation, who were more highly qualified to get to the University of Georgia, University of Alabama and other schools, who were denied access because of their skin color. Is that true? And the victory of the Civil Rights Movement was that people who were fully qualified were no longer denied access, but could get access like others, correct?”
Burns agreed.
“At the end of the day – and I was challenged to live through the Civil Rights Movement, and most of you haven’t had that challenge – I had friends who were one of the first African American students at the University of Georgia,” Burns said. “We worked together, we communicated closely, we had dinner together, we socialized together. They were no different, but they overcame the challenge of preparing themselves to have access to higher education. We want to provide that access, we want to provide the skills and materials to ensure that they have that opportunity. At the end of the day, equal protection is essential.”
Are you anti-racist or Anti-racist?
Atlanta Democratic Sen. RaShaun Kemp took umbrage at the inclusion of “anti-racism” in the long list of concepts that postsecondary institutions would not be able to promote as official opinions and asked to amend the bill to remove that word.
  Sen. RaShaun Kemp debates with Sen. Max Burns over Burns’ anti-DEI bill. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“I’m really concerned that the word antiracism is in there,” Kemp said. “Mr. Chairman, you spoke about wanting equality, and I’m curious to know why the word antiracism is included in this if you are saying that you oppose racism, and if you could give me the definition of anti-racism?”
“That’s a series of issues that would not be a part of a official position of a post-secondary institution,” Burns said. “Anti-racism would be something where individuals would be opposed to racism.”
“So why is that a bad thing, we should not promote that?” Kemp asked.
“Well, you should not promote the reverse,” Burns said. “Anti-racism, don’t promote racism. Is that not true?”
“Anti-racism is opposing racism and promoting equality,” Kemp said. “So why are we including anti-racism as something that we should not promote in the state of Georgia?”
“To not have a position on,” Burns said.
“So do you think we should have a position in support of racism?” Kemp asked.
“I believe we should ensure that everyone has equal opportunities,” Burns said.
Dolezal told the committee the term anti-racism has been co-opted by unsavory elements in society.
“These are ideologies rooted in neo-Marxism focused on centralizing the means of production, focusing on the outcomes and assuming that outcomes are tied to systemic racism,” Dolezal said. “They were a key factor that led to the riots in 2020, that led to billions of dollars of damage in this country. So anti-racism is a very specific thought, I should say ideology, currently in culture, and it is not some kind of nebulous idea. There are volumes of books written around the concept of anti-racism, and it is anti-capitalism and in many cases it is anti-American.”
Setzler proposed an alternate amendment to capitalize Anti-racism in the bill so as to distinguish the good anti-racism from the anti-American one, and Democrats agreed.
The session is set to end on Friday, April 4. If the DEI bill is to become law, it must pass both chambers and receive Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — The Kentucky General Assembly has overturned Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of a bill meant to clarify the state’s abortion ban, which some doctors said fell short of that goal. 
House Bill 90 will immediately add to Kentucky law an itemized list of  certain conditions under which doctors can legally end a pregnancy — including during hemorrhage, ectopic and molar pregnancies. It will also make it possible for Kentucky to have freestanding birth centers. 
Doctors previously told the Lantern that the bill doesn’t clarify the ban for them and causes more confusion about when they can legally perform an emergency abortion.
Lawmakers voted to overturn Beshear’s veto largely along party lines. The governor had said the bill “threatens the life of pregnant women in Kentucky.” 
Planned Parenthood called the legislature’s override of Beshear’s veto “unforgiveable.” Tamarra Wieder, Planned Parenthood’s Kentucky director, said it is a “a devastating blow to the health and dignity of Kentuckians.”
“Lawmakers had the opportunity to course-correct — to listen to doctors, to trust patients, and to put people above politics. Instead, they doubled down on cruelty and control,” Wieder said. “These power grabs do nothing to serve public health. They are a calculated attempt to cement government interference in the most personal, life-altering medical decisions — whether it’s denying care to someone facing a pregnancy crisis or medical care for trans Kentuckians.” 
Kentucky’s near-total ban on abortion has exceptions only to prevent death or the permanent impairment of a life-sustaining organ. Doctors charged with violating the ban could be charged with a felony punishable by prison.
Lawmakers’ debate
In the house, Rep. Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, said she couldn’t support the bill because of the abortion language. Burke has tried unsuccessfully in recent years to reverse the state’s abortion ban. 
“We can’t gamble with another Kentucky mother,” said Burke, calling women’s lives “too sacred to blunder again like we did before.” 
“We’ve made an exhaustive list in a place where an exhaustive list is unhelpful and limiting,” she said. “There were so many missed opportunities, and it just does not sit well with me that we couldn’t do better for you, Kentucky moms, so I’m sorry.” 
Rep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, called the new abortion language “a calculated attack on women’s health disguised as legislative clarity.” 
  Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty of Martin was the only House Democrat voting to override Beshear’s veto of HB 90. (LRC Public Information)
Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty, D-Martin, sided with Republicans in voting to override. 
“I strongly feel we should unequivocally be protecting the life of a mother in these situations,” she said. “While very legitimate concerns have been raised by both knowledgeable and compassionate people, I do genuinely feel that this legislation will save lives.” 
In the Senate, Sen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said the effort may have been “well intentioned,” but “you cannot clarify what people are allowed to do medically, if you only use totally nonmedical terms that mean nothing to the health care profession.”
Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, said she hopes the legislature works on improving the language in the future. 
“I’m glad to see that people want to make sure our laws aren’t causing pregnant women to die because we don’t allow doctors to effectively manage miscarriages,” she said. “I’m glad to see that this body has an appetite to address that serious life or death problem, and I hope that we can continue to work together to address that problem, to save pregnant women’s lives, but the way to do that is by making sure that we are including the medical community at the outset, so that we can make sure the language does what we’re seeking to accomplish.”  
Sen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, called the bill “the beauty of life.” 
Funke Frommeyer has worked on freestanding birth center legislation since joining the General Assembly in 2024. 
In addition to ending a regulatory impediment to freestanding birth centers, “we were able to so clearly articulate some of the significant challenges that come along with pregnancy and natural abortions — abortions that you didn’t intentionally cause, these unintentional and dangerous situations,” she said. 
Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, called reproductive health an “oxymoron” when praising the bill. “We want to be a pro-life state,” she said. “And when we talk about reproductive health, that’s really just an oxymoron, because health is not ending a life, obviously, and if you’re not reproducing, then you’re ending that life. So it’s not reproductive when you talk about abortion rights.” 
Tichenor also said she’s had family members with “premature birth and ultimate ending of their child’s life” who were unsure how the abortion ban would affect them. 
“So this brings clarity for women to know that they are going to be protected if their health is at risk and if any of these instances come up and they need to just make the discussions about how they can protect their life,” she said. 
Stivers: ‘A political issue’ 
  Senate President Robert Stivers speaks with reporters over coffee, March 26, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, said Wednesday during a conversation over coffee with several reporters that there had been a lot of “misinformation” around the abortion ban — and he blamed Beshear for contributing to it. Beshear took issue with the new language that he said could jeopardize in vitro fertilization, among other issues. 
“I think he’s trying to create a political issue,” Stivers said, saying he believes IVF to be protected in Kentucky. 
“People were saying, ‘oh, there’s no exceptions to abortion.’ Well, that’s not accurate. There has always been the life of the mother. And then people were trying to say, ‘Well, what does that mean? Clarify that, what is the life of the mother? Is that … physical life? Is it mental health?’ Those types of things,” Stivers said. 
He specifically wanted to clarify the issue of ectopic pregnancies, he said, since his family experienced that very issue in 2015, years before the United States Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion and Kentucky’s ban went into effect. 
“My daughter-in-law had one and had to be terminated, because, if not, she and the baby — well, the baby had no chance — but she would have been very at risk if they let that go through,” Stivers said. 
He also admitted “there always will be” bipartisan appetite in the legislature to add exceptions for rape and incest, and he understand the arguments in favor of them. 
Despite that, he said, “when there has been a heinous act with rape or incest, there is a being created … and that being had nothing to do with this, but that being gets punished by the loss of life.” 
Both Republicans and Democrats have tried to add rape and incest exceptions to the abortion ban, but all attempts have failed. 
Meanwhile, Wieder with Planned Parenthood said the legislature’s override “made it clear: political posturing matters more than preventing needless suffering, more than protecting medical providers, more than saving lives.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_9802-scaled-e1739484217138-2048x1310-1-1024x655.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 22:01:17.777992

(File photo) Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder Legislation passed by the Senate on Thursday would place the Georgia governor at the top of the list of high-paid governors in the nation and significantly increase the salaries of the attorney general, House and Senate leaders, and several other key officials.
The Senate voted 45-10 to approve a revised House Bill 86 that would increase the governor’s annual salary from $182,000 to $250,000 for next year. Several state court judges will receive higher salaries under the legislation, while the attorney general, state school superintendent, secretary of state, and agricultural, insurance, and labor commissioners will receive annual salaries of $200,000.
Now that the bill has been amended by the Senate, the changes must be adopted by the House before the session concludes on April 4.
According to data collected by the Council of State Governments on gubernatorial salaries for 2022, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s pay raise will move him from 10th highest earning to tied for first with Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York.
Sen. John Albers, a Roswell Republican, said the new salaries will provide uniformity among several executive officers while also addressing disparities, such as the governor earning less than the Atlanta mayor’s $236,000 salary. The bill would set the other salaries at $200,000, based on 80% of the governor’s salary.
“This simply sets the governor’s salary at $250,000 which I believe is appropriate, but then it falls in line with our constitutional officers and the speaker of the House,” Albers said.
“I think it actually will bring us up to where we need to be. If you look at constitutional officers like the speaker of the House, they sometimes make twice as much money as them,” Albers said.
According to the open.ga.gov database, the reported salaries in 2024 for six Georgia public officials who could get pay bumps through HB 86 were: Attorney General Chris Carr with $146,000; $131,000 for Insurance Commissioner John King and State School Superintendent Richard Woods; Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger made $125,637; $106,000 for House Speaker Jon Burns, and $98,000 for Lt. Gov. Burt Jones.
In comparison, the Council for State Governments reported that the average salary for secretary of states nationally was $121,628 in 2022, with Arizona paying the lowest salary at $70,000, while Tennessee had the highest at $222,252.
The report also says that the 2022 national average salaries for state attorneys general was $139,000. New York’s AG led the nation with $220,000 while Oregon’s $82,200 ranked last. Some lawmakers questioned the wisdom of giving such large raises to top Georgia executives at the same time.
Stone Mountain Democratic Sen. Kim Jackson said she supported the higher salaries but had reservations about the raises taking effect this summer instead of waiting until next year when Georgia’s next elections for state offices will be held.
“Isn’t it true that we typically do salary increases to be effective for the next election cycle, not during the time when people want to see it as a decision,” Jackson said.
Albers said he understands why government officials may hold off  from publicly requesting better pay in order to avoid being accused of supporting their own pay raises.
There is also an added layer of scrutiny about elected officials raising pay during an election year, Albers said.
“We can find a reason each and every year to not do this,” he said. “This is the right time, the right year to do this.”
Under the bill, the General Assembly would approve salaries for Supreme Court justices and judges for the Court of Appeals, state Business Court and Tax Court based on pay of judges for the United States District Court for Northern Georgia, who currently earn $247,400, according to U.S. Courts government website..
The justices could earn equal pay to the federal district court judges while the other state judges could earn 95-99% of the U.S. district court judges.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)It only stands to reason that a bunch of elected officials who are term-limited would believe that terms limits are good for everyone. That’s the case in the South Dakota Legislature, where both chambers endorsed House Joint Resolution 5002. It calls for a national constitutional convention to create an amendment that imposes term limits on members of the U.S. Congress.
HJR 5002 was approved by votes of 42-24 in the House and 25-10 in the Senate. Joint resolutions don’t require the signature of the governor. The Legislature’s action did earn praise from U.S. Term Limits, an organization pushing for a constitutional amendment determining how long members of Congress can serve.
It takes 34 states to call for a constitutional convention. Now South Dakota is one of 10 states that has endorsed USTL’s version of the amendment. Nineteen other states have endorsed congressional term limits, but their language has to be made to conform with USTL’s or the entire effort will just become a jobs program for lawyers.


Let us know what you think...


 

USTL would like to see members of the U.S. House limited to three two-year terms and members of the U.S. Senate limited to two six-year terms. That’s quite a change for an institution that has some members who make a career out of getting reelected.
“Term limits provide fresh faces with fresh ideas to elected office,” USTL says on its website. “They reduce lobbyist and special interest influence and make room in Congress for the citizen legislator.”
The citizen legislators in South Dakota’s Legislature are limited to four two-year terms in each house, though they are allowed to try to jump to the other chamber after eight years. Legislators here became subject to term limits with the passage of an initiated constitutional amendment in 1992. Many of the faces in both chambers have changed due to term limits. However, many of the same lobbyists are still hanging in there, ready to offer their brand of guidance, expertise and institutional memory to each group of newbie lawmakers.
Chances are that congressional term limits would make lobbyists more important rather than less powerful, as claimed by USTL. Term limits would also place more emphasis on the expertise of government bureaucrats. After all, co-President Musk and DOGE can’t fire them all.
The prospect of congressional term limits is worrisome for a small state like South Dakota. This is particularly true in the U.S. Senate, where longevity leads to power. If term limits were already the law of the land in Washington, D.C., there’s likely no way that Sen. John Thune would rise to be the Senate majority leader.

Granted, Thune’s tenure so far hasn’t exactly been a profile in courage as the Senate confirmed a group of Fox News has-beens and conspiracy theorists to serve in President Trump’s Cabinet. Still, it will be good to have someone from South Dakota in a position of authority to look out for the state’s interests when Congress tackles the next farm bill.
The battle cry for term limits is usually based on the power of incumbents and how tough it is to kick the bums out of office. Some of the same South Dakota legislators who embraced HJR 5002 proved last year that incumbency is not all that it’s cracked up to be.
The ditches of South Dakota roads are littered with Republican incumbents, tossed aside by voters in last year’s GOP primary. All the new faces in this year’s Legislature prove that, as they always have, voters hold the true key to term limits.
By design, amending the U.S. Constitution takes time. With just 10 states signed on for its version of the term limits amendments, USTL has a long way to go. For small states it may be best if USTL never reaches its goal. Through the years, South Dakota has enjoyed the Senate leadership of Tom Daschle and now John Thune. It’s hard to see how our small state could be in that position of power if the U.S. Capitol were to install a revolving door.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Thune-Rounds-Johnson-Dakotafest-cropped-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-03-27 22:01:17.777992

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen calls President Donald Trump’s sweeping executive order overhauling the administration of U.S. elections a “new and hopeful chapter.” 
Evnen said state election officials have long faced federal roadblocks to using “databases that could help confirm the citizenship status of those on the voter rolls.” He pointed to a joint letter from him and 19 other secretaries of state last month that requested more access to federal immigration data to help verify voter registrations. Evnen’s statement and recent actions echo national Republican framing that election experts warn could undermine trust in elections.

Fewer voters were turned away under the law than in other states with similar laws.
If the SAVE Act was signed into law, it would codify parts of the executive order. While Evnen said he welcomes the executive order, his office has defended Nebraska elections in the past.

Among their requests is the ability to search multiple voters at once, clearer guidance on how and when state election officials may use the database, and free use of the system. 
“This is not just a letter from certain states requesting a sort of seemingly bureaucratic access to a database,” Eliza Sweren-Becker, a voting watchdog, said of the joint letter. “This is a part of a broader effort to restrict voting access for all Americans.” 
She and other election watchdogs said the framing from Republicans is based on the “myth” of widespread non-citizen voters. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, analyzed election conduct from 2003 to 2023 and found only 29 instances of noncitizens voting.
“With this action, President Trump is moving the rocks out of the road so that states can access the data they need and should have,” Evnen said in a statement praising Trump’s executive order. 
When the Nebraska Examiner asked how many non-citizens have been removed from voter rolls or voted in past elections, a spokesperson for the secretary of state said earlier this month that the agency has not “removed anyone due to their status as a non-citizen, nor do we believe that there are many such people registered to vote.” Evnen told KETV earlier this month that the secretary of state would like to investigate whether 46 Nebraskans who have voted over the last several elections are U.S. citizens. The agency spokesperson told the Examiner it is developing a process with the Attorney General to request confirmation of citizenship status from a small number of registrants whose citizenship status is unclear.
According to Evnen’s office, 13,550 voters were removed from the voter rolls after the November 2024 election – they were removed due to death or relocation from the state. Such removals are routine and required by federal and state law.
State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue introduced a bill in the Nebraska statehouse to eliminate online voter registration, restrict absentee voting, provide more security for ballot boxes, and require hand-counting of election results, citing “election integrity concerns.” Evnen agrees with some provisions of Legislative Bill 541, such as tightening security around ballot boxes. But a spokesperson said he has practical concerns about hand counting and legal concerns about voter registration during its hearing.  
Trump’s Executive order will likely face legal challenges from voting rights groups and Democratic state attorneys general.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — With a veto-proof supermajority, Republican lawmakers overturned Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s vetoes on two notable higher education bills Thursday.
House Bill 4 eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (DEI) at Kentucky’s public universities and was at the center of heated debates in the General Assembly this session.
Some Kentucky professors have warned that House Bill 424 erodes academic tenure at the state’s public universities and colleges, although its sponsor has said it is about employment contracts at universities.
The House and Senate quickly gave both final passage by largely party-line votes.
In his veto messages on the bills, Beshear argued they could both hinder higher education in Kentucky.
Some advocates agreed with him. Four people — college students Jillian Gabhart, Savannah Dowell and Alice Harkins and Eastern Kentucky University lecturer Carl Root — read eulogies for university education on the steps of the Capitol Thursday morning. Dressed in black, they held a funeral as lawmakers convened for business.

“We may have lost a battle here in Frankfort, and we should absolutely mourn what we’ve lost here today,” Root said. “But we must also organize, agitate, educate and fight back against those who would use all the power of government in attempts to force uniformity, inequity and exclusion on all our universities, classrooms and curriculum.”
Some House Democrats met with the funeral-goers outside.
When HB 424 was called to the floor, Rep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, said she feared passing the bill would upend recruiting faculty to the state’s public universities. She added that protecting tenure gives faculty “the ability to explore complex, and sometimes controversial topics.”
“Tenure protects the core mission of higher education,” she said. It is the fearless pursuit of knowledge and critical thinking.”
Democrats in the Senate raised similar concerns in their chamber. Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, and a law professor at the University of Louisville, said HB 424 has produced “confusion and fear” among facultyi. She said she was supportive of Beshear’s reasoning for the veto, adding that “these sorts of policies that take away faculty self-governance” and “put in place these programs with no guardrails” undermine the security tenure establishes.
Meanwhile, Republicans easily had the votes to enact their policies. Rep. Vanessa Grossl, R-Georgetown, said she supported the veto override of HB 4 because she believes “in equality” and “equal opportunity.”
“Our greatest divide as a commonwealth and as a nation is not based in race, but is rural and urban,” she said. “I’m voting no today because DEI on our college campuses is not helping poor kids in Kentucky who are seeking to further their educational goals, regardless of their immutable characteristics.”
In speaking in support of HBl 4, Sen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, looked back to the Civil Rights Movement and said activist Martin Luther King Jr. “gave us a great start and what happened?” Douglas then asked, “Should we continue to blame others and hold others accountable for our own personal decisions?”
“This legislation is only a message to those who are unwilling or unable to love others deep enough to allow them to seek their own way or their own level of success,” the senator said. “We have to love them.”
The Kentucky bills are reflective of actions Republicans have taken elsewhere to exert their influence over higher education. On the issue of tenure, Florida recently passed a law requiring post-tenure reviews of professors at public universities and termination should they fail them. This year, a Nebraska Republican lawmaker introduced a bill that would replace academic tenure with annual performance evaluations of faculty members.
Though an anti-DEI bill failed to pass in Kentucky last year, the passage of the current law comes as Republican President Donald Trump has made DEI a target of his administration. In addition to issuing an executive order aimed at curbing DEI in the private sector early on in his second term, Trump is facing a lawsuit from fired federal workers who were tasked with implementing DEI policies.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3729-1024x781.jpg,,,2025-03-27 21:00:06.270306

Senate Majority Leader Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, introduced amendments to House Bill 1176, a property tax proposal backed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong.
Hogue proposed lowering the primary residence credit from the $1,450 approved by the House to $1,250. He also proposed changes he called a “skin-in-the-game” amendment that would limit the credit to 75% of the property owner’s total tax liability. Homeowners would get a minimum tax credit of $500, the same level approved by lawmakers in 2023.

“If we adopt (House Bill) 1176 as is, you are virtually wiping out the tax liability of all the primary residence owners in those small communities,” Hogue said. “I don’t think that’s good policy.”
The committee adopted the amendment with a 12-4 vote.
Armstrong’s proposal, which was incorporated into the bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, called for a primary residence tax credit of up to $1,550. Though not included in the bill, Armstrong’s long-term vision is to eliminate property taxes for most homeowners within a decade, a proposal he highlighted during his first State of the State address.
“I don’t think what got put on in Appropriations today is nearly good enough for the North Dakota citizens,” Armstrong told the North Dakota Monitor after the hearing. 
Armstrong said he hopes senators defeat the amendments on the floor and pass the bill as originally intended.
Hogue said if property tax liability is eliminated for a large portion of homeowners, then they won’t have an economic stake in voting for future property tax increases or bonding proposals.

The committee also adopted an amendment from Hogue that adds language urging lawmakers in the 2027-29 session to consider property tax reductions for agriculture, commercial and centrally assessed properties. The language would not be binding.
The property tax credits would be paid for through earnings from the Legacy Fund, which was created by voters and is fueled with oil and gas revenue. Hogue expressed concerns about Legacy Fund earnings being used to only benefit homeowners.
“It should be broader based,” Hogue said.
Armstrong said he has concerns about using Legacy Fund earnings to benefit out-of-state interests that own farmland, businesses or other types of property.
“I don’t think giving out-of-state landowners a tax break helps anybody buy farmland cheaper and I don’t think it helps anybody rent land cheaper,” Armstrong said.
The committee rejected amendments related to the 3% property tax levy cap for local subdivisions. 
The bill will now head to the Senate floor for a vote of the whole chamber. If passed, it will need to be reconciled in a conference committee between the House and Senate.

Burnett (far left), Jim Murren (center), and former Gov. Brian Sandoval (far right) face Nevada Gaming Commission. (Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)The Nevada Gaming Commission on Thursday agreed to a stipulated agreement and $10.5 million fine against Resorts World Las Vegas, which faced multiple counts of failing to comply with anti-money laundering laws by allowing known illegal sports bookies to gamble on dozens of occasions.
“We’ve got a dream team of governance on the board here in front of us today. You’ve all had extensive Wikipedia pages,” Gaming Commissioner and former Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki gushed of the newly-minted Resorts World board of directors seated in the front row – former Gov. Brian Sandoval (who Krolicki served under as Lt. Gov.), former Gaming Control Board chairman A.G. Burnett, and former MGM Resorts CEO Jim Murren, who also chairs the gaming commission of the United Arab Emirates. 
Resorts World attorney Erica Okerberg called the revamped leadership “Resorts World 2.0.” 
The new board is intended to right the $4.3 billion listing ship that opened on the Las Vegas Strip in 2021. 
The Current was first to report in 2023 that the Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service was investigating Resorts World and MGM Grand for alleged anti-money laundering violations. 
The IRS settled its case last year with MGM, which paid a $7.45 million fine. Former MGM Grand president Scott Sibella, who later became president of Resorts World, was fired by Resorts World weeks after the Current broke the news of the investigation. Sibella later pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of failing to file federal anti-money laundering reports. 
Nevada gaming regulators subsequently filed a complaint against Resorts World, and resolved a complaint against Sibella by revoking his gaming license for five years.  
The Nevada Gaming Control Board (GCB) “found that the violations alleged in its amended complaint are particularly egregious, warranting a substantial penalty and significant changes at Resorts World,” Darlene Caruso, who represents the commission on behalf of the Nevada Attorney General’s Office, told gaming commissioners.  
“It’s breathtaking,” Krolicki said of the GCB complaint against Resorts World. “The lack of control, the lack of reward of open culture,” that extended from the casino floor “to the C suites, and I’ll argue, even beyond Las Vegas, was truly extraordinary.” 
Resorts World Las Vegas is owned by Genting Assets, a Malaysian conglomerate. 
The stipulated agreement states Resorts World “believed it was operating within industry standards and norms” and does not accept responsibility for the alleged violations. 
“I’m surprised by that a little bit, just given the posture that it’s in,” Commissioner Rosa-Solis Rainey said. “They fell down on the job. I don’t think there can be any reasonable dispute about that from anybody. This is not a situation where information wasn’t available to them. It was there and leadership chose to ignore it.” 
“I don’t know who is denying liability and pays $10.5  million. It’s not a thing, usually,” observed Commission Chairperson Jennifer Togliatti. 
“Personally, I feel the fine is on the low side,” Solis-Rainey said, adding she’d vote in favor of the stipulation because of the “extensive efforts” the company has taken and “tremendous expenses” it has and will incur as it imposes corrective action. 
The GCB, in its settlement with Resorts World, reserves the right to take additional disciplinary action in the event the Department of Justice or Department of Treasury takes any criminal, civil, or administrative action against the casino.
During public comment, high-stakes professional gambler R.J. Cipriani told the commission that “harassment and intimidation” by Resorts World executives led to his “unwarranted arrest, multiple bogus felony charges and wrongful exclusion from the property.” 
Cipriani said he turned to the Criminal Division of the IRS and other federal authorities in California because he was ignored by Sibella, Genting chairman K.T. Lim, and then-Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, who is now governor of Nevada.
Federal authorities have yet to file a complaint against Resorts World but are said to be negotiating a non-prosecution agreement and fine with the casino, according to sources close to the case. Murren and Burnett declined to comment following the commission meeting. 
“I believe this will be a wonderful fix and a new pivot for Resorts World,” Krolicki said, calling the agreement a “clarion call up and down the street that AML (anti-money laundering), compliance audits, all of these things we talk about all the time – we really mean it. Nevada is a best in class, you know, whatever we want to call it, regulatory environment.”
Although the fine, second in size only to the $20 million fine imposed against Wynn Las Vegas for its namesake’s sexual encounters with employees, was criticized by some as insufficient, “I don’t think it’s for us to tweak” the fine, Krolicki said. “I accept the hard work that was done with the GCB. I never wanna do this again.” 
Gaming Commissioner and former Nevada Supreme Court Justice Abbi Silver recused herself from the vote because of her “long-standing friendship” with Sibella, adding Sibella, while president, was a member of the casino’s anti-money laundering compliance committee. The personal relationship, she said, “would materially affect the independent judgment of a reasonable person in the situation.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0B6E9273-02B1-46A2-9901-B3AC16C3428D-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 21:00:06.270306

Greg Gianforte signed two bills Thursday intended to “safeguard fairness, privacy and security for women and girls,” but that opponents say will limit the rights of transgender and intersex Montanans. 
House Bill 121, one of the first measures introduced during the session, would require public restrooms and changing areas exclusively for males or females, and require people use the one “designated for their sex” based on “external genitalia present at birth.” The bill — which landed in court the same day — would also require individuals be housed at a prison aligning with their designated sex at birth. 
The other bill, House Bill 300, restricts the ability of transgender women from participating in female sports. 
“Today, we’re maintaining equal opportunity for all Americans, while also protecting women and girls and their right to safe and separate facilities and activities,” Gianforte said in a statement. “Because we think it’s pretty simple. A man shouldn’t be in a women’s restroom. Shouldn’t be in a women’s shower room. And shouldn’t be housed in a women’s prison.”
  Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe speaks on the floor of the Montana House of Representatives in support of a ‘bathroom bill’ that would mandate public restroom usage based on the gender assigned at birth (Photo by Micah Drew of the Daily Montanan).
Both bills were sponsored by Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billings. 
Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage, in a statement called them “victories for common sense,” that show that “in Montana, we still believe in biological reality.”
The bills were unanimously opposed by Democrats in both chambers, and Thursday, House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan said Montanans have other priorities. She said she thought Gianforte did too — cleaning up the property tax crisis early in the session.
“The Republican Governor has failed to deliver on taxes, and by his own metric,” Sullivan said in a statement “Yet, he’s proud to enact new laws on toilets.
“Gianforte and Republicans in the legislature have their minds in the gutter. Democrats have our minds on lowering taxes, funding public schools, and fixing healthcare. Democrats know Montanans can go to the bathroom without the government getting involved.”
House Bill 300 is part of a nationwide trend to restrict transgender athletes in women’s sports. Montana is now one of 25 states with laws that ban transgender students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project.
Montana previously passed a similar ban on transgender athletes in sports in 2021 but a district court judge found it unconstitutional. 
The same day HB 300 cleared the House in Montana, President Donald Trump signed an order banning transgender student athletes from women’s sports.
Several national advocates for protecting women’s sports testified on the bill, including Riley Gaines, a former collegiate swimmer who tied for fifth place with a transgender swimmer in a collegiate championship race.

“The legislature’s passage of House Bill 121 and House Bill 300 sends a clear message that the legislature and the Gianforte administration stand with over half a million Montana women and girls,” Gaines said in a statement shared by Gianforte. “I was glad to support this bill through my testimony, and it is an even greater honor to see yet another state pass such critical legislation!”
House Bill 121 raised substantial opposition for its broad application to bathrooms and changing rooms in correctional centers, juvenile detention facilities, local domestic violence programs, public buildings, public schools, and other places.
Several Democrats noted that while a fiscal note said “immediate costs” are expected to be minimal, a similar failed bill from a previous session was pegged at costing nearly $1.8 billion. 
Sen. Laura Smith, D-Helena, said during floor debate that she’d spoken with domestic violence shelters and homeless shelters that were concerned they’d have to shut down immediately in order to be compliant with the law. 
A majority of legislation that has impacted transgender and nonbinary Montanans in recent years has been temporarily or permanently blocked by the court system, and on Thursday the ACLU of Montana announced it had already filed a legal challenge. 
Alex Rate, with the ACLU of Montana, said his organization filed a lawsuit against HB 121 along with an emergency request that the judge immediately pause the bill.
“House Bill 121, unlike House Bill 300, goes into effect immediately upon the governor’s signature,” Rate said. “It’s operational right now, and we need to get relief for our clients and for anybody who may be impacted by this terrible law.”
Rate said the ACLU’s clients are transgender and intersex individuals throughout the state of Montana.
In a video statement, Gianforte said the bill shows Montana is fighting the “far-left gender ideology” sweeping the nation.
“Here in Montana, we’ve stood up against this radical agenda and maintained equal opportunity for all Americans,” Gianforte said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bathroom-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 21:00:06.270306

(Photo by Becca Paschal/Arkansas Governor's Office)Meteorologists predicted the volatile weather that hit Arkansas on March 14 at least five days in advance by using sophisticated equipment and advanced forecasting techniques, surpassing their normal two-day warning of potential tornadic activity.
Those advancements may soon be throttled, however, as budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration could strip National Weather Service stations of needed meteorologists, cut funding for research and upgrades in equipment and eliminate educational outreach programs such as storm spotter training classes.
Under President Donald Trump’s administration, his Department of Government Efficiency has called for slashing NOAA’s $6.8 billion budget by up to 20 percent and either laying off employees or not filling positions vacated by transfers or retirement.
Already, 1,300 were laid off at the country’s 122 National Weather Service stations in February. Another 1,000 people may soon lose jobs in the near future.
Five stations in North Little Rock; Memphis; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Vicksburg, Mississippi, monitor weather conditions in Arkansas.
“We consider ourselves a public safety institution,” said Dennis Cavanaugh, the warning coordinator for the National Weather Service’s North Little Rock station. “We provide a place for the public to go for information about the weather. “

Cavanaugh wouldn’t comment much further, saying his office doesn’t get into politics.
“I can say if we have more cuts, it will make it tougher to cover events like the [March 14] one,” he said.
Just recently, stations in Omaha, and Rapid City, South Dakota, suspended the launching of weather balloons because of cost, according to The Associated Press. Stations in Albany, New York, and Gray, Maine, recently quit sending their balloons skyward also. Weather Service balloons, which contain GPS tracking and a radio for transmitting data, cost about $350 each.
Weather balloons launched by the North Little Rock station are what alerted meteorologists to increase the March 14 warnings in Arkansas.
The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, a division of NOAA, predicted on March 9 that meteorological elements would combine — cold air from the north, desert winds from the west and humid Gulf moisture — to create the potential for storms.
Normally, the center issues its daily convective outlook report and indicates anything more than two days in advance is difficult to forecast.
This time, though, the outlook gave a week’s warning, placing northeast Arkansas in the “moderate” level. The center rates potential storm chances on a five-level scale. The first, the least dangerous, is “marginal.” The highest ranking is “high.”
The pre-March 14 ranking of “moderate” was the fourth highest level for storm potential.
For most of the week, Jonesboro and Memphis were in the area’s ‘bull’s-eye’ for the worst possibility for storms. Early on March 14, though, the area was moved slightly northeast into eastern Missouri and west central Illinois.
“It was a really big storm system that we had been tracking by satellite all week,” Cavanaugh said. “Most of the models showed it was packing incredibly strong winds.
“We knew this one had extreme wind energy,” he said.

Meteorologists continued monitoring the system as it trekked through Nebraska and dipped down into Oklahoma and then Arkansas that afternoon.
Cavanaugh said his station’s meteorologists launched several weather balloons that day to record air temperatures aloft. He wanted to determine if the “cap was breaking,” referring to an upper level of warm air that forms and saps energy from any potential storms. If the cap breaks, cold air rushes in and creates the turbulent supercells that could spawn tornadoes.
At 1:30 p.m. on March 14, Cavanaugh saw the cap had broken over Arkansas. He immediately issued a tornado watch for much of the state.
“When I saw what was happening, I told our meteorologist on duty that night that this had the potential to be a career-defining night,” he said.
In Jonesboro, county officials prepared to open its safe room in the recently finished new courthouse annex in downtown. The building, which houses additional courtrooms and a quorum court chambers, officially opened earlier in the month.
The safe room — the only one in the state maintained by a county government — can withstand winds of up to 250 miles per hour and can hold nearly 600 people.
Craighead County administrator Brandon Shrader said the county opened the safe room at 7:30 p.m. well before storms began rolling in.
“About 75 came in,” he said. “Then when storms began hitting around, we started seeing more.”
By the time an EF-4 tornado hit Diaz, a Jackson County town about 5 miles southwest of Jonesboro, there were 207 inside the Craighead County safe room.
The people crowded in and waited for the storms, watching storm coverage on KAIT, the local ABC-television affiliate, on three large screens mounted on the room’s walls.
The more violent storms hit Jonesboro at about 11:30 p.m. There were no tornadoes, though the weather service did report there were at least four twisters within about 20 miles of the city that night. Torrential rains, 60 mph winds and hail peppered the area for a while. Radar did indicate rotation, indicative of the formation of a tornado, over the NEA Baptist Hospital and near Brookland to the northeast of Jonesboro.
“We knew it was coming,” said Craighead County Office of Emergency Management director Anthony Coy. “We had a four-hour advance warning, but we didn’t expect that many people to come to the safe room though.”

Shrader said people called his office the following week to thank the county for providing the shelter. He said one person suffering from “storm anxiety” after riding out a devastating tornado in Jonesboro in 1968 was appreciative of the shelter.
Coy added that a March 2020 tornado that hit Jonesboro also created a higher level of awareness among residents.
“We know what to do,” Coy said. “Our safe room will provide more safety than what we had before.”
He also credited the advance warning meteorologists gave. Three people did die in a tornado in Cushman just north of Batesville, but he thought more people were aware of the impending storms than had been in previous storms.
The National Weather Service was even able to rate the tornado that hit Cave City as an EF-3 twister with winds of up to 165 miles per hour before survey teams inspected damage.
Cavanaugh said advances in radar — mainly in the dual-polarization Doppler radar — were able to determine how high debris was lifted into the air in the tornado’s path and how large the debris was to get an idea of the twister’s wind speeds.
Storm survey teams still went out in the week after March 14 and determined 15 tornadoes hit the state that evening.
Four days after a twister hit The Enclave, a high-end subdivision in southwestern Paragould, a man pushed a baby stroller along South 30th Street. He didn’t give his name, but said he knew a tornado was headed toward his neighborhood.
“We had plenty of time to get ready,” he said. “We knew bad weather was coming and we watched the coverage on [KAIT] as it came in.”
His family hunkered down in their storm shelter and waited. The winds spared their home, but scores of others just west of his were damaged. He said he was thankful for the advance warning.
The potential for cuts has weather officials worried those warnings may not be as advanced in the future.
Coy, who still second-guesses decisions he made in the wake of the sudden March 2020 tornado that hit Jonesboro, said he was anticipating even earlier storm detection methods in the future.
Advances in artificial intelligence could help forecasters, he said.
“They are incorporating AI in storm models now,” he said. “It can learn from data fed into it and could eventually provide even more lead time.
“But the National Weather Service was a strapped agency to begin with,” Coy added. “I don’t think the cuts will totally impact safety, but it could cut SkyWarn classes to teach spotters how to detect possible tornadoes, and it will cut the public services they produce.”
Under the Trump administration’s plans, the National Weather Service would function more as a “data-gathering” agency while private companies such as AccuWeather would issue public notices such as storm warnings.
During his previous administration, Trump nominated Barry Myers, the former CEO of AccuWeather, to lead NOAA. After two years of failed confirmation hearings, Myers withdrew from consideration in 2019.
Meteorologists also remember in 2019 the “Sharpiegate,” episode when Trump ignored Weather Service warnings for a hurricane headed for the Gulf coast. Trump used a Sharpie pen to draw on a map of the country an area for potential damage from Hurricane Dorian and included Alabama. Weather service meteorologists said that was not true and issued a public statement refuting Trump’s predictions after receiving scores of calls.
“You can’t totally replace the National Weather Service,” Coy said. “But these cuts will hurt the things that you don’t see. It will impact infrastructural upgrades that could even better improve radar and give us even more warnings.”

(Capital-Star photo by Peter Hall)The Shapiro administration is reviewing President Donald Trump’s sweeping executive order that overhauls U.S. elections. Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt said Thursday Gov. Josh Shapiro will do everything in his power to protect voting rights.
“There’s a lot there for us to assess, whether it’s from providing in person, documentation of citizenship when registering to voting, to what voting systems can be certified,” Schmidt said in a press briefing on Trump administration cuts to a federal agency that monitors and warns states of threats to election security.
While an executive order could not overrule federal and state election law, staff at the Pennsylvania Department of State and Gov. Josh Shapiro’s Office of General Council are working to identify possible consequences and what issues could be litigated, Schmidt said.
Trump signed the order Tuesday requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. It’s aligned with the president’s  campaign trail rhetoric about non citizens voting in federal elections and his strongarm tactics on immigration.
U.S.House Republicans have prioritized passing the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE Act, which would codify parts of the order. Trump’s order uses the threat of losing federal funding to compel states to comply. It directs the Election Assistance Commission, which distributes federal grants, to require people registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship such as a passport or state-issued ID. 
Last week, Schmidt warned U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that cuts to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency program that helps monitor and prepare for election threats will “make elections less secure.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Thursday, Schmidt said the resources CISA provides aren’t available anywhere else and withdrawing them will affect the state and counties’ capabilities.
“They participated in our election threat task force that Governor Shapiro set up in advance of the 2024 election, so that federal, state and local partners were in regular communication with one another,” Schmidt said.
“We saw the value of that … when we did have some threats targeting our county election operations on Election Day,” he said.
Several county election offices received bomb threats around the time polls closed on Nov. 5. In the week before the election, a fake video showing mail-in ballots cast for Trump and Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) being destroyed and thrown away was linked to a Russian disinformation campaign.
“CISA was able to quickly identify not only that it was fraudulent, but also the source of it, so that we could share with our counties and we could share with the public so confidence in the election wasn’t undermined,” Schmidt said.
Suzanne Spaulding was under secretary for cybersecurity and infrastructure at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. CISA is responsible for protecting assets, systems and networks “necessary for our ways of life,” Spaulding said in the press briefing.
“It’s clear that election infrastructure meets that definition, and it was officially designated as critical infrastructure in 2017,” she said, noting that Trump’s latest order maintains that definition.

The election security mission took on heightened importance in 2016 when the presidential election brought a marked uptick in cyber espionage, Spaulding said. Primarily from Russia, it targeted election infrastructure ranging from voter registration processes and databases, ballot preparation, tabulation, reporting results and news wire services that informed the public.
Initial efforts to help state and local governments safeguard their systems were met with skepticism from officials who were wary of a federal takeover of elections, Spaulding said.Over the following eight years, CISA worked to build trust by providing nonpartisan assistance over a range of election-related cyber, physical and informational realms.
“Sadly, the election security work related work at CISA seems to have stopped. The men and women who are doing this vital work at CISA have been placed on administrative leave. The funding has been eliminated,” Spaulding said.
Deborah McCarthy, former U.S. ambassador to Lithuania, lead a team at the United Nations negotiating an international treaty to allow American law enforcement to pursue cyber criminals around the world. Russia remains a serious threat to cyber security, she said, but Iran and China have also shown clear intent to influence elections through fake social media posts and phony news reports and by building relationships with state and local officials. 
China has also engaged in cyber attacks on U.S. communications infrastructure.
“Now they’ve penetrated our U.S. telecoms companies and internet providers, accessing messages, text messages, IP addresses and, in some cases, audio recordings. It’s unclear what they’re going to do with this information, but they hold a lot and they’re still present,” McCarthy said.
Asked why the Trump administration implemented cuts to the election security program, Schmidt said they are aligned with the false perception that election administrators are adversaries.
“I can’t really speak to their motives,” Schmidt said. “I can’t really speak to their thought process. But clearly, the fact is that election administration has been perceived as being partisan, political and seeking to influence the outcome of elections, which is not the case in Pennsylvania.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_5321-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 20:01:50.875663

Henry Helgerson, seen during a March 11, 2025, session of the House, warned the state is in ""a financial mess."" (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The House adopted a spending plan Thursday that puts the state on a course to blow through billions in reserves and face a budget shortfall within three years.
Senate Bill 125 finalizes $27.08 billion in spending plans for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and provides the blueprint for how the state will spent $25.6 billion next year. Those figures include $10.85 billion from the State General Fund in the current year and $10.64 billion next year.
When coupled with the five-year, $2 billion slash to income taxes from last year’s special session, and assorted new legislation that would deliver tax cuts, the state would be an estimate $461 million in the red in fiscal year 2028. That would be a stark departure from the $3.2 billion surplus from a year ago, which is already projected to decline to $2.1 billion as expenses for the current fiscal year exceed revenues.
Rep. Henry Helgerson, an Eastborough Democrat, said the state was in “a financial mess.” He warned House members they were “going to come to loggerheads with a new governor” as a result of last year’s tax cuts and an appetite for spending that was created by federal COVID-19 aid.
“The chickens are coming home to roost, and we are in a hole,” Helgerson said.
Rep. Troy Waymaster, a Bunker Hill Republican who chairs the budget committee, acknowledged “a tough road ahead.”
“That’s the reason why we had the new legislative budget process,” Waymaster said, referencing the decision by lawmakers to ignore the governor’s budget proposal and make their own.
The House adopted the budget on an 89-36 vote. The Senate planned to take action Thursday night.
Senate Democrats expressed concerns in a caucus meeting Thursday about the abbreviated schedule for the legislative session. A revenue forecast in late April will show the full impact of income tax cuts passed during a special session last year, but lawmakers are set to wrap up business April 11.
“This is deliberate that we pass things without having knowledge,” said Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes.
Republicans pressed forward with their budget, which attaches numerous policy strings to the money allocated to state agencies, universities, boards and other government entities. The provisos include directives to ban the use of gender-identifying pronouns in state employee email signatures and to stamp out any diversity, equity and inclusion positions, mandates, policies, programs, activities and training.
Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Shawnee Democrat, said it was “troubling” that the state would hold Department of Administration funding hostage until the agency showed it had implemented the directives.
“I don’t know what it’s satisfying or who it’s satisfying,” Ruiz said.
Other provisos will end continuous eligibility for Medicaid recipients, ban purchases of candy and soda with money for food assistance, raise the rent of journalists who work from the Statehouse, allow the state treasurer to invest rainy day funds, authorize the Kansas Developmental Finance Authority to issue STAR bonds, and prohibit Larned State Hospital from using contract agency nursing staff in 2027.
Lawmakers got rid of a proposed mandate that all executive branch employees work from the office, opting instead for a requirement that state agencies report how many employees are working from home.
The budget would fully fund public schools but eliminates funding for training and other items not required under the school finance legal settlement. It also provides just $10 million in new funding for special education services, short of the $73 million commitment made a year ago.
Spending items include the allocation of $106.3 million for state employees, mostly for 2.5% wage increases, $5.8 million for a top-secret military weapons project in Wichita, $24.9 million for a new Kansas Highway Patrol dispatch center in Salina, $19.3 million to complete renovation of the Docking Building, $10 million for firearm detection software in public schools, $179 million for local bridge construction, $71.2 million for a Wichita Biomedical Campus, $41.3 million for an Ag Innovation Initiative at Kansas State University, and $30 million for a Health Science Education Center at Wichita State University.
The budget eliminates funding for the Blueprint for Literacy, an initiative the Legislature adopted last year to train teachers and improve reading levels. The program is a collaboration among the Kansas Board of Regents, Kansas State Board of Education, state universities and K-12 teachers.
Rep. Nikki McDonald, an Olathe Democrat who serves on the Blueprint for Literacy advisory committee, said she was “ashamed” the Legislature would defund the initiative.
“It’s insulting to the work that we’ve done in good faith, and the more I talk about it, the more mad I get,” McDonald said. “So I think I’m just going to leave by saying a budget is a reflection of our priorities, and I had hoped that we would prioritize our children more.”
The budget also calls for the state to take on $128 million in debt for a veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Manhattan and $80 million in debt for a new Kansas Bureau of Investigation headquarters in downtown Topeka.
Adam Proffitt, the state budget director, told Senate Democrats that Republicans had taken “an across-the-board shotgun approach” to trimming the budget that lacks strategic planning. And he said he was concerned about adding debt after spending the past few years trying to pay it down.
“Now we’re going in the wrong direction,” Proffitt said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3111056-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-27 20:01:50.875663

(Getty Images)A bill that would strengthen state regulators’ ability to deny and revoke wastewater permits for those who have a demonstrated history of noncompliance with environmental regulations was filed in the Arkansas Senate last week.
Senate Bill 557, sponsored by Sen. Mark Johnson, would also broaden public notice requirements for new permits or major modifications to existing ones by requiring the state to provide a written notice to residents and property owners within the same Zip Code as the proposed or existing facility. 
Currently, for wastewater permits, the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment’s Division of Environmental Quality is only required to place a notice within a “newspaper of general circulation” in the county where the facility will be or is located.
The proposed legislation says DEQ “may deny a permit relating to wastewater if the applicant has a history of noncompliance with environmental regulations, whether at the applicant’s site or at any other permitted or unpermitted facility in this state.”
It goes on to list specific examples of what such noncompliance could look like, such as, “noncompliance that is recorded on inspections or other compliance activities performed by the division,” or “a demonstrated history by the applicant of submitting incomplete or deficient permit application information.” 
It also lists consent administrative orders (CAOs) as examples of noncompliance and would apply to companies or entities “whose ownership includes individuals who own at least five percent (5%) of the applicant and who own or have owned at least five percent (5%) of any other entity that has a history of noncompliance with environmental regulations.”
The bill would also add a requirement that DEQ deny permits to applicants with a history of noncompliance if the applicant has had five or more “events of noncompliance with environmental regulations” within the previous five years.
Johnson called the proposal his “bad actor bill,” and said it is specifically targeted toward land developers who install what he described as low-quality sewage treatment equipment called package wastewater treatment systems that would discharge insufficiently treated wastewater into ephemeral streams or across people’s yards.
He compared what his bill would do to what states already do with driver’s licenses.
“You get, you know, 23 speeding tickets, and they take it away from you,” Johnson said. “I don’t think people ought to be able to just thumb their nose at the law and the regulations.”
If enacted as written, the bill also could have ramifications for large industrial dischargers down to small municipal wastewater treatment plants.
For example, the Lanxess Corporation, which operates three facilities for bromine extraction in South Arkansas and has active wastewater permits, has entered into 11 separate CAOs with DEQ over the last five years, with CAOs applying to multiple Lanxess facilities counting as one. 
Those CAOs also include air permit violations, and the bill filed by Johnson isn’t clear on whether violations of air or land disposal permits would count toward a history of noncompliance where wastewater permits are concerned. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Johnson didn’t rule out amending the bill if other industries had concerns, saying that he had tried to tailor it to wastewater issues caused by property development in rural areas. He said such concerns are why bills can be amended after they are introduced, that if it wasn’t for the “law of unintended consequences,” the legislative session would not be as long as it is.
“Clean water is probably the most important thing that we can deal with,” Johnson said.
Al Drinkwater, a retired environmental consultant and former employee of the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology, one of DEQ’s predecessor agencies, is involved with the Pinnacle Mountain Community Coalition, which has rallied against developments in rural Pulaski County, frequently citing water pollution concerns. One of the developers in the area, he said, has had multiple noncompliance issues with environmental regulators.
“In the process of getting to this point, we’ve had a number of conversations with other involved people, some of the people at the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality and others, about the problem that we have with people that go out and have violation after violation after violation,” Drinkwater said. “And there’s no rule that the department has to say, ‘Look, you’re a bad actor, we’re not going to continue to play with you.’”
Drinkwater said the bill would make sure DEQ considers the “history” of a permit applicant when making permit issuance or reissuance decisions.
Arkansas leaders approve multimillion-dollar water projects, note progress despite high costs

Last year, DEQ saw a significant increase in consent administrative orders —  a kind of voluntary enforcement settlement —  issued by the Office of Water Quality. The increase was driven by noncompliance with wastewater permits, a DEQ spokesperson said in January. 
Many of those CAOs were between DEQ and municipal wastewater systems that consistently were not meeting the discharge quality requirements specified in their permits.
This is the second bill filed in the last month with language that could force an environmental permit revocation. Rep. Brad Hall, R-Alma, filed a bill two weeks ago that would automatically revoke the permits of an entity permitted to land-apply industrial poultry waste as fertilizer, if that facility violated its permits three or more times within a 45 day period.
Hall said in an interview with the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette last month that his bill was specifically targeted at Denali Water Solutions. Denali has been out of compliance with its permits multiple times over the last year due to its land-applying of industrial waste from poultry processors and similar facilities onto fields when the chance of rain is greater than 50%, which is prohibited under state no-discharge permits.
A Denali spokesperson said they were aware of the bill and had no comment other than to say that “we are working with legislators, agency officials and industry partners to satisfy all concerns.”
SB 557 would also require DEQ to create a way that local officials “responding to a sewage or storm water emergency” could get “immediate access to personnel of the division for technical support.”
Lastly, the bill would prohibit discharges into ephemeral or intermittent streams, overflows onto the private property of another, or “any situation in which the normal course of discharge shall result in accumulation of wastewater in areas outside of the stream or waterway.”

Even after the Senate amended the bill to avoid fully repealing minimum child-to-staff ratios, many child care advocates remained opposed to the bill — worrying that loosening regulations will risk harm to kids. 
Idaho’s existing child-to-staff ratios are the 41st loosest in the nation, compared to all 50 states and the District of Columbia, a report by Idaho Voices for Children found. In other words, Idaho’s existing state-set child care standards let individual staffers care for more children at a given time than most states. 
The new law will leave Idaho with the 45th least stringent child-to-staff ratios in the nation, Idaho Voices for Children Executive Director Christine Tiddens previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.
The bill was cosponsored by Republican lawmakers Reps. Barbara Ehardt, from Idaho Falls, and Rod Furniss, from Rigby, and Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene.

The bill will retain the state’s points-based ratio that only allows up to 12-points, determined by kids’ ages, per each staff member. But the underlying points for kids would almost all be reduced.
Here’s how the bill will change Idaho’s child-to-staff ratio standards:

Each child under 24 months old would remain at two points.
Each child at least 24 months old but younger than 36 months would be 1.33 points. That is a decrease from the current 1.5 points in Idaho law.
Each child at least 36 months old but younger than 5 years old would be 0.923 points. That is a decrease from 1 point in Idaho law.
Each child at least 5 years old but younger than 13 years old would be 0.48 points. That is a decrease from 0.5 points in Idaho law.

The curtailment order was in place for about three weeks until the two sides reached an agreement that resolved the issue for 2024. The two sides then continued negotiations until the Surface Water Coalition and Idaho Groundwater Association reached a long-term settlement agreement last fall.
Then, in conjunction with his Jan. 6 State of the State address, Idaho Gov. Brad Little called for spending $30 million on water projects to increase water levels in the aquifer and support the settlement agreement.

 Idaho legislators make the case for water projects funding 

Several legislators stood up on the House floor and made passionate speeches in favor of approving the funding and the budget.
“Water is the lifeblood of our state,” Rep. David Cannon, R-Blackfoot, said. “Water is the lifeblood of my legislative district. There is no more urgent issue in the immediate term or in the medium term or in the long term to the state of Idaho than water. And in my view, House Bill 445, is one of the most important bills to come through this session. And I urge unity. I urge the state to join together on this issue for the betterment of Idaho and for the protection of Idaho water going forward.”

Rep. Stephanie Mickelsen, an Idaho Falls Republican and chair of the Idaho Ground Water Appropriators, said there are more water projects than there is money to go around, and many projects take multiple years to complete. But Mickelsen said legislators have a responsibility to protect water resources. She described investments in water projects as investments in the state’s overall economy. 
“I had ancestors that came and dug the very beginning of the canals in Taylor, Idaho,” Mickelsen said. “And now I sit here and I look and we’re not going to sacrifice anything to keep these waterways and this aquifer healthy? We could have the problems of the Ogallala (Aquifer) that are in Nebraska and Kansas, and they are a declining resource that they may not be able to save. The lucky thing for Idaho is we have plenty of water, but we have to make the investment to protect the resource that we have.”
  How will the water projects be prioritized under the bill? 

Not every legislator agreed with spending the money, however.

“I understand the importance of water in our state,” Rep. David Leavitt, R-Idaho Falls, said. “It is the lifeblood of our state. It’s what makes everything function, every single industry. But the reality is this is $30 million. This is a massive amount of money. And with this money, we don’t know where it’s going to be spent.”
Several legislators pushed back, saying it is not true that the state doesn’t know where the money is going or what the projects are for.

Hopefully someday I can afford to live on it, too,” Regier told reporters during a press availability this week. “But [&#8230;]","Somers Beach State Park on Flathead Lake. (Provided by Montana FWP for the Daily Montanan)Senate President Matt Regier grew up learning to water ski on Flathead Lake — the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi — as did many of his constituents. 
“I have friends that live there. Hopefully someday I can afford to live on it, too,” Regier told reporters during a press availability this week. “But Flathead Lake is not just for the people around it. Tourism is a big draw for the Flathead Valley. And when you have a problem like we did two years ago with lake levels and not being able to put boats in, I mean, that’s just the start of it.”
Regier presented Joint Resolution 18 to the Senate Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday, which requests that water managers consider recreation to be as important as other priorities when making decisions about Flathead Lake. 
In late June 2023, water levels on Flathead Lake were historically low — nine inches below the lake’s full-pool mark and a foot below the 23-year median, according to U.S. Geological Survey data — and causing problems for businesses and recreational users. 
Requests to raise the lake level, made to the inter-agency team that coordinates dams across the Columbia River Basin, were denied, as water managers had to balance multiple uses including flood control, wildlife management and irrigation — not just recreation. 
“I needed to do something to stand up for my constituents, especially back home, (to show) how vital having water in Flathead Lake is,” Regier told reporters. “I always speak for my constituents, but this is special to them.”
Regier cited comments from Gov. Greg Gianforte made that year about the importance of the lake to the region’s economic vitality — roughly $600 million is spent from anglers, boaters and other tourists in Flathead County alone, according to a University of Montana study. 
During a normal year, the dam-controlled lake fills up during the spring runoff by mid-June and tends to stay level throughout the summer months. 
In 2023, however, low snowpack and regional drought conditions prevented the lake from reaching full-pool levels.
According to the University of Montana’s Flathead Lake Biological Station — which operates from a campus on the east side of the lake — snowpack the previous winter was just 80% of the long-term average, and an unusually warm May led to a rapid meltout. 
Flathead Lake Biological Station Director Jim Elser said inflows from the main stem Flathead River, which is the primary source for the lake, was between 34% and 60% throughout the year.
With so little water entering the lake, levels continued to drop, ultimately reaching a full two feet below full pool, which is 2,893. 
Low water levels affected boat and business owners around the lake, according to the Flathead Beacon, as many public and private boat access sites couldn’t operate. Rental companies lost customers, too. 
Farmers upstream of the lake saw irrigation issues, as lake water often backs up the river to an elevation high enough to divert into sloughs, and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of crops were jeopardized. 
Efforts to address the problem ran up the ladder from county officials, to the governor and Montana’s Congressional delegation. 
One avenue considered was a plan to release water from Hungry Horse Reservoir located upstream.

Hungry Horse Dam, along with Se̓liš Ksanka Qĺispe̓ (SKQ) Dam, operated by Energy Keepers Inc., on behalf of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, are part of a network of 60 dams throughout the the Columbia River Basin. Many of the dams are operated by the Army Corps of Engineers or Bureau of Reclamation, but all of them are jointly coordinated to regulate flood control, energy generation, irrigation, streamflow for fish migration and recreation. 
An inter-agency Technical Management Team comprising representatives from four states, five federal agencies and six tribal nations, coordinates operations across the Columbia River Basin. A proposal by Gov. Greg Gianforte to fill Flathead Lake using water from Hungry Horse was considered, but ultimately found to be an inadequate solution, due to the risk of draining too much water from the reservoir during drought conditions. During the fall, water released from Hungry Horse augments the Flathead River to aid endangered Bull Trout. 
Many elected officials, including U.S. Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke lambasted the decision, accusing the Technical Management Team of prioritizing fish over people.
Zinke later introduced legislation to Congress that would require Flathead Lake to be held at full-pool capacity through Labor Day each year, but the legislation never got out of committee. 
Regier said during the committee hearing on Wednesday that he had considered similar legislation “with a lot more teeth than just a resolution” until he researched the intricacies involved in coordinating the water system of the Pacific Northwest.
“Once we started digging into that, there were a lot more players than I realized that were involved in water levels in Flathead Lake,” Regier said.  
The resolution put forward instead requests that “all decision-making bodies with an influence on the usability of Flathead Lake ensure that recreation needs be measured fairly compared to hydropower, fish, and irrigation demands,” and also requests that Flathead Lake Recreation be “expressly reflected” in the next iteration of the Columbia River Treaty. 
Negotiations to update the 61-year old treaty between the U.S. and Canada are currently paused due to President Donald Trump’s threats to Canada’s sovereignty.

 State of the lake

Management of Flathead Lake primarily rests with Energy Keepers Inc, the company that operates SKQ Dam.
Under the dam’s federal license, the lake is dropped to its lowest level during the winter, and has specific flood-risk limitation on how quickly the water level can be brought up during the spring runoff. 
In a February news release, Energy Keepers said that streamflow conditions in the Flathead Basin were “similar to 2023 and 2024” and the dam was being operated to increase the likelihood of meeting refill requirements. 
In both 2023 and 2024, the dam operators requested waivers from the Army Corps of Engineers to deviate from the normal process and begin filling the lake early in order to maximize capacity. 
The first water level benchmark to be released won’t come until mid-April, and Energy Keepers has not updated its forecast for the lake since Feb. 2.
Data from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service show that snowpack in northwest Montana is significantly better than in recent years. 
As of March 27, NRCS data indicated that snow water equivalent — the amount of moisture contained within the snowpack — across the Flathead Basin is at 96% of the 30-year median. Rain and snow are forecast during the next week in the area.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Somers-2-1024x612.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 20:01:50.875663

Brandon Beach, recently appointed U.S. Treasurer by President Donald Trump, amended a bill by Rep. Katie Dempsey to allow for wrongful conviction compensation when district attorneys are subsequently disqualified. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA bill that would grant compensation to wrongfully convicted Georgians was just given a second chance after lawmakers spliced it into a bill inspired by President Donald Trump’s election interference case in Georgia.
Senate Bill 244, which is aimed at allowing criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs if the prosecuting attorney in their case is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct, now includes the bulk of House Bill 533, which would establish a standardized process in Georgia state law for people who have been exonerated. It passed out of the House Judiciary Non-Civil Committee in a contentious vote Thursday afternoon.
House lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have faced an uphill battle in their efforts to properly compensate those who have been wrongfully incarcerated. The process is currently done on a case-by-case basis through individual compensation resolutions that must pass through the full legislative process like any other bill. Legislation to standardize the process was initially introduced by Atlanta Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb in 2022, and re-introduced in 2023, but his efforts have repeatedly been stalled in the Senate by Republican opposition. 
This year, HB 533, also known as the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act, was sponsored by Rome Republican Rep. Katie Dempsey. It passed through the House Judiciary Non-Civil Committee unanimously ahead of Crossover Day but never made it to a vote on the House floor. House lawmakers did, however, overwhelmingly pass a measure that included individual compensation resolutions for five people who served time in prison after being wrongfully convicted.
In contrast, SB 244 was sponsored by state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican and staunch Trump ally who was recently appointed by the president to serve as U.S. Treasurer. It was originally aimed solely at allowing criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs in the event that the prosecuting attorney in their case was disqualified as a result of “improper conduct.” The bill, Beach said, was inspired by Trump’s election interference case in Georgia, in which Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was disqualified after an appeals court judge found that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a “‘significant’ appearance of impropriety.” 
“When you think about somebody getting indicted, it’s somewhat of a scarlet letter,” Beach said at a committee hearing on the bill Tuesday. “It is tough. It can ruin your life, and it can definitely cost you a lot in attorney’s fees to defend yourself. And so I just am doing this so that people that have been wrongly accused and then the case goes away, they have some type of ability to recoup some of their fees and reasonable cost.”
Democratic lawmakers on the committee objected to Beach’s portion of the bill, pointing out that the bill would benefit Sen. Shawn Still, a Johns Creek Republican who was indicted in the Fulton County election interference case alongside Trump and 17 other codefendants. 
“My concern is that we are specifically aiding one of our colleagues, not to mention the issue that Rep. Dempsey and Rep. Holcomb’s bill is essentially being used, essentially, as political extortion,” said Rep. Esther Panitch, a Sandy Springs Democrat.
Democrats also raised concerns about the disproportionate impact the law would have on smaller counties with more limited budgets, as well as fears that local district attorneys could be discouraged from prosecuting complicated cases out of fear of having to cover the cost of defendant’s attorney fees, but they ultimately failed to successfully amend the bill.
 
Dempsey also made an effort to distance her language from Beach’s proposal as she presented the substitute bill to the committee.
“This is truly quite separate from the measure that Senator Beach has on the front,” Dempsey said. “This is a completely different conversation. We are not trying to target anyone. We are trying to take a process and make it fair and remove it from the hands of the Legislature and put it into administrative law judges’ hands, who are much better skilled and equipped to handle those decisions.”
Though Dempsey said she was grateful that the language regarding wrongful convictions has a second chance to pass through the Legislature this year, she admitted that it may be an uphill battle to get the bill through both chambers before the 2025 legislative session ends on April 4. 
But in its new form, she has reason to be optimistic, she said.
“This bill is a priority for Senator Beach,” Dempsey said, adding that he could be instrumental to the bill’s passage.

(Photo by Mia Maldonado/Idaho Capital Sun)A federal judge on Thursday evening temporarily blocked a new Idaho immigration law from taking effect.
The block was issued hours after the ACLU of Idaho on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the state of Idaho over a new policy Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law on Thursday, which allows law enforcement to record a person’s documentation status if they are suspected of a crime. 
Modeled after a controversial 2023 Texas law, House Bill 83, as amended, creates Idaho immigration crimes “illegal entry” and “illegal reentry,” targeting individuals who do not have proper immigration authorization and those who have already been deported from coming to Idaho. Law enforcement would only be able to convict someone of those crimes if they are suspected for a different crime. 
The law also creates the crime of “trafficking a dangerous illegal alien,” or knowingly transporting an unauthorized immigrant who has previously been convicted of a crime in the U.S. or another country. The law grants immunity to law enforcement, meaning they are protected from lawsuits that could arise from the damages and liability they cause while enforcing the law. 
As federal agencies tighten immigration enforcement, House Bill 83 represents Idaho’s own approach to address unauthorized immigration in the Gem State – where about 35,000 unauthorized immigrants live, according to a report from the University of Idaho’s McClure Center for Public Policy. 
However, the ACLU of Idaho anticipated the law taking effect, and it immediately sued. 
 About Idaho’s newest lawsuit: IORC v. Labrador

There are multiple plaintiffs in the case including the Idaho Organization of Resource Councils, an organization that promotes the safety, health and justice of immigrant communities. Another plaintiff includes The Alliance of Idaho, a nonprofit that provides low-cost immigration services to families in Blaine County. There are also five individual plaintiffs whose names are anonymous in the lawsuit for protection purposes, including four Mexican citizens and a Peruvian citizen who live in Idaho and Oregon, all of whom have children who are U.S. citizens. 
The defendants include Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador and 13 prosecuting attorneys who represent the counties that the plaintiffs live in, ACLU of Idaho spokesperson Rebecca De León told the Idaho Capital Sun. The lawsuit alleges House Bill 83 violates the U.S. Constitution in three ways. 
First, the plaintiffs allege the law violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which establishes that federal law overrides state law, including in immigration matters. 
“Courts in other states who have passed these laws have agreed with our legal argument, and we expect the court to do so here,” ACLU of Idaho legal director Paul Carlos Southwick said in a press conference, referring to immigration policies in Texas, Iowa and Oklahoma.
Second, the plaintiffs allege the law violates the Commerce Clause in the U.S. Constitution because it regulates people’s ability to enter into Idaho and imposes burdens on interstate and foreign commerce. 
Third, they argue the law is vague.
“This was a result of a lot of back and forth between the House and the Senate and deciding what version of this bill would pass, and unfortunately they cobbled together a version that is incomprehensible,” Southwick said. “And everyone, including our undocumented community, has a right to understand the law so that they know what the provisions of that law are and what they may or may not be violating.”
 Bill sponsors say law targets immigrant criminals. ACLU of Idaho disagrees.

Bill sponsors have said the bill’s purpose is to curb unauthorized migration and prevent dangerous unauthorized immigrants from entering Idaho. 
However, Southwick said the bill clearly does not just target criminals. 
“You do not have to have any criminal conviction in order to be arrested, detained or prosecuted for these crimes,” he said in a press conference. “Law enforcement merely needs suspicion that you have engaged in some kind of independent crime.”
Emily Croston, a staff attorney at the ACLU, agreed with Southwick. 
“It affects anyone who is stopped or accused of committing even minor crimes, so these could include littering, shoplifting or disturbing the peace,” she said. “So even if someone is never actually convicted for those minor crimes, if there’s suspicion against them, then the police are allowed to engage in prosecuting the H.B. 83 crimes.”
Croston said the law would discourage unauthorized immigrants from reporting crimes they’ve witnessed or are experiencing. 
Because the bill had an emergency clause, it went into effect immediately after the governor signed it. The court’s temporary restraining order issued Thursday evening will prevent the law’s enforcement for 14 days. The lawsuit has been assigned to federal Judge Amanda Brailsford, and a preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled at 10 a.m. April 10 at the James A. McClure Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Boise. A preliminary injunction could block the law’s enforcement throughout the litigation process.

(Getty Images)More than 180 religious or philosophical exemptions to the state’s school immunization requirements have been requested in the approximately two months since Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order, and all of the requests have been approved, health officials say. 
The West Virginia Department of Health released the number of exemptions approved this week in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from West Virginia Watch. The response included the number of requests, but no identifying information about the nature of the requests. 
Morrisey issued an executive order Jan. 14 directing the state, through the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act, to allow religious exemptions to the state’s vaccine requirements. The department said 186 exemptions have been made and approved between then and Monday.
All states require school children to be vaccinated against a number of infectious diseases, including measles, polio and chicken pox. Until January, West Virginia was among only five that did not allow religious or philosophical exemptions to those requirements. West Virginia state code currently allows only exemptions for children who have a medical reason, such as an allergy or a previous severe reaction to a vaccine. 
Morrisey’s executive order also directed the state health officer, a position that’s currently not filled, to come up with rules and legislation to facilitate religious exemptions. 
The state House of Delegates on Monday rejected Senate Bill 460, a bill Morrisey requested that would have established those religious exemptions in state code. 
Morrisey said Monday he would not rescind the order, setting up a potential clash between the state’s executive and legislative branches. The Department of Health said it would continue to abide by Morrisey’s order, despite the Legislature rejecting the bill. 
The Senate easily passed Senate Bill 460 last month with a vote of 20 to 12. In the House, the Health Committee had pared down the legislation, aiming to change the medical exemption process only. The religious exemptions were added back into the bill on the House floor last week.  
During an interview with HD Media’s Outside the Echo Chamber this week, House Health Committee Chair Evan Worrell, R-Cabell said that Senate Bill 460 is dead, but that lawmakers could continue to have conversations about whether to change the medical exemption process for vaccines. 
“I think ultimately some people had a lot of consternation around the religious exemption, that you could just write a letter and you could have that exemption,” Worrell said. “I personally believe that we should be able to do that, but that’s just my vote and that’s why we have this debate.”
The 186 exemptions represent a minuscule portion of the state’s school age population, estimated to be about 250,000. But it’s more than three times the 53 medical exemptions requested in 2023, according to a report from the state Department of Health.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) As Republicans move forward with their proposal to overhaul Iowa’s property tax system, House Democrats introduced their own property tax relief proposal Thursday: a $1,000 rebate for all Iowa homeowners and $500 rebate for renters.
In a news conference Thursday, Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said both Republicans and Democrats heard on the campaign trail that property tax costs were one of the top concerns for Iowans across the state. But he said the Republicans’ plan, House Study Bill 313 and Senate Study Bill 1208, will not necessarily guarantee lower property tax costs.

Jacoby said the Democrats’ bill, House File 691, would provide immediate relief through rebates, which would be funded using the Taxpayer Relief Fund, which currently holds $3.75 billion. Democrats also released another bill, House File 916, to expand the existing Homeowner Property Tax Credit, which freezes property tax rates, to all seniors over age 65.
“Over the years, as we’ve all door knocked and talked to people when we’re running for office, property taxes is one of the number one things that people bring up,” Jacoby said. “Their frustration is coming to a boiling point, because everything we’ve done to date has been totally ineffective. How many people’s — as homeowners — property taxes have gone down in the last 10 years? Nobody. The Democrats have a plan that puts the dollars right back into Iowans’ pockets.”
House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters Thursday that he had concerns about using the Taxpayer Relief Fund, which contains one-time money, for these rebates, as these funds will also be used to implement the income tax cuts enacted by Republicans in recent years.
“I would just want to be mindful of that to make sure that we don’t over commit to something, regardless of what the tax would be,” Grassley said. “We know right now that, that Taxpayer Relief Fund helps smooth any unforeseen things that happen as we reduce the tax to 3.8%, so I’d want to see what that direct proposal would look like and how that would impact the income tax cut.”
The GOP bill, proposed by Ways and Means chairs Rep. Bobby Kauffman, R-Wilton and Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, would remove Iowa’s “rollback” system that limits how much the aggregate taxable value of properties can grow each year. It would move the state to a “revenue-restricted” system, where taxable property value can grow by a larger margin, but would set new limits on how much local property tax levy rates can increase each year and how much new tax revenues could be collected by local governments.
Jacoby said the rollback system was first introduced in the 1970s as a way to lower property taxes in the face of the farm crisis and high inflation. He said as inflation remains a current concern, removing this system could lead to even higher costs for property owners especially as property valuations would be roughly doubled by removing the rollback. The residential property rollback rate was 47.4% in fiscal year 2026, meaning for a $100,000 home, only roughly $47,400 would be taxed.
“The way it’s laid out right now, there’s no guarantee that residential homeowners will see any decrease in their tax liability,” Jacoby said. “There’s no guarantee whatsoever.”
Jacoby said while Democrats support making changes to Iowa’s property tax system, lowering property taxes would have to involve providing state funding for costs that were shifted to local governments through the 2013 property tax legislation signed by former Gov. Terry Branstad. While state lawmakers had agreed at that time to backfill costs related to issues like health and public safety costs, Jacoby said the state did not end up providing funding for these measures, leading to higher property taxes.
He said a similar problem could arise with this year’s bill, which proposes shifting $426 million funding for K-12 schools currently paid for using property taxes to the state.
“In the 2013 bill, the agreement was with cities, counties and schools that the state would make the backfill from the decrease in the revenues,” Jacoby said. “The state abdicated on that promise from 2013, so I don’t trust state government to honor its commitment to the school districts to make up that difference.”

Grassley said Republicans were committed to providing the education funding contained in the property tax bill if it were to pass.
“When it comes to the funding aspect of it, I continue to remind Iowans we’re spending more money on education right now than we ever have as a state,” Grassley said. “… We’ve been pretty consistent that if we’re going to do it, we need to fund it. And that’s why this plan looks at that direct shift to the education piece, which affects all property taxpayers.”
The House speaker also emphasized that conversations were still ongoing on the Republican property tax proposal and that “no bill right now is set in stone.”
“When you’re looking at such a system that’s been in place as long as it has, it’s going to take time,” Grassley said. “And we need to be very deliberate in our approach to make sure we’re not only providing relief, but that is something that’s sustainable as well.”
