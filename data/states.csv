This story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on August 9.
CHELSEA — The grieving family of a Newbury, mother of four who was shot and killed by her father more than four years ago pleaded before a Vermont judge never to let her murderer live free in society again and to ensure the state places him in an appropriate institution.
“I’m not here asking for revenge. I’m asking for safety,” said Mason Rheaume, the eldest of Karina Rheaume’s four sons.
He was 18 years old when his mother was killed by a shotgun blast fired by her father, James Perry Jr., on the porch of Perry’s Newbury home in 2021. She had shown up at his door with a plate of cookies for a welfare check.
Karina Rheaume’s family has been reeling ever since the shooting and is now pressing Vermont officials to address the problem of inadequate state resources to handle people whose mental illness has led them to commit horrific crimes.
“Jim Perry must remain in a facility specifically designed for long-term psychiatric care — not a nursing home, not under the limited supervision,” Mason Rheaume said, stating that what his grandfather requires is “ongoing, lifelong oversight in a secure setting that protects him and those around him in the community.”
Mason Rheaume’s statement, along with others from his brother, their father and Karina’s sister were given in a packed courtroom in Chelsea before Superior Court Judge Daniel Richardson, after family friends and supporters contacted the county prosecutor’s office in recent weeks out of concern over Perry’s looming release from prison.
Perry, 74, was found not guilty by reason of insanity earlier this year in the shooting death of his 38-year-old daughter. A psychiatric evaluation concluded he had been “floridly psychotic with paranoid delusions and hallucinations” when he shot Karina at point-blank range with a 12-gauge shotgun on May 3, 2021, at his home on Deerfield Lane in Newbury.

Since the court’s insanity determination, which leaves Perry with no criminal record and with little agency oversight, the Orange County State’s Attorney’s Office and the state Mental Health Department have come under sharp criticism from Karina Rheaume’s family members and supporters who say the state does not do enough to protect victims and the public from the ongoing risk Perry presents to the community as well as himself.
When Emilie Perry, Karina Rheaume’s sister, learned that the options state officials were weighing for her father after his release from prison included his “uninhabitable” home in Newbury, a nursing home or a “hotel in Barre,” she called upon friends and supporters to write to the state attorney’s office to register their concern.
Within days, more than a hundred emails and letters were sent to Colin Seaman, the state attorney for Orange County.
“The court is well aware that this has become an item of great public interest,” Richardson acknowledged from the bench at the outset of the approximately 32-minute hearing, while also cautioning “misinformation” has also accompanied that concern.
Despite its reputation for progressive policies, critics have long contended that Vermont lacks adequate resources and facilities to handle people whose crimes are attributed to mental illness.
The lack of accommodations, for example, led to a Strafford man convicted of arson for burning down his cabin while suffering from delusions in 2023 spending 240 days in a Springfield prison. His attorney maintained his client needed treatment instead.
On Friday, supporters and family members of Karina Rheaume’s family filled every available spot on the visitors’ benches at the back of the second floor courtroom. A large-screen video monitor displayed phone icons of people watching remotely. Karina’s sons, dressed in suits and ties, and Karina’s sister Emilie, sat on the front bench, stifling tears when a family member went to the podium and addressed the judge.
“I urge you to consider the profound impact (Perry’s) actions have had on our family and the community,” Joshua Rheaume, Karina’s second oldest son, said. The unfathomable murder of his mother “point(s) to a deep-seated mental instability that requires long-term, intensive psychiatric care.”

My beautiful, kind big sister, the most loving and dedicated mother I have ever known. Her life matters.” Photo by Alex Driehaus/Valley News
Perry, shackled and wearing blue prison sweats, sat at the defense table next to his attorney, Mike Shane. With his hair cropped closely and beard trimmed and hooked up to a hearing aid, Perry appeared alert and compliant, a different visage from the gaunt, wide-eyed, straggly hair and thick, overgrown beard image in his booking photo after his arrest.
Perry’s criminal case ended with the insanity determination, Judge Richardson explained, and he is now in a “civil” phase meant to assess his mental health needs and treatment program. But those issues will be addressed at a future hearing, the judge said.
Family members said there can be no guarantee Perry will not relapse into psychosis.
“While his mental state may appear stable now, (Perry) is in a structured environment of incarceration,” Joshua Rheaume said. “What happens when he is released and faces the stresses and triggers of the outside world? The risk is too great. Our family, community and any potential future victims deserve the assurance of a more permanent solution.
Emilie Perry grasping a tissue and fighting back tears, recounted the disbelief of learning that it was possible her father could be essentially left on his own following the expiration of a 90-day “non-hospitalization order.”
“The shock of this email was so unbelievable that it didn’t seem like it could be real,” Emilie Perry said. “I wrote back saying that was insane and spent the following days calling the state’s attorney, the defense, the mental health department, and anyone I could think of to make sense of what was a horribly terrifying proposal by the courts.”
“To act like the court is working to protect (Perry’s) rights is not true if he’s not given placement in a safe (…) environment. It is cruel to set him up to be unable to take care of himself and put himself and others at risk,” she said.
Both Seaman, the Orange County state’s attorney, and Shane, Perry’s defense attorney, said state officials are working together at multiple agencies and levels to address the public’s concern.
Shane, before Friday’s hearing, said that the Department of Mental Health will extend that order of non-hospitalization “indefinitely” and “if there are issues” then the non-hospitalization order will convert to an “involuntary hospitalization order.”

“There is a really good plan coming together,” Shane said, noting that the Department of Mental Health, the State’s Attorney’s Office, the Judiciary’s Guardian ad Litem Program that advocates on behalf of children who are victims of crime “and our own experts” are “working collaboratively to find the best fit for (Perry’s) needs and the needs of the community. I think when the plan is presented everyone will feel better.”
After Friday’s hearing, on the green outside the courthouse in Chelsea, Joe Rheaume, the father of Karina’s children and her former husband, and Karen Tronsgard-Scott, executive director of the Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, both said there are “holes” in the way Vermont handles cases like Perry’s. Once it shifts to a civil matter victims have been excluded from the civil process phase of determining the offender’s fate.
“Victims should really have a seat at the table,” Tronsgard-Scott said. “They should be a part of every process in the courtroom.”
Joe Rheaume said the current system and civil phase needs to change.
“When you have a defendant who’s adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity and the next step is to just release them into society, I mean, everybody can logically think there’s something wrong with that,” Joe Rheaume said.
“There needs to be some kind of ramp or step-down program where this offender gets put into something secure, something semi-secure, anything,” he said.
Friday’s hearing, during which his family got to go on record with their victim impact statements, only happened as the result of the family’s persistence, Joe Rheaume noted.
“We’ve had to advocate for this. We’ve been pushing,” he said.
When it was pointed out that what he seeks requires the Vermont State Legislature to take up the matter and make law where none currently exists, Joe Rheaume acknowledged the challenge.
“That’s where this is going. That’s where we’re headed,” he replied.

For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government. The sale and possession of kratom is legal in Pennsylvania.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
States stiffen penalties for fentanyl, despite public health concerns

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
As Kratom Use Surges, Some States Enact Bans

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.

In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two years after police staged a chilling raid on the Marion County Record, the newspaper’s owner-editor remains committed to the hard-hitting journalism that made him a target.
And he wants his ongoing lawsuit against the city and county to hurt.
Eric Meyer appeared on the Kansas Reflector podcast to talk about how things have changed since the Aug. 11, 2023, raid, when police stormed the newsroom under the false pretense that a reporter had committed identity theft by looking up a driving record in a public online database. They took computers and reporters’ personal cellphones, acting outside the scope of a search warrant that was issued in disregard for the U.S. Constitution and state and federal laws that protect journalists.


The raid spawned one state and five federal lawsuits, as well as a criminal charge against Gideon Cody, the former police chief who led the raid. The legal action continues to unfold as attorneys battle in federal court and a hearing in Cody’s case is scheduled for this fall.

Following is an edited and abbreviated Q&A from the podcast with Meyer.
How has your life changed in the past two years?
You don’t have long enough in your podcast to explain it all. It has changed massively. In addition to the practical side of it, that I’ve had a lot of places I’ve gone, a lot of speeches I’ve given, a lot of other things that have gone on, but just the work of it. You know, this was my retirement gig. I was going to come here and do this part-time for fun.
What could be more fun than this?
Well, it is fun. I at one point said that my mother, who died as a result of the stress of the raid, had an opportunity at 98 to go out meaning something in her life. But it’s nice as a retiree to be out here doing something, of still meaning it somehow or another, trying to keep trying — maybe as Don Quixote — to keep journalism alive. But we are trying our hardest to not bow to pressures and still get good journalism out there. And it really is a battle.
What are some of the revelations that have come out since we last checked in with you about this time a year ago?
Not as many as you’d think. We’re still literally blocked from discovery in our federal court lawsuits, which means we can’t go out and interrogate people that we think have information that would be relevant to the case. And part of this is being able to figure out the degree to which political people, elected officials and others, helped push this raid along.
This is important because there’s sort of been a narrative at times to pin this all on one rogue police chief, but I think the evidence clearly shows that one guy can’t do this in isolation. It was a coordinated effort.
Exactly. And I really object when that thought comes up, that this was just Gideon Cody who did this. And yeah, he did a lot of it himself. But there were people within law enforcement who helped him, people in elected positions, people in judicial court positions, who could have and should have stopped him, and they didn’t. Now, was it because they were not courageous? They didn’t want to make waves? Or was it that they agreed with him? Or was it that that they were just incompetent to what’s going on? I don’t know. That would be nice to find out.
Where do things stand in your case?
It’s abundantly clear from the rulings of the judge so far in the case on various motions of dismissal that we’ve probably won the case.
The most telling of these things was we had sued the city of Marion for failing to provide training to its police officers about the Privacy Protection Act, which says that you’re supposed to get subpoenas, not warrants, to raid newsrooms. And the judge threw that out, saying any fool who’d be a cop should know this automatically and without requiring specialized training.
And there are overtures now to try to settle — some official, some unofficial. I’m eager to get the thing done. But there are things other than financial damages at stake here. So there needs to be some admissions. There need to be things that are reported to licensing authorities for police officers other than Gideon Cody.
Are you committed to not settling, to seeing this out through trial?
The real reason we wanted to go to trial was we wanted a ruling on the record that acknowledges that this is something you just don’t do. And if they are willing to provide that as a stipulation, we might accept that. This has never been about money.
This is about making sure that people understand what they did was wrong, admit that publicly. Set it as an example. And somehow or other, it needs to hurt. One of our concerns is that they’ll want to settle up to the limit of their insurance coverage. Well, that really means you did nothing. I mean, it really probably needs to go a little beyond insurance. Now, we don’t want to bankrupt the city or county of Marion by any manner or means. But something that has a little pain to it.
Do you feel like you still have strong community support?
I think everybody, including me, would like to see this over. But they’re very supportive of us. They just don’t like the fact that it looks like we’re hickville. And to be honest, I think that’s a very unfair assumption. I think that Marion and Marion County are not hickville. Some things that went on in Marion and Marion County that probably go on in a lot of other counties have been exposed. We just don’t hear about them in other counties.
And to an extent, Marion County should take pride in the fact there here, we’ve had a situation where somebody tried to trample on rights, and it didn’t happen. We fixed it. We’re in the process of fixing it. So you can take pride in that. It’s not where cops were stupid and raided a newsroom. It’s where somebody tried something stupid and, you know what? They didn’t get away with it. I think that’s a point of pride, but it would be nice to be known for something else.
I think it’s worth pointing out that accountability journalism put you in the crosshairs of police for this raid. But this is the role that journalists need to embrace, right, in this current climate?
Oh, absolutely.
I’m sorry to tell this to a group of people out there: There are facts. And some things are facts. And your opinion of the fact doesn’t change whether it’s a fact or not. And you have to pay attention to the nuances. You have to pay attention to the little things.
You and your late mother were inducted in the Kansas Press Association Hall of Fame last year. I went to the induction ceremony, where you gave this speech, shortly after the election in November, and you gave a sort of rallying cry to journalists. You said: “Make democracy great again.” Are journalists rising to meet this moment?
Some are, when they still have money to do it. I mean, closing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is going to silence a great number of people in public media. Corporations are going to take care of silencing a great number of people elsewhere.
We need to have people aggressively going out and finding out what’s wrong. We had a story this week: They applied a new coating of pavement to the main road that leads to Pilsen, which is the home of Emil Kapaun, the man who’s about to be sainted as a Korean War hero. And it didn’t stick, and the road is now basically untravellable. Did they tell us about it? No! We had to find out about it. And now it’s a game of finger-pointing.
Journalists have joined this Gen Z thing: “We don’t want to embarrass anybody. Oh, my goodness, somebody might take offense if we run this story.” And so they don’t want to do it, and their corporate bosses say, “Oh yeah, they might cancel their ads. Oh, we can’t do that.” So we make our news publications and news broadcasts and other things so dull that nobody wants to read them anymore or listen to them anymore.
I used to say this as a journalism professor — that’s why I came here in my retirement, was that I think there’s still a place in this world for regular, good old-fashioned journalism. And this is from somebody who taught online and stuff like that in school. I said, “We’ve wasted too much time worrying about that stuff, and not enough time worrying about the substance of what we’re reporting. And get out there and get interesting things that matter to people and tell us about them.”
So I said, “Well, I can’t solve it for the world, but maybe I can make a little demonstration project out here that we can try to do it. And of course, somebody says, “Yeah, and what happened to you: You get raided.” Yeah, that’s true. But the raiding gives us more attention.
I may be quixotic in some regards and Pollyannaish in another, but the raid drew attention to the fact that we’re actually trying to do good journalism. So there’s a positive outcome to the raid.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCoRecord-E-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-11 09:56:39.645044

At left is Mitch Meyers, partner at BeLeaf Medical marijuana company (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).Missouri cannabis business owners who have had their license revoked for violating state rules could be prohibited from getting another license under proposed rules announced by state regulators last week. 
The Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation released the draft of a massive overhaul of cannabis rules giving regulators more authority to address a range of issues, including predatory practices in the state’s social-equity cannabis licenses, product recalls involving hemp-derived THC and non-compliant owners obtaining other licenses.
“We have found over the years that there’s really not a lot of structure or authority in rule… for us to address individuals in ownership or potential ownership who have been found to be either violating regulations themselves or responsible for those who are violating rules,” Amy Moore, director of the division, told The Independent Friday. “We have found that that is a gap.”
Among the rule revisions, Moore said, is a requirement for businesses to have mechanisms in place to remove owners who are responsible for violating state regulations. 
Missouri cannabis regulators announce new rules to target ‘predatory’ contracts

The changes cover so much ground, Moore said, because the division hasn’t made any rule alterations since the recreational marijuana constitutional amendment passed in 2022.
“It’s the things that we’ve learned over time,” she said, “and found it needed improvement or needed to be fixed. Hopefully we’re not missing anything.” 
Aside from revisions, a brand new rule released Thursday would establish an unlimited number of research licenses to study cannabis in Missouri.
The public can submit the feedback on the division’s website until Aug. 21, and regulators will then review them and decide if they want to formally submit the rules to the Secretary of State’s Office. 
Moore said if her team decides to move forward, they would like to do it “quickly.”
“If I thought, ‘Okay, we’ve solved everybody’s concern’…we could have it done in a couple weeks,” she said, “but we want to be sure that we are open to all the feedback and that we really consider it all.”
 Delta Extraction case

Nearly a year after the state stripped Robertsville-based Delta Extraction of its license in November 2023, regulators approved one of the company’s co-owners — AJO LLC — to take over a cultivation and manufacturing facility in Waynesville in May 2024. It’s a far bigger operation than Delta Extraction, and it also involves several dispensaries as well.
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the division, told The Independent in May that the rules currently do not prohibit individuals who have had a license revoked from acquiring another license. 
Moore said Friday that the new rules would give the division “a much better standing” to deny an application for a license for an owner who’s been noncompliant previously. 
She hopes it gives licensees “fair warning” when choosing future business partners.
“That’s part of why these new rules are so important,” she said. “This rule gives them a big heads up that that’s not going to work out for them, and they shouldn’t make that investment and get themselves tied up with individuals who have had previous non compliance.”
Co-owners of Missouri company at center of marijuana recall got green light for another license

It also establishes an annual review of ownership for every license. 
In February, Delta lost its appeal to get its license back, with Missouri’s administrative hearing commission concluding it had a “corporate culture of lax compliance with regulatory requirements.”
The scathing 137-page ruling, issued by Commissioner Carole Iles, informed the revisions released Thursday, Moore said. 
Iles agreed with the division that the company’s practice of bringing in hemp-derived THC concentrate from other states and adding it to Missouri-grown marijuana products was a violation of state law. 
“What this is doing is clarifying what we believe has always been in our rules and I think the Delta Extraction order from AHC confirms that that is what our rules mean…” Moore said, “that all the THC and THCA and those types of compounds need to originate from cannabis grown in our licensed facilities.”
 Microbusiness ‘fronts’

The microbusiness program, which was written into the Missouri 2022 constitutional amendment that legalized marijuana, was designed for the licenses to end up in the hands of disadvantaged business owners. The eligibility criteria includes disabled veterans, those with lower incomes and people with non-violent marijuana offenses.
Since the program began in 2023, the division has struggled to prevent what some legal experts have called “fronts,” or arrangements where the profits and ownership weren’t going to people that regulators had certified were eligible. 
Of the 96 microbusiness licenses issued so far, regulators have revoked 34. 
For the last two years, The Independent has documented the pattern of well-connected groups and individuals flooding the microbusiness lottery by recruiting people to submit applications and then offering them contracts that limited their profit and control of the business. A majority of the revoked licenses followed this pattern.
These kinds of agreements violate the constitutional requirement that the license be “majority owned and operated” by eligible individuals, Moore explained at a division town hall meeting in February. 
“It is not sustainable to keep going through rounds of license issuance and then having to do rounds of revocations,” she said in February. “We’re never going to get this market fully built out.”
The division first released rule changes for microbusiness licenses in December. The draft released Thursday includes some of the feedback the division received this winter, Moore said, but retained the core elements.

The designated contact for a microbusiness applicant must still be an eligible individual contributing to the majority ownership of the microbusiness license. And any entity who was the designated contact for a license that was previously revoked for failure to comply with the ownership and operation requirements may not be allowed to be involved in any capacity in a future microbusiness application.  
In order to prevent numerous revocations, the division is proposing to adjust when its extensive application-review period occurs. 
“Those adjustments really clarify what we are actually accomplishing here, which is ensuring that these licenses are held by eligible individuals,” Moore said. “And I think everyone really should agree that that’s the goal. I think the language that they have now is better focused on doing that.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_3084-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 09:56:39.645044

Today marks the first day of a planned three-day trial to determine whether the U.S. military unlawfully carried out civilian law enforcement when it was deployed to Los Angeles under President Donald Trump.
As CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn explains, a California federal district court will take up the matter, which stems from a June lawsuit Gov. Gavin Newsom filed against Trump after the president federalized California’s National Guard in response to demonstrators protesting against immigration raids in L.A. 
Lawyers for the state argue that the military violated a federal law that limits the use of the military in civilian settings. They point out that if the military can accompany immigration enforcement agents in their raids, it sets a precedent that authorizes it to accompany other law enforcement agents while they perform their duties, such as federal food safety inspectors.
The Trump administration says what the military did in L.A. doesn’t count as law enforcement. And because the law limiting military engagement is also a criminal statute, it cannot be invoked by the state since this lawsuit is a civil case.

Speaking of Trump: 

Feds request lift on immigration raids ban: The Trump administration is seeking help from the U.S. Supreme Court by asking it to lift a temporary restraining order, issued by a district court in July, that blocks immigration enforcement agents from conducting raids without “reasonable suspicion” in L.A. and other California counties. In its emergency appeal filed last week, the federal government said that the order is a major barrier to enforcing federal immigration laws. Read more from CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos.


Redistricting battle: Newsom on Friday gathered with Democratic lawmakers from Texas in Sacramento to again promote his plan to redraw California’s congressional maps. To counteract Texas Republicans’ plans to redistrict its maps in a way that benefits the GOP in the 2026 midterm elections, Newsom is proposing to call a special election to allow California voters to approve or reject a new map that would strengthen the chances of Democrats flipping Republican-leaning districts. The state Legislature is expected to take up the issue when it reconvenes from summer break on Aug. 18. Read more from CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.

Under California’s conflict of interest rules, however, these contracts can be seen as problematic: Atkins has equal ownership of her spouse’s assets through marriage, meaning that she earns hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from entities that could soon be vying for her sway if she is elected governor next year.

Trump’s chilling effect on international students

Some international students attending college in California are living in fear and censoring themselves as the threat of deportation looms under the Trump administration, writes Emewodesh Eshete of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.
As part of his effort to cut back on immigration and combat alleged antisemitism, Trump issued an executive order in January that resulted in hundreds of international students losing their student status. Though many had their statuses reinstated in April after challenging the order in court, some international students in California are afraid that it will happen again. 
Some told Emewodesh that they have changed their involvement in campus activities, revised the topics they include in their research projects and scrubbed their social media presence.
Campus institutions are also responding to the chilling effect: The editor-in-chief of UC Davis’ student newspaper, for instance, said the outlet is more open to removing articles for the sake of protecting the status of international students.

The Delaware Department of Labor is launching a new initiative aimed at strengthening employment opportunities and protections for the state’s youngest workers.
The “Delaware Youth Workforce Connect Call,” a monthly virtual series organized by the Department’s Division of Industrial Affairs, will debut on Thursday, August 21.
The series is designed to connect community organizations, educators, employers, and state agencies to share resources, provide updates, and support youth employment across Delaware.

The initiative will focus on workers between the ages of 14 and 17, with the goal of educating both employers and young employees about workplace rights, safety, and job readiness.
“Our mission is to ensure Delaware employers understand their responsibilities while safeguarding the rights of workers — especially our youngest members of our workforce,” said Secretary of the Delaware Department of Labor LaKresha Moultrie. “The Delaware Youth Workforce Connect Call creates a space for collaboration, resource sharing, and compliance education that benefits both youth workers and employers.”
The first session will take place via Microsoft Teams from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. and will feature a presentation on child labor laws, legislative updates affecting youth employment, and a preview of upcoming events aimed at preparing young people for the workforce.
In addition to presentations from labor officials, the sessions will offer a platform for participants to exchange tools, best practices, and ideas to promote safe and productive work environments for teens.

Atkins and her spouse, Jennifer LeSar, earn hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from clients that also lobby state government.","In summary
If elected governor, Toni Atkins faces potential conflicts of interest with her spouse’s consulting firms. Atkins and her spouse, Jennifer LeSar, earn hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from clients that also lobby state government.


If former state Senate leader Toni Atkins is elected governor next year, she would oversee a state contract that puts money in her own pocket.
Following a directive from Gov. Gavin Newsom to develop state-owned properties for affordable housing, the California Department of General Services in 2020 hired a consulting firm to help prioritize sites, conduct market research and evaluate applications from contractors.
That firm, LeSar Development Consultants, is owned by Atkins’ spouse, Jennifer LeSar. And because of California’s community property law that gives couples equal ownership of assets in their marriage, the $1 million contract — which was reupped in February through 2028 — has been worth tens of thousands of dollars to Atkins, according to financial disclosures.
It’s just one of the potential conflicts of interest with her spouse’s business dealings that Atkins faces as she seeks the most powerful office in California. Nearly half of the major clients last year at LeSar’s companies employed lobbyists to influence government policy.
Disclosure forms filed by Atkins and LeSar list 51 different entities, including the Department of General Services, from which they received more than $10,000 in income last year through LeSar Development Consultants, LeSar Support Services, LeSar Holdings, Inc. or Global Policy Leadership Academy — all firms for which LeSar serves as president or CEO.
A CalMatters analysis found that 24 of those clients are registered lobbyist employers. They include the counties of Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange, the cities of San Jose, Oakland, and Palm Springs, the insurance provider Elevance Health, the Bay Area homelessness advocacy group All Home and the homebuilder Brookfield Residential.
That means Atkins earns hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from entities that could soon be asking for her signature or veto on priority legislation, requesting funding in her state budget proposals or applying for contracts with her administration.
“People who have business before the state could be using the potential governor’s spouse as an advocate, essentially,” said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School and former president of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission.
No plan for Atkins on managing conflict
Atkins declined an interview request to discuss how she would handle conflicts of interest as governor. She did not say she would take any specific steps to insulate herself from LeSar’s business dealings or make any changes to their current arrangement.
“Toni is proud of her spouse Jen’s decades of work to expand access to affordable housing in California,” spokesperson Danni Wang said in a statement. “Throughout her leadership in both the Assembly and the Senate, Toni has maintained high ethical standards, prioritizing transparency and avoiding any conflicts of interest. If elected governor, she will continue to uphold those same principles and ensure that every decision is made in the best interest of Californians.”
California’s conflict of interest rules disqualify public officials from participating in governmental decisions that would foreseeably have an impact on their personal finances, though there is an exception if the potential effect does not benefit the official any more than it would the general public. 
Atkins is not the first politician with a family member whose work creates a potential conflict of interest with their elected office. Nor is she the only 2026 gubernatorial candidate whose income could complicate their tenure.
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis told CalMatters in April that she would place her extensive property investments — which include downtown Sacramento office buildings that rent to at least three state agencies and dozens of organizations with business before state government  — in a blind trust if she won next November. She dropped out of the race on Friday.
But the direct financial benefit Atkins receives from LeSar’s income and the expansive portfolio of a governor, encompassing the entirety of California government, make this a particularly thorny case, Levinson said.
Organizations could theoretically hire LeSar to get closer to Atkins, while Atkins, as governor, could direct more state business to LeSar’s companies — though Levinson stressed that the potential for a conflict of interest does not necessarily indicate Atkins has done anything illegal or unethical.
“None of this means that she’s corrupt or she would make corrupt decisions,” Levinson said.
The relationship has long raised eyebrows
Questions about potential conflicts of interest with her spouse’s work have dogged Atkins throughout her rise in California politics. She married LeSar in 2008, when Atkins was a member of the San Diego City Council, and subsequently served 14 years in the Legislature, where she became the first person in more than a century to lead both the Senate and the Assembly.
As a lawmaker, Atkins received some criticism for introducing bills that would have raised taxes and fees to fund affordable housing development, her spouse’s line of work, so she sought permission from an attorney for the Legislature. After she became the Senate president pro tem in 2018, the Los Angeles Times reported that the clientele at LeSar’s firms had nearly quadrupled in five years. Last year, a campaign watchdog alleged that Atkins illegally used campaign funds for a $22,500 study trip to Austria organized by Global Policy Leadership Academy.
Atkins has always denied any wrongdoing.

LeSar’s business portfolio has grown to include four companies, which employ nearly three dozen people. The largest, LeSar Development Consultants, is a management consulting firm that provides strategic advising on affordable housing and homelessness projects. LeSar Support Services manages longer-term housing, public health and disaster recovery programs. Global Policy Leadership Academy offers training courses and study trips focused on urban development. All receive operational support from LeSar Holdings, Inc.
Though not among the most elite tier of affordable housing consultants in the state, LeSar carries considerable influence in the industry, particularly as she has carved out a unique lane with auxiliary services like her training academy, said Ben Metcalf, managing director of UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation.
“There are some obvious synergies and benefits from her involvement in both of those organizations,” said Metcalf, who has attended a Global Policy Leadership Academy study trip.
On a statement of economic interests that LeSar filed last year with San Diego County for her consulting work, she reported the fair market value of LeSar Development Consultants at more than $1 million and for each of her other three companies at between $100,001 and $1 million. State financial disclosures only require filers to provide broad ranges.
Atkins reported receiving more than $100,000 in gross income from each of the four companies last year. That means, under California’s community property law, that LeSar earned at least double that amount — more than $800,000 — across her businesses.
The total income Atkins received is unknown. But nearly 40 of LeSar’s clients paid her enough last year that it triggered disclosure requirements for Atkins as well, because she earned more than $10,000 from each of them. That included the Department of General Services and 18 lobbyist employers.
“There are potential conflicts of interest with respect to any state agency consulting contracts,”  Thomas Hiltachk, a political and election lawyer whose firm helped set up a blind trust for Arnold Schwarzenegger when he became governor in 2003, said in an email. “Such conflicts could also appear with any private consulting clients if such clients have matters or legislation under the Governor’s authority.”
Few solutions for avoiding conflicts
The Department of General Services hired LeSar Development Consultants for its affordable housing project in November 2020, on a three-year contract worth nearly $1.1 million, according to a copy provided to CalMatters. LeSar was paid $301.41 per hour, including labor, fringe benefits, overhead and profit.
Shortly before it expired, the contract was extended for another year for an additional $364,000. Then in February, the department signed a new three-year contract, for just over $1 million, which will keep LeSar Development Consultants advising on proposals to build housing on state-owned properties through 2028. LeSar’s rate has increased to $350 per hour. 
“DGS is using the consultant to help as needed, through project initiation, preparation for and evaluation of proposals submitted by developers, provision of advice for complex policy, technical and procedural matters concerning affordable housing development, and ground lease and financial closings,” Fallon Okwuosa, a department spokesperson, wrote in an email.
CalMatters obtained several other public contracts that LeSar Development Consultants signed with cities and counties listed in Atkins’ statement of economic interest last year. They include a $964,800, one-year contract to produce a housing strategy for San Diego County; a $161,230, one-year contract to update Ventura County’s homelessness strategy; a $120,000, one-year extension of a contract to provide loan underwriting services for San Jose; a $100,000, one-and-a-half-year contract to advise San Jose on financing affordable housing projects, with renewal options through 2030; and a one-year extension of an ongoing $259,600 contract with Monterey County to update its exclusionary housing ordinance.
These local governments all employ lobbyists to weigh in on state budget funding requests and legislation.
Levinson and Hiltachk agreed that there are no easy solutions for Atkins to address the potential conflicts of interest if she is elected governor. Unlike with assets, such as property or investments, Atkins cannot put her spouse’s work in a blind trust.
And it would be complicated, Levinson said, for Atkins to recuse herself from every policy decision that affects LeSar’s clients.
“There’s just too many things that the governor does and too many ripple effects from a governor’s decisions,” Levinson said.
Because even the appearance of conflict of interest could undermine the public’s confidence in Atkins as governor, she added, LeSar might ultimately be forced to narrow the scope of her work or step back from her firms altogether.
“You’re punishing people who might never engage in nefarious behavior,” Levinson said. “But there’s a reason for that.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/051214-Toni-Atkins-2014-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Sean Geary
Sean Geary is a former unhoused man who lives in his hometown of Pacifica. In 2021, he led a class-action lawsuit against Pacifica over a local ordinance that banned people in RVs from parking on city streets.


As the cruelty of the second Trump administration continues to come to bear, the recent executive order directing states to states to criminalize unhoused people and institutionalize those with mental health disabilities creates an interesting dilemma for Sacramento politicians.
Over the past few months, legislators have been pushing Assembly Bill 630, legislation that would facilitate the towing, dismantling and essentially the destruction of many RVs statewide under the guise of health and safety. If passed, the state would allow cities to destroy the last lifelines for Californians already pushed out of their homes by skyrocketing rents — and force them into the harsh, punitive systems now championed by the White House. 
Lawmakers should choose compassion and reject AB 630.
This issue is deeply personal for me. In March of 2020, I was working two well-paying jobs in downtown San Francisco yet could only afford to rent an RV. When COVID hit, my medications were cut off. It took nearly three years to have them reinstated. Without medication or steady income for rent, I lost the RV. My dog Rex and I then endured 15 traumatizing months in a shelter, where daily harassment by staff made life unbearable. 
Living there was far worse than being in an RV. After speaking out against the harassment, I was kicked out with one hour’s notice, two hours before sunset, with no chance to collect my belongings. We slept on the ground that night in 40-degree weather. 
After two more months in a tent, with the help of social service providers, I finally secured disability benefits and found an apartment.
Currently, cities and counties can destroy “inoperable” or “abandoned” vehicles valued at $500 or less after towing and storing them for 30 days. This policy already puts many peoples’ homes at risk because many cities declare vehicles inoperable simply if their engine won’t start, or deem them abandoned even when they’re inhabited. AB 630 raises that threshold to $4,000 for RVs, dramatically increasing the number of RVs subject to summary towing, storage and destruction.
As the bill’s author, Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, acknowledges, this will affect most of the tens of thousands of RVs that are used as last-resort shelter. And yet, the bill does nothing to address houselessness itself — all it would do is strip away protections.

 Mark Gonzalez
 Democrat, State Assembly, District 54 (Los Angeles)



Proponents of this bill frame RVs as threats to health and safety, but for many Californians, RVs are their only remaining refuge. Removing these mobile homes directly threatens their personal health and safety. 
Genuine public safety concerns should be addressed without destroying last-resort housing of tens of thousands of Californians. Removing and dismantling someone’s RV takes away their shelter from wind, rain and the dangers of the street, as well as their ability to store water and cook food. It erodes their agency and autonomy. 
Even after these actions, the same number of police officers will be tasked with moving people along — people now more desperate, having lost any semblance of home or privacy.Living one’s private life in public view is highly distressing to begin with. Given the pressures of ticketing and towing from law enforcement, the situation becomes nearly unbearable. For people with homes, basic needs — getting clean, warm, seeking solitude, accessing water, using a restroom, eating a meal, or disposing of garbage — take just moments. For the unsheltered, these tasks can each consume the whole day.
Those that would suffer the negative effects from passage of this bill are our fellow community members struggling the most. There are none more affected by public safety issues than those living them without respite.

Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM will offer AI-related tools to California’s schools and universities in an effort to prepare the state’s students for a changing economy.


As artificial intelligence replaces entry-level jobs, California’s universities and community colleges are offering a glimmer of hope for students: free AI training that will teach them to master the new technology. 
“You’re seeing in certain coding spaces significant declines in hiring for obvious reasons,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday during a press conference from the seventh floor of Google’s San Francisco office. 
Flanked by leadership from California’s higher education systems, he called attention to the recent layoffs at Microsoft, at Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and at Salesforce Tower, just a few blocks away, home to the tech company that is still the city’s largest private employer.
Now, some of those companies — including Google and Microsoft — will offer a suite of AI resources for free to California schools and universities. In return, the companies could gain access to millions of new users.
The state’s community colleges and its California State University campuses are “the backbone of our workforce and economic development,” Newsom said, just before education leaders and tech executives signed agreements on AI.
The new deals are the latest developments in a frenzy that began in November 2022, when OpenAI publicly released the free artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, forcing schools to adapt.
The Los Angeles Unified School District implemented an AI chatbot last year, only to cancel it three months later without disclosing why. San Diego Unified teachers started using AI software that suggested what grades to give students, CalMatters reported. Some of the district’s board members were unaware that the district had purchased the software. 
Last month, the company that oversees Canvas, a learning management system popular in California schools and universities, said it would add “interactive conversations in a ChatGPT-like environment” into its software. 
To combat potential AI-related cheating, many K-12 and college districts are using a new feature from the software company Turnitin to detect plagiarism, but a CalMatters investigation found that the software accused students who did real work instead.
Mixed signals?
These deals are sending mixed signals, said Stephanie Goldman, the president of the Faculty Association of California Community Colleges. “Districts were already spending lots of money on AI detection software. What do you do when it’s built into the software they’re using?”
Don Daves-Rougeaux, a senior adviser for the community college system, acknowledged the potential contradiction but said it’s part of a broader effort to keep up with the rapid pace of changes in AI. He said the community college system will frequently reevaluate the use of Turnitin along with all other AI tools. 
California’s community college system is responsible for the bulk of job training in the state, though it receives the least funding from the state per student. 
“Oftentimes when we are having these conversations, we are looked at as a smaller system,” said Daves-Rougeaux. The state’s 116 community colleges collectively educate roughly 2.1 million students.
In the deals announced Thursday, the community college system will partner with Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM to roll out additional AI training for teachers. Daves-Rougeaux said the system has also signed deals that will allow students to use exclusive versions of Google’s counterpart to ChatGPT, Gemini, and Google’s AI research tool, Notebook LLM. Daves-Rougeaux said these tools will save community colleges “hundreds of millions of dollars,” though he could not provide an exact figure. 
“It’s a tough situation for faculty,” said Goldman. “AI is super important but it has come up time and time again: How do you use AI in the classroom while still ensuring that students, who are still developing critical thinking skills, aren’t just using it as a crutch?”
One concern is that faculty could lose control over how AI is used in their classrooms, she added.
The K-12 system and Cal State University system are forming their own tech deals. Amy Bentley-Smith, a spokesperson for the Cal State system, said it is working on its own AI programs with Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM as well as Amazon Web Services, Intel, LinkedIn, Open AI and others. 
Angela Musallam, a spokesperson for the state government operations agency, said California high schools are part of the deal with Adobe, which aims to promote “AI literacy,” the idea that students and teachers should have basic skills to detect and use artificial intelligence.
Much like the community college system, which is governed by local districts, Musallam said individual K-12 districts would need to approve any deal. 
Will deals make a difference to students, teachers?
Experts say it’s too early to tell how effective AI training will actually be.  
Justin Reich, an associate professor at MIT, said a similar frenzy took place 20 years ago when teachers tried to teach computer literacy. “We do not know what AI literacy is, how to use it, and how to teach with it. And we probably won’t for many years,” Reich said. 
The state’s new deals with Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM allow these tech companies to recruit new users — a benefit for the companies — but the actual lessons aren’t time-tested, he said. 
“Tech companies say: ‘These tools can save teachers time,’ but the track record is really bad,” said Reich. “You cannot ask schools to do more right now. They are maxed out.”
Erin Mote, the CEO of an education nonprofit called InnovateEDU, said she agrees that state and education leaders need to ask critical questions about the efficacy of the tools that tech companies offer but that schools still have an imperative to act. 
“There are a lot of rungs on the career ladder that are disappearing,” she said. “The biggest mistake we could make as educators is to wait and pause.”
Last year, the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office signed an agreement with NVIDIA, a technology infrastructure company, to offer AI training similar to the kinds of lessons that Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM will deliver. 
Melissa Villarin, a spokesperson for the chancellor’s office, said the state won’t share data about how the NVIDIA program is going because the cohort of teachers involved is still too small.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Community-College-Budget-LJ-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Gavin Newsom alleges the Trump administration broke a 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act when it deployed military units to Los Angeles in June.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom alleges the Trump administration broke a 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act when it deployed military units to Los Angeles in June.


Did the U.S. military illegally engage in civilian law enforcement when they were deployed to Los Angeles in June under the orders of President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth?
California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta say yes. Trump’s Department of Justice says no. The three-day trial to answer this question is scheduled to commence today at 10 a.m. in a California federal district court, with implications for the country as Trump continues to signal a desire to deploy troops to patrol domestic city streets.The president has appointed himself chair of a task force on the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, telling reporters that “we’ll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe, including using our National Guard or military, OK?”
Relatedly, the Department of Defense issued a new activation order to deploy troops in California for another 90 days on Aug. 5, California lawyers told the court in a filing. That came two weeks after the Marines deployed to Los Angeles left and a week after the Trump administration demobilized most of the National Guard.California’s lawyers assert evidence in their briefs, often redacted because of a court order, that the military took part in law enforcement in violation of 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act. They want a judge to order the Trump administration to permanently halt those actions. The Trump Department of Justice counters that those engagements don’t count as law enforcement, but rather fall under the category of supporting immigration law enforcement agents or protecting federal buildings.Trump has not invoked the Insurrection Act, a law that would allow the military to engage in law enforcement activity.
How did we get here?
This trial is an extension of the June lawsuit that Newsom filed against Trump after the president took over California’s National Guard. Trump did that in response to protests that broke out in the Los Angeles area after immigration law enforcement agents began workforce raids to apprehend individuals allegedly in the U.S. without proper authorization.Ultimately, about 4,000 troops from the California National Guard and 700 U.S. Marines were deployed to Los Angeles.That month marked a new nadir in the relations between Newsom and Trump. The governor likened the president to failed dictators. Trump endorsed the idea of arresting Newsom.Charles Breyer, the judge in Monday’s case and oversaw the June hearings, initially sided with Newsom, ordering that Trump return the National Guard to the governor. A three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked that move. They found that the Trump administration legitimately called up troops to protect federal buildings and federal employees from some protesters who tossed chunks of concrete and used trash dumpsters as battering rams. California lawyers said the troops’ presence inflamed the protests.The June protests lasted about a week and were largely isolated to a handful of city blocks in the downtown area; Los Angeles is roughly 500 square miles.Breyer then allowed California’s lawyers to depose Trump officials and gather documents to argue California’s case that the Trump administration was violating the law barring the military from acting as a police force. Trump’s Department of Justice lawyers tried to cancel the trial but failed.
What is California’s latest allegation? 
That Los Angeles residents were “subjected to a form of military occupation” as federal troops worked alongside federal immigration agents, “often indistinguishable from each other.”The lawyers say that “never before, in the history of the Nation, has the federal government utilized the military for domestic law enforcement in this manner.”The Trump administration’s “insistence that perimeters, blockades, and other security functions are permissible makes clear they will continue to engage in these activities,” California lawyers with the state attorney general’s office wrote to Breyer.
The lawyers argued that if military forces can accompany U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their raids and arrests, as had been unfolding in Los Angeles, “there would be no logical basis to preclude members of the Armed Forces from accompanying other law enforcement agents when performing their duties,” the California lawyers wrote. Military personnel could accompany federal food safety inspectors, medical fraud investigators or accompany federal voting rights officials to “monitor” election polling places, they wrote.
What are California’s examples of the military acting as police?
Attorneys representing the state pointed to several instances in which they allege troops went too far and violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of the military in civilian settings:

California attorneys deposed an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field director who said National Guard soldiers accompanied immigration officers on as many as 75% of their missions.
Troops accompanied a federal agency during a “law enforcement operation” at a cannabis facility in Riverside County and formed a security perimeter that prevented people from leaving the site. 
Troops allegedly formed security perimeters on July 7 during a demonstration at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles during raids at cannabis farms in Ventura County.
In two incidents, military service members detained civilians, the California lawyers wrote. One took place in Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County, where National Guard troops allegedly “apprehended” a protester. In the other, a Marine on June 13 allegedly detained someone at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles.
California attorneys collected testimony from the deputy chief of staff of the military unit in Los Angeles who said the National Guard is subject to Posse Comitatus and cannot engage in civilian law enforcement. 
The attorneys point to military-issued guidance that “directly providing ‘security functions’ for civilian law enforcement agents is a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act,” per their summary. But, the lawyers note, the military unit in L.A. was ordered to “actively provide security during civil law enforcement operations on a near-continuous basis since the deployment began,” the California lawyers wrote. 

How does the federal government respond?
The federal government says California is wrong for four reasons. Some are disputes over technical court procedure and some disputing the facts California’s legal team is presenting.

Federal lawyers wrote that Posse Comitatus is a criminal statute, which cannot be used in a civil case, and the lawsuit is civil, not criminal. 
They dispute that the president or the Department of Defense exceeded its authority in ordering the troops to assist federal immigration law enforcement in apprehensions. “As Supreme Court precedent makes clear, the (Posse Comitatus Act) does not prohibit the President from using troops to protect federal personnel and property,” the Trump administration lawyers wrote.
The federal lawyers also say California has no standing to sue. (California’s attorneys dispute this.)
Fourth, the lawyers say that the National Guard can act as a police force because the law Trump cited to federalize them permits the National Guard to “execute the laws of the United States” if the president is unable to do that with “regular forces,” which at minimum means enforcing “federal immigration laws as well as laws forbidding interference with federal functions or assaults on federal officers and property,” the federal lawyers wrote.

The lawyers also dispute that the military’s role counts as law enforcement. California’s lawyers say the Marines “briefly detained” a protester. But the federal lawyers wrote that action “was in protection of federal property (the individual had attempted to enter a restricted area on federal property multiple times) and the Marines turned that individual over to the LAPD minutes later.”And providing a perimeter for federal immigration law enforcement also doesn’t violate Posse Comitatus, because, as a previous federal court found, “Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to federal troops playing ‘a passive role in civilian enforcement activities,’” the federal lawyers wrote.
What is likely to happen after this trial?
How Breyer will rule is impossible to forecast. He sided with California already only to have a three-judge panel in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals block his orders.Nor is the military the main force acting on the Trump administration’s interpretation of immigration law. The Department of Homeland Security has that role through its various agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.
Those agencies were temporarily blocked by a lower district court judge from making apprehensions in Southern California based on race, ethnicity, language, and location or employment. The move sought to block “roving” immigration stops in California’s most populous region. 
A panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that block. Last week the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States to lift the lower court’s restraining order.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-Natl-Guard-MDC-DTLA-TS-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Doug Slater, a chaplain from Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, preaches to attendees during service at the chapel on Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi, in this 2019 file photo. (Photo by Airman Hannah Bean/U.S. Air Force)In the gilded sanctuaries of America’s churches, a new kind of sermon is being preached—not one of salvation, but one of electioneering. Thanks to the IRS’s quietly seismic reinterpretation of the Johnson Amendment, pastors may now endorse candidates from the pulpit without fear of losing their tax-exempt status. The cross has been joined by the campaign banner.
This evolution — or erosion — is not merely a bureaucratic quirk. It is a radical shift in nonprofit oversight, one that invites political operatives to launder influence through houses of worship, cloaked in immunity and shielded by the First Amendment.
When a pastor delivers an endorsement mid-sermon, the offering plate becomes a conduit for tax-deductible campaign contributions. In that moment, the line between theological truth and political talking point vanishes.
Pastors are finally free to speak — will they have the courage?

And yet, where is the accountability?
The IRS has, in essence, created a special class of nonprofit untouchables. Secular charities face strict scrutiny if they dabble in electoral politics — but churches can now participate freely under the veil of religious expression. This is not equal enforcement. It is institutional favoritism.
More troubling is the collapse of transparency. Religious organizations are not required to disclose their donors. When these entities engage in political speech, we lose sight of where money is flowing and whose interests are being served. Dark money doesn’t have to hide anymore — it can simply congregate.
Democracy suffers when campaign finance laws stop at the sanctuary doors. Free speech is a pillar of our republic, yes — but tax benefits are not a birthright. They are a social contract, granted in exchange for civic responsibility and nonpartisan service. When that contract is broken, the public foots the bill for partisan pulpits.
It’s time to rewrite the rules.
Congress must act decisively. The Truth in Political Advertising Act should define nonprofit political speech clearly, enforce donor transparency across the board, and end the double standards that threaten civic trust. Let churches preach freely — but not at the expense of the voter’s right to know.
If sermons have become stump speeches, then the tax-exempt status should come with campaign finance strings. We fund pulpits for prophecy, not propaganda. And we deserve a democracy whose soul isn’t sold behind closed chapel doors.

Many have been told that if you dare to teach your congregations how biblical principles apply to elections, if they ever endorsed a candidate or spoke too directly about public policy, they would jeopardize their church’s tax-exempt status.
This chilling effect traces back to the Johnson Amendment of 1954, a politically motivated punitive measure meant to silence the famed senator’s political opponents, long been used to muzzle churches on matters of politics and policy.
Last month, that muzzle finally dropped. In a groundbreaking move, the IRS clarified that pastors and religious leaders are not bound by the Johnson Amendment when speaking to their own congregations. They can preach the full counsel of God, including guidance on civic engagement, candidates, and legislation. They no longer have to fear losing their tax-excempt status.
Crosses, campaigns and cloakrooms: How tax-free pulpits became political podiums

This is a monumental announcement that extends a precious gift to every Marylander of faith, no matter their religion or politics.
Yet as much as I celebrate this decision, I’m also sobered by a hard truth: laws and court decisions can change overnight, but courage is harder to summon.
For years, pastors convinced themselves that staying silent on politics was simply prudent. They reasoned, “If I avoid endorsing candidates or wading into legislation, more people hear the Gospel and I preserve the peace.”
But that caution is rooted more in misunderstanding and complacency, rather than in truth. Worse, it is bolstered by a deeper myth that has done untold damage to our country: The false idea of a rigid “separation of church and state,” which supposedly prohibits the church from influencing civic life.
The Constitution says nothing about separation of church and state. Nor is it what Scripture teaches. In fact, the Bible offers no divide between sacred and secular. To paraphrase Abraham Kuyper’s famous line, there is not a single square inch of this world over which Christ does not declare, “Mine!”

Because many pastors have lacked the courage to speak boldly into the public square, generations of believers have not been discipled to think biblically about politics. The result? Churches that shy away from teaching on critical cultural questions, and Christians who cast votes without considering or understanding how timeless truths should shape their civic choices.
This is why the IRS ruling is both liberating and convicting. It removes every last excuse for timid pulpits. Pastors can now freely endorse candidates and equip their flocks to advocate for legislation that aligns with biblical principles, using every modern means at their disposal.
In this digital age, that doesn’t just mean Sunday sermons. It includes livestreams, email newsletters, Facebook videos, podcasts, and every other platform where churches already connect with their congregations.
Still, I fear that some pastors will cling to silence. The IRS may have taken off the shackles, but not every pastor will find the will to walk free. They will continue to avoid “controversial” topics, not out of legal necessity, but because they lack the fortitude to risk pushback.
That’s a tragedy. Because when pastors shrink back, they rob their congregations — not of political opinions, but of the full counsel of God. They leave believers spiritually underfed, unequipped to bring biblical wisdom into the voting booth, the school board meeting or the halls of Annapolis.
It doesn’t have to be this way. It is time to change the norm. I am hopeful that courageous pastors, who understand there is no aspect of life untouched by God’s authority, will lead by example. That their boldness will inspire others to step forward and teach their people how to live out their faith fully, including in public life.
At the Maryland Family Institute, we stand ready to come alongside churches, parishes and congregations in this mission. We want to see Maryland’s pulpits ablaze with truth, unafraid to speak on biblical issues that shape our families, our communities, and our laws. We want to see believers equipped not only to worship on Sunday but to live and witness wisely on Tuesday at the polls.
So yes, the IRS ruling is cause for celebration. It is a victory for free speech, for religious liberty, and ultimately for the health of our democracy. But it is also a test for pastors.

Gaines/Maryland Matters)The annual Maryland Association of Counties summer conference has evolved into several things over the years.
It’s a forum for wonky discussions about near- and long-term policy and budgetary challenges. An opportunity for local bureaucrats to network and refresh their professional skills and credentials. A venue for vendors to peddle their services to government procurement officers. A chance for the governor to report to his fellow policymakers.
And it’s become party central, with a dizzying array of round-the-clock fundraisers, receptions and other social gatherings at bars and restaurants throughout Ocean City.
But at its most basic level, MACo is the biggest gathering of Maryland’s political clan of the year. So with the critical 2026 elections just around the corner, the political landscape is sure to be Topic A as Maryland leaders descend on the state’s top resort town for sand, surf, strategizing and soothsaying.
At first glance, 2026 in Maryland appears to be a sleepier and less consequential cycle than the historic election of 2022, when there were vacancies for all four statewide offices – governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller and attorney general – and voters chose trailblazers for each position.
All four – Gov. Wes Moore (D) and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), along with Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) and Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) – are early favorites for reelection. Some may have no serious opposition at all.
But with the national political dynamic so tumultuous – and with Maryland disproportionately impacted by the chaos and uncertainty in the federal government – state and local races will be affected in myriad, incalculable ways. Moore’s prominence as a probable presidential contender in 2028 will add to the weight and scrutiny of the 2026 outcome here.
“I think unpredictable is the word,” said Jessica Haire, a Republican former county councilmember from Anne Arundel County, who is chair of Opportunity Maryland, an advocacy group promoting economic growth and free market policies.
Maryland’s elections coincide with a period of instability and voter anger rarely seen in modern politics. National polls show voters deeply unhappy with both major political parties. And that could produce some surprising results in Maryland and beyond.
“The word that keeps coming back to me is disquiet – there’s disquiet in the electorate,” said Len Foxwell, a Democratic consultant.
Ordinarily, in the first midterm election of a president’s term, the “out” party makes significant gains – and there are certainly ingredients in place that could make it a good cycle for Democrats in 2026.
But assumptions about the midterms, and their consequences for 2028, become tricky in the volatile age of President Donald Trump, who has remade government, political discourse and media coverage in remarkable ways. Democrats, who are simultaneously looking to shake off their demoralizing defeat to Trump and are grappling with ideological, generational and tactical battles throughout the country, may be taking their 2026 prospects for granted.
“I think, both locally and nationally, we assume everybody’s going to be where they are, from the governor to all elected officials,” said former Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker (D). “But we don’t really know how they’re going to wind up.”
At the dawn of this year’s MACo conference, it’s easy to see that county elections will be among the most hard-fought and significant of the 2026 cycle.
Four of the state’s biggest counties will be electing new executives next year, and “each race will be brutal,” a leading state Democratic operative predicts. Several downballot elections in the counties – including internecine battles for state’s attorney, sheriff, county council seats and other offices – will be equally tempestuous.
“The greatest opportunity for political dynamism next year rests not with state elections or the General Assembly but with our county governments,” Foxwell said.
Known unknowns
Maryland’s 2026 primaries are on June 30. The candidate filing deadline is on Feb. 24.
Some key questions about 2026 races remain unanswered:
– Will former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) try to get his old job back, setting up an epic battle with Moore? Hogan has been strafing Moore on social media, but has taken no overt steps to organize a campaign; strategists on both sides of the aisle believe he is almost certainly the GOP’s best hope next year.
“I think the governor will win,” Baker said of Moore. “I think he could win big. But he will definitely have vigorous opposition.”
– Will U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives in Maryland history, seek another term next year, when he will be 87 years old? Not even his closest friends seem to know – and several downballot races could be impacted if he chooses to call it a career, as ambitious pols scramble to succeed him.
Baker said Hoyer’s plans may hinge on whether he thinks Democrats can retake the majority in the U.S. House.
– Even more basically, will Maryland lawmakers seek to redraw the state’s congressional lines next year, as state House Majority Leader David Moon (D-Montgomery) has suggested, in retaliation for mid-decade redistricting efforts underway in Texas and other Republican-dominated legislatures?
“Does Maryland respond to Texas?” asked Mileah Kromer, a pollster and director of the University of Maryland Baltimore County Institute for Politics. “That decision could have serious political ramifications.”
Moon plans to introduce legislation that would require Maryland lawmakers to consider a mid-decade remap of congressional boundaries if another state changes its map. But even Moon, in an interview, said it wasn’t clear if the bill would mandate action or produce new district lines before the 2026 election, or if Democratic leaders will choose that path.
“At a certain point, a lot of these decisions go above my pay grade,” he said.
Through a spokesperson, Moore told The Baltimore Sun last week that he would consider “all options” on redistricting.
Democrats already hold a 7-1 advantage in the state’s House delegation, so making U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) vulnerable would require even more gerrymandering. He won reelection by 22 points last year, and Jake Day (D), Moore’s charismatic state secretary of Housing and Community Development, is pondering a challenge.
But the task of weakening Harris’ political position may not be impossible: Only the 6th congressional district, occupied by freshman Rep. April McClain Delaney (D), is remotely competitive. She won her seat last fall by a little over 5 points; the state’s other six Democrats won theirs by an average of 45 points, with victory margins ranging from 18 points (Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr.) to 77 points (Rep. Glenn Ivey). Some of these members would have to sacrifice safe Democratic territory to put Harris’ seat in play.
And it’s worth pointing out that a court in 2022 rejected Maryland Democrats’ attempts to put Harris’ district in play as unconstitutional.
Democratic gerrymandering has also limited the number of competitive seats in the General Assembly. Can Republicans target more than a handful of Democratic-controlled seats next year? Do Democrats have any pick-up opportunities in GOP districts?
If there are any vulnerable state legislators in 2026, they may face more peril in their party primaries than in the general election. Democratic supermajorities in the state Senate and House of Delegates do not appear to be in any danger at this point.
A bigger and more basic question is whether the two parties in Maryland are even equipped to challenge for seats where the other side has long dominated.
Republicans have won three of the last six gubernatorial elections, but the state GOP is in thrall to Trump, who has appeal in conservative pockets of Maryland but limits the party’s ability to compete statewide and in bigger jurisdictions. Republicans are unlikely to run a strong candidate for Howard County executive next year, even though the GOP held the job as recently as 2018; the same may be true in Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County, depending on Haire’s plans. Bigger Republican benches in conservative jurisdictions have yet to yield candidates who can compete at the statewide level or for many congressional seats.
Conservative Democratic elected officials have all but vanished in Maryland; they controlled the General Assembly just a generation ago. Democrats have seemingly impenetrable advantages in several large suburban counties that were swing areas just a few elections ago. But as Maryland Democrats become more liberal and more in sync with the national party, their ability to make gains in conservative parts of the state diminishes.
Partisan arguments and counter-arguments
Even with the conflicting political signals, smart minds in both parties in Maryland see reason for optimism this election cycle.
Moon, the House majority leader, said Trump’s assault on the federal government and programs resonate in every corner of Maryland, benefiting Democrats.
“It’s a midterm where the GOP has set out to destroy our state,” he said. “We’ve got a cannon aimed directly at our head – we’ve got to do our best to dodge it.”
Sophia Silbergeld, a Baltimore-based Democratic fundraiser and strategist, said state Democrats will prosper if they portray themselves as a bulwark against Trump policies.
“As long as Democrats message strategically and paint themselves as an alternative to Trump, they will do well in Maryland in 2026,” she said. “State and local officials can message that they’re the last bastion against the Trump administration.”
But Jim Burton, a former executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, said tax and fee increases pushed through by Moore and legislative Democrats over the past two years could come back to haunt them electorally; he sees some of the same elements at play this cycle that propelled former Republican Govs. Larry Hogan and Bob Ehrlich to victory and almost elected Ellen Sauerbrey governor in 1994.
“We don’t know what the environment will look like in a year and a few months from now, but there are a lot of things on the table that could be a problem for Democrats,” said Burton, a pollster who advises GOP clients in Maryland and other states. “We could be looking at a period of history repeating itself. I like the situation that we’re in right now.”
Kromer acknowledged that voters will be driven by economic issues, but noted that the impact of the Trump administration’s policies on the state will also be top-of-mind to Democratic voters, making it difficult for Republican candidates to piece together a broad coalition, as Hogan did so deftly in 2014 and 2018.
“Like all voters, Democrats are driven by taxes and cost-of-living issues, but they’re particularly angry about Trump being back in the White House, and that anger will create a serious obstacle for Moore’s eventual challenger,” she said. “Just look at what happened in 2022.”
Foxwell said rising utility costs are a source of great outrage for voters and present a major challenge for Maryland political leaders in both parties.
“The one issue that keeps blinking as a big issue for me is the cost of energy, and it poses risks for Democrats and Republicans,” he said. “The proclivity of Annapolis lawmakers for blaming [grid operator] PJM is a losing strategy. People don’t know what PJM is, and they know they didn’t vote for PJM.”
Known knowns
One thing that is certain about the 2026 election in Maryland is that the open-seat races for county executive in Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Howard and Montgomery counties will be among the most intense of the cycle – especially in the Democratic primaries.
“The theater of combat in the counties this cycle is not going to be Republicans vs. Democrats, but establishment Democrats vs. insurgents,” Foxwell predicted.
Anne Arundel, considered a purple jurisdiction, is a paradox: Democrats have made significant and potentially durable gains in the last few elections, even as angry divides have erupted among party leaders and activists – especially since the death in 2019 of the late House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D), who had a robust political organization and was a unifying figure for county Democrats.
The Democratic race to replace term-limited County Executive Steuart Pittman (D) features County Councilmembers Alison Pickard and Pete Smith, and James Kitchin, a top aide to Pittman who has his boss’ support. Skirmishing among the candidates and their supporters seems inevitable. Even so, the Democrats are likely to hold the seat if Haire does not run – and might be favored, given the national dynamics of the political cycle, even if she does.
Haire, who lost to Pittman by 7 points in 2022, said she is still pondering her political options for 2026 but doesn’t think Anne Arundel voters will be swayed by the national political dynamic.
“We have an electorate that really pays attention, and local issues really matter to folks,” she said.
Baltimore County features a four-way Democratic primary to replace County Executive Kathy Klausmeier (D), who was appointed to complete the final two years of Olszewski’s tenure and isn’t expected to seek a full term of her own. The wide-open race features Councilmembers Julian Jones, Izzy Patoka and Pat Young, along with Nick Stewart, a businessman, attorney and former county school board member.
Republicans have yet to put up a candidate for the race, but intriguingly, former state Sen. Jim Brochin, a moderate who lost the 2018 Democratic primary to Olszewski by just 17 votes, has floated the possibility of running in the general election as an independent. He could be formidable, if he gets sufficient funding.
In Howard County, Del. Jessica Feldmark (D), who served as chief of staff to former County Executive Ken Ulman (D), is likely to rack up a substantial amount of establishment support as she looks to replace the outgoing executive, Calvin Ball (D). Councilmembers Deb Jung and Liz Walsh are also seeking the Democratic nomination, and the field could grow.
No Republican has come forward yet in Howard, and it’s hard to see a strong contender emerging. Allan Kittleman was the GOP nominee in the last three elections – winning once and losing twice.
In Montgomery County, County Executive Marc Elrich (D) is term limited, and three young Democratic council members are the leading candidates, so far, to replace him: Andrew Friedson (39), Evan Glass (48) and Will Jawando (42). The last Republican county executive was elected in 1974.
At least three of the open-seat candidates for county executive in the state – Feldmark, Pickard and Smith – have scheduled fundraisers in Ocean City this week to coincide with MACo. So has Frederick County Executive Jessica Fitzwater (D), who is seeking a second term.
As usual, Ocean City will be the center of the political universe for a few days this week. By the time next summer’s MACo conference takes place, the 2026 primaries will have come and gone – and the world could look a lot different.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/maco-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
Underwater grasses continued to mount a comeback in the lower Chesapeake Bay last year, while a steady recovery also continued in upper portions of the Bay.
Areas in between were a different story, as declines in the mid-section of the Chesapeake more than offset improvements elsewhere.
Overall, data from the 2024 aerial survey showed a mixed bag of results, with the Baywide acreage of underwater meadows — one of the Chesapeake’s most critical habitats — decreasing by about 1% but with diverse trends in different areas.
“This year really shows just how dynamic the system is, that we can have two very different trends emerge in different areas,” said Chris Patrick, a researcher with the Virginia Institute of Marine Science who oversees the annual aerial survey of grass beds.
Indeed, last year saw more underwater grasses in the high salinity waters of the lower Bay than had been observed since the survey began four decades ago. The Susquehanna Flats in the upper Bay also saw significant expansion. But the mid-Bay saw large losses, especially along the Eastern Shore.
Altogether, the 2024 survey found 82,778 acres of submerged aquatic vegetation, or SAV, down from 83,419 acres in 2023.
That is well below the Chesapeake Bay Program goal of 185,000 acres, though it is significantly more than the 38,227 acres observed in 1984 when the survey began.
Underwater grass beds provide an important refuge for juvenile blue crabs and fish, as well as food for water­fowl. Plus, they pump oxygen into the water, their roots help stabilize sedi­ment and their leaves buffer wave action.
They are also a closely watched indicator of Bay health because the plants require clear water to get the sunlight needed to survive. They die off when sediment and nutrient-fueled algae blooms cloud the water.
But grass beds are not the same throughout the Chesapeake. Beds in different areas consist of different species based on the salinities of the water, and they can be impacted by local factors as opposed to Baywide conditions.
That might have been at play last year in the mid-Bay where higher than normal spring river flows shifted sharply to lower than normal summer flows. That might have contributed to Eastern Shore losses, said Brooke Landry, a biologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and chair of the state-federal Bay Program’s SAV Workgroup.
“It shows that we’re still susceptible to climate change, with super hot water and highly variable river flows potentially impacting the grasses as well as overall water quality,” she said.
Here’s how the Bay fared in different regions last year.
High salinity zone
The best news was in the high salinity, or polyhaline, portion of the Bay, which stretches south from the Rappahannock River and Tangier Island to the mouth of the Bay. The survey found 24,800 acres of grass in that area, a 14% increase from 2023 and the most recorded since the survey began.
It’s especially good news because the area is dominated by eelgrass, a species that is especially sensitive to warming temperatures and poor water quality and has suffered repeated setbacks over the years. As Bay temperatures have increased, polyhaline SAV coverage declined to just 11,975 acres in 2019.
Patrick said the comeback was driven in part by better water clarity, which means the plants get more light and allows eelgrass to move into deeper waters — sometimes as deep as 9 feet.
Last year saw notable increases in Mobjack Bay, Poquoson Flats and nearby Western Shore areas.
“We’ve seen a lot of big expansions,” Patrick said, including areas where grasses had not previously been observed. “It certainly looks like this is tied to improving water clarity. I mean, anecdotally, the water looks clear to me out there.”
The Bay Program goal for the polyhaline is 33,647 acres.
Tidal fresh zone
The tidal fresh zone of the upper Bay and upper portions of its tidal tributaries had 20,218 acres, a 2% increase from last year.
The large grass bed in the Susquehanna Flats, located near the mouth of the Bay’s largest tributary, increased to 10,925 acres last year. That was a 2% increase from 2023 and accounted for slightly more than half of all SAV in tidal fresh waters.
The tidal fresh zone, which hosts more than a dozen SAV species, also saw notable increases in Maryland’s Northeast River on the upper Eastern Shore and in Piscataway Creek off the Potomac River.
Not all the news was good. In Virginia, the upper Mattaponi River and upper portions of the tidal James River saw losses.
The Bay Program goal for the tidal fresh zone is 20,602 acres.
Low salinity zone
The slightly salty oligohaline zone, a relatively small area which includes portions of the up­per Bay and tidal tributaries, saw a 46% increase, to 4,730 acres.
Much of that was a bounce back from losses in recent years, particularly in and near Maryland’s Gunpowder and Middle rivers, which had seen recent declines. Other areas with increases included the Elk, Sassafras, Bush, and Back rivers in Maryland; the middle Potomac; and the middle Rappahannock in Virginia.
But the Chickahominy River in Virginia suffered a significant decline.
The oligohaline zone has the least amount of potential underwater grass habitat, with a Bay Program goal of 10,334 acres.
Mid-salinity zone
The mesohaline zone, with mid-range salinity, suffered a 14% decline, dropping to 33,031 acres. It has the largest amount of potential SAV habitat — its restoration goal is 120,306 acres — and it stretches southward from near Baltimore to the Rappahannock River and Tangier Island in Virginia. It includes large sections of most tidal rivers.
It is dominated by widgeon grass, which is notorious for rapid changes linked to water quality.
Most of the larger losses were along the Eastern Shore. In the lower Choptank River grass coverage fell by 2,200 acres, which made scientists think local conditions were at play.
Patrick said it is likely that heavy spring rains washed more nutrients off the land, which led to reduced water clarity in the Choptank and some other rivers in the area.
Landry said rapid salinity changes, spurred by high flow events in the spring and near-drought conditions in the summer, may have contributed to losses. “While widgeon grass does have a really broad salinity tolerance, it doesn’t respond well to rapid changes in salinity particularly when stressed by water quality,” she said.
While the area saw overall losses, some locations had notable increases, including the Patapsco River in Maryland and the Piankatank River in Virginia.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/689217d45061b.1-1024x668.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.

Read the series >


A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The U.S. Election Assistance Commission — an independent, bipartisan commission charged with ensuring secure, accurate and accessible elections — is launching a national effort to recruit poll workers, including in Utah. 
“Utah needs you,” Commissioner Donald Palmer said in an interview with Utah News Dispatch on Friday. 
Tuesday — which is also Utah’s municipal primary — is National Poll Worker Recruitment Day, when the U.S. Election Assistance Commission kicks off a nationwide effort to encourage more people to volunteer at their local county clerks office and sign up to be election workers ahead of the November general election. 
“Where there’s a primary, there’s always going to be a general (election),” Palmer quipped, saying the aim of scheduling National Poll Worker Recruitment Day on the same day of municipal primaries is to recruit more poll workers ahead of the 2025 November election, when voters typically turn out in higher numbers. 
‘Go see for yourself’: These poll workers want to demystify the voting process for you

By raising awareness on a day when Utahns are thinking about their local elections, Palmer said he hopes more Utahns will consider being a part of the process this fall. 
Across the nation, clerks are seeing a “dramatic decrease in the number of poll workers available,” Palmer said, noting that for the 2024 presidential election, 772,000 Americans served as poll workers, according to the 2024 Election Administration and Voting Survey Report. That’s down from what’s typically been 1 million. 
While it’s been getting incrementally easier to recruit election volunteers since 2020, recruitment efforts have trended easier since 2020, still about 48% of clerks’ elections jurisdictions across the nation reported it’s either “very difficult” or “somewhat difficult” to find poll workers, according to that survey. Of that 48%, 14.3% said it’s “very difficult” while 33.6% said it’s “somewhat difficult.” 
While Utah is not facing a dire poll worker shortage, Palmer said he’s still encouraging Utahns to volunteer, noting that what he hears most from Utah clerks is a need to help process by-mail ballots since the vast majority of Utah voters use the state’s vote-by-mail system. 
He also said some counties are in more need than others — noting that rural areas with smaller populations often face more challenges recruiting poll workers. 
In Utah during the 2024 November election, 104,350 people cast ballots in person on Election Day and 36,381 people voted early in person, while about 1.3 million by-mail ballots were cast and counted, according to the national survey. 
By comparison, Utah only reported 1,110 total poll workers for that election. 
That survey also showed that in 2025, about 40% of Utah’s poll workers were new recruits. 
Palmer said that shows there’s been “a lot of turnover” and “a need for poll workers” in Utah — demonstrating that people are not volunteering anymore, likely because they’re getting older or are no longer able to. 
“We have an aging population of poll workers,” Palmer said. 
He noted that the survey found the vast majority of poll workers in 2024 were over the age of 40, with nearly 60% ages 61 and older. That includes 31.1% that were between the ages of 61 and 70, and 28.1% that were 71 and older. 
Republicans are losing trust in elections, even in Utah. What should be done?

“It really does (show) we need to start recruiting younger and middle-aged Americans to really fill the gap. Because at some point, they’re going to retire,” he said.
Palmer urged younger Utahns — who may not even be aware of the opportunity to serve their communities in this way — to consider being an election worker.
“I really encourage people to try (volunteering) at least one or two elections, because it will give you great insight, and the people that continue on year after year, some of these folks, they absolutely love it. They’re going to do it for the rest of their lives,” he said. “So we really do want young people and other Americans to see the voting process.”
He also said more people being involved in local election processes can help combat rising distrust in election security. 
“It’s right on the ground. You can see how the voting process works,” he said. “You really do, as a poll worker, get to see the checks and balances within a polling place. You get to see the efforts that go into chain of custody and how we make sure the ballots equate to the number of people that have voted. And the care that’s taken with those ballots. … It really is the best place to understand how the voting process works.”
“There really does need to be replacement poll workers as we move to the future,” he said.

Under state intervention, a new elementary school and gymnasium (above) are being constructed on the high school campus. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)This is the third of a three-part series on Alabama school districts under state intervention. Part 1 on Bessemer City Schools is here. Part 2 on Dallas County Schools is here.  
On a recent June day, Sumter County Schools students  went to the front office to get permission slips signed on one of the last days of summer school. 
While parents work, the kids are able to get a head start in their new grade through the summer bridge program. As Sumter County Schools Superintendent Marcy Burroughs was walking down the hall, a student called after her asking for summer learning to be extended.
“I’m bored inside the house,” he said.
Burroughs teased the student.
“So you want to do year-round school?” She asked him. He shook his head, seemingly wishing he never said a word.
Burroughs continued on, explaining the upgrades made to the school, like a new camera system and new HVACs throughout the school. 
Sumter is consolidating all its schools on the campus of Sumter Central High School. The high school itself lies in the shadow of a new elementary school wing. 
When the Alabama State Department of Education took over Sumter County Schools in August 2023, the district had 923 students between its four schools, a drop of more than 100 from the year prior.
Intervention takes many different forms around the state; in Sumter, it will end in school closures and new construction. State Superintendent Eric Mackey plans to close three schools and move them to the York Central High School campus, into a new facility for elementary students.
The $14 million construction is set to be completed by December, Burroughs said. 
“We’re hoping to be in by January, but with the weather and the rain,” Burroughs said. “We will definitely be in by next August.”
The school closures, Mackey said in a phone interview Thursday, were necessary due to the condition of the facilities and low membership.
“York West End (Junior High School) has a whole wing that is not available to be occupied because of structural problems, but it’s a big school that was built decades ago, so you still had plenty of room because there were so few students,” Mackey said. “Nevertheless, you’ve got this whole section of the building that you can’t even go in, and which always is, to me, that’s a safety concern, even though we don’t have students housed there. And then Livingston Junior High, the other school, actually was condemned.”
Even Sumter Central High School, where the consolidated campus will be, is an older building, but HVAC replacements and minor renovations will keep it updated. Burroughs said the state replaced 30 HVACs in the building when they intervened two years ago, and the process was still ongoing during the summer.
Sumter County Schools was the first of three school systems under Mackey’s control, joined by Bessemer City Schools south of  Birmingham and Dallas County Schools in Selma.

Why the state intervened
The Sumter intervention, Mackey said, is unique because of how rural the county is. Sumter County, like many Black Belt counties, has seen significant population loss over the last few decades. The county lost 10.3% of its population from 2010 to 2020, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
That creates challenges. The falling population and difficulty accessing Sumter, on the state’s western border with Mississippi, makes it difficult to recruit teachers and staff. York Central High School has had three principals since the state intervened, Mackey said.
“There’s been a lot of teacher turnover too, and it’s hard to get people to drive there,” Mackey said. “There’s not a lot of housing in the community, so that’s been a struggle for them for a long time, and it’s been a little bit of a struggle even with the intervention.”
Although the construction of the consolidated campus is set to be completed in the next six months, Mackey said there will still be more work to do before the system’s autonomy is restored. One of those things is finances. 
John Heard, the state appointed chief administrative officer for the intervention, said in a recent interview that the system did not have their financials in line before intervention. Now, though, the school system has about four months worth of expenses in reserve, Heard said, about $6.2 million.
“That means they’re gonna have longevity in being able to do a good job keeping up with their finances,” Heard said.
Kinterbish Junior High School in Cuba, Alabama, the first school that was closed in 2023, had less than 70 students in 2022, according to state data. Mackey said the low membership overextended the school system’s staff and cost the district money. Those students were consolidated with York West End Junior High School in December 2023, which brought membership up to 276 students at the end of the 2023-24 school year, according to state data.
“They were overextended in the number of schools. That’s one of the real issues why they got into so many financial issues,” Mackey said. “It’s been one of their academic problems because they were trying to get teachers at all these different little schools and and it was really too much to staff.”
Another issue Mackey had was board governance. He said 18-24 months before the state intervened it recommended the closure of Kinterbish. The board, Mackey said, did not act on the recommendation.
“They were headed toward bankruptcy, and the things that had to be done to keep the system, solve it, mostly closing schools,” Mackey said. “I’m not saying they’re not willing. They were not able to get to the place where they could do it on their own.”
Even with consolidating schools, the system’s membership continues to decline. In the 2021-22 school year, Sumter County Schools had 1,068 students, according to state data. At the end of the 2023-24 school year, the school system had 910 students. Mackey said that some of the student movement is due to students attending University Charter School in the county, which enrolls 691 students.
Academics were also a concern. Sumter County Schools has been one of the state’s lowest performing schools for years, he said. In 2022, the system scored a 70 on the state report card and a 74 in 2024, according to state data. In 2024, the state average was an 85. 
In this year’s state reading test for second and third graders, 47% of Sumter’s second graders and 34% of third graders scored below the proficiency mark, which was raised nine points last year. Third graders system-wide are in the bottom ten school systems in proficiency. In the 2024 test, 40% of Sumter’s second graders and 19% of third graders scored below the proficiency mark.
“That’s a concern for all of us, that we make sure that we reach that goal and exceed it, really,” Heard said. “So there’s gonna be a lot of effort this year to spend more time working on that, to have some side by side coaching with students and teachers.”
Although focus is currently on construction and renovations, Mackey said that once the elementary school wing on Sumter Central High School’s campus is done they will be focusing more on academics.
He said Burroughs, who was appointed superintendent of Sumter County Schools two months before intervention, has an “academic mind” and will be able to improve the system’s academics.
“I think if we can get the other pieces taken care of, then she’ll be able to manage the academics,” he said.

Staff and community support
Burroughs and Heard said that they have not heard of any outright opposition to the intervention; however, they have heard some community members say they feel they’ve lost their voice.
“I think just the idea that the state is actually running the system does have some angst in some people,” Heard said. “I think a lot of people are excited about the fact that they’re getting a new facility.”
Board President Elanor James said in a recent interview that the progress the schools system has made would not have been possible without the state, but parents are wary of the future.
“There’s pros and cons to anything. Some say that they are happy that the state is here because we’re getting a new school, which we probably wouldn’t have gotten if the state intervention hadn’t come in,” James said. “Then some are kind of wary about it, they feel that the schools were doing OK.”
Sumter County teachers and staff said in interviews that they supported the intervention. 
Carla Landrum, a first grade teacher in the district, said she’s noticed teachers being more focused since intervention started.
“Everybody came in with a purpose. We knew what our kids needed. We wanted to make sure that that’s what they were getting,” Landrum said during the June site visit.
Natalie Adams, a second grade teacher, said the additional hands-on resources from the state have yielded a noticeable difference in the kids’ learning and engagement.
“I like them to collaborate so they can get an understanding that if they work together, someone may know something that someone else may know, may not know,” Adams said. “When they work together, it seems to work better for them.”
Burroughs said in a phone interview in June that intervention stabilized “finance, governance and academic oversight.”
“I had just gotten hired in July, and the state intervened in August, so it was kind of sort of like we came in both at the same time and we were able to develop a partnership.”
Heard accredits the success of the intervention to Mackey and the support from state personnel.
“Dr. Mackey had really committed his staff to just support us 100% whatever we needed, whether it was federal programs, whether it was a finance department, whether it was career tech,” Heard said. “He pretty much made his entire staff available to us for whatever we needed to make certain that we were doing the best possible approach for whatever we were doing.”
Mackey said he plans for the intervention to last another year or two, and hopes to be out in 2027.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9569-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Now the practice of frequent redistricting is raising the possibility that a stalled ballot measure to create an independent redistricting commission in Nevada could be resurrected, and if successful, trickle down to local governments.
Councilwoman Carrie Cox, who is running for reelection next year, suggests the council is rejiggering the maps with an eye toward boosting prospects for her opponent, Nevada State Board of Education member Annette Dawson Owens, who has been endorsed by Cox’s fellow council members.
“When you have colleagues that do the things that I’ve had done to me, it’s an easy trip to know that something’s going on,” Cox said at the City Council meeting Tuesday, where she cast the lone vote against the redistricting plan recommended by staff.
Bad blood flows freely on the Henderson Council. 
“Every two weeks there’s a pattern, if you haven’t figured it out, with a false narrative right before a City Council meeting,” Councilwoman Monica Larson, the newest member of the council, said from the dais, referring to Cox. “The narrative spun was gerrymandering, but what I appropriately call it is grandstanding.”
“That’s absolutely not true,” Cox said Friday. “Review the City Council meeting recordings on the website. The only pattern is the rest of the council voting against me when I stand up for my constituents.” 
Larson, a California transplant, campaigned last year on the promise of aligning with Cox to turn back an “insular cabal” — a Las Vegas Review-Journal reference in its 2024 endorsement of Larson — of Mayor Michelle Romero and three council members who routinely voted in lockstep. 
Instead of teaming with Cox, Larson cozied up to Romero, Councilman Dan Stewart, and Councilman Jim Seebock. 
On Wednesday, Romero called out Cox’s campaign for issuing a news release that asserts there is “strong evidence that the mayor had authorized the use of internally crafted population estimates” for the redistricting effort.   
“Either the person making these statements has a profound lack of understanding of both our charter and our city operations, or they have purposefully misled the public with these statements,” Romero said. 
Reapportionment and redistricting efforts are conducted nationwide every ten years, following the completion of the U.S. Census, to ensure congressional and legislative districts represent roughly the same amount of residents.  
Unlike most Nevada municipalities, which rely on the Census to determine population, in 2013, Henderson, the second-fastest growing city in Nevada at the time (behind Las Vegas), won legislative approval to change its charter to let the city’s own demographer estimate each ward’s population. When the number of residents in one ward varies by more than 5% from another, the city must redraw its maps. 
The population of Ward Three exceeds that of Ward Four by 7.8% and the population of Ward Two exceeds that of Ward Four by 5.6%, according to Henderson’s longtime Demographer Andy Powell.  
“If we were, for instance, to go 10 years without redistricting, given the high rate of growth that we’ve seen, we could see upwards of 20, 25% difference in population between some of some of the wards, and that would effectively serve to dilute the voting power” of residents in faster-growing wards, Powell said at Wednesday’s meeting. 
The city redrew its ward maps in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2021, 2023, and 2025.
Cox says this is the second time Henderson has tweaked her ward since she was elected in 2022. 
“They once again tried to move over 40,000 residents, many of them my voters,” she said Friday.   
Henderson grew by 22% in the decade ending December 2023, according to a study based on the U.S. Census data. But growth has slowed. For the year ending in June 2024, the most recent data available from the state demographer, Henderson’s population of 350,706 grew by 2.6%. 
City staff presented two redistricting options to the council. 
Plan One would have affected 40,000 residents, or 11% of the population by moving a dozen precincts. Three precincts that were moved in 2023 would have moved again. 
Plan Two accomplished the same goal of reducing the disparity between ward population by moving one precinct of roughly 4,500 residents (1.4% of the city’s population) out of Cox’s Ward Three. 
The two plans submitted to the council by Henderson staff raise questions about the motivation behind the redistricting effort and the veracity of the city’s internal estimates, which some experts challenged, 
Voting rights advocate Sondra Cosgrove, among others, wondered why Henderson officials floated a plan to move 40,000 residents when the alternative — moving 4,500 residents to another ward — achieves the same outcome. 
“City staff followed industry best practices and the City Charter requirements to develop the proposed redistricting maps,” Henderson spokeswoman Madeleine Skains said via email. “Staff selected two plans for consideration because they minimize impact, best achieve population balance and align with the best practices and Charter requirements. Both plans were provided to give City Council options to balancing these priorities.”
Romero, who is also seeking reelection next year, did not respond to inquiries about whether she requested two plans. 
“I cannot see how moving one precinct from one ward into another is political,” Stewart said, as he made a motion to approve Plan Two, which passed four to one. 
Former Henderson Police Chief Hollie Chadwick, who is challenging Romero in the race for mayor, declined to say whether she believes Henderson should return to redistricting every 10 years. 
“If you’re continually being moved between one ward and another, voters don’t know who represents them,” says Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada professor who heads up Fair Maps Nevada PAC. The group has unsuccessfully tried to let voters decide if an independent redistricting commission is better suited than state lawmakers to draw the lines for legislative and congressional districts. 
In 2020, the pandemic put a crimp in Fair Map’s effort to collect signatures to put the redistricting revamp on the ballot. In 2024, the Nevada Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that struck down two similar initiatives slated for the ballot that year. The ruling in favor of a Democratic voter found the measures created a commission with no source of funding. 
Although the ballot measure doesn’t affect redistricting of local governments, Cosgrove says given the power of the state in Nevada over local governments, a successful effort to include a redistricting commission in the constitution could prompt the Legislature to direct cities and counties to follow suit, and redraw maps every 10 years. 
Sept. 1 is the first day to file constitutional amendment ballot questions. 
“We’ve been going back and forth about what’s the best approach to not get sued,” Cosgrove said Thursday regarding the measure’s potential ressurrection. “And right now, I don’t care about that anymore. Based on what’s happening in Texas, everybody sees how bad it is.”

Donald Trump’s Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, prompted Gov. Greg Abbott to threaten the lawmakers with arrest.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B176A6C1-12DE-401B-BB9F-C95F48C61767-scaled-e1754831306425-1024x746.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
A soon-to-be law regulates SC sales of a psychoactive herb. No, it’s not marijuana.

This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
In South Carolina, a law signed in May after passing both chambers unanimously bans stores from selling kratom to anyone under 21. For legal sales to adults, kratom products must have “clear” labeling that includes ingredients, the amount of kratom, recommended amount for safe usage, and servings per container. The law also bans the sale of kratom products mixed with other things.
The law took effect July 11, exactly 60 days after Gov. Henry McMaster signed it.
The two-month delay was designed to give owners of the stores that sell the products time to comply, said the law’s author, state Sen. Russell Ott, D-St. Matthews.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers.
Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
44 more people charged with trafficking drugs in SC fentanyl overdose investigation

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 Public health concerns

Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21.
But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month ordered parties in a redistricting case to submit briefs on whether majority-minority districts were constitutional, which could have ramifications for Alabama's two congressional districts with large Black populations. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)U.S. Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus recently asked attorneys for Alabama a direct question: Why should we ignore the past?
This happened during a hearing on Alabama’s congressional district maps. Marcus and his two colleagues — U.S. district judges Anna Manasco and Terry Moorer, both Trump appointees — ruled in May that the state discriminated against Black voters by approving a 2023 map that gave those Alabamians little chance of electing their preferred leaders.
As the court considered sanctions, Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour argued that the judges could only impose preclearance, or judicial review of future congressional maps, if they found numerous violations of the 14th and 15th amendments, which address congressional representation and voting rights. The Legislature’s actions in 2023, LaCour said, were unlike the “unremitting and ingenious defiance that made it nearly impossible for Black voters in the South to register to vote.”
“I hear you that to a certain extent, states should be given some ability to be viewed as actors with clean hands,” Marcus replied. “But the state of Alabama shouldn’t be divorced from its history, should it?”
I can answer that. No. A thousand times no.
Look at the history of Alabama from 1901 to 2025. You can’t find any example of Alabama officials helping or even allowing Black Alabamians to vote without federal or judicial intervention. Left to their own devices, they put up obstacles. And worse.
Our state government exists to let powerful elites act without restraint. Alabama leaders have spent over a century demanding that same level of deference from the federal government, the only force that ever made our leaders pay attention to citizens outside the country clubs.
And in that quest, the elites have had a powerful ally: the U.S. Supreme Court.
In 1903, Black Alabamians presented the nation’s high court with transcripts of Alabama’s 1901 constitutional convention, in which leaders said without caveat or dissembling that they planned to disenfranchise Black voters and defy the spirit of the Reconstruction amendments. In the face of this tyranny, the justices claimed they had no power to enforce the U.S. Constitution. At least as applied to Black Americans.
Sure, there were 15 years where the Warren Court acted responsibly. The justices upheld the Voting Rights Act in 1966 in the face of a lawsuit from South Carolina (in which Alabama officials filed a brief on behalf of the Palmetto State).
But that was the eye of the hurricane.
In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which required the U.S. Department of Justice to approve any voting law changes made by Alabama and other states with long histories of racial discrimination. That’s preclearance. Chief Justice John Roberts, siding with a group of Shelby County plaintiffs who challenged the law, wrote that the country “had changed.”
In the next decade, Alabama lawmakers made Roberts look like a sucker or a conspirator. Since the 2013 decision, Alabama has banned drop boxes used by voters with disabilities and criminalized some forms of absentee ballot assistance.
And look at the last two years. Marcus, Manasco and Moorer ordered the Legislature in 2023 to draw two districts where Black voters had an opportunity to elect their preferred leaders. The Legislature responded with a nonresponsive map. And that, as Alabama House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said at the time, was deliberate. They intended to ignore the lower court and win an appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The state lost that time. Last week, the court ordered the state to keep the current congressional map in place through the 2030 Census.
But the nation’s highest court now appears ready to ride to our leaders’ rescue.
The justices earlier this month ordered the parties in a Louisiana redistricting case to brief them on whether majority-minority districts violate the 14th and 15th amendments.
This is a bad sign for Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the last shred of the law remaining. Section 2 bans voting laws that discriminate based on race. It was critical in Alabama’s redistricting case. The lower court judges ruled that since Alabama voting is racially polarized — with white Alabamians tending to support Republicans and Black Alabamians tending to support Democrats — the Legislature’s preferred map swamped Black voters and didn’t give them an actual voice in the political process. Hence, the two districts.
Declare those unconstitutional, and Black Alabama voices in Congress will be silenced. The Republicans who control our government will not hesitate to draw seats to ensure our delegation is all GOP and all-white.
What would stop them?
This is not a government that works for its people. This is a regime that protects the privilege of the powerful. It sees popular opinion as a threat to be siphoned off or contained. Left to their own devices, Alabama officials will always make it difficult for Alabamians to govern themselves.
And sadly, you don’t have to go very far back in the past to find examples of that.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Friday_maps_20-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.

Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

(Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
States stiffen penalties for fentanyl, despite public health concerns

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
As Kratom Use Surges, Some States Enact Bans

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Progressives and voting rights advocates are divided on whether California and New York should fight the Texas power grab by gerrymandering their own states, creating more safe Democratic seats, even if that means undermining fair maps and the authority of those states’ nonpartisan redistricting commissions.
In Wisconsin, which just got out from under one of the worst partisan gerrymanders in the U.S., and the impenetrable, outsized Republican majorities in the state Legislature it protected for a decade and a half, this issue hits particularly close to home.
It’s head-spinning to hear arguments for Democratic counter-gerrymandering in other states from the same people in Wisconsin who were recently crying out for fair maps.
If Democrats are going to mount a serious challenge to the fascist takeover of our country by Trump and his minions, it’s hard to see how ceding the moral high ground and running roughshod over the principle that the will of the majority of voters should prevail is going to help.
I get that it’s more satisfying to imagine a quick fix to the fascist takeover of every branch of government than to listen to a lot of vague talk about long-term plans to rebuild democracy. After all, election deniers and the architects of the Jan. 6 attack are now running the federal government, demanding access to voter lists across the country and deploying the FBI to arrest political opponents, including the Texas Democrats who’ve fled their state to stall the gerrymandering scheme there.
But here in Wisconsin, where we’ve just finally beaten back the most gerrymandered map in the country, it’s depressing to imagine Democrats abandoning the high ground and scrambling to do exactly what Republicans did when they controlled all three branches of government, attempting to lock in permanent political control against the will of the people.
If we want democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, we need to champion, well, democracy, fairness and the rule of law.
In this most extreme political moment, with every public institution and the continued existence of U.S. democracy in doubt, I understand why the long view frustrates people. The emergency is now. I understand that many voters want to see Democrats “fight fire with fire,” as Newsom put it.
But consider this: Republicans control more state legislatures (28 Republican versus 18 controlled by Democrats) and have trifecta control of all branches of government in more states (23 all-GOP states versus 15 all-Democratic). JD Vance just launched a tour of Republican states to encourage more mid-decade gerrymandering. And Trump wants to hold a new census for the purpose of redefining who can vote. Even if Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom and Kathy Hochul succeed in gerrymandering California and New York, Democrats are not likely to win the nationwide redistricting war.
Meanwhile, democracy will be the first casualty of that war. California and New York would have to suspend the work of their nonpartisan redistricting commissions — the gold standard for fair, nonpartisan map-drawing — and take back partisan control of the process in order to carry out their threats. If they succeed, it is beyond unlikely that the politicians who pull off that short-term victory will ever cede back their power over the voting maps to the nonpartisan commissions again.
On a deeper level, the Democratic gerrymandering fantasy takes the whole movement to oppose Trump in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of building grassroots support to counter an unpopular, authoritarian leader, it rigs the system to benefit a party whose whole problem is that it has lost the broad, popular support it needs to win elections and create a better, more enlightened government.
Instead of trying to rig the maps to ensure a Democratic House majority in the next election, Democrats need to focus on winning elections and flipping seats in areas of the rural and industrial Midwest that were once reliably blue but have turned deep red.
To do that they need to make the case that health care, education and an adequate social safety net are bedrock rights in the richest nation on earth, and that we should not be giving tax breaks to billionaires by taking food out of the mouths of hungry children.
They need to offer something to the farmers and factory workers and disaffected voters in rural and urban areas alike that is clearly different and better than the hate, corruption, and a determination to run roughshod over democracy that Republicans offer.
In Wisconsin, voting rights groups have been working on a campaign to push through a constitutional amendment modeled on one in our neighboring state of Michigan, to make sure that our voting maps are never again drawn up by partisan legislators.
That’s the kind of grassroots fight that helped Wisconsin finally overcome Republican gerrymandering. One important aspect of the fair maps movement is the way it engaged citizens to feel like participants, not spectators, in democracy, and to find their common interests instead of focusing on the politics of division. This, not more politicians in safe seats who don’t have to listen to voters, is what we need right now.
The battle to beat back fascism does not turn on a handful of Democrats in protected districts. It turns on an organized uprising by the majority of people in the U.S. who are willing to join together despite their differences because they are sick and tired of having their democracy stolen from them, along with their health, safety, opportunity and hope. There’s no short cut to leading that fight.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-11 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What is diquat? Here’s what to know about herbicide at the center of debate in CT,John Moritz and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/11/diquat-army-corps-hydrilla/,Diquat is among the most common herbicides used on invasive plants. It's approved for use in the US by the Environmental Protections Agency.,"Throughout this summer, a debate has raged along the Connecticut River over a little known but widely used chemical herbicide: diquat.
The controversy kicked off in June when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced its plans to resume using diquat and other herbicides to combat the spread of invasive hydrilla along the river. Those plans were part of a years-long effort to study the effectiveness of using herbicides to control hydrilla. They quickly became the subject of viral social media posts. 
Here’s what to know about the herbicide, the Army Corps’ plans, and risks to the public:
What is diquat?
Diquat, or diquat dibromide, is a chemical herbicide that was first developed in England in the 1950s for use in agriculture. Diquat is a fast-acting, non-selective herbicide, meaning it can be used against a wide range of weeds, invasive plants and other target species.
Dr. Melissa Perry, dean of the College of Public Health at George Mason University, said diquat can be used as a “burndown” herbicide that is applied to soils before crops are planted in order to control weeds. In agriculture, it is most commonly used in growing potatoes, oil seed crops and vineyards, though Perry said diquat remains relatively rare for use on U.S. farms.
While it is known to persist in soils for a long time, diquat dissipates quickly in water — making it much more popular as an aquatic herbicide.
Despite some claims that have circulated online, Perry said that diquat is not related to Agent Orange, another herbicide that became infamous for its use by U.S. troops during the Vietnam War.
How is it being used in Connecticut?
In Connecticut, diquat is among the most common herbicides used to rid lakes and ponds of invasive plants such as hydrilla, water chestnut and Eurasian watermilfoil.
A total of 955 permits have been issued since 2022 allowing for the use of diquat in aquatic settings. 
The chemical works by destroying walls of plant cells from within and interrupting the photosynthesis process. Diquat is known to be especially effective against plants with weak root systems, like hydrilla, and is not as lethal to plants with stronger roots.
Typically, the herbicide is either sprayed at the surface level or it is mixed into a sinking solution that is injected under the water through hoses. The latter method is the one that the Army Corps of Engineers have employed as part of their ongoing studies on the Connecticut River.
That work began in 2023, when research scientists began placing dyes into the river to study its flow in order to determine what herbicides to use, in different concentrations, in areas afflicted by hydrilla. Based on those results, the Army Corps first started applying herbicides, including diquat, at five areas along the river last summer.
The Army Corps has recorded large declines in the amount of invasive hydrilla, with minimal impacts to native plants, as a result of that application. This summer, the hydrilla has returned in Chester Boat Basin and, to a larger extent, in Selden Cove, according to the Corps’ reports. Both sites were selected for additional treatments when the Corps’ resumes its studies this month.
What are the risks?
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the potential health risks from diquat are mostly associated with people who work with the chemical or apply it to their lawns and gardens.
The agency does not report any dietary or other post-application risks associated with exposure to treated water.
“The bottom line is, if the labeled directions are being followed, there are no concerns from people swimming or coming into contact with water that’s been treated with diquat,” said Anne Overstreet, the director of the EPA’s Pesticide Re-Evaluation Division.
Overstreet said that the agency has determined that diquat can be “mildly toxic” to fish and other aquatic wildlife that are not the intended targets of its treatment. Reports released by the agency said those effects can be mitigated by applying the herbicide underneath the water, as opposed to spraying it on the surface where it can more easily drift into other areas.
Due to the potential risk to people who handle diquat in undiluted concentrations, the EPA requires certain workers to wear protective clothing, including respirators and protective eyewear. 
Perry, the epidemiologist, said skin exposure can be toxic and ingesting diquat is “highly toxic,” interfering with the gut, its microbiome and other internal organs.
How is it regulated?
Diquat and other herbicides are approved for use in the U.S. by the EPA. The agency completed its most recent review of diquat in 2020, allowing its continued use in a variety of applications including lakes and waterways.
Diquat is also commercially available as an ingredient in several household landscaping products.
Critics of the Army Corps’ plans have frequently pointed out that diquat is banned in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Diquat lost its registration status in the E.U. in 2019, but it has been approved for emergency use dozens of times since, including in Ireland, Denmark and Hungary.
EPA is in charge of approving herbicides for the wider market, but Connecticut DEEP reviews and approves any requests to apply diquat or other chemicals within the state’s waterways. As part of its approval process, DEEP requires users post signs letting people know when it’s safe to swim, fish or use the water for irrigation purposes.
What are the alternatives?
Other methods for combating invasive aquatic plants include the use of mechanical harvesters or large mats to block sunlight, preventing plants from growing.
Due to the costs and inability to target specific plants without also impacting large numbers of native species, Army Corps officials determined that neither option was suitable for use along the Connecticut River.
In 2017, voters in New Fairfield adopted an ordinance to prevent officials from using diquat and other herbicides to combat a similar infestation of invasive weeds on Candlewood Lake. As an alternative to using herbicides, the Candlewood Lake Authority began introducing sterile grass carp to feed on watermilfoil and other weeds. Between 2015 and 2017, more than 8,000 carp were stocked into the lake.
Those actions effectively controlled excess vegetation, Mark Howarth, the CLA’s executive director, said in an email. But in 2022, “there was a big shift in the lake and virtually all of the vegetation was eliminated,” including native species, Howarth said. The die-off was attributed to both the voracious carp and the annual lowering of water levels by the lake’s owner, FirstLight Energy. As as result, DEEP has been working to remove the carp from the lake until the vegetation can recover.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5345047.jpg,,,2025-08-11 07:57:11.236088

They came with promises of transformation: thousands of jobs, surging salaries and a foothold in the booming electric vehicle market.
Imola Automotive USA, a Boca Raton, Florida-based startup, pitched officials in small, struggling towns in Georgia, Oklahoma and Arkansas on a bold vision. The company planned to build six EV plants, create 45,000 jobs —  and help these impoverished communities secure a place in America’s green future.
But more than 18 months later, the company hasn’t broken ground on a single site. And its top executive — whose background is in television and athletic shoes, not automotive manufacturing — has gone silent.
A Floodlight investigation did not uncover lost taxpayer money in Fort Valley, Georgia; Langston, Oklahoma; or Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Imola has sought free land, municipal financing and other incentives for its shifting proposals. 
But an economic development watchdog said the episode illustrates how the frenzy to land electric vehicle jobs can leave economically distressed towns vulnerable to empty promises.

Imola CEO Rodney Henry declined requests for an interview. He responded to Floodlight’s inquiries with a short statement, insisting the company had not given up on its plans, which have included a partnership with an Italian manufacturer of two-seat electric vehicles. 
“Our timetable has been modified due to matters outside of our control,” Henry said in a statement. “We are highly focused on bringing our goals into alignment. Due to proprietary consideration as well as NDA (nondisclosure) agreements, we are not at liberty to discuss specifics at this juncture.”
That’s a stark shift from the company’s earlier promises. In a press release issued in January 2024, Henry claimed the company had already secured land in multiple states to build half a dozen plants and create tens of thousands of jobs. 
Could someone with no experience in car manufacturing really deliver that?
“It’s ludicrous,” said Greg LeRoy, CEO of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks and analyzes economic development projects. 
Building large auto plants, he said, requires “a great deal of capital, a great deal of management skill, a great deal of engineering and marketing chops. And obviously, Tesla developed those, but they didn’t do it overnight, right?”
Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff weren’t the only towns swept up in the competition to attract electric vehicle plants. Spurred by federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which unlocked billions in private investment and expanded government incentives, local officials across the country scrambled to land high-paying manufacturing jobs and a slice of the booming clean energy economy.
Since the IRA passed in 2022, more than 150 EV plants have been announced in the United States, according to E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for economic development good for the environment.
But that rush may be grinding to a halt. The recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” rolls back many federal tax credits and incentives for electric vehicles. The law is already throwing the EV sector into turmoil — threatening to stall or shrink the kinds of ambitious projects towns like Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff were counting on. E2 reports that plans for 14 EV-related plants have been canceled this year.
  Imola Automotive USA President Rodney Henry said in early 2024 that his company had chosen Langston, Okla., and Pine Bluff, Ark., as sites for their electric vehicle plants because they were close to universities. That, he said, would create career opportunities for residents and students of Langston University, a historically Black college. The plans in Langston, however, have been canceled. (Website for Langston, Okla.)
Bold promises, then silence
In three towns where Imola pledged massive investment, there’s no sign of construction and little more than confusion.
Langston — a town of 1,600 where more than 35% of residents live in poverty — never saw Imola’s plans take shape.
A 2023 letter to the city council from former Imola chief operating officer Eric Pettus stated that the company had run into “multiple obstacles,” including trouble acquiring enough land.
“In order for us to continue moving forward on the project we are requesting that the City of Langston convey to us any and all vacant properties owned by the city,” Pettus wrote.
Langston City Council member Magnus Scott said the company also asked the town to issue municipal bonds to help them build their plant. Since then, he said, a company representative told him the deal had been canceled. 
“I guess maybe they ran into financial problems,” Scott said.
Reached by phone, Pettus, of south Florida, said he’s no longer employed by Imola but instead works as a consultant for the company. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he declined to discuss Imola’s plans.
Fort Valley gave its backing in early 2024 to Imola’s ambitious plan to build an EV plant that would employ 7,500 workers.

Since then, however, there has been no sign of construction. (Fort Valley State University)
A year later, with no sign of progress on the plant, the company came back to the Georgia town with an entirely different proposal. This time, instead of building an EV plant, they pitched a high-tech lighting system for the town. 
One city council member balked.
“You want us to sign an agreement for 99 years before you bring us the car company,” said council member Laronda Eason, according to minutes of the March 2025 meeting. “It feels like a bait and switch.” 
Eason did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment on the Imola proposal.
In Pine Bluff, where per capita income last year was just over $21,000, city officials were initially all in. Writing to Henry in August 2024, then-Mayor Shirley Washington said the city of 39,000 stood ready to buy land, build infrastructure and issue industrial revenue bonds to support Imola’s vision. 
“With an anticipated employment base of more than 8,000 jobs,” Washington wrote, “we firmly believe this investment will marshal a pivotal turning point in our community.” 
But a year later, the project hasn’t moved. 
“We never did get off the ground with that,” Washington said in a brief phone interview.
 LeRoy said Imola’s pitch fits a troubling pattern.
“It grabs me as an example of how the craze among governors and mayors to get the next big thing has caused some sloppy vetting,” he said of the struggling communities courted by Imola. 
Such towns, he said, are “easy prey. …They’re desperate.”

Grand vision, missing details
Henry, who lives in Florida, touts a background as a longtime TV executive producer and the founder of Protégé, an athletic footwear brand. He claims on his IMDB profile that Protégé donated a million pairs of shoes to African nations.
But despite announcements of partnerships and promises of good-paying jobs, his EV company has yet to show any tangible progress. 
Floodlight found the website for Imola — named after the Italian city where Tazzari EVs are made — is no longer accessible without a password. A search of the Tazzari website found no mention of plants in the United States. But a 2024 version of the Imola site mentions the tiny vehicles “coming soon to America.”
In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA and the Tazzari Group — an Italian firm best known for its electric two-seater micro cars — jointly announced plans for a partnership. 
The EVs that Tazzari makes in Italy aren’t designed for highway driving. Top speed on the company’s Opensky Sport model is about 56 miles per hour, while maximum speed on the Opensky Limited is about 37 mph, according to the company’s webpage.
  These are some of the electric two-seater micro cars made by the Tazzari Group. The Italian firm and Imola Automotive USA jointly announced plans for a partnership in early 2024 as Imola promised to build electric vehicle plants in economically struggling U.S. towns. There’s no sign of progress so far. (Tazzari Group’s website)
Tazzari didn’t respond to email messages from a Floodlight reporter.
Henry said at the time that the company chose Langston and Fort Valley because of their universities. 
“Both of these locations are ideal,” he said in the January 2024 news release, “as their proximity to communities with institutions of higher learning, will allow residents and students career opportunities in the fast growing EV Technology and Innovation Industry.” 
Many local officials in Fort Valley, Langston and Pine Bluff did not respond to interview requests. Few documents were provided in response to Floodlight’s public records requests.
But it’s clear from available records that Imola’s promises stirred hope. 
Langston Mayor Michael Boyles called the proposal “transformative” in a January 2024 news release.
But some local leaders soon began to question the details.
Erica Johnson, a real estate agent and former member of Langston’s economic development commission, said parts of the plan didn’t add up. How, for instance, would the company house more than 1,000 workers in such a small town? And how were they going to build such a large plant on land without utilities or water?
Her doubts deepened when she learned that Imola wanted to lock down land agreements without putting up any earnest money.
“My early feeling was that, ‘Something is not quite okay with this,’ ” she said. “But I think the hope for our community kind of outweighed the ability to just take things slow and look at them for where they are and what they are — versus where you hope them to be.”
Eventually, the promise fizzled. 
“It was disappointing,” Johnson said. “…We could have had our energy and time focused on something that seemed more valid and more substantial.”
  In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA promised that it would build an electric vehicle plant in Fort Valley, Ga., that would employ 7,500 people — and pay average wages of $45 an hour. The promises have raised hopes in the economically struggling town, but there’s little indication they will be fulfilled. (Michael Rivera via Wikimedia)
Still waiting for the shovels
Some residents in Fort Valley are still holding out hope.
Mayor Jeffery Lundy said early last year that it was a “priority for my administration to land a company like Imola Automotive USA.” Local officials, he said, were looking forward to the economic boost the plant would bring.
At the time, Imola claimed it would break ground on a 195-acre site by the third quarter of 2024 and open the plant within 20 months, according to a report in the Macon Telegraph. 
During a February 2024 town hall meeting, Imola officials told residents that the plant would pay employees an average of $45 an hour, according to a Facebook post. Commenters buzzed with excitement, with one writing: “Application me !!!!” 
Pettus told a local TV station that most jobs would require only a high school diploma.
In early 2024, Fort Valley rezoned land to accommodate the plant, and the city council signed off on the deal. But more than 15 months later, there’s still no sign of construction. 
Council members were told that Georgia Power couldn’t provide sufficient power for the EV company, according to minutes of their March 2025 meeting. A spokesman for Georgia Power said that while the utility doesn’t discuss economic development projects, “We’re prepared and ready to meet the energy needs of any new customer.” 
Makita Driver, one of the Facebook commenters who’d voiced excitement about the proposed EV plant, said there’s no doubt she would have applied for one of the jobs there — had the facility ever been built.
“The pay rate was really what got my attention,” she said.
As a medical assistant, Driver said she earns far less than what Imola had promised. But she eventually concluded the promises were too good to be true.
“Who really makes that kind of money starting out?” she asked.
In a brief interview with Floodlight on July 11, Mayor Lundy said he’s still in contact with Henry.
“We are patiently waiting for that groundbreaking,” Lundy said.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa PBS)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a multistate letter Friday questioning whether a new net-zero carbon emissions standard for businesses is illegal under state and federal law.
The letter was sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard.
This standard is meant to aid financial institutions “in addressing their most significant climate impact through alignment and sector-specific targets,” according to the document, through actions like stopping or limiting investments in new projects related to fossil fuel expansion and addressing deforestation risks in existing investments.
This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter.
According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there were 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of September 2023.
South Carolina joined the list in February 2024, when Gov. Henry McMaster signed the ESG Pension Protection Act.
Bird also wrote SBTi and the businesses that commit to following the standard may be in violation of state consumer protection laws and federal and state antitrust laws, constituting an illegal boycott by deliberately cutting off investment and insurance for certain industries through their standard on oil, gas, and coal expansion.
“Some economic arrangements are illegal because they are unfair or unreasonably harmful to competition; the ‘good intentions’ behind them are irrelevant,” Bird wrote.
The letter was co-signed by attorneys general from 22 other states — Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.
In a news release Friday, Bird called the standard from SBTi, which partners with the United Nations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other organizations in providing advisory information, “the next attempt by radical environmentalists to coordinate companies to squeeze important American industries into eliminating carbon dioxide production by some future date.”
“SBTi is trying to redo President Biden’s radical green scheme,” Bird said in a statement. “If successful, they’ll hurt farmers, energy producers, and Iowans. Its program limits output of goods or services, and these unrealistic net-zero programs harm both American agriculture and industry. Making net-zero a goal actively harms Americans, creates risk for energy independence, and increases the cost of safe, healthy, nutritious food.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also took steps to investigate SBTi last week, announcing he would issue subpoenas to the advisory group and the CDP, an international nonprofit focused on environmental impact reporting.
The investigation will look into whether these organizations violated state consumer protection and antitrust laws “by coercing companies into disclosing proprietary data and paying for access under the guise of environmental transparency,” according to a news release.
“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift. We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers.”
South Carolina’s anti-ESG law requires the Retirement System Investment Commission to make investment decisions based only on “pecuniary factors” — in other words, what’s expected to net the most money — without giving weight to policies such as climate change and social impacts. During a public hearing, the commission’s CEO told legislators nothing would change, since the agency already operated that way.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)From 8% to 100%, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce recently graded Indiana lawmakers on their support of major business legislation in the recent General Assembly session.
The 41st annual Legislator Scorecard was based on how legislators voted on 12 key “pro-economy, pro-jobs” policies. The most significant of the bills was Senate Bill 1, which reduced property taxes — including a break for businesses.
Other key bills included the topics of road funding, education deregulation, economic development, child care, energy generation, higher education and workforce development and health care costs.
“The Legislator Scorecard is a critical measure to track lawmakers’ commitment to keeping our state among the nation’s best for doing business – which also leads to increased economic growth and job opportunities,” said Indiana Chamber President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders. “The legislation that factored into the 2025 rankings was especially important in creating a more attractive tax climate, building our talent pipeline and maintaining needed road infrastructure.”
More than 50 lawmakers earned a perfect mark — all Republicans who generally align with the right-leaning Chamber of Commerce.
Many Republicans were in the 90 percentile, including Fort Wayne Sen. Liz Brown who scored 91%. Her four-year average is 89%. She has recently been targeted as being too liberal and faces a primary fight in 2026 against Allen County school board member Darren Vogt. He is backed by Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Banks.
There were a number of Republicans below 80%. They include Rep. Craig Haggard at 62%; Rep. Matt Hostettler at 75%; Rep. Andrew Ireland at 50%; Rep. Lorissa Sweet at 70%; Rep. Ethan Manning at 75%; Sen. Eric Bassler at 64%; Sen. Vaneta Becker at 42%; Sen. Gary Byrne at 62%; Sen. Spencer Deery at 69%; Sen. Dan Dernulc at 54%; Sen. Aaron Freeman at 54%; Sen. Tyler Johnson at 62%; Sen. Jean Leising; Sen. Jim Tomes at 46%; Sen. Michael Young at 42% and Sen. Andy Zay at 38%.
Some common bills that cost these lawmakers were ‘no’ votes on road funding and property tax relief.
The lower scores largely were assigned to Democrats, though the worst grade went to GOP Indianapolis Sen. Mike Bohacek.
Other awards
Seven policymakers also were further selected as an Indiana Chamber Legislative Champion, Small Business Champion or Champion Freshman Legislator.
The Legislative Champions are Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, and Rep. Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty, for their respective work on pro-business legislation in 2025, namely on the topics of road funding and taxation, respectively.
Additionally, three Small Business Champions were named: Rep. Martin Carbaugh, R-Fort Wayne; Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers;  and Rep. Craig Snow, R-Warsaw.
The Indiana Chamber also honored Rep. Wendy Dant Chesser, D-Jeffersonville, and Rep. Danny Lopez, R-Carmel, as Champion Freshman Legislators for their impacts on boosting entrepreneurship and economic development.
The Legislator Scorecard (formerly Legislative Vote Analysis) is produced annually after the legislative session, the news released said. Lawmakers are kept apprised of the Indiana Chamber position and reasoning on these bills through various communications during the legislative session – and prior to key votes being taken. Only floor votes for which there is a public record are used in the vote calculations.

Bill Lee and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announce a plan for Elon Musk's Boring Company to build an underground tunnel from the airport to Downtown Nashville. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee was all smiles on July 28 as he announced the Boring Company, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, has plans to build a 10-mile tunnel connecting Nashville International Airport with downtown Nashville.
The “Music City Loop,” as the project has been dubbed, will transport riders in electric vehicles, and if the project is anything like a similar Boring “Loop” in Las Vegas, the cars will all be Teslas, as Musk also owns Tesla. 
The company website says it creates tunnels to “solve the problem of soul destroying traffic,” and Lee said the project “will transform the way people travel from the airport to downtown Nashville.”
Aside from the Looney Tunes-Wile E. Coyote-sounding aspect of the project, the potential environmental impacts of boring through Middle Tennessee’s limestone — even Boring CEO Steve Davis admitted construction would be challenging —  and the company’s poor track record — it has managed to complete only one similar project, in Las Vegas, while projects in Illinois, Maryland, Florida and California have all been busts — there’s another topic on my mind. 
Hypocrisy, or, perhaps, lack thereof. 
My first thought was that Lee’s support for the project is hypocritical: After all, Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers have repeatedly over the last decade sneered at and stomped on efforts by Nashville leaders to enact mass transit plans geared toward alleviating the city’s growing traffic snarls while simultaneously stripping the city’s power.
Nashville, Tennessee voters green light transit tax

In 2012, Nashville Mayor Karl Dean pitched a plan for bus rapid transit (BRT), which allows buses to use dedicated lanes down the center of streets, expediting travel time: BRT is one of the simplest and most effective methods for expanding municipal transit. More than half of U.S. states implement BRT — including conservative states like Alabama, Florida and Texas.
The plan wasn’t perfect, but it was a starting point, aimed at connecting East and West Nashville. Nonetheless, it drew pushback from conservative political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity and subsequently from Tennessee Republicans. 
Former state Rep. Jeremy Durham, a Franklin Republican, crafted a measure in 2014 that would give the state the final say on any BRT project, whether state funds were used or not. Not only did that project, known as The Amp, die, but the law continues to impede Nashville’s transit plans: despite the city’s voters approving by a large margin a new tax to pay for transit improvements, city leaders will still need state approval to add transit on state roads. 
More recently, the GOP-legislature has enacted measure after preemptive measure designed to strip power from Nashville’s Metro Council and governing boards — including the Airport Authority and Convention Center Authority  — and to cut the size of Metro Council in half.
So, yes, supporting this boondoggle for billionaires and tourists may, at first glance, appear hypocritical based on past opposition to transit, but after thinking this over, I would argue that it’s 100% on brand for Lee and the state lawmakers who zoomed approval for a no-cost lease of state property to the Musk company. 
The Lee administration has failed to find solutions — or in some cases, even to try to find them — for issues important to Tennesseans. Since Lee was elected in 2018, he has raised no concern about the number of Tennesseans who lack health insurance. The Tennessee Justice Center, a nonprofit public advocacy organization, estimates about 300,000 people in the state aren’t covered by TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program, as lawmakers have refused to take a federal Medicaid expansion enacted in the Obama administration.
Gun safety? A nonstarter. After a 2023 school shooting, Lee held a special legislative session ostensibly devoted to creating safer laws around gun possession. Little was accomplished other than an agreement to apply $50 million to community mental health programs — a good start, but the funds were pulled from the already overburdened TennCare.
Then there’s the Department of Children’s Services. The state has been woefully slow to find solutions for the problem of having kids in state custody sleeping on the floor of office buildings. And although Lee has touted adoption as a solution to the number of children in foster care, Anita Wadhwani recently reported about a family who adopted a child with mental health needs, only to be thwarted in their attempts to find him help and threatened with child abandonment charges. 
Kids in state custody forced to sleep on floors in state office building

Finally, we have the Middle Tennessee issue of, yes, soul-destroying traffic. 
The area around Nashville is in dire need of mass transit to navigate the three interstates that run through the city. Commutes from Murfreesboro up the I-24 corridor during rush hour are legendary for bumper-to-bumper traffic. To get from Franklin to Nashville — around 18 miles — easily takes an hour. 
What does Lee give us? Toll lanes, couched as “choice lanes,” meaning you have the choice to pay extra money to travel in a less trafficked lane, and now this Musk-backed absurdity. 
Spare me the governor’s platitudes about how the Musk tunnel project will streamline traffic: I feel confident a tunnel for Teslas connecting the airport with downtown will offer little benefit to residents of Nashville and none to commuters who live in surrounding counties, but will put money in the pockets of people who least need it.
Another idea that doesn’t benefit Tennesseans? There’s no hypocrisy: That’s Lee to a tee.

They came to denounce the impact to patients, families and workers if Republicans cut Medicaid, health care and SNAP to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for SEIU)When we hear about health policy changes in the news, usually the numbers we hear are related to insurance: How many people will become insured or uninsured as a result of the latest legislation? Analysts — and as a result, news reporters, too — tend to use these numbers because they’re relatively simple to predict and understand.
But at the end of the day, health insurance is just a little card legally linked to a thick stack of paperwork in some office somewhere. Insurance numbers don’t really tell us much about what we actually want to know, which is the human health impact. How many medically avoidable deaths will a given piece of legislation prevent or cause? How many will or won’t get the care they need? How many more will or won’t be in medical debt?
Congress passed and on July 4 President Trump signed his “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the largest ever cut to government health care funding in U.S. history. The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will push about 10 million Americans off of health insurance while growing the deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade.
Health economists have studied the link between health insurance and health outcomes and can estimate how many more preventable deaths Americans will suffer as health coverage declines, among other outcomes.
The Minnesota Department of Human Services recently released preliminary estimates that about 140,000 Minnesotans will lose their health insurance as a result of the legislation.
Additionally, due to upcoming subsidy expirations and rule changes for the Affordable Care Act’s insurance markets (“Obamacare”), health policy analysts at KFF have predicted an additional 5.1 million Americans will become uninsured nationwide, leading to an additional 13,000 uninsured Minnesotans.
Using this 153,000 figure, we can estimate that roughly one more Minnesotan will unnecessarily die per day as a result of losing coverage. Tens of thousands more will forego necessary care, miss medications, and rack up medical expenses they cannot afford.

Make no mistake, however. The craziest part of all of this should not be these figures themselves. It’s the fact that they can mostly still be prevented from coming to fruition by our state Legislature.
KFF estimates that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to cost the state up to $2.4 billion per year over the next decade, leaving a big hole for our state legislators to fill. Although some of these harms are caused by Congress’s imposition of work requirement paperwork burdens on Medicaid beneficiaries that the state cannot do much about, most of them come from the funding cuts, and funding cuts are something the state can definitely do something about. Minnesota just needs to come up with roughly $2.4 billion on its own.
How exactly can the state find such a large sum of money — roughly 6% of the state general fund budget? Believe it or not, it’s not actually that complicated. Currently, the state runs Medicaid through private third-party administrators called managed care organizations, or MCOs. These MCOs are a product of the 1990s, when the public policy world thought the problem with health care was that people were using too much of it, and health care needed gatekeepers.
It’s a rather evidence-free claim. Consider that Americans actually use less care than people in Europe and Canada despite spending far more per capita than them, all while also living shorter, less healthy lives. Nonetheless, the MCOs still run Minnesota’s Medicaid program, adding significant administrative expenses onto the state budget while doing nothing to make health care better.
Connecticut got rid of these wasteful MCO contractors in 2012, instead opting to run its Medicaid program itself. Unsurprisingly, they saved lots of money doing so. How much would Minnesota save if it spent per beneficiary what Connecticut does on Medicaid? About $1.5 billion annually, according to my analysis.
Given the $2.4 billion in cuts also includes some money cut from non-health care areas, that $1.5 billion in savings is likely enough to fill most of the health care-related hole in the state budget! With that money, the state can ensure tens of thousands of Minnesotans get the care they need while preventing closures of Minnesota hospitals and nursing homes that depend on Medicaid for funding.
During the last legislative session, I wrote a column in support of legislation called the Patient-Centered Care bill that would more or less copy what Connecticut did (SF1059/HF255). Unfortunately, neither the state House nor Senate brought it up for serious consideration.
Back then, it was admittedly still uncertain whether Congress would actually pass massive cuts to Medicaid, but it did, and now there are no more excuses. Our state Legislature can quite easily alleviate most of the financial problems Congress has passed onto it and thereby save lives.
All they have to do is pass a not very big but in my opinion quite beautiful bill to cut wasteful MCO middlemen out of our Medicaid program",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2222312159.jpg,,,2025-08-11 07:57:11.236088

Mike Braun and Indiana State Police Superintendent Anthony Scott hold a news conference in the Statehouse on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)If you commit the “crime” of speaking Spanish in Indiana, watch your back. The Indiana State Police and Indiana National Guard are looking for you.
Gov. Mike Braun recently announced the Indiana State Police, Indiana Department of Correction and the Indiana Department of Homeland Security will join the Indiana National Guard in assisting the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement roundup of immigrants into the United States.
Braun said the state will make 1,000 beds available in the Miami Correctional Facility to imprison people who have been convicted of nothing and have been given no due process rights. The Marion County Sheriff has said he will go along with the order, in part because the federal government pays him per detainee, while the state does not.
This is an affront to anyone who values liberty, limited government and human dignity. It wastes police resources — and Hoosiers’ tax money — in diverting them from searching for and prosecuting crimes against person and property by actual criminals to instead round up peaceful people who are seeking a better life. Immigrants work in our farms, factories and communities, shop at our stores, and contribute positively to our state’s economy and culture.
It’s also a gross violation of the words Braun said on Jan. 13, when he placed his hand on a Bible and swore an oath to God and the people of Indiana that he would uphold and defend both the Indiana and United States Constitutions.
Indiana immigration arrests surge despite stalled ICE partnerships

Participating in President Trump’s scheme to systematically dismantle due process and the rule of law is a clear violation of that solemn oath.
While Braun and Trump claim this is a roundup of “violent illegal immigrants,” the witch hunt has gone far beyond that. Of those being arrested, 71% have no criminal convictions at all – and among those who do, most are for minor offenses – and only 8% have been convicted of violent crimes. The number of those without any conviction being arrested and detained keeps rising.
However, Trump has been eager to not just deport the “violent” criminals, but to round up anyone who is Latino, Asian or Middle Eastern, treating everyone as a potential illegal immigrant, to meet the quota of 3,000 arrests per day vocalized by White House adviser Stephen Miller, while the administration gleefully touts deplorable conditions in detention centers and violates due process rights.
To desperately reach that goal, it means rounding up people who aren’t criminals, but who have fled oppressive communist and socialist regimes and lawfully sought asylum, revoking visas and green cards for students without explanation, and sweeping up U.S. citizens and throwing them in jail.
People showing up for their visa appointments — doing the right thing in good faith — are being arrested in court and taken to faraway detention facilities where they know nobody and have little chance of contacting representation. One was a 20-year-old Purdue student from South Korea who was on an active student visa, but arrested, detained and shipped to Louisiana at her hearing.
This is the work of a banana republic, not a republic bound by a Constitution that has a very clear mandate to protect due process rights and a tradition of “innocent until proven guilty.”
Participating in such a system — and actively and enthusiastically doing so — is denying people their dignity, as well as their human rights.
Our beliefs
As Libertarians, we believe in the sovereignty of the individual and the freedom to live, work and move in peace.
A state government deputizing local and state officers to participate in a federal scheme of rounding up people for the sole crime of looking different or speaking with an accent, on the hopes of “finding illegals” violates that principle. It undermines state sovereignty and also sows distrust between our immigrant communities and local authorities.
The U.S. immigration system is irreparably broken. It is a Byzantine system with a number of hoops and steps someone must jump through to legally emigrate to the U.S., which incentivizes “illegal immigration,” and the Trump administration has doubled down on it by not only making legal immigration more difficult, but revoking visas and arresting and deporting people going through the process the right way for small paperwork errors.
Truly making America great would be living up to the words on the Statue of Liberty – “give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free” – not weaponizing local police to kidnap, detain and deport people trying to properly follow the system, while revoking visas and making the immigration system more difficult.
The Libertarian Party of Indiana calls for Braun to revoke this promise, to not allow Indiana prisons to be used to detain people who are not criminals, and to honor our tradition of federalism by refusing to comply with the federal authorities carrying out these heinous acts, while we call on the federal government to offer a bridge, not an alligator-infested moat, to those seeking a better life in the great melting pot of the United States.

(Photo courtesy of Washington State School for the Blind)The longtime superintendent at the Washington State School for the Blind is resigning amid threats from a disgruntled former employee, he announced this month. 
“Change can bring fresh energy and perspective, and I am hopeful the agency will continue to grow and thrive in the years ahead,” Scott McCallum wrote in his resignation letter. “I have decided it is best for me and for the WSSB that I resign from my role as superintendent to seek new leadership opportunities.”
McCallum has been the Vancouver school’s superintendent since 2016. Gov. Bob Ferguson reappointed McCallum upon taking office in January.
In his resignation letter to Ferguson, McCallum attributed his departure, effective Aug. 15, partially to “continuous harassment from a former employee that has created significant disruption across the agency.”
“I remain hopeful that such disruption and threats may cease once I depart my role as superintendent,” he wrote to the governor Aug. 1. “Also, with the recent shift to your administration and our school year ending, I believe this is the appropriate time for WSSB to begin a new chapter under new leadership.”

In a court filing in May related to the alleged harassment, McCallum said he worried the former employee would escalate threats and commit violence. He was especially worried since many of the staff at the school are blind or visually impaired. 
“Her continual focus on us and violence, and our particular vulnerabilities has us all worried and scared,” he wrote. “I regularly drive new routes to work. I park in different places at work regularly, always backed in to make for a quick escape. I can’t leave my house without looking out to see if she is outside and I have found new routes to walk my dogs.”
McCallum didn’t respond to requests for further comment last week.
Ferguson tapped Pam Parker, the school’s outreach director, to serve as interim superintendent for the 2025-26 school year.
The school serves blind, visually-impaired and deaf-blind students. Fifty students were enrolled this past school year, according to state data. It has about 100 full-time equivalent employees and a state budget of around $29 million.
McCallum has a national reputation in education of students who are blind or visually impaired. He helped implement the country’s first online adaptive state assessment that is accessible to students who read Braille.
In 2022, the National Federation of the Blind awarded McCallum with the Distinguished Educator of Blind Students award. 
Before coming to Washington, McCallum worked in education in Oregon.

WATERLOO, Iowa — John-Paul Sager appreciates the care he has received at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics, but he thinks it should be easier for veterans like him to use their benefits elsewhere.
Sager, a Marine Corps and Army veteran, uses his VA coverage for non-VA treatment of back injuries stemming from his military service. But he said he sometimes must make several phone calls to obtain approval to see a local chiropractor. “It seems like it takes entirely too long,” he said.
Many veterans live hours from VA facilities, or they need health services that aren’t readily available from the VA. In such cases, the department is supposed to provide a referral and pay for private care. Critics say it often hesitates to do so.
Republicans controlling Congress aim to streamline the process of obtaining what is known as community care.
Two Republican senators have introduced legislation that would make it easier for rural veterans to seek care at local hospitals and clinics. The proposals would build on VA community care programs that started under Democratic President Barack Obama and were expanded in Trump’s first term.
Critics worry that steering veterans to private care facilities drains federal money from the VA hospital and clinic system. But supporters say veterans shouldn’t be forced to travel long distances or wait months for the treatment they could obtain at local hospitals and clinics.
“My main concern is for veterans, not for the VA,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told KFF Health News. “I don’t believe we have an obligation to sustain the bureaucracy.”
About 9 million veterans are enrolled in the VA health system. Last year, about 3 million of them — including 1.2 million rural veterans — used their benefits to cover care at non-VA facilities, according to data provided by the department.
Cramer sponsored a bill that would allow veterans who live within 35 miles of a rural, “critical access” hospital to use VA benefits to cover care there or at affiliated clinics without referrals from VA staff.
Cramer, who serves on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, noted his state has just one VA hospital. It’s in Fargo, on the state’s eastern border, which is more than 400 miles by car from parts of western North Dakota.
Many North Dakota veterans drive past multiple community hospitals to get to the VA hospital for treatment, he said. Meanwhile, many rural hospitals are desperate for more patients and income. “I kept thinking to myself, ‘This doesn’t make any sense at all,’” Cramer said.
Cramer said previous laws, including the VA Mission Act, made it easier for veterans to use their benefits to cover care at community hospitals and clinics.
But he said veterans still must fill out too much paperwork and obtain approval from VA staffers to use non-VA facilities.
“We can’t let the VA itself determine whether a veteran is qualified to receive local care,” he said.
U.S. Rep. Mark Takano of California, who is the top Democrat on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said he sees the need for outside care for some veterans. But he contends Republicans are going overboard in shifting the department’s money to support private health care facilities.
The VA provides specialized care that responds to veterans’ needs and experiences, he argues.
“We must prevent funds from being siphoned away from veterans’ hospitals and clinics, or VA will crumble,” Takano said in a statement released by his office. “Veterans cannot afford for us to dismantle VA direct care in favor of shifting more care to the community.”
Some veterans’ advocacy groups have also expressed concerns.
Jon Retzer, deputy national legislative director for the Disabled American Veterans, said the group wants to make it easier for veterans to find care. Rural and female veterans can have a particularly tough time finding appropriate, timely services at VA hospitals and clinics, he said. But the Disabled American Veterans doesn’t want to see VA facilities weakened by having too much federal money diverted to private hospitals and clinics.
Retzer said it’s true that patients sometimes wait for VA care, but so do patients at many private hospitals and clinics. Most delays stem from staff shortages, he said, which afflict many health facilities. “This is a national crisis.”
Retzer said the Disabled American Veterans favors continuing to require referrals from VA physicians before veterans can seek VA-financed care elsewhere. “We want to ensure that the VA is the primary provider of that care,” he said.
Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins has pledged to improve the community care program while maintaining the strength of the department’s hospitals and clinics. The department declined a KFF Health News request to interview Collins.
Marcus Lewis, CEO of First Care Health Center, which includes a hospital in Park River, North Dakota, supports Cramer’s bill. Lewis is a Navy veteran who uses the VA’s community care option to pay for treatment of a back injury stemming from his military service.
Overall, Lewis said, the community care program has become easier to use. But the application process remains complicated, and participants must repeatedly obtain VA referrals for treatment of chronic issues, he said. “It’s frustrating.”
Park River is a 1,400-person town about 50 miles south of the Canadian border. Its 14-bed hospital offers an array of services, including surgery, cancer care, and mental health treatment. But Lewis regularly sees a VA van picking up local veterans, some of whom travel 140 miles to Fargo for care they’re entitled to receive locally.
“I think a lot of folks just don’t want to fight the system,” he said. “They don’t want to go through the extra hoops, and so they’ll jump in the van, and they’ll ride along.”
Rep. Mike Bost (R-Ill.), chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said veterans in some areas of the country have had more trouble than others in getting VA approval for care from private clinics and hospitals.
Bost helped gain the House’s approval for Trump’s request for $34.7 billion for the community care program in 2026. Although spending on the program has gone up and down in recent years, the appropriation represents an increase of about 50% from what it was in 2025 and 2022. The Senate included similar figures for next year in its version of a military spending budget that passed Aug. 1.
Bost also co-sponsored a House bill that would spell out requirements for the VA to pay for community care.
Sager hopes the new proposals make life easier for veterans. The Gulf War veteran lives in the northeastern Iowa town of Denver. He travels about 15 miles to Waterloo to see a chiropractor, who treats him for back and shoulder pain from injuries he suffered while training Saudi troops in hand-to-hand combat.
Sager, who remains active in the Army Reserve, also visits a Waterloo outpatient clinic run by the VA, where his primary care doctor practices. He appreciates the agency’s mission, including its employment of many veterans. “You just feel like you’re being taken care of by your own,” he said.
He believes the VA can run a strong hospital and clinic system while offering alternatives for veterans who live far from those facilities or who need care the VA can’t promptly provide.
The local VA doesn’t offer chiropractic care, so it pays for Sager to visit the private clinic. But every few months, he needs to obtain fresh approval from the VA. That often requires several phone calls, he said.
Sager is one of about a dozen veterans who use the community care program to pay for visits at Vanderloo Chiropractic Clinic, office manager Linda Gill said.
Gill said the VA program pays about $34 for a typical visit, which is comparable to private insurance, but the paperwork is more burdensome. She said leaders of the chiropractic practice considered pulling out of the VA program but decided to put up with the hassles for a good cause. She wishes veterans didn’t have to jump through so many hoops to obtain convenient care.
“After what they’ve done for us? Please,” she said.

Inundated basements, entire portions of Wauwatosa seemingly underwater, people fleeing the Wisconsin State Fair which shut down early amid rising floodwater and reports of cars literally floating away down roadways all followed the torrential downpour which began Aug. 9. 
The National Weather Service recorded 5.74 inches of rain Saturday, eclipsing the  previous single-day record for Milwaukee of 1.64 inches of rain. Meteorologists say that Saturday was Milwaukee’s second wettest day in 154 years of record keeping. Additional rainfall brought the total up to nearly 7 inches, with some areas expected to get over 10 inches of rain. Researchers have long-warned that increased and more intense rain and flooding would be among the ways climate change would manifest in Wisconsin.

Casey Serrano, a resident of Milwaukee’s North Side left the home she shares with her boyfriend around 8 p.m. Saturday about an hour after the rain started. When she returned around 1 a.m., she saw water in the basement “coming out of our main sewer drain that was covering maybe a quarter to a third of our basement, maybe an inch deep.” During the night, the water rose to nearly 2 feet of “brown runoff from the street,” she said.
Serrano woke up to find there was no  power in her home. “Our immediate street is not flooded, and did not flood last night,” she told Wisconsin Examiner. “But the streets surrounding us flooded pretty heavily.” When she went out on  Silver Spring Drive to get supplies, she saw “within like a 20-block radius of our house there were cars that had clearly floated down Silver Spring.”  
“Thousands in Milwaukee are facing flooding after last night’s storms,” Mayor Cavalier Johnson wrote on X. “Avoid flooded roads — moving water is dangerous. City crews and first responders are working nonstop. Neighbors are stepping up to help neighbors.” The mayor posted that the city was coordinating with Gov. Tony Evers and Milwaukee County on emergency aid and shelters. “Milwaukee is strong,” Mayor Johnson posted. “Together, we’ll get through this.” 
Across Milwaukee County, emergency responders were overwhelmed as the flooding created a cascade of issues with natural gas, debris and power outages. “Very busy night for [Milwaukee Fire Department] & many other FD’s!”, Milwaukee Fire Department Chief Aaron Lipski posted on X. “Over 600 responses between 8pm-7am: numerous fires, water rescues, & many other weather-related emergencies.” 
 


Video shared with Wisconsin Examiner by Casey Serrano, a City of Milwaukee resident who experienced severe basement flooding after the storms on August 9th and 10th, 2025.
 
Online videos showed  cars trapped on flooded roadways and highways. People attending one of the final days of the Wisconsin State Fair were filmed wading through water to leave the fairgrounds. Around 10 p.m. on Sunday the sky began to light up with a new wave of lightning, heralding more rain. Over 18,000 people reportedly lost power during the storms.

“Flooding is still an active emergency situation across Milwaukee County, and we are expecting more rain today and into this evening,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a press statement Sunday. “I strongly urge our residents to stay cautious, stay informed, and refrain from traveling. Check  in on your neighbors and loved ones, especially older adults, and seek out emergency assistance if needed. I am thankful for our first responders, law enforcement partners, social services workers, and neighbors who are lending a helping hand during a challenging time. We will get through this together, Milwaukee.”
Local officials are warning residents not to walk into floodwater, as it may be contaminated or be near downed electrical wires. In some areas, the water had strong currents capable of sweeping people away. Those cleaning up debris are encouraged to wear gloves and proper protection, and residents are encouraged to limit water usage (such as by holding off on washing dishes or doing laundry) to reduce the risk of wastewater backing up into basements. 
The suburban city of Wauwatosa produced some of the most dramatic images of flooding throughout the county. According to the Wauwatosa Police Department (WPD), over 500 calls were received by their dispatch center with issues ranging from flooded out basements to blocked storm drains to traffic incidents due to standing water. WPD says there have been no reports of serious injuries, though several major roadways and intersections remain affected and impassable. 
Hart Park, near the Wauwatosa Village, is closed, and police are encouraging people to avoid the area. Sunday afternoon, many people were seen walking through the village area and parts of Hart Park to observe storm damage. Large debris was strewn along the railroad tracks, and reports indicate that the Menomonee River flowing through Hart Park rose from a little over 1 foot high to over 14 feet in a matter of hours. Sunday afternoon the water level was still high, with rushing water ripping through the park continuing to damage green spaces and concrete bike paths. Wauwatosa squad cars used loudspeakers to declare the area closed due to a state of emergency.

Traffic control issues were also reported by the Waukesha Police Department, with the Fox River also under close observation. Waukesha Sheriff’s Department spokesperson Capt. Nicholas Wenzel said in an email statement that the department was “dealing with flooding across the county,” and that no injuries or missing persons had been reported.
For Serrano, the flood is an unprecedented experience. She anticipates costly repairs, including ripping out wood paneling in her house. 
Serrano is also concerned about what the flooding means for the city. “I think that my main concern is that the city is completely unprepared to deal with this, and I think it’s really willful on their part to be honest,” she said. Serrano, who used to work  for the city’s sewage department creating and analyzing data maps, thinks city budget and staffing cuts have adversely affected emergency preparedness. She blames Act 10, which has limited public employees’ collective bargaining rights since 2011, arguing that it  has contributed to staffing shortages and out-dated technology for city departments most responsible for preventing floods, and dealing with their aftermath. 
 










 
Act 12, which mandates that staffing and funding are maintained for the Milwaukee Police Department, also exacerbated the imbalance between police and  other departments including  Public Works, she said. 
“At any point, the Common Council could stand up for residents of this city — especially residents of the North Side,” Serrano said,  “and say we’re not going to deal with this anymore. We are going to fully fund these departments so that they have the right materials and the right resources to fully staff themselves, to fully hire.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2975-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 06:58:12.367055

Phil Murphy of pushing ""dangerous sanctuary city policies"" after an undocumented immigrant was arrested and charged with a fatal car crash that killed a Lakewood mom and her daughter. (Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/Dana DiFilippo)State prosecutors sought pretrial detention last month for an undocumented immigrant accused of killing a woman and her daughter in a drunken driving crash in Lakewood, but a Superior Court judge denied the state’s request.
The fatal crash has sparked a new fight between the Trump and Murphy administrations, with the White House accusing Gov. Phil Murphy of pushing “dangerous sanctuary city policies.” President Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. attorney of New Jersey has previously said she’s investigating Murphy, a Democrat, and Attorney General Matt Platkin over a state directive that limits when local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents.
A Murphy spokesman said the governor believes the man at the center of this fight — Raul Luna-Perez, whom federal authorities said entered the United States illegally from Mexico — should have been deported long ago, and one for Platkin stressed that the state’s directive allows for cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding anyone charged with a violent crime or convicted of any indictable offense.
Platkin has noted that prosecutors wanted Luna-Perez to remain behind bars after the July 26 fatal crash, which killed Maria Pleitez, 42, and her 11-year-old daughter, Dayanara. At a July 31 court hearing in Ocean County, Gregory Lenzi, assistant county prosecutor, said he was “shocked and appalled” that Luna-Perez was arrested three times in four months for driving under the influence, according to a recording of the hearing obtained by the New Jersey Monitor.
“The defendant was fortunate, following his first DWI, no one was severely injured or killed. He then made the conscious decision to drive intoxicated a second time, 27 days later,” Lenzi said. “Now, your honor, following this third incident, we are here because two people are dead and another is injured.”
A public safety assessment that weighs risk factors to determine whether a defendant should be detained before trial indicated Luna-Perez should be released, Luna-Perez’s defense attorney said. But Lenzi urged Superior Court Judge Wendel E. Daniels to keep Luna-Perez jailed anyway.
“The defendant is clearly an obstruction risk, as he repeatedly operates a motor vehicle in a manner which poses a risk of death and serious bodily injury to every member of the community on the roads, either in a car or on foot,” he said.
Daniels sided with Luna-Perez’s lawyer. He ordered Luna-Perez released but confined to his Red Bank home with an ankle monitor, barred him from operating a vehicle, and ordered a substance abuse evaluation.
“As the state argued, his conduct was conscious and deliberate, getting behind the wheel allegedly under the influence. That resulted in a tragedy and also presented a danger to the community as well,” Daniels said. “However, his attorney argued, and rightfully so, this defendant has no other pending charges, no disorderly persons convictions, no indictable convictions, no violent convictions.”
Luna-Perez’s release turned out to be temporary. Immigration agents later arrested him, and on Thursday, Ocean County authorities said they retrieved him from a migrant jail in Elizabeth and brought him back to an Ocean County jail as they seek a second time to keep him behind bars.
“His return sends a clear message that our federal partners share in our mission to hold those individuals that commit serious crimes accountable — regardless of their immigration status,” Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said in a statement.
Ocean County has resisted the state directive, known as the Immigration Trust Directive. In 2019 it sued the state to invalidate the order, saying it was preempted by federal law. A federal judge ruled against the county, a decision that was upheld by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2021.
 Charges

Luna-Perez was initially charged with two counts each of vehicular homicide and assault by auto. Authorities say he was speeding and driving drunk, crossed double-yellow lines into oncoming traffic, and collided head-on with a car driven by Pleitez. Luna-Perez’s blood alcohol level was about three times the legal limit at the time of the crash, authorities say.
After Luna-Perez was released by the judge in Ocean County, county prosecutors slapped him with two counts each of aggravated manslaughter and strict liability vehicular homicide.
Luna-Perez has several prior arrests but no convictions, court records show. He was arrested on March 20 and April 17 by Red Bank police and charged with driving under the influence. He was accused of domestic violence in a June 2023 complaint that was later withdrawn, so the matter was dismissed, state courts spokeswoman MaryAnn Spoto said.
White House spokesman Abigail Jackson said the blame for the crash “rests squarely with Governor Murphy.”
“This criminal illegal alien had three prior arrests by local police — including two that were for driving under the influence. The innocent people he killed should still be alive today — and they would be if it weren’t for sanctuary policies that protect criminal illegal aliens. President Trump is committed to carrying out the largest mass deportation operation of criminal illegal aliens in history and Making America Safe Again,” Jackson said.
The Immigrant Trust Directive, first issued in 2018, restricts when local and state law enforcement can help federal immigration authorities and bars them from asking about immigration status during certain encounters. But the directive says when it comes to certain violent and serious offenses, including assault, cops are allowed to cooperate with immigration agents.
“To be clear, nothing in the Immigrant Trust Directive would have prevented New Jersey law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials to deport this defendant. And we reiterate that the Immigrant Trust Directive allows for cooperation with ICE in regard to anyone charged with a violent crime or convicted of any indictable offense,” said Platkin spokeswoman Sharon Lauchaire.
Mahen Gunaratna, a Murphy spokesman, said Luna-Perez should have faced repercussions for his previous charges.
“The Governor believes that Mr. Luna-Perez, who has been arrested multiple times for DUI and domestic violence, should not have been allowed behind the wheel and should have already been deported due to his previous dangerous criminal activity,” Gunaratna said.
Prosecutors at the July 31 hearing discussed details from Luna-Perez’s two previous DWI arrests.
On March 20, police accused him of hitting another car that was attempting to park. He failed roadside sobriety tests and had a blood alcohol content of 0.186, more than twice the legal limit of 0.08, police said.
On April 17, police said he nearly hit a marked Red Bank police car head-on. Officers found multiple Modelo cans in his car, and he attempted to get rid of an open can by spilling it all over the inside of his truck, police said. His blood alcohol content then was 0.16, they said.
“His actions have been egregious, and with three documented incidents, has given this court zero reason to believe he will abide by any condition of release,” Lenzi said during last week’s hearing. “Your honor has the authority to … not give this defendant a fourth opportunity to do this again.”
Luna-Perez’s immigration status was not discussed at that hearing.

(Photo courtesy of Howard Rynearson) After years of failing to advance legislation to eliminate Idaho’s sales tax on groceries, an effort has launched to make the change via voter ballot initiative. 
Howard Rynearson, Payette County GOP Central Committee chairman, is leading the charge to gather enough signatures to place the measure on the November 2026 ballot.  
“People are very, very disgusted and tired of the fact that we’ve not been able to do this,” Rynearson told the Idaho Capital Sun in a phone interview. 
If passed, the “Repeal Idaho’s Grocery Tax” initiative would in fiscal year 2028 eliminate Idaho’s 6% sales tax on food items, as defined by the federal Supplemental Nutrition and Assistant Program, or SNAP. The sales tax would remain for alcohol, tobacco, and restaurant sales of food or “hot food products ready for immediate consumption.”  
The initiative would also eliminate the Idaho Grocery Tax Credit, which is meant to offset the sales tax on food spent throughout the year. 
Rynearson said the elimination of the tax is “the most achievable tax repeal that we can do right now.” 
He said that although the Idaho Republican Party is strongly behind the move, he is pursuing the initiative proposal as an individual. 
 Idaho lawmakers have failed to advance bills to repeal the sales tax on food 

In 2017, the Idaho Legislature passed a bill eliminating the sales tax on food, known colloquially as the “grocery tax,”  but then-Gov. Butch Otter vetoed the bill, saying the costs were “too high,” the Idaho Statesman reported at the time.   
Since then, other efforts have been discussed or attempted but none advanced. Many of the proposals have come in the form of “personal bills,” which go around the committee process and are typically stored with the clerk and do not advance. Rynearson said committee chairs and leaders have refused to hear proposed bills in hearings. 
During this year’s legislative session, the Legislature passed and Gov. Brad Little signed a law increasing the grocery tax credit from $120 a year per person to $155 per person per year. 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs bill to increase grocery tax credit

During Senate debate on the bill, Sen. Christy Zito, R-Mountain Home, attempted to send the bill to what’s known as the 14th order, in which senators may propose amendments, for the purpose of changing the bill to eliminate the grocery tax, the Sun reported. Her procedural move failed in a 5-28 vote. 
Amid calls to instead eliminate the sales tax on food and the tax credit entirely, bill sponsor and House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, said that keeping the grocery credit allowed the state to continue collecting revenue on groceries bought by out-of-state visitors, the Sun reported. 
Rynearson countered this logic. 
“The tourism situation is way overstated,” he said. “Most people that travel through the state are tourists going from one state to the other, they generally eat at restaurants or fast food businesses. Those are exempted from this repeal.” 
Idaho is one of 13 states that applies sales tax to food, according to the Coeur d’Alene-based conservative think tank Mountain States Policy Center. The policy center commissioned a poll in 2024 that found 87% of respondents were in favor of eliminating the sales tax on groceries.

 Ballot initiative would decrease state revenue 

The state does not track how much of its sales tax revenue is generated from grocery purchases. To create the required fiscal impact statement for the proposed initiative, the Division of Financial Management used information from Utah, which does track this information. 
Utah’s data showed that groceries typically comprised 11% to 13% of retail sales, according to the impact statement. The division projected sales tax revenue of $3.7 billion, and estimated a loss of revenue of $410 million to $485 million total. 
However, because the initiative would also eliminate the grocery tax credit, which costs the state between $210 million and $255 million, the net revenue loss would be $200 million and $230 million, according to the impact statement. 
In 2024, the state collected nearly $3.1 billion in total sales tax revenue, according to the Idaho State Tax Commission annual report. The Legislature this year also passed historic cuts to income and property taxes, reducing revenues by an estimated more than $400 million annually. These tax cuts and other legislation passed the past two years draw down sales tax revenue, which was a driving factor in the state reporting revenue coming in $141.5 million below projections near the end of fiscal year 2025, the Sun reported. 
Rynearson expressed doubts that the sales tax revenue would increase in the next two years as much as projected in the impact statement, but said he opted not to challenge the statement. 
 Initiative backed by Idaho GOP 

Rynearson said he did not think the issue was political and that any registered voter could be involved or interested in making the change, but leaders of the Idaho Republican Party are supporting the effort. 
Idaho GOP Chairwoman Dorothy Moon this week wrote in an opinion piece that “it’s time to end the grocery tax.” 
“If the Legislature won’t act, it’s time for the people of Idaho to get it done,” Moon wrote. 
Members of the party voted this summer in favor of a resolution, sponsored by Rynearson, to support an initiative repealing the sales tax on groceries. 
Many in the party have also expressed support for limiting the ballot initiative process. 
During the party’s 2025 winter meeting, Rynearson also brought forward a resolution that was approved to increase the threshold for the signatures needed to get an initiative on the ballot. 
The resolution states that because the process “bypasses the Legislature,” it should increase the threshold from 6% of registered voters in at least 18 of Idaho’s 35 legislative districts to at least 10% of registered voters in 23 of 35 districts. 
Rynearson said at the time of that meeting, he “wasn’t that impressed with the initiative” process. 
“I thought we were such a red state, we didn’t need it, but then came the option that we really needed it,” he said.  
Moon in her newsletter addressed some of the criticism of the initiative process. 
“I know what you might be thinking: ‘Aren’t ballot initiatives tools of the left?’” Moon wrote. “Sometimes, yes. But there’s an important difference here. This initiative is bottom-up and driven entirely by the grassroots.” 
Initiative supporters will need to gather more than 70,000 signatures, including at least 6% of registered voters in 18 of 35 legislative districts. Rynearson said he and supporters are visiting state fairs and encouraging small business owners to put petitions in their lobbies. 
There is information about the petition, including how to share it, at repealidahogrocerytax.org.

Sign up for Hechinger’s weekly newsletter. 
BELOIT, Wis. — As Chris Hooker eyed a newly built piece of ductwork inside Beloit Memorial High School, a wry smile crept over his face. “If you worked for me,” he told a student, considering the obviously crooked vent, “I might ask if your level was broken.”
Hooker, the HVAC manager of Lloyd’s Plumbing and Heating Corp. in nearby Janesville, was standing inside a hangar-sized classroom in the school’s advanced manufacturing academy, where students construct full-size rooms, hang drywall and learn the basics of masonry. His company sends him to the school twice a week for about two months a year to help teach general heating, venting and air conditioning concepts to students. 
“I cover the mountaintop stuff,” he said, noting that at a minimum students will understand HVAC when they become homeowners.
But the bigger potential payoff is that these students could wind up working alongside Hooker after they graduate. If his firm has an opening, any student recommended by teacher Mike Wagner would be a “done deal,” Hooker said. “Plus, if they come through this class, I know them.” 
Manufacturing and construction dominate the business needs inside Beloit, a small city of 36,000 just minutes from the Illinois border. Sitting at the nexus of two major highways, and within 100 miles of Chicago, Milwaukee and Madison, Beloit is home to a range of businesses that include a Frito-Lay production plant, an Amazon distribution center and a Navy subcontractor. In the next two years, a $500 million casino and hotel complex is scheduled to open. 
But staffing these companies into the future is a major concern. Across the country, the average age of manufacturing workers is increasing, and one in four of these workers is age 55 or older, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2021 figures, the most recent available. In many other jobs the workforce is aging, too. Wisconsin is one of several states looking to boost career and technical education, or CTE, as a possible solution to the aging and shrinking workforce. 
While the unemployment rate of Rock County, which includes Beloit, is 3.6 percent, only slightly higher than the state’s 3.2 percent, there’s a worker mismatch in the city, according to Drew Pennington, its economic development director.
Every day, 14,000 city residents travel outside of Beloit to work, while the same number commute into the city to fill mostly higher-paying jobs, said Pennington. 
So when Beloit decided to revamp its public high school in 2018, CTE and work-based learning were at the forefront of the transformation. 
The 1,225-student school now has three academies that cover 13 different career paths. After ninth grade, students choose to concentrate in an area, which means taking several courses in a specific field. Students also have the option to do work-based learning, which can mean internships, a youth apprenticeship or working at high-end simulated job sites inside the school. 
“This creates not just a pipeline to jobs but also to career choices,” said Jeff Stenroos, the district’s director of CTE and alternative education.

“There are a lot of really good-paying jobs in this area. Students don’t need to leave, or go earn a four-year degree,” Stenroos said. An auto mechanic can “earn six figures by the age of 26 and that’s more than an educator with a master’s degree,” he said.
Beloit’s effort is a shift in high school emphasis similar to the extensive CTE programs being run in other places, notably Indiana, Kentucky and Alabama. In 2024, 40 states enacted 152 CTE-related policies, the biggest push in five years, according to Advance CTE, a nonprofit group that represents state CTE officials. Nationwide, about 20 percent of high school students take a concentration of CTE courses, it says, adding that the high school graduation rate for students who concentrate in CTE is 90 percent, 15 percentage points higher than the national average. 
Three years ago, Wisconsin called for 7 percent of its high school students to be in workplace learning programs by 2026. Beloit’s progress puts it far ahead of that target. In Beloit Memorial, nearly 1 in 3 students meet this designation today, Stenroos said. 
The high school features a cavernous construction area where students build full-scale rooms, learn masonry and complete plumbing and electrical wiring projects. The metal shop offers 16 welding stations and a die-cutter machine that allows students to create customized pieces to fit projects. Down the street, the school runs an eight-bay car repair center, a space it took over when a Sears autobody shop left town.
These spaces are “better than a lot of technical colleges,” Stenroos said.
In addition to their high school courses, Beloit Memorial students pile up industry-recognized certifications, Stenroos said. More than 40 percent of its students graduate with at least one certification, and 1 in 4 of them has multiple certifications. 
While some simple certifications, such as OSHA Workplace Safety, can be accomplished in just 10 hours, others, such as those for the American Welding Society, require up to 500 hours of student work, he added. The state has called for 9 percent of graduating high school students to have earned at least one certification by next year. To incentivize schools to offer these opportunities, the state’s Department of Workforce Development pays schools for each student who earns a certification; in 2024, Beloit received $85,000 through this program, Stenroos said.
One of the school’s best automotive students, Geiry Lopez, graduated this year with five Automotive Service Excellence certifications. Standing less than 5 feet tall, Lopez said she is not bothered that she might not look like a typical mechanic. “I know I can do this,” she said, adding that she hopes to work on heavy machinery such as tractor trailers after she graduates.
She’s worked on her own car, with some fellow students, replacing the brakes, a front axle, rotors and wheel bearings at the school’s garage, she said, although she still hasn’t been able to drive it.
“My dad is taking forever to teach me how to drive,” she said.

The garage operates like an actual business, but the only customers are teachers and other Beloit staffers and students. Students estimate work costs, order parts and communicate with customers before any repairs take place. While oil changes and brake replacements are common, some students are totally rebuilding an engine in one car. 
Over in the welding room, rising senior Cole Mellom was putting the finishing touches on a smoker he built in less than a month’s time. He said he loved the creativity of finding a plan, cutting the metal and building something that he could sell, all while in school. Plus, he knows that welding is a key skill needed for his dream job, race-car fabrication.
In the past, students created a custom-made protective plate that the city’s police use on a bomb squad vehicle.
The welding program has 125 students this year and had to turn away 65 more because of space limitations, Stenroos said; last year, 17 of the school’s welding academy graduates enlisted in the armed forces to specialize in welding. 
These programs are designed to help meet the future needs of the state’s workforce. More than one-third of Wisconsin jobs will require education beyond high school but less than a bachelor’s degree by 2031, according to the Association for Career and Technical Education. For the last four years, the state has had more job openings than people on unemployment.
“There’s more jobs than there are people to fill them right now,” said Deb Prowse, a former career academy coach at Beloit Memorial who now works at Craftsman with Character, an area nonprofit that helps train students for careers in skilled trades.

Hooker, the Lloyd’s Plumbing HVAC manager, agreed. “Every project we work on has a delay, from a multimillion-dollar mansion to a three-bedroom spec,” he said. “There aren’t enough workers.”
The main reason Beloit Memorial has been able to zoom past state and national goals for both CTE and work-based learning is the school’s single-minded focus since 2018 on helping to ensure that its graduates will understand what businesses need and giving them a head start toward gaining those skills.
High school officials actually pared back the program from 44 pathways to 13, Stenroos said, part of an effort to tie each pathway to specific jobs. About 75 percent of pathways target area jobs, with the remaining quarter highlighting prominent professions within the state, he added. 
Even though three straight budget referendum defeats have left the district with a $6.2 million funding gap, Stenroos said he’s been able to keep the CTE equipment modernized through donations and strategic allocation of the school’s federal Perkins grant and the state reimbursement for student certifications. In one instance, the school recently bought a $20,000 scanner for its automotive program; the machine can not only help diagnose a car problem, but also connect students to garages throughout the country that have successfully fixed the specified problem. 
“It’s an expensive piece of equipment,” Stenroos said, “but it’s industry-certified and will give students real-life experience.”
Each of the three academies has an advisory board of teachers and industry professionals who work out how to embed practical lessons in classroom curriculum. “We ask business people, ‘What do you need, and how can we help our kids get there?’ ” said Stenroos.
“It’s really cool how receptive the school is to feedback,” said Heather Dobson, the business development manager at Corporate Contractors, Inc., a 200-person general contracting firm.
She explained that the district has incorporated small changes over the years, such as having students work in Microsoft programs instead of Google Classroom apps and teaching them how to write a professional email.
“Rarely is there an idea presented that they don’t embrace,” said Celestino Ruffini, the CEO of Visit Beloit, a nonprofit that promotes tourism of the city. The school is expanding its hospitality program because of the expected influx of jobs connected to the new casino and hotel, he said. 
All the changes aren’t at the high school, however. In order to employ Beloit Memorial students, Frito-Lay had to alter its corporate policy of not allowing anyone under 18 to work in its plants, according to Angela Slagle, a supply chain manager there. The company now hires Beloit Memorial students for its career exploration youth apprenticeship program, she added. 
The connection to area businesses goes beyond the school’s leaders. Each year, about 10 teachers complete an externship in which they spend one week of their summer at a local business. Teachers are paid $1,000 for the 20 hours, and they not only learn about what jobs a company may have but also find ways to incorporate real-world problems into their classroom lessons.
A few summers back, math teacher Michelle Kelly spent a week at Corporate Contractors. She was searching for different ways to use construction-based math problems with her students. In addition to using math to estimate a bid for a project or calculate the surface area of a job, she realized that complex math is needed to build a truss, the framework used to support a roof or bridge.
Because the triangular truss is supported by different lengths of wood inside its structure, Kelly said, building one requires the calculation of angles, total area, how much wood is needed and more. Since all her algebra students were in the school’s construction academy, she partnered with those teachers to go beyond blueprints and have the 10th graders build trusses, a collection of which sit in the back of her classroom.
She sees this work as one way to help counter the chronic absenteeism that has existed since Covid. Teaching with this kind of hands-on work makes students see the relevance of algebra, she said. “Would it be easier to just have them take a test? Yes.” 
Beloit Memorial Principal Emily Pelz said the school’s work is paying off. In the last four years, the school’s four-year graduation rate has ticked up slightly, from 83.4 percent in 2021-22 to 85.2 percent in 2024-25, while its attendance went from 78.5 percent to 84.8 percent in the same period, Pelz said. 
Rik Thomas, a rising senior who already has his own business repairing and modifying cars, said this work has definitely made him more interested in school. While he thought the academy would merely explain what a construction career might include, “It’s nice to find out how to do the work.” His father works in construction and, Thomas added, “He loves that I take this program.” 
Thomas and his classmates built a wooden shed earlier this year and were able to sell it for $2,500, with the money going to pay for more materials. Likewise, the first smoker created in the welding class was bought by Stenroos; the students are looking forward to posting the second one for sale after they determine how much they should charge. 
While the school’s construction and other trade-related fields have drawn the most attention, its three academies also offer career paths in healthcare, education, business, the arts, hospitality and more. 
For example, rising senior Tayvon Cates said he hopes to study pre-med at a historically Black college or university on his way to becoming a cardiology radiologist. Cates, who is in the school’s health and education academy, said, “If you want to do something, the school can help you do it.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch.Iowa State University is charging up to become a destination for academics and industry dealing in battery fabrication and testing, with new equipment opening doors for expanded study of the power source.
Todd Kingston, an ISU researcher and assistant professor of mechanical engineering, said the accelerating rate calorimeter system now housed at the university and used for battery testing will hopefully draw in interested students. It would act as a centerpiece of a “shared facility,” where ISU researchers and collaborators can create prototypes and test these and other batteries.
“Various users across campus will have the ability to come in and use that, but we’re hoping to even extend that to partners outside of the university, ones that maybe necessarily don’t have the capabilities or the equipment, or perhaps also the expertise to do some sort of the testing that they want,” Kingston said. “So we can perhaps even work with them to do that testing, provide that expertise, that training … and those resources to them.”

The new equipment was purchased for the university through grant funding from the U.S. Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research, which Kingston secured. It took several months to install and integrate into lab infrastructure, he said, but the machinery has been up and running for some time.
Both new and used battery cells can be tested with the equipment, Kingston said, allowing researchers to see how they respond under various conditions at different stages of wear. The conditions placed upon the cells can range from electrical to thermal to mechanical, with data being taken on temperature, pressure, voltage, self-heating levels and more in real time.
Batteries are sometimes pushed past their limits as part of testing, Kingston said, leading to their damage or even full destruction. As the batteries are encased in the equipment, researchers can stand just a few feet away and monitor the tests through a computer system.
Qusai Alahmad, a third-year Ph.D. student studying mechanical engineering at ISU, called the new ARC equipment an “amazing tool” — one he’s been able to use already as part of a project funded by the Office of Naval Research.
In addition to funding the purchase of the equipment, Kingston said the Office of Naval Research has provided grant dollars to multiple projects that utilize the ARC system and look at metrics associated with batteries and what characteristics can influence their level of safety.
One of these projects has ISU researchers testing effects of thermal gradients on battery safety, and another has the university running battery tests to verify predictive modeling for “thermal runaway,” or when a battery goes beyond its limits, developed at the University of Arizona.

Battery safety is a topic that is growing in popularity and importance, Alahmad said, as lithium-ion batteries can be found everywhere, from phones to cars to satellites.
“Looking into it is very important, right, not only for the environment, but for the safety of people using these batteries,” Alahmad said. “Since it’s part of my funding, it’s really exciting.”
There are only a handful of ARC systems currently operating across the U.S., Kingston said, and even fewer are housed in university labs. This allows ISU to conduct research and testing that cannot be done elsewhere due to safety hazards.
Joined by other ISU researchers and utilizing internal funding from the Office of the President, Kingston said he is working to create a center where batteries can be crafted and tested on-site. Other equipment is still being installed for the center which will expand the kinds of batteries that can be fabricated.
Beyond academic study and potential partnerships with businesses and organizations, Kingston said the new equipment and center for battery testing will be helpful in workforce development, as ISU graduates will head into the world with experiences and skills they would have a hard time finding elsewhere.
More and more students, ranging from their undergraduate to graduate education, are becoming increasingly interested in battery technology, Kingston said, and he hopes the center and its toys will aid in recruitment and retention.
“It takes lots of different disciplines, knowledge, expertise to be able to tackle all the difficult problems associated with batteries,” Kingston said. “And so I hope that that attracts a lot of students from wide backgrounds to campus to come and learn and take advantage of the resources that we have.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Schools start up again this week for hundreds of thousands of Oklahoma students, and our public classrooms are in the throes of a massive teacher shortage.
Our children return from summer breaks suffering from some of the highest rates of adverse childhood experiences related to abuse, neglect and mental health struggles. Many of them are hungry. And they’re not excelling in school.
But the adults whose job is championing strategies to improve our kids’ futures are too busy bickering about their own adverse adult experience involving images of nude women shown on Superintendent Ryan Walters’ office television.
In their quest to defend their honor and tarnish someone else’s to prove they’re the wounded party in this debacle, they all seem to have forgotten who they’re supposed to be serving: our children.
Everybody that doesn’t live in a happy bubble knows that our school children today are dealing with worse things than a little shared nudity among adults. I suspect some children have probably dealt with worse in the month.
After all, they’re continually facing the threat of school shootings. Ours is a state that experiences high rates of domestic violence, high poverty rates, low health care outcomes, and high rates of childhood hunger. 
We’ve experienced a recent drop to 50th in the country in education quality. We rank 48th worst in per pupil spending, investing a pitiful $11,349 per student. Our teacher pay is 38th worst in the country, about $2,300 below the regional average. 
But instead of focusing on those struggles, we’re witnessing the bitter implosion of a seven-member governing board that is supposed to be working together to advocate for policies that chart a better path forward for our children. We’ve got a state superintendent and members of the board who have embarked on a bizarre crusade to prove they’re the true victims here.
Meanwhile, an initial probe released by Republican House Speaker Kyle Hilbert indicates that this brouhaha may boil down to adults being exposed to a little-remembered, R-rated Jackie Chan Hollywood flick that had scenes featuring fully nude women.
Hilbert said his findings seem “to vindicate” both Walters and the board members and these images weren’t shown intentionally.
If anything, Hilbert’s findings make this situation seem even more absurd.
Why was this board even watching TV in the first place during a closed-door meeting? They were supposed to be considering high-stakes matters that impact students, families, teacher licenses and schools. The television shouldn’t have been on, and the fact that it was makes me wonder if anyone is actually taking their responsibilities seriously.
But instead of taking responsibility for that blunder, two education board members last week decided the best course of action was to dump gasoline on this dumpster fire by firing off a statement that included “what we saw on TV is content that would get the certificate of any teacher in this state revoked had it showed up on a classroom TV.” 
Here we go again.
It’s not exactly shocking that a governing board that stripped one teacher’s license for providing high school students with a way to access an online library catalog that contains banned books would threaten the same punishment for another educator showing R-rated movies to people over 17. Is it any wonder that qualified teachers are fleeing to Texas or exiting the profession in droves?
I attended high school in a high-performing district in Texas. I occasionally viewed R-rated movies like “The Patriot,” and those teachers didn’t have their livelihoods threatened.
Maybe if Republican leadership stood up with the same gusto to Walters’ agenda that directly impacts students when it comes time to set academic standards or invest millions on Bible class in public schools we could take them seriously. 
It’s clear that the losers here are our public schools and the roughly 700,000 children that rely on them. 
It’s unfortunate that this debacle has distracted from that.
When Gov. Kevin Stitt ousted three State Board of Education members in February, he said he was sick of the panel driving up “needless political drama.” 
“If we want to be the best state for business, we need to make sure our kids have a path to success,” he said at the time. “It’s time for some fresh eyes and a renewed focus on our top ten goals.”
In a rare occurrence, I wholeheartedly agreed with the governor. I’d been looking forward to seeing what fresh ideas this board has to offer because what we’re doing isn’t moving the needle in the right direction.
Maybe the Board of Education needs to go back to school. Is this the best we can do?
I’m waiting for someone, anyone, to step up, show some leadership and remember what really matters here. 
Our children.

Vermont now has a methadone clinic in each region of the state. That convenience brings treatment options to people who didn’t have access before, officials and recovery coaches say.

BENNINGTON — Tucked into a nondescript strip mall downtown, Bennington’s new methadone clinic has seen about 70 patients walk through its one-way glass doors since opening in late June.  
Inside, the building’s four hallways form a loop, offering patients a literal road to recovery. First-timers walk in to their right and visit with doctors in offices along the corridor one by one. They can get their first dose of methadone, a medicine prescribed for opioid use disorder, that day. 
It’s the first time that people who live in Bennington County have access to the medication in their own backyard, which opens up access and provides stability for people, health officials and recovery coaches said. 
With the clinic’s opening, Vermont now has a methadone clinic in each region of the state after building plans were complicated for years, said Kelly Dougherty, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Health. The Bennington clinic offers a glimpse of how methadone can help people in recovery.
In past years, it was a job on its own to get on meds for recovery, said Dylan Jonhson, a recovery coach at Turning Point in Bennington. 
One of Jonhson’s clients spent hours each day on the bus to a clinic in North Adams, Massachusetts. That trip would take up most of the client’s day, he said. And if they missed the bus, it could cause painful withdrawals and put their path to sobriety at risk. 
Now, that client goes to the local clinic in town, which has offered them much more stability. 
“They just got a job this week, and I guarantee you it’s because they didn’t have to go to North Adams,” Johnson said.

Many others also made the trek to North Adams regularly, said Sean Cossey, the clinic’s director. Now, Cossey’s trying to slowly funnel those people to the new clinic to make their lives easier. About 20% of the clinic’s clients so far have never received treatment before, he said. 
“The only thing I can’t do is make them walk in. But if they do walk in, they’ll be met with respect, they’ll be met as a person,” Cossey said. 
The clinic’s opening has been mostly celebrated by the community, Cossey said. About 50 people showed up for a July 23 ribbon cutting ceremony, he said. Then U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., and Rep. Paul Tonko, D-N.Y., came to tour the facility on July 29. Their visit sparked a roundtable discussion among local recovery groups about treating opioid use. 
“Success rates in recovery are pretty low,” Johnson said. But methadone is considered the gold standard — and it’s important that people in town have the option for treatment, he said. 
In 2024, 183 Vermonters died from opioid-related deaths, and five of those deaths happened in Bennington County, according to data from the Vermont Department of Health. 
While many embrace the opening, there are still some in Bennington who have a stigma about methadone, Cossey said. He’s confident that stigma comes from a lack of education. 
“We’re giving out medication to people that suffer from a clinically diagnosed disorder,” Cossey said. 
It’s a highly regulated medication. The clinic was built around its pharmaceutical safe, Cossey said. That was just one required specification to follow regulations from The Drug Enforcement Administration. A $3.9 million grant from the state that lasts through July 2026 helped the clinic meet the requirements.
While methadone isn’t the only medication used to treat substance use disorder, many consider it to be the most effective. People who have been using opioids start by taking the medication every day at first, then wane off of it very slowly, Johnson said. 
“It’s basically impossible to quit cold turkey,” Johnson said. 
Methadone significantly reduces symptoms of withdrawal, which helps those prescribed the medication stabilize their life as they begin recovery, Johnson said. That stability can help people find housing, repair relationships in their life or gain employment, he said.
Johnson himself uses his experience in recovery to help others navigate the journey. He tried quitting without medications 15 to 20 times — but each time he “failed spectacularly,” he said with his eyes closed as he raised his hands in the air. 
He then started taking suboxone, another medication to treat opioid use disorder, and it has helped him remain clean for 6 years. Johnson said it helped relieve painful body aches and gastrointestinal issues he suffered as withdrawal symptoms.
Now, he considers himself a success story and tries to help others through their own recovery. Johnson said he continues to take suboxone in small doses and hopes to be able to discontinue the medication completely soon. 
Other facilities in the Bennington area, like small clinics or doctors offices, have offered other medications to treat opioid use disorder for years. But many think methadone has unique potential to help those in the early stages of recovery. 
The stigma comes from the fact that methadone is technically a psychoactive drug, Johnson said. But if someone has used heroin for years, they will not feel a high from the medication, he said. 
Other medications, like suboxone or buprenorphine, have blockers that stop people from feeling high if they continue using opioids while on the medication. With methadone, people can still feel the effects of other drugs. And that’s partly where the stigma comes from, Johnson said.

Patients at the Bennington clinic are closely monitored and must provide urine samples regularly, Cossey said. Patients prescribed methadone also receive counseling resources and are assigned a case manager, he said. 
Patients take doses in a room about the size of a telephone booth in front of an employee who sits behind a counter. After the medication is ingested patients stay for about 20 minutes while medical professionals observe them. 
Cossey said the facility is still reaching its full potential. There are still a number of staff positions available that are proving difficult to fill, he said. With more staff, the facility will be able to serve up to 400 patients, he said. Whether it’s someone’s second or tenth time in recovery, there’s no judgement, Cossey said. 
“We try to meet them more than half way,” he said.

(Photo by Derek White/Getty Images for Bentonville Film Festival)A couple of years ago, Alisa Jno-Charles saw her now 9-year-old daughter watching a YouTube video of several children and their swift ninja moves.
The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring adult account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
 40 million subscribers

Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
 States step in

In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”
This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.
Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

Study refutes widespread understanding that gray wolves, anchored by young offspring, don’t move during spring denning season.
The post Yellowstone-area wolves observed moving pups to follow elk — upending scientific assumptions appeared first on WyoFile .","Scientific research has long assumed gray wolves are non-migratory during springtime, staying anchored to tend to litters of nearly helpless pups. For the first weeks of life, after all, pups are blind, deaf and extremely vulnerable.
A game camera image captured in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, however, upends that assumption. In the picture, an adult female wolf hauls a squirmy-looking pup by its hindquarters. The collared female, GPS data shows, was transporting the youngster from a den site to a new pack “rendezvous” site — effectively relocating her young family.
The photograph is part of a study, “Wolves use diverse tactics to track partially migratory prey,” that sheds new light on the evolving dynamics between ungulates and the carnivores that prey on them. 
The study, published Aug. 1 in the journal Current Biology, finds that canids with very young pups relocate homesites if their source of prey — in this case, elk — migrate.
The research helps illuminate the ways shifting ungulate migrations can impact predator behaviors and ecosystem dynamics, said senior author Arthur Middleton, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who has spent years researching ungulate migration and conservation in Wyoming.

“It’s sort of become pretty obvious to me that [ungulate migrations are] really important to the functioning of the ecosystem,” Middleton said. “But, we’ve had work to do to show how and why, and so I think this helps add another piece of that puzzle.”
This puzzle piece relates to the ways ungulate movements can directly influence the behavior of large carnivores. “That has broader implications, I think, for how we think about the migrations and why we’re trying to conserve them and things like that,” Middleton said.  
Tracking movements
The research team set out in 2019 to learn about wolf predation in more granular detail, said co-author Avery Shawler. To do that, researchers partnered with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to put collars on both prey — nearly 100 members of the large Cody elk herd — as well as their predators — 19 wolves belonging to seven packs. 
“So we were investigating wolf kill sites to see what they were killing and eating,” said Shawler, who completed her PhD at UC Berkeley in 2024.
This study area is east of Yellowstone National Park in the Absaroka Mountains, a rugged landscape home to high-alpine meadows, Douglas fir forests, aspen glades and sagebrush steppe. 
Over summer and winter seasons through 2021, scientists collected a great deal of data on the movement patterns of the animals, Shawler said.

That allowed researchers “to do movement analyses and compare GPS collar information,” she said. Through that, they realized “that different wolf packs have different strategies for tracking the Cody elk herd, which has individuals that migrate and individuals that don’t migrate.”
Wyoming Game and Fish game camera images helped bolster the collar observations. 
Ultimate findings demonstrated that gray wolves use diverse movement tactics to track partially migratory elk. Some Yellowstone Ecosystem elk only migrate short distances in the spring, and the wolf packs that tracked them generally stayed in the territory where they first established their dens. Other elk travel longer springtime distances, and the wolf packs that tracked them went to greater lengths to keep close. That includes packs with pups shifting homesites to follow migratory elk to summer range. Sometimes they carried small pups as far as 20 kilometers from their original dens. 
Because the highest source of wolf mortality can be attributed to members of other packs killing puppies, moving them is risky, Shawler said. 
The relocation of small pups was not a surprise to Game and Fish biologists and other large carnivore specialists, Shawler and Middleton said. Experts have observed that behavior on the ground for years. The finer-scaled detail provided by GPS collars confirmed their observations.

But, Middleton said, these findings counter years of assumptions by the larger body of animal researchers that migratory ungulates can escape predation in spring because wolves are anchored to dens and their largely immobile pups. The study is the first time researchers outside of the Arctic have observed gray wolves shifting their territorial range to be closer to prey during pup-rearing season.
The game camera photo captured it perfectly, Shawler noted. “Once they got that camera trap photo, literally of an adult wolf carrying a pup that was really, really young  … It was like, ‘Oh, they actually are moving the pups, and that’s over some really rugged terrain, over a pretty long distance.’”
Implications 
Previous work by Middleton illustrated that elk are highly variable and have the means to adapt to changing climate cues. 
This study takes that a step further, Shawler said. 
“There’s less research on how predators respond to that flexibility, and it would make sense that predators are also able to adapt,” she said. “So it’s just kind of adding to that literature.”
Understanding how wolves adapt to the prey’s behavior can help land managers better conserve both species, Middleton said. The study area, outside of Yellowstone National Park boundaries, encompasses human development like ranches and wilderness. That makes it a candidate for human-wildlife conflict.

Researchers generated a significant body of data, and Shawler is working to publish further work from it. 
Additional study co-authors include Kenneth J. Mills and Tony W. Mong of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department; Kristin J. Barker of UC Berkeley and Beyond Yellowstone Living Lab; and Wenjing Xu of the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre in Germany. 
The National Geographic Society, Knobloch Family Foundation, George B. Storer Foundation, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, UC Berkeley and USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture supported the study, which was conducted from a base at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody.

In Senate hearing, critics question regional office closures, consolidation of wildland firefighting service.
The post Forest Service faces identity crisis in USDA overhaul plan. Again. appeared first on WyoFile .","This story was originally published by Mountain Journal.
The U.S. Forest Service has been searching for an identity almost since the federal government began managing trees in the 19th century.
It started in 1876 inventorying public lands to prevent over-logging. Then it became the lumber provider to the nation. Now, just shy of its 150th birthday, the Forest Service faces another fundamental reorganization announced in late July by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.
Or not. A week after Rollins’ announcement, the Senate Agriculture Committee ordered Deputy Agriculture Secretary Stephen Vaden to present a “Review of the USDA Reorganization Proposal.” Many public lands watchdogs hoped the hearing would clarify where the idea came from and how the Forest Service’s tree focus fit in the farm-and-ranch world of the Department of Agriculture.
During the hearing on July 30, Committee Chairman John Boozman, R-Arkansas, offered his appreciation that Vaden, who took the job just two weeks before Rollins announced the reorganization on July 24, was working on his third week when he was summoned to explain the plan.
Ranking member Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, was less welcoming.
“The reason for the short notice is because the administration put out a half-baked plan with no notice,” Klobuchar said. Rearranging a major department that had already lost 15,000 staff members at a time when tariffs and pests such as the screwworm are roiling farm markets is “nothing short of a disaster,” she said.
Sharon Friedman, former Forest Service regional planning director, called the Rollins memo “way out of the normal range of ‘things to do.’” In particular, she pointed to the proposal to phase out Forest Service regional offices, instead of shrink them from the current nine to some smaller number. Earlier this year, draft maps showing a two- or three-region compression were in circulation.
“I think Congress is going to say this is a really stupid, bad idea,” Friedman told Mountain Journal on July 29 ahead of the hearing. “Go back to the drawing board.”
The National Association of Forest Service Retirees was equally aghast.“We do not see anything in the proposal that would improve services or efficiency,” they wrote in a July 29 letter to Senate committee leaders Boozman and Klobuchar. “Rather, it appears to simply cut staffing and funding without describing how the work will continue to get done. It provides the classic direction to do more with less.”
National Association of Forest Service Retirees Chairman Steve Ellis told Mountain Journal the proposed reorganization of the Forest Service is nothing new. “I’ve been through a lot of these in my career, going back to when Jimmy Carter was in the White House,” he said. “The political ones are easy to smell, and this has the political smell to it. I doubt that it came from the Forest Service. It came from higher up. They were told, ‘Eliminate regional offices and station offices — figure it out.’”
Where to call home?
While the impact that Rollins’ reorganization plan might have on the Forest Service has drawn particular attention, it affects all 29 agencies within the Agriculture Department. Rollins told Politico on Friday that “perhaps 50 to 70% of our Washington, D.C. staff will want to move” to five new hubs the agency is creating and the rest should seek jobs in the private sector.
That amounts to about 2,600 of the 4,600 USDA staff now in Washington, D.C. offices. The department has about 100,000 employees nationwide, 90% of whom work outside the national headquarters area. 
The regional hubs would be in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis, Indiana; Fort Collins, Colorado; and Salt Lake City, Utah. The memo did not say if the Forest Service regional offices would be redistributed among those five cities or eliminated altogether. 
The Forest Service has three regions serving or affecting Wyoming. The Northern Region 1 based in Missoula, Montana, oversees the Custer-Gallatin National Forest around Yellowstone National Park. It also supervises the Black Hills National Forest across the South Dakota border by Newcastle.
The Intermountain Region 4, based in Ogden, Utah, sprawls across several state borders. It oversees all of Wyoming’s Bridger-Teton National Forest, headquartered in Jackson. It also manages the Caribou-Targhee National Forest, which has offices in Pocatello and St. Anthony, Idaho, but significant impact in Wyoming.
Rocky Mountain Region 2 oversees the Bighorn National Forest, based in Sheridan, the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest, based in Laramie, and the Shoshone National Forest, based in Cody. Region 2 also handles the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest, based in Fort Collins, Colorado.
Region 2’s central headquarters is in Lakewood, Colorado. Fort Collins has been proposed as one of the USDA “hubs” where some conglomeration of the agency’s 29 departments and services might be concentrated.

The overlaps matter because Forest Service regional offices typically handle federal-state projects such as Good Neighbor Authority agreements. Wyoming has had as many as 19 active GNA agreements affecting six separate national forests and two regions. Regional office planning and legal staff typically manage the National Environmental Policy Act analyses, Endangered Species Act consultations and other matters that affect multiple national forest landscapes.
Rebuilding that chain of command for those projects would have to be part of the USDA restructuring. Friedman, the former planning director, noted that similar renegotiations would have to take place for many Native American tribes that have forestry and wildlife management agreements with the Forest Service.
Vaden told senators that the plan removed some layers of middle management. “But that does not automatically mean everyone located in a former regional office of an agency will be moved,” he said. Vaden also pledged that USDA would help with moving costs for current employees, while “building the next generation of USDA leadership” in the regional hubs.
Most of Wednesday’s Senate hearing focused on two issues: Why there was so little advance notice of the plan and what senators’ districts were being considered for receiving the USDA jobs Rollins was moving out of Washington, D.C. 
Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, praised the reorganization’s goals, but warned he needed to see more collaboration with Congress.
“There’s a difference between you selecting hubs on your own and if we work together and come up with a plan,” Hoeven said. “Is this an outcome that we’re going to talk about, or a fait accompli?”
But Vaden did reveal a few expectations for the Forest Service.
Sen. Ben Jay Luján, D-New Mexico, asked about the impact of “eliminating a regional office” of the Forest Service. Vaden replied that the Forest Service’s national human resources office in Albuquerque would not be affected in the reorganization, but that “the regional office will no longer be there.” Its building is already on a federal list to be closed and sold, and its employees would “be absorbed to other areas or asked to move.”
In his testimony, Vaden said one of the biggest reasons for the organization was to get the USDA workforce out of the National Capitol Region, which has “one of the highest costs of living in the country.” Federal salaries include a “locality rate,” or pay boost, to help employees afford expensive areas. The Washington, D.C. locality rate is 33.94% above a federal job’s base pay. Federal workers with new families couldn’t afford to buy homes in the Capitol area, where prices are averaging more than $800,000, he said. 
What saves money?
“If you’re really looking for savings and belt tightening, focusing on the higher level of the organization doesn’t bother me,” said Mary Erickson, the recently retired supervisor of the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. “It’s not like you couldn’t downsize the regional offices, but the transitional costs of that are daunting. As you eliminate regional offices, where does that work go? And how do you do that in a year’s time? That’s a lot of work. And they say they don’t want to do this in fire season. Those are pretty long these days.”
Erickson pointed out that Fort Collins’ locality rate is 30.52%, resulting in almost no payroll savings. And although Salt Lake City’s locality rate is 17.06%, Utah’s public land is predominantly managed by the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, not the Forest Service.
“There’s been no explanation for those locations,” Erickson said. “No one seems to know who’s the mastermind behind this design.”
Nor does there appear to be any acknowledgement of previous federal reorganization attempts. Congress created a Special Agent in the Agriculture Department to survey the nation’s public forests in 1876, and opened a Division of Forestry in 1881. A decade later, Congress passed oversight of “forest reserves” to the Interior Department. President Theodore Roosevelt moved it back to Agriculture in 1905, naming Gifford Pinchot the first chief of the Forest Service.

An official history of the Forest Service’s first century labels eight more evolutions, including “The War Years,” “Environmentalism/Public Participation Era” and “Ecosystem Management and the Future Era.” 
Ellis recalled the attempt at slimming down the BLM during the Clinton administration.
“They decided to take the district office layer out, which is like removing the forest supervisor layer in the National Forest System,” Ellis said. “It ended up costing a lot of money to move people around and get out of office leases. It ended up being a total flop. When the second Bush administration came on, they quietly put that layer back in.”
The first Trump administration took a similar track in 2019 when it moved the BLM headquarters out of Washington, D.C. Staff were dispersed to new offices in Colorado, Nevada, Utah and several other bases.
A 2021 survey of BLM workers by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility reported that 87% of reassigned employees either retired or quit rather than move. The field offices were staffed largely by new hires who lacked the scientific or experiential backgrounds of the former staff. “This lack of expertise in new hires has resulted in a shunning of science at the agency, and even a demonization of intellectual culture in some cases,” the PEER report stated.
It also resulted in a paucity of workers handling public business. At the time, the Utah area reported an average of one BLM employee for every 37,277 acres of public land. Arches National Park, which is surrounded by BLM lands, had one employee for every 1,530 acres.
Biden administration Interior Secretary Tracy Stone-Manning moved much of the BLM headquarters staff back to Washington in 2022. But she also reinforced the Colorado office, expanding its contingent from 27 positions under Trump to 56.
Friedman now runs the forestry policy blog Smokey Wire. She was a planning director in 2007 when a “Transformation Team” explored ways of performing Forest Service duties better. But Friedman noted her own inability to find out what it actually accomplished: “I couldn’t find any documentation for the effort. It wasn’t even clear whom I would ask at the Forest Service. Historian? Archivist? I got some phone numbers and emails, but no one returned the messages.”
Some of that effort looked into moving the Forest Service from Agriculture to Interior. A 2009 Government Accountability Office report concluded “a move would provide few efficiencies in the short term and could diminish the role the Forest Service plays in state and private land management … [If] the objective of a move is to improve land management and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the agencies’ diverse programs, other options might achieve better results.”
The 2009 GAO report also cataloged other past consolidation initiatives. One was the colocation of wildland firefighting experts from the Forest Service, BLM, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs to create the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. That took place in 1965.
Where’s the fire?
One particular problem drags public lands management off balance: wildfire.
While logging trees and grazing cows and digging trail occur far from the average American’s attention, forest fires are literally front-page news. The Forest Service routinely spends nearly half its annual budget fighting fire. It handles between 70 and 80% of the public land ignitions, with Interior agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management chasing most of the rest.
Federal firefighters have long chaffed at being just a tool in a larger agency’s land management toolbox, according to Freidman.
“There’s a tension between wildfire people and everybody else,” she said. “They got pay raises and nobody else did. They want to work for other wildfire people, because they feel they’re a national asset. They think they shouldn’t have others holding them back when they could be making money.”

But wildfire and public land management are woven together in a tight braid. Fire-dependent ecosystems cover most of the western United States. Local ranger districts not only map and monitor their surrounding forest for fire potential, their staffs often donate their time to the community volunteer fire department and ambulance service.
Removing fire duties from the Forest Service would “hollow out” the agency, according to Ellis.
“Fire is integrated in every program the Forest Service does,” he said. “Anything you do on public lands affects the fuel. It isn’t just burning slash piles. It’s how you graze range land. It’s timber harvest. That’s all fuels management. The fuel in Los Angeles fires [last January] was homes.”
During the hearing, Sen. Klobuchar asked if there was a bigger plan to move the Forest Service, or parts of it, to some other cabinet agency. She particularly wanted to know about the fate of wildland firefighting.
Vaden replied that the president’s budget, not the reorganization plan, called for the centralization of wildfire services. In other responses, Vaden said the Missoula-based Fire Lab would not be moving, and that the Salt Lake City regional hub was chosen in part because it offered “aviation assets” that would help the Forest Service in the “administration’s plan regarding centralizing wildfire efforts.”
Congress had already shown resistance to other Trump administration moves. Last week, both the House and Senate Appropriations committees rejected a plan to wrap the Forest Service’s firefighting duties into a new wildland fire management service housed in the Interior Department. Despite a Trump executive order creating the consolidated wildfire service and Forest Service and Interior budget reports detailing how it would work, congressional budgeters put the 2026 wildfire allocations back in their traditional multiagency bankbooks.
“The committee is disappointed with the utter lack of regard for complying with Congressional intent on spending funds as appropriated,” the Senate Appropriations Committee bill report stated. On other pages, the Senate committee overruled Trump’s order changing the name of North America’s highest mountain from Denali to McKinley. And it blocked an Interior Department plan to hand over some unnamed small national park facilities to state management.
“Over my whole career, the president’s budget, if you took it as reality, was completely drastic,” Erickson said. “We always expected it was going to be moderated by the Congressional process. Up to this point with Trump, you hadn’t seen that. Maybe we’re seeing some good signs there.”

But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.
The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.
Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.
At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.
But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.
“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.
The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.
After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”
However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.
Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.
Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.
Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.
“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”
There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.
One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.

Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)
In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.
The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.
The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.
Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.
Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.
The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.
“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.
“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

(Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A program meant to offer state resources to Nebraska children suspected of being abused or neglected while keeping more of them at home and out of foster care is not being used as intended, an inspector general’s report alleges. 
The Office of Inspector General for Child Welfare began investigating the state’s Alternative Response (AR) program after it received nine notices between 2021 and 2024 of children having suffered serious injuries and three of them dying within months of their families being assessed through the program, which is manned by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.

AR, according to the report, is recognized as a best practice in more than 20 states. It is used as a less adversarial and more collaborative method of working with children and families to assess possible cases of child endangerment while keeping more children with their families. 
Though AR is meant to be used for mid- to low-risk cases, the report found nearly half of the families DHHS assessed were deemed to be high-risk or worse of future mistreatment. The OIG report notes that between 2021-2024, DHHS completed AR assessments for more than 17,000 families, and over 7,800 of them qualified as high or very high risk. 
AR was implemented as a pilot program in Nebraska in 2014. It was added as a permanent program in 2020. Inspector General Jennifer Carter noted that during its pilot years, there were no reported cases of serious injuries or deaths related to AR assessments. The reports of kids getting harmed started after the program became permanent, which is part of what prompted the investigation, Carter said. 
In a written response included in the report, DHHS Director of Children and Family Services Alyssa Bish argued current regulations don’t mandate how AR cases should be assigned based on risk level and noted that cases are excluded from AR when a child is determined to be unsafe. 
The OIG report confirmed that DHHS has not broken the law.

Bish explained that “safety” and “risk” are two separate measurements. Safety is an immediate assessment based on active threats of serious harm to the child, while risk is a more long-term evaluation of potential for future harm. 
“It is important to clarify that the level of risk can only be evaluated after an intake is determined to be eligible for AR and the assigned Children and Family Services Specialist has made contact with the family,” Bish wrote. 
Carter’s report criticized multiple deficiencies found in DHHS’ AR process, noting multiple errors found within the assessments of the nine cases the Inspector General’s Office reviewed in depth. 
The report also raised concerns about DHHS’ “limited review” of each family’s history when assigning AR cases. In more than one of the nine reviewed cases, reports of suspected abuse within the family were missed, including at least one in which the OIG said there had been a report of abuse filed within the family nine months before the AR assessment. 
“A family could have extensive previous intakes over many years that indicate a pattern of concerning behavior that [is] not considered if outside that six-month window,” Carter argued. 
The OIG report makes several recommendations, including that DHHS improve its data tracking and find ways to encourage families to more easily engage more with state resources. Of the nine cases, a majority of families declined DHHS resources after receiving an AR assessment. 
“It is impossible to say that AR services being provided would have stopped the incidents from occurring in those cases,” Carter wrote in the report. “But in AR cases, unlike court-involved cases, engaging the family during the AR assessment is the only way to provide the family with the supports they need to address concerns in the home.”
Carter praised DHHS for enhancing its data tracking system in February to include a note when families decline state services, calling it “a great step.” She suggested DHHS ought to align its data on AR with HHS data on the agency’s more common Traditional Response method to alleged abuse or neglect. The goal: to be able to compare the effectiveness of each program under certain circumstances. 
Bish noted multiple updates DHHS has made to its AR system before the OIG report came out, including a new tool that reviews the frequency and quality of contact with families within the program. However, Bish noted that this tool does not evaluate families’ level of engagement with state resources for families. 
“DHHS acknowledges the importance of this recommendation and is open to further exploration and development of metrics or tools that could more explicitly assess engagement outcomes,” Bish wrote. 
Carter emphasized that despite her critiques, Alternative Response remains a useful tool that can recognize nuanced cases, such as families in poverty that could be mistaken as neglectful. 
However, she argued that more attention should be paid to the outcomes of families assessed under AR and suggested DHHS and the Nebraska Legislature should consider whether risk level of future abuse or neglect should be a factor in assigning AR cases. 
DHHS did not respond to requests for additional comment on the report.

The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.

Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

Marsha Blackburn. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn holds a significant lead over U.S. Rep. John Rose in the 2026 Republican primary for Tennessee governor, according to a poll released by the conservative think tank Beacon Center. 
The Beacon poll gives Blackburn a 68% to 14% advantage among the 571 Republican voters the group polled from July 27 to August 1. 
The poll was conducted before Blackburn officially announced her campaign at the start of August. Rose entered the campaign in March.
Early polling leads aren’t always an indication of who will win.
When Gov. Bill Lee ran in a five-person Republican primary in 2018, he trailed in polling until the campaign’s final weeks. 
A March 2018 poll conducted by the Washington, D.C.-based Save the Children Action Network, showed Lee with 7% support, trailing two other Republicans with 20% support each. 
Lee is term-limited and can’t run for reelection.

Blackburn has higher name recognition than Rose, who represents a U.S. Congressional district covering parts of middle and east Tennessee, after winning two statewide elections to the U.S. Senate. She’s also a close ally of President Donald Trump, who has not made an endorsement in the race yet. 
Shortly after her 2024 reelection to the Senate, Blackburn was rumored to be interested in running for governor. But she has waited nearly a year, allowing her to use her federal campaign funds for advertisements and to travel the state using that money.
Now that she’s officially entered the race, Blackburn can’t use federal campaign funds in the governor’s race as federal campaign finance laws prohibit the comingling of funds for state and federal races. 
Rose has shown he’s willing to put his personal funds, loaning his campaign $5 million. 
In 2018, the last time there was an open primary for Tennessee’s governor, the candidates spent almost $50 million. 
Memphis City Council member Jerri Green is the only Democrat to announce a candidacy in the Democratic primary.

(Courtesy of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife)In an amazing court victory for wild wolves and advocates who tirelessly speak on their behalf, the federal district court in Missoula, Montana, ruled that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service violated the Endangered Species Act when it determined that gray wolves in the Western United States do not warrant federal protections.
Western Watersheds Project, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, WildEarth Guardians, International Wildlife Coexistence Network, Predator Defense, Protect the Wolves, Trap Free Montana, Wilderness Watch, Friends of the Clearwater, and Nimiipuu Protecting the Environment filed a lawsuit in January challenging the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s denial of their petitions to list a Western U.S. distinct population segment of gray wolves under the Endangered Species Act, or alternatively, to re-list the Northern Rocky Mountain distinct population segment, which Congress “delisted” in 2011.
Federal court overturns decision denying Endangered Species protections to wolves

The ruling means that the Fish and Wildlife Service’s finding that gray wolves in the West do not qualify for listing is vacated and sent back to the agency for a new decision, consistent with the Endangered Species Act and best available science.
We hope this order will help blunt some of the lingering bigotry, senseless killing and fear mongering that nearly wiped wolves out before they were listed as endangered under the provisions of the federal Endangered Species Act in 1974.
Wolves remain under state control in Idaho following legal victory for conservationists 

The court order states that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service failed to consider the “best available science” on wolf populations and the impacts of hunting and trapping; the full extent of the species’ historical range; and the threat posed by inadequate state and federal regulations that often bow to political pressure.
The court ordered the Fish and Wildlife Service to re-analyze threats to the gray wolf population in the West in accordance with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. These include the requirement to use the best available science.
Specifically, the court noted the agency failed to consider wolves’ lost historic range throughout the West in its assessment.
The court also ruled that the Fish and Wildlife Service  failed to apply the best available science on population estimates and genetic threats from their small population size; incorrectly assumed connectivity among wolves in the West would continue despite high levels of mortality in the Northern Rockies.
To sum it up, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service didn’t follow the law to protect wolves from Montana’s, Idaho’s, and Wyoming’s wolf extermination policies. Wolves have yet to recover across the West, and allowing a few states to undertake aggressive wolf slaughters is inconsistent with the law.
The Alliance successfully sued to overturn the delisting of the gray wolf in 2012, but Montana’s Democratic Sen. Jon Tester broke his campaign promise to not use riders to overturn court decisions and attached a rider to a must-pass Defense appropriation bill to remove wolves from Endangered Species list despite the court’s order. It is time to once again manage wolves in the Northern Rockies and throughout the west based on science, not politics, since Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming have demonstrated that they are not capable of doing so.
I would like to thank Matt Bishop, an attorney at Western Environmental Law Center for representing us and winning.

But right now Michigan’s kids are being exposed to increased political polarization, growing ideological extremism and high levels of political violence.
Although extremism and political violence are not new, virtual platforms allow fringe beliefs and hateful ideas to gain traction, particularly with young people. Kids encounter a huge amount of supremacist ideologies in virtual forums, gaming platforms and social media, where racist, anti-LGBT, antisemitic and misogynistic content thrive.
According to a 2023 Gallup Poll, teens report using social media on average 4.8 hours a day, a trend that is not only linked to negative effects on physical and mental health but also exposes teens to hate-based content. Although social media can offer many benefits to teen mental health – including through opportunities for connection, creativity and identity development – many social media platforms use algorithms to target harmful, hate-based content to vulnerable young people. 
The targeting of misogynistic content to adolescent boys has been especially well-documented. Gaming chats have become notorious for the sexist attitudes that prevail there, including both misogynistic and anti-LGBTQ+ ideas, while popular male lifestyle influencers play into the male loneliness epidemic while advocating violence against women and downplaying sexual violence. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
These kinds of messages risk normalizing everyday harassment and violence against girls and nonbinary kids. According to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 13.8% of high school students in Michigan reported experiencing sexual violence, a 21% increase from 2017 to 2023. Reports of sexual violence are even higher for girls and students identifying as LGBTQ+.
But hate is not only spread online. Political extremism is becoming more commonplace and puts vulnerable populations at risk. Research from the Southern Poverty Law Center shows Michigan is home to 34 hate and anti-government extremist groups, making our communities less safe for Black people, women, immigrants, Jewish people, Muslims and LGBTQ+ people. 
Just five years ago, members of one such anti-government extremist group were indicted in a plot to kidnap the governor that occurred following a relentless online disinformation campaign fueled by sexism. More recently, a politically motivated assassin took the lives of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. 
Increasing polarization and ideological extremism makes it difficult for our leaders to do their jobs and keep our public institutions working. From 2022 to 2024, Michigan has seen 80 incidents of public officials facing threats and harassment – including doxing, stalking and death threats – in the course of their work as civil servants.
In a recent survey conducted by the Bridging Divides Institute and CivicPulse, 36% of school board officials reported experiencing hostility in 2024. This hostility does not just harm school leaders, but can also create an unwelcoming environment for students, especially if the hostility centers around the politicization of a child’s identity.
It’s time for us to lower the temperature. We can demonstrate the values we want kids today to take into adulthood, whether that means lawmakers reaching across the aisle or neighbors working together to better their community. We can all find things to agree on when we listen with curiosity and set aside the defensiveness. 
Some legislators are already making efforts to reduce tensions and build relationships. State Reps. Brenda Carter and Greg Markkanen became the first lawmakers to invite each other to visit their districts as part of the inaugural Michigan Legislative Exchange Project, which seeks to strengthen understanding and cooperation between lawmakers in Michigan. 
We also need to address the role of online platforms in allowing misogyny, disinformation and extremism to flourish. A Stanford University study found a majority of middle school students surveyed could not evaluate the credibility of online content, demonstrating the need to equip young people with the tools to identify misinformation. 
Social media platforms have become essential tools for promoting democracy and civic engagement, but they also lack the guardrails to prevent the spread of conspiracy theories and the promotion of violent extremism. If we want kids today to grow up in communities free of threats, harassment and violence, it’s up to us to create them.
The Michigan League for Public Policy’s Kids Count in Michigan project and the team of people behind it believe all kids deserve this and more. Kids deserve to grow up in a state that offers belonging, economic security, a world class education, access to health care, and thriving families and communities.

North Dakota mineral owners have asked state leaders for help with the issue, but they say an oversight program has fallen short.

Sign up for Dispatches to get stories in your inbox every week.
One morning in February 2023, a small group of mineral owners arrived at the North Dakota Capitol on a mission. They had traveled from across the state and other parts of the country to explain to lawmakers how the powerful oil and gas companies had been chipping away at their income.
It’s not easy to recruit people to testify during the winter months of the legislative session. Ranchers are busy with the calving season. Snowbirds have relocated to warmer climates. It’s a more than three-hour drive for those living in the Bakken oil field. 

This is the second story in a series. Read the first story here.

But those who made it to Bismarck lined up at a podium to share details of their own experiences and the broader concerns affecting the estimated 300,000 people who receive money from the industry in exchange for the right to their underground minerals. For nearly a decade, they had grappled with companies withholding significant portions of their royalty payments without explaining how they determined how much to deduct, as the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica reported last week. 
Now they were at the Capitol for a specific reason: They wanted legislators to require companies to provide more information so owners could discern if they were being paid correctly, and to impose penalties if companies failed to comply. 
Shane Leverenz, who manages income his extended family receives from numerous oil wells, read aloud email responses from companies to illustrate the lack of cooperation mineral owners face when they request information. “We are not obligated to mail each owner a calculation as to how their interest was calculated,” one company wrote. 
“There is no transparency,” Leverenz told the legislators. Leverenz, whose great-grandfather homesteaded in North Dakota and had his property deed signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, has helped organize royalty owners on this issue in recent years. Leverenz grew up in Epping, a town of fewer than 100 people in the northwest part of the state, and traveled to North Dakota from Texas, where he now lives, to testify.

After input from Leverenz and others, lawmakers decided to create a new state program that they hoped would address conflicts between royalty owners and companies. In particular, mineral owners had mounting concerns over postproduction deductions, the money companies withhold to cover the costs of processing and transporting minerals after they are extracted and before they are sold. Companies say they are allowed to pass on a share of those costs, while royalty owners say they shouldn’t bear that responsibility because in most cases lease agreements don’t mention those expenses. 
The state’s “postproduction royalty oversight program” had the support of the industry, but it was far less than what Leverenz and other owners wanted. In the two years since its creation, the program has not lived up to its name and has not alleviated owners’ concerns over deductions or transparency, an investigation by the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica found. The program has resolved 69 cases so far, and none have involved postproduction deductions, according to documents obtained under a public records request. A case can represent a complaint or question from a royalty owner.
“The legislative intent was supposed to be addressing the issue of the postproduction costs that they were hitting people with,” said Rep. Don Longmuir, a Republican from Stanley, in the northwest corner of the state. 
The newsrooms’ investigation found that the program has focused on other issues. It has instead helped owners resolve complaints about companies withholding payments entirely and failing to pay interest on late royalty payments, records show. Some mineral owners said in interviews that they do not trust state officials to help them get information about the deductions and therefore have not tried to use the program.  
Leverenz said the program, also referred to as the ombudsman program, has not accomplished what he and other royalty owners were told it would. He has taken six complaints to the ombudsman; three were resolved but three remain open, including two for more than a year. The unresolved complaints do not involve deductions, he said, and focus on other issues with his family’s royalty payments. 
“The ombudsman is running into the same thing that I have, where there’s just no response from the oil companies or they stalled,” Leverenz said. “There’s been no forward momentum.”
Ron Webb, who coordinates the program within the state’s Department of Agriculture, said it has helped facilitate communication between mineral owners and companies. He said the program is voluntary and does not have authority to compel companies to change how they calculate payments or even to provide information. “Oil companies are not required to work with us,” Webb said.
The program no longer promotes itself as being able to oversee concerns about royalty deductions even though that was part of the legislative intent. On the department’s website and in a brochure, the word “postproduction” has been dropped from the program’s name even though it is in the title of the law that created it.
The department’s legal counsel, Dutch Bialke, said the name of the law is irrelevant to how the program operates.
“The title is entirely legally non-binding and has no legal effect,” he wrote in an email, citing North Dakota law. 
  A bill introduced in 2023 established what it called the postproduction royalty oversight program. The program has since dropped the word “postproduction” from its name. (Obtained by North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.)
‘Nothing is clear’ 
Ever since Neil Christensen and his sisters noticed in 2016 that Hess Corp. was withholding nearly 25% of their royalty income — up from less than 1% just two years earlier — his family has tried to get answers from the company. 
He traveled to Minot, North Dakota, some years ago to meet with Hess representatives at their production offices. He also called the company’s accounting office and its royalty owner hotline, but he said their explanations didn’t make sense. 
“It doesn’t seem as if the company has a large interest in explaining themselves,” Christensen said. Spreadsheets kept by his family show withholdings have been as much as 42% in recent years. “The transparency issue is a big problem with oil operators and mineral owners.”

The royalty statements can be hundreds of pages long but provide only a general description of the reasons for the deductions, leaving owners unable to verify the companies’ costs and whether they are being paid a fair share. Christensen’s family and others said they have had payments reduced for expenses the companies incurred years earlier.
“Nothing is clear,” said his sister Naomi Staruch, who has spent most of her career working in finance for banks and churches in Minnesota. “I would get so frustrated really looking hard at the statements.” 
Diana and Bob Skarphol, who have advocated for years on behalf of royalty owners, said confusing and overwhelming royalty statements are a common concern. The couple received one statement last year that included 39 pages of calculations for a single well — including reductions to past royalties going back nine years. The Skarphols received $1.15 that month from the production of the well.
Merrill Piepkorn, a Democratic former state senator from Fargo who was the prime sponsor of the transparency legislation, said oil companies’ tactics are “obfuscation through transparency.” 
“You get so much information, there’s no way to find what you’re looking for,” said Piepkorn, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2024. 
Todd Slawson, chair of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said royalty statements are complex in part because state regulators within the last decade began requiring companies to include additional categories of information. Hess said it maintains an online portal where royalty owners can access their royalty information and operates a call center that mineral owners can contact with questions. 
North Dakota does not regulate the costs that companies can pass on to individual owners, though the state and federal governments regulate deductions on government-owned land. The state audits the royalties paid on state-owned minerals to ensure the amounts are correct and, since 1979, the state’s leases do not allow deductions. But private mineral owners don’t have that same access and often learn about deductions by comparing their statements with one another. 
“It’s kind of all rigged against the individual royalty owner,” Leverenz said.

State officials have told mineral owners that they can’t get involved in private disputes and that litigation is the owners’ best recourse. But litigation isn’t financially feasible for most families, according to attorney Josh Swanson, who represents mineral owners.
“It easily exceeds six figures, and that’s cost-prohibitive for most folks,” Swanson said. “Part of the playbook for a lot of operators is making these things as cost-prohibitive as they can.”
Swanson was the attorney Janice Arnson and her family hired to try to get answers from Hess. Hess had been deducting between 15% and 36% of their royalty income each month since 2015, according to a spreadsheet maintained by Arnson. They had no luck getting an explanation from the company until they hired Swanson in 2017. When Hess responded, a company attorney said in a letter that the deductions were “proper and permissible” under the terms of the lease. While Swanson disagreed, the family declined to pursue litigation because “it was going to be an expensive suit.”

“We were one small, little family,” said Arnson. “We just didn’t have the resources against Hess to fight.”
(Hess did not contest or comment on Arnson’s or Christensen’s claims.)
Some royalty owners have turned to the Northwest Landowners Association, a nonprofit advocacy group, for help. Troy Coons, the group’s chair, said he has fielded multiple calls a week from royalty owners who are angry that state leaders have not helped them with the deductions. “It’s a massive concern for people,” said Coons, whose group has sued the state on behalf of property owners on a different issue. “We’re not supposed to be bearing the burden of expenses.”

Lawmakers initially had bipartisan support in 2023 for a bill that would have guaranteed mineral owners access to electronic spreadsheets detailing their payments and would have required companies to provide more information on how they calculate a royalty owner’s share of the income from each well. It also would have directed courts to require companies to reimburse royalty owners for attorneys’ fees if they successfully sued for the information. 
But that bill was discarded in favor of legislation creating the royalty oversight program. 
The Legislature “took our bill and they stripped it of everything, and they shoved the ombudsman program into it,” Leverenz said. They created the program “with the promises that, you know, this is going to be the answer to all the issues that have been brought up over the years with the royalty owners.”
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, a Republican from Williston, initially backed both bills. The senator said he hoped the bill creating the ombudsman program would be amended in the legislative process to give it more authority to advocate on behalf of mineral owners. That didn’t happen.  
“That would have been, I think, more beneficial to royalty owners,” said Bekkedahl, who ultimately voted against it.

‘Barking up a tree’ 
In pitching the program to lawmakers in 2023, Doug Goehring, the state’s agriculture commissioner, said the goal was to “try to develop some resolution” for royalty owners with questions about their payments, including concerns over deductions.
The bill required a report to legislators. Goehring told lawmakers he would share with them “full and complete information concerning the cases” handled by the program and the issues faced by mineral owners in order to inform future legislation. “We’ll certainly provide you scenarios, situations, and some of the challenges and difficulties we’ve dealt with,” Goehring, a Republican, testified in 2023. “And even some suggestions about how you correct some of this moving forward.” 
The result has fallen short of what Goehring pledged in testimony, the news organizations found. Goehring now says it is not the program’s job to find resolution for royalty owners who question the deductions. “We don’t have a leg to stand on to try and advocate or try to extort money out of the company,” Goehring said. He said an exception is if deductions are specifically prohibited in leases, but most agreements, especially those signed decades ago, are silent on the issue of deductions.
Instead of a detailed report, Goehring delivered a one-page summary to legislators in September that broadly categorized the issues handled through the program. Legislators accepted the report without discussion. Goehring said a more detailed report was not necessary. “They don’t want to know that,” he said. “We generally don’t write reports in that manner. We give them the basic information.”

Of the 147 cases filed with the program, about half remain unresolved, including more than two dozen that have been pending since 2023. Goehring said some of the cases remain open at the request of royalty owners.
Two of the pending cases involve postproduction deductions, including one that has been open since September 2023, according to Bialke, the Agriculture Department’s legal counsel.
The cases are assigned to two energy companies that serve as ombudsmen, Diamond Resources and Aurora Energy Solutions, which contact the companies on behalf of the mineral owners. Neither of the companies responded to questions from the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica. 
The news organizations paid $425 to obtain records related to the cases that had been resolved as of late June. In those cases, the ombudsmen have answered royalty owners’ questions and obtained answers for them when companies had not been responsive. In some cases, they mediated solutions that resulted in royalty owners receiving payments they were owed, records show. 
In one case, an ombudsman spent nearly 10 months going back and forth with a company until the royalty owner got paid. In other cases, ombudsmen helped royalty owners understand technical issues related to taxes and the probate process after inheriting minerals. The department redacted company names from the documents released, with Bialke citing state law.
“It has been extremely helpful for frustrated royalty owners who cannot get their questions answered,” said Slawson of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, who also owns an energy company. “Having deductions suddenly show up on revenue checks and questions not being answered or not explained well can lead to suspicions of wrongdoing.”
North Dakota mineral owners say oil companies unfairly keep millions from checks without oversight

Kenneth Schmidt, who owns minerals near Ray in Williams County, contacted the program after struggling to convince a company that it owed interest on late royalty payments as mandated by state law. It took a few months, he said, but the company paid him.
“I was very satisfied with the program,” said Schmidt. “Instead of going to an attorney and I’ll pay $400 an hour, they did it for free, but through the state.”
Goehring said the program has been successful, citing feedback from the industry as well as the fact that no bills related to royalty deductions were introduced during this year’s legislative session, the first time in nearly a decade.
“If there’s no bills that are coming up, then isn’t that an indication? It’s kind of like if you don’t have a cough, then maybe you don’t have a cold,” he said.
While the program has resolved disputes like Schmidt’s, which are more cut-and-dried, it isn’t well equipped to handle more complex disagreements, Goehring said. That isn’t a surprise to one of the lawmakers who worked on the bill. 
“I don’t doubt that in some cases, facilitating that communication probably helped, but I don’t think it gives all the answers to the royalty owners that they’re looking for,” Bekkedahl said.
A number of royalty owners told the news organizations they simply don’t trust the program to help. “I didn’t feel the ombudsman program had any teeth in it whatsoever to do anything,” said Brian Anderson, who has not filed a complaint even though he wants companies to more fully explain their deductions. “They’ll placate you; they’re not going to do anything about it.”
Curtis Trulson, a royalty owner in Mountrail County, agreed: Going to the program, he said, is just “barking up a tree.”

And she is curious: Wouldn’t Nebraska fans be game for taking a train to see a Husker football game? An Omaha concert? A Grand Island museum? 
Starting Aug. 19 in Columbus, Juarez and ProRail Nebraska advocates are kicking off a statewide series of five  town halls to gauge the interest Nebraskans have in passenger rail options. 
The feedback is for a legislative interim study also evaluating existing passenger rail infrastructure in Nebraska — which sponsors say could lead to legislation proposing ways to create easier commutes between Nebraska cities.  
 Nebraska ‘far behind’

Juarez said her hope is for a frequent and steady Omaha-Lincoln route, but she also sees potential for better connection from western Nebraska to the state’s capital city of Lincoln or to its largest city, Omaha.
“Transportation is a priority in our state, and I’m disappointed in the lack of progress we’ve made,” she said. “I want communities across Nebraska to see what a great asset passenger rail can be.”
 

Town hall schedule
(Times are 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., except in Omaha, which is 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.)
Aug. 19, Columbus, library, 2500 14th St., in English and Spanish 
Sept. 5, Lincoln, First Presbyterian Church, 840 S. 17th St.
Sept. 9, North Platte, library, 120 W. 4th St.
Sept. 16, Grand Island, library, 1124 W 2nd St.
Sept. 22, Omaha, Willa Cather library, 1905 S. 44th St.



She referred to a trip she recently made to Salt Lake City, where she once lived. She said a light rail system allowed her to ride from the airport to downtown and her hotel for $1.25.
“It reinforced in my mind how far behind Nebraska is in mass transportation,” said Juarez. “That kind of reliability and affordability should be available to everyone in Nebraska.”
According to the Juarez-led legislative resolution seeking the study, interest in rail transit and public transportation has grown in Nebraska, especially among young professionals. In addition to trying to retain homegrown talent and meeting workforce needs, the resolution said passenger rail projects can drive tourism and large public and private investment.
The study, among other tasks, will examine plans that the Amtrak passenger railroad may have relevant to Nebraska. Juarez said the study and recommendations from the public town halls will help inform legislation she plans to present in January. 
Costs to buy and own a vehicle are fast increasing, Juarez noted. “These transportation systems need to be in place, because there are people who can’t even afford to buy a car,” she said.
A major roadblock to expanding passenger rail service, she acknowledged, is cost. Juarez said she recognizes that “plenty of research” still is ahead.
A less expensive pathway, Juarez said, would be to use existing rails, perhaps adding more frequent intercity Amtrak trips between, say, Omaha and Lincoln.
 California Zephyr

Currently, she said, Nebraska’s passenger rail service is limited to Amtrak’s California Zephyr route that stops in Omaha, Lincoln, Hastings, Holdrege and McCook on its way from Chicago to Emeryville, California. Nebraska stops are typically in the late night or early morning hours, not geared toward workers or a daily outing.

“It’s what we call a long-distance train that runs daily, although the time-keeping in the wintertime can be challenging,” said Clyde Anderson, a representative of ProRail Nebraska. 
Snow and the fact the Zephyr shares tracks with freight trains can throw off schedules. Anderson said pickup and drop off times aren’t convenient for commuters wanting to move from one Nebraska town to another.
“There’s a lot of people who ride between intermediate points,” he said, not necessarily from one end of the route to the other end.
Juarez has held information-gathering discussions with sources including representatives of a local railroad. One suggestion Juarez said she received during preliminary discussions was to start with test excursion trips headed to a Nebraska football or volleyball game, for example.
The Nebraska Department of Transportation said in a statement to the Nebraska Examiner that passenger rail currently is “not viable in the state because the development of such a route would pose a significant cost, and there is currently no mechanism to pay for such a project with existing state revenue.”
The state has been involved with groups dedicated to expansion and study of passenger rail, including the Midwest Interstate Passenger Rail Commission (MIPRC), which Nebraska helped establish. However, lawmakers withdrew from the multi-state commission under a 2015 proposal by then-State Sen. Bill Kintner of Papillion, who said in his bill’s intent statement that membership benefits “do not outweigh the expenditure of tax dollars on dues.”
The commission in conjunction with the Federal Railroad Administration released a draft  four years ago for a 40-year regional plan, identifying key corridors. The plan at that time did not extend beyond Omaha, the NDOT statement said, adding that no route into Nebraska is officially planned.

At least two state senators in recent years have launched efforts to rejoin the commission that coordinates and supports improvements to passenger rail service among its members. The most recent proposal was earlier this year by Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island. Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln made a push in 2023, saying also that it was important for Nebraska to have a voice in future passenger development and funding allocation.
“Whether the Nebraska Legislature should choose to reenter the MIPRC, as has been proposed in past years legislation, or commit to any other opportunities to study passenger rail, NDOT will remain committed to delivering a high-quality, safe and efficient transportation system for the movement of people and goods in Nebraska,” the statement said.
 Workforce, tourism

The ProRail group, which is associated with the Rail Passenger Association, wants the state DOT to update a state rail passenger plan, Anderson said.
He said his group has advocated in the past for a second Amtrak train that would run during daytime hours across Nebraska. ProRail also supports improved bus service between Nebraska cities, including Omaha and Lincoln.
A company that had provided daily bus rides to students between the Omaha and Lincoln campuses of the University of Nebraska at one time was interested in offering the service to a broader audience, Anderson said. He said the idea fizzled during the COVID-19 pandemic and to his knowledge has not been revived.
Lack of convenient public transit options between Omaha and Lincoln, he said, can hinder people such as himself from, for example, testifying on a bill before the Legislature. 
Juarez said better intercity transit opportunities also could help fill labor gaps and encourage more tourism and entertainment outings between cities. “The potential is massive,” she said.
Organizers of the town halls said they hope to hear voices from urban and rural communities. Virtual participation is an option. Those who want a remote connection are asked to email mjuarez@leg.ne.gov at least two days in advance of the chosen meeting to get a registration link.
An online survey also is ongoing and hosted by Poll The Vote, which plans to provide results to the Nebraska Legislature and the LR 203 interim study.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)Ford Motor Company will delay mass production of its next-generation electric pickup truck at its West Tennessee plant until 2028, the company confirmed Thursday.
Ford informed its suppliers of the delay — a result of the company shifting its focus to smaller, more affordable models — in June. The company also pushed back production of its electric transit van at its plant in Ohio from 2026 to 2028.
Prototypes of the truck will still begin production at BlueOval City in Stanton, Tennessee in 2027.
“F-150 Lightning, America’s best-selling electric truck, and E-Transit continue to meet today’s customer needs,” a company spokesperson stated. “We remain focused on delivering our Ford+ plan and will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.”
This announcement comes roughly a year after Ford first delayed production of the truck from its initial production goal of 2025 to 2027. At the time, Ford said the decision was part of a shift toward prioritizing hybrid vehicles and producing lower-cost batteries to improve profitability.
Ford announced its $5.6 billion investment in the BlueOval City campus in Haywood County in 2021, pledging to create 5,800 jobs in return for a nearly $1 billion incentive from the state. The Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center where the electric pickup truck will be manufactured plans to employ roughly 3,000 of those workers.
The company has teased a “Model T moment” announcement about its plans to “design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in America” at an appearance in Kentucky slated for Aug. 11 at 9:20 a.m. CT.

(Getty photos)West Virginia high school and middle school athletes are now able to get paid for name, image and likeness deals.
The state school board in July approved the first NIL policy for student athletes, and the policy went into effect Friday.
Since the NCAA allowed college athletes to profit from their NIL in 2021, the ripple effects of this change have now affected high school and middle school sports. More than 40 states have laws and state high school association rules governing NIL for young athletes.
North Carolina’s first high school NIL year included a $1.2 million deal for a high school quarterback, Sports Illustrated reported. 
  Wayne Ryan
Wayne Ryan, executive director of the West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission, said the state’s new policy sets general guidelines that will protect students from violating their eligibility under amateur athlete rules. 
“It’s basically going to have to be evaluated on a case by case basis,” he said, adding that they pulled from other states’ polices to create a starting point for student athlete NIL in West Virginia. 
“We’re just trying to serve the student athlete appropriately and keep our competitive rules and policy in place,” Ryan added.
The policy put forth by the WVSAAC outlines how students can use their NIL for monetary gain. It bans school employees, including coaches, from being involved in a student athlete’s use of their NIL.
Students are prohibited from making any reference to their school or wearing their school’s logo when engaging in any NIL activity. For example, they couldn’t wear their high school football or cheerleading uniform while participating in a local television commercial. Students also can’t reference the WVSAAC.
“They have to keep it independent of their school and athletic life,’ Ryan said. “Honestly, they have received notoriety for that, but they can’t use that as part of their advertisement.” 
Student athletes also can’t engage in NIL activities to advertise for a number of products, including alcohol, cannabis, weapons, prescription drugs and more. 
  Paul Saluja
Paul Saluja, an attorney in Charleston, visited the state Capitol earlier this year with a successful student athlete and met with state lawmakers about the importance of an NIL policy. He said families don’t want multimillion dollar endorsements; they’re looking for flexibility. He argues that it gives student athletes a reason to stay in West Virginia. 
“Some of these student athletes, they will do well in high school, they’ll do well at the collegiate level, but they’re not going to make it at the pro level,” Saluja said. “This at least allows them the opportunity to go ahead and at least, if not secure their future, but get a good head start on securing their future.”
Ryan said as NIL policies have become standard for states, he had received numerous inquiries from parents outside of West Virginia whose children had NIL deals and were considering relocating to the state. 
Ryan said the policy will continue to be under evaluation “because NIL is an ever fluid ongoing situation.”
He encouraged students and parents considering NIL deals to contact the WVSAAC’s director of compliance to ensure there would be no issues with eligibility.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Ever wished you could open up your mailbox and find $100?
That wish could come true for some Arkansans under a new state unclaimed property law. Act 114 of 2025, which went into effect earlier last week, allows the Arkansas State Auditor to automatically return thousands of dollars of unclaimed money to their owners.
More specifically, the law allows the auditor to mail property valued at less than $5,000 to owners if they live within the state of Arkansas and the auditor “reasonably believes” it belongs to them, even if they haven’t filed a claim for it.
That means unclaimed property could find its way into the inboxes of thousands of Arkansans without requiring them to go through a claims process, State Auditor Dennis Milligan told the Advocate.
“The next two or three months is going to be a lot of fun for Arkansans, because the checks will start going out,” Milligan said. One in four Arkansans have money sitting in the unclaimed property program, he said.
In addition to its other roles, the auditor’s office is responsible for around $400 million in unclaimed property from around the state, which is held in “perpetuity” until it’s claimed, Milligan said.
With the new law, Milligan said his office anticipates sending out nearly a fourth of that — $83 million — to approximately 360,000 people. Milligan said the average payout is expected to be a little over $100.
“This program is very, very important to me,” Milligan said. “You know, $200 might not mean anything to one person, but it may mean the difference between being able to pay a utility bill or … put[ting] some food on the table.”
Milligan’s office receives money from a variety of sources, including abandoned checking accounts, rebates and insurance adjustments.
“I got 20 bucks here a while back off of some kind of rebate,” Milligan said. “A former employer tried to send you your last check, and they couldn’t find you, so they forwarded it to us. It’s a multitude of different reasons why we get sent this money.”
Unclaimed property is more than money. The office keeps a book with pictures of some of the more interesting physical property in its care  — a World War II-era telegram referencing a conversation with Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a $10,000 bill, signed Nolan Ryan baseball cards  — obtained from abandoned safety deposit boxes or an inheritance that went unclaimed. That property is meticulously catalogued and stored.
Getting Arkansans to come and collect what they’re owed, however, can be a difficult task, Milligan said, because many people don’t know they’re owed money at all. Fears about being scammed have also come up.
In some cases, property can go unclaimed for decades. Most people don’t know that the unclaimed property program exists, Milligan said, something that still “amazes” him.
Even Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has unclaimed property, according to the auditor’s office’s online database, where Arkansans can go to see if they are owed money.

Milligan and his staff criss-cross the state to raise awareness for unclaimed property — and to get people to see if they have any in their name. Milligan has personally driven to the homes of people who were owed large sums to convince them to fill out the claims form.
Even for those who weren’t suspicious or knew they were owed money, the paperwork sometimes stood in the way of returning their property, Milligan said. Prior to Act 114, if someone wanted to reclaim property from the auditor’s office, regardless of the value, they had to fill out a form and verify their identity before being sent their property.
Republican Sen. Dave Wallace of Leachville, who introduced the act, said Milligan came to him with the idea for the legislation last year. Automatically repatriating the funds in the possession of the state to their rightful owners, Wallace said, was just good government.
Wallace said he was a “good example” of the benefits of the law  because “the state has $238 that belongs to either me, or my wife, Karen, from some event a couple years ago. I didn’t even know about it. And there’s going to be thousands and tens of thousands of Arkansans in that same situation.”
Milligan said his office will use software to validate the identities and addresses of unclaimed property owners before mailing a check. Getting through the backlog will take time, he said, but eligible unclaimed property owners will begin receiving letters informing them that a check is on the way in the coming months. The check will follow a few weeks after as long as the original letter isn’t returned as undeliverable.
“I mean, who can argue about Arkansans getting their money back?” Milligan said. “I haven’t had anybody complain yet.”
Even with the law, Milligan said he still encourages Arkansans to check the unclaimed property database occasionally. The new law only allows the auditor’s office to send money, and only if it’s $5,000 or less. Any more than that, and the person owed the money still has to fill out the paperwork that was previously required.
Physical property isn’t eligible for automatic repatriation either, nor is property that multiple people or businesses have claims to. For example, if someone is owed money as part of an inheritance that has multiple claimants, they still have to fill out the auditor’s form online.

(John Gray/Verite News)In late July, officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided access to three detention centers they operate in Louisiana to a group of about 20 civil rights advocates. 
Their tour included the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, located on the former England Air Force Base in Alexandria. It’s become a conduit for individuals apprehended around the country to the nine ICE detention centers in Louisiana, where immigration court watchers say judges are more likely to be aligned to the Trump administration’s enforcement policy.
The other ICE facilities on the tour were the South Louisiana Processing Center in Basile, which holds only women, and the Pine Prairie Processing Center in Evangeline Parish.
The Illuminator conducted two separate interviews with attorneys who went on the tour, and excerpts from these transcripts are shared below. They have been edited for length and clarity. 
One interview featured Kerry Kennedy and Anthony Enriquez with the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization, who are in Episode 17 of “The Light Switch,” our weekly podcast.

﻿ 
The other interview is with Alanah Odoms, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, and Nora Ahmed, the organization’s legal director. 
RFK Human Rights and the ACLU of Louisiana have collaborated in the past, most notably as of late on a 2024 report – “Inside the Black Hole” – that detailed “abused and disappeared” immigrants in the state. It was compiled based on interviews with more than 6,000 interviews and seven tours with officials from the New Orleans ICE office. 
Last month’s tour was just the latest trip to the state’s ICE facilities for Ahmed and Enriquez, both of whom have clients in custody. 
The interviews included claims of unsanitary living conditions, inadequate medical care and abuse. Questions about these allegations were sent to the ICE media relations office, and its representatives have yet to respond.

Q: You’ve visited these facilities before. Did you get the sense that preparations were made in advance to have each facility put its best foot forward, or was it much as you’ve seen on past visits?
Odoms: This was actually my first time inside immigrant detention.  … I was really surprised that it did not seem like much preparation went into making things appear, at least visually, better than what they normally are. I think where the real dog and pony show took place was in their presentation to us about their operations and their standards and their protocols. That was like night and day, hearing from ICE about how they care for people and what their standards are, versus hearing directly from the residents.
Q: The first stop on the tour was the ICE Processing Center in Alexandria. Take us through your first impressions.
Odoms: First of all, every single one of these places has many layers of barbed wire around it, so they depict prison immediately. Then you’re brought through metal detectors and security. You’re you have to surrender everything, even a smart watch. You’re not allowed to have any recording devices, anything like that. Then you’re brought through these metal sally port doors, which are these huge metal doors that slam shut behind you, and you are very, very aware that you are in a prison. 
Then you walk in and you see there are two main areas in the staging facility where people are either held in prison, like cells, like a cell block, very traditional prison … and it opens up into  what they call airport-style seating area, where people are actually sitting, chained at their hands, chained at their feet, and chained at their bellies, waiting for their planes to take off. 
That is what you see as soon as you walk in, and they did not try to hide the people who were waiting. There were about maybe a handful, if not maybe 10 to 12 people who were waiting for a flight, who were sitting clearly chained … at every single appendage of their body. 
The second room is more of a gymnasium style room where there are between 70 to 90 people being housed in bunk beds. … This aging facility is where the male population is held inside these either cell blocks or bunk-style barracks. 
In the open room, there’s a large Plexiglas or glass partition where you can very clearly see who’s inside, and they can very clearly see you. As soon as folks saw us, they immediately came to that window. And honestly, the looks on all of their faces were like, “Help.”

Q: Kerry, your organization has a global focus on human rights concerns. What’s happening in Louisiana’s ICE facilities that has made this situation one of your priorities?
  Kerry Kennedy, president of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization. (RFK Human Rights photo)
Kennedy: When we were in Louisiana, in the detention centers, we met with a woman who is also one of our clients, who her doctor told her that she might have colon cancer, and she was picked up [to see a doctor] a couple of days later. She’s been asking for four and a half months to see a doctor to see whether or not she has colon cancer, and her ability to see that doctor has been denied for four and a half months. 
We met another woman, an elderly woman, who begged and pleaded to see a doctor because she came into the facility walking perfectly, and now she’s forced to use a wheelchair, and she doesn’t know why. She’s begged and pleaded to see a doctor. They finally said, ”We’ll send you to health care,” and she was sexually assaulted when she did that. 
I met another young woman who’s 26 years old. She is gay. She’s from Russia. She fled Russia because of the oppression against gay people, because her life was in danger. She’s got a master’s in chemical engineering, and she was working for a pharmaceutical company, making medicines for us, for our country, and now instead, she’s in this detention center. 
This makes no sense. These are people who are in our communities, who are creating change, who are paying taxes, who are making our country stronger and better. And instead, now you and I … [are] paying through our tax dollars for their breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day, and for them to be in a prison situation instead about the world creating change. So that’s why we’re attacking this.
Q: How do you mount a legal strategy for your clients against an administration that is willing to subvert due process when it comes to immigration law?
Enriquez: This is a question that actually has two answers. One is we work hand in hand with people who are living and working in the communities where detention centers exist. So for those of you who are in Louisiana, one thing that’s been interesting is when we have discussions with the workers who are guards in some of these private prisons, these detention centers. They tell us, “I really didn’t have another choice. It was either work here or in a casino, and this was the only thing around for me. This was a way that I could feed my own family.” 
So a core element of what we’re doing is to try and extend the notion of human rights, not just to the people who are suffering the types of physical sexual abuse that that you just heard Kerry speak of the detained immigrants, but actually the workers who are being exploited in these detention centers as well by private prison.
CEOs … are pocketing these taxpayer dollars for their own bonuses. People might not be aware that the head of the corporate leadership of the GEO Group, which is one of the owners of many of the detention centers in Louisiana, they just gave themselves big fat raises after the passage of this last domestic policy bill. That’s money that they’re actually taking out of the hands of pockets of Louisiana workers as well. So that’s one of the ways that we really try and broaden the conception of what human rights is, and we let people know this is a big fight that’s affecting all of us. 
Q: Statistics show that roughly half of the people being detained in Louisiana ICE facilities do not have a prior criminal background, and many have not been formally charged with a crime.
Odoms: The only designation that they have that separates people who they believe have criminal histories is this high- [or] low-designation, and whether you get put in a cell block or whether you get put in the barrack style living conditions. 
When we asked about classification for how people were classified as either high or low, we didn’t get a very clear answer on that at all. Sometimes they were saying, “Well, they come to us that way from other facilities, so someone else is making the classification, and we’re just kind of rubber stamping that and either putting somebody in a cell block or putting someone in a barracks.” Or, “We have a point system,” and they said, “Oh, you’re going to have to request that in writing.” 
So anytime we kind of brushed up against a question that would really illuminate what was happening in terms of constitutional violations and real problems, all of those questions were met with: “That would have to be something that you submit in writing.”
Q: What explanations have you been given as to why your clients are being warehoused indefinitely in ICE detention without any opportunity for bond, and what level of proof is the federal government providing to justify this?
Ahmed: We have two clients [and] we’ll be filing habeas petitions* in short order that illustrate this. 
One of our clients, they’ve attempted to remove her to six different countries. All have said no, but she’s still there because apparently they’re just going to run through the list, which is … wildly preposterous. 

* What is a habeas petition? It’s a legal filing with the court to require authorities to present the legal reason someone is held in prison.

In terms of bond, we’re going to bring another habeas challenge. Because right now you’ve probably heard the administration is [taking into custody] people who appear at their immigration proceedings. We have a client who appeared for her asylum proceeding, and then she was whisked away. The reason she was whisked away is because of a newfound interpretation of the United States Code, Section 1225, which no longer is interpreting mandatory detention as applicable to people appearing at the border, and is now just applying to anybody who entered the country without inspection. 
So you’re now starting to see people like our client, who’ve been in the United States for two decades, showing up as they’re supposed to to an immigration court hearing. Are you really a flight risk if you’re showing up to your court hearing? Probably not. And in her particular case, there’s no criminal record. So you’re also talking about somebody who there is no conceivable way that you could possibly say that she’s a danger. 
I still want to say that people who do have criminal records are also not dangerous, let’s be clear, because in this country, a criminal record could include not paying a fine or having to pick up your child and not making a court date. So I don’t like to pitch people with criminal records as people who are dangerous because the vast majority are not.

Q: Recently in Louisiana, two powerful members of our congressional delegation intervened to secure the release of two detainees. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise stepped in to have an Iranian woman who’s lived in New Orleans for nearly 50 years released, and Sen. John Kennedy was instrumental in the release of a Mexican woman who’s married to a U.S. Marine. Does this give you any glimmer of hope that other powerful Republicans will call for the Trump administration to pause its sweeping immigration enforcement efforts?
Kennedy: I think it’s important that people at the highest levels are beginning to understand the impact of these terrible laws. You know, one of the problems with GEO Group is that it runs prisons. So this is a detention facility that is run as a prison. 
But before this, we were not always putting people in detention, and a lot of these people have been in the communities, have been in the Marines, have served our country. They are our teachers. They are giving us the food that we eat every day. They’re making our medicines.
They can be in the community, and they’re great programs – proven again and again and again – where 100% of the people who are released into the community return for their detention here, for their immigration hearings and also to be deported, if that’s ultimately what’s supposed to happen to them. 
So why in the world are we taking people? Why are we kidnapping people off the street and treating them with such inhumanity and harming our country at the same time? This makes no sense, unless you think about it as a way to enrich a cruel corporation, which is what’s happened. 
Q: The sheer number of people being detained makes it close to impossible that everyone is represented by an attorney. Is there any solution within sight that, at the very least, would ensure every detainee receives legal representation?
Kennedy: Yeah, well, there’s a clear solution – open up the doors and let people be in the community, which was the solution under the Bush administration, the Obama administration, many of the other administrations. That’s what would happen to people, and there are proven programs where 100% of them come back to their [immigration court] hearing. So that’s the least expensive, most effective and best way to assure that people’s rights are not being compromised by the United States government.   
Q: We’re seeing increasing incidents of people showing up for immigration court hearings at the appointed time and date, following official instructions only to be taken into ICE custody and placed into detention. How are you advising clients who might want to adhere to the rules but face a good chance they will be apprehended and then fast-tracked toward deportation or imprisoned indefinitely?     
Odoms:  We have very direct guidance for people who are able to obtain counsel. They absolutely need to do so, and they need to presume that they are going to be apprehended. Like, it’s not if they’re going to be taken. It’s when they’re going to be taken. 
But here’s the thing, I really want this to come across: Everyone is still having faith in this system, that if they actually present themselves and continue to do what’s right, being compliant, being adherent, that they will actually be given some kind of consideration. And that is not true
Ahmed: … What preparations people need to do? They need to prepare in two to three very distinct ways, I think, and we can tell them, talk to an immigration attorney about a motion to reopen your immigration proceedings very quickly. Also try to ensure that you have access to a federal practitioner who will be able to file a habeas petition for you when you’re incarcerated. 
… We’ve seen a lot of congressional folks start stepping up, have a privacy waiver signed and make sure that everyone important in your life, including your congressional representatives, is able to communicate on your behalf with ICE. You can download the document off of the [ICE] website. … You get to fill in the information of whoever is allowed to have access, and then they can start advocating for you with ICE. You should know your congressional representatives, who can do that, your local friends and family.
Q: Alana, your organization has always had as its bedrock the belief that our Constitution, our laws and judicial system ultimately would not let us down. Do you feel that certainty still exists?
Odoms: Yeah, it does feel like the safety net of our Constitution has started to fray in some really fundamental ways. 
… Myself and every other lawyer that’s been trained in this country, we’re trained in the Constitution, both of Louisiana and of the United States of America. We’re not trained to actually respond to an authoritarian regime – that is the true issue that we’re all facing. What do you do when the Constitution doesn’t apply anymore? What do we do when we actually have laws and those laws are being completely thrown out, how do we respond? 
There’s a lot for us to learn from organizers and folks who have been doing work outside of the power structure, because I don’t think we’re going to find our answers in the traditional way that we have in the past.
…  That’s the outside strategy that we have to work on. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with filing a lawsuit, but it does have to do with strategizing around people power. How do we do that? Because these systems are only going to buckle under the the pressure of people saying, “Oh, hell no, that looks like an authoritarian regime. That’s not what we want. We want a process. We want due process. We want people to have access to lawyers. We want people to have access to all the things that our constitution says.” 
That’s a people power movement.

The survey — for which results were shared with Mississippi Today before publication — of nearly 1,600 Mississippi college students shows that almost 60% of students who reported gambling in the last year said they placed online bets on “legal” sportsbooks. 
This indicates that a potentially large number of students are finding ways to place bets on legitimate platforms, not just illicit betting sites, even though mobile sports betting remains illegal in Mississippi, according to one of the study’s coauthors.    
“Our students are showing similar patterns to those identified by the NCAA and seen nationally, including that legality doesn’t make a difference with college students,” said Dan Durkin, an associate professor of social work.
The survey did not ask about the use of illicit betting platforms because most students either don’t know or don’t care whether or not the practice is illegal, Durkin said. The researchers plan to create a variable before publication that reflects illegality, he added.  
College campuses have become hubs of activity for sports betting and, increasingly, gambling addiction. This has prompted calls for research into mobile sports betting’s growth and impact on young adults. 
As more states began to legalize online betting and concern over addition grew, the NCAA  surveyed students and found that many young adults were wagering on sports despite age, geographic and legal restrictions on betting. 
Mobile sports betting statewide has remained illegal in Mississippi, largely due to fears that legalization could harm the bottom line of the state’s casinos and increase gambling addiction. In 2024, illegal online betting in Mississippi made up about 5% of the national illegal market, which is about $3 billion in illegal bets in Mississippi, proponents said that year. 
The new University of Mississippi study, conducted by Durkin, Hannah Allen, Nicholas McAfee, George McClellan and Ronald Rychlak in conjunction with the University of Mississippi’s William Magee Institute for Student Wellbeing, also found that 32% of students reported using family members or friends to place bets over the past year. About 18% reported placing bets in person at casinos, 15% bet online through a sportsbook outside the U.S. or Canada and another 15% place bets with illegal bookies. 
Mississippi residents have placed, according to some analysts, billions of dollars in online sports bets through illicit offshore betting platforms. But the new survey results show that young people in Mississippi have found a way to place online bets on legitimate platforms as well. They might be doing this by using tools such as virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access betting sites.

Some students told Durkin that their peers learned how to use VPNs after Mississippi enacted a law in 2023 requiring age verification for pornographic sites, prompting some pornography companies to block access to their sites in the state. 
There are just under 80,000 students enrolled at Mississippi’s eight public universities and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. That translates to somewhere between 4,700 and 6,400 Mississippi students facing serious gambling issues currently, Durkin said, using a range of state and national estimates on gambling-related “harm.” This can include psychological distress, debt, and dips in academic performance. 
Of those, 20%–30% may eventually develop a gambling disorder, though gambling disorders can often take time to develop, Durkin said. Those are his estimates, not figures included in the survey.
In the survey, a majority of students who bet on sports had no or a low risk for “problem gambling,” but 10% had a moderate risk for problem gambling, and 6% met criteria for problem gambling.       
The survey looked at gambling across the board. About 39% of students gambled in the past year, with lottery (18%), card games (17%), and sports betting (16%) as the most prevalent types of gambling. Gambling was more prevalent among students who were male, white, lived off campus, participated in athletics, were involved in Greek life and had higher GPAs, the survey found.

Zooming in on sports betting, the most prevalent way to bet was online through a sportsbook. 
The most common sports to bet on were the NFL football (62%), college football (53%), college men’s basketball (48%), and NBA basketball (46%). Typical monthly spending ranged from $0-$6,000, with an average of about $100 per month. 
Favorable regulatory and technological shifts have led to rapid growth for the U.S. online gambling market in recent years. But the industry continues to be undercut by illegal operators. Online gross gaming revenue in the U.S. topped $90 billion in 2024, $67 billion of which went to unlicensed players, according to research commissioned by the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, a group that lobbies against illegal gambling.
Changing state regulations have kicked off a lobbying blitz in states such as Mississippi. 
The Mississippi House in 2023, 2024 and 2025 passed legislation legalizing online betting, but it has died in the Senate.
Some form of sports betting is legal in 40 states, though only 20 have full online betting with multiple operators, according to Action Network, a sports betting application and news site. Some states have only in-person betting, and some only have a single online operator. Mississippi permits sports betting, but it only allows bets made in person at casinos or bets made with apps on mobile devices while inside casinos. 
Mississippi House Speaker Jason White, a Republican, has been one of the state’s most vocal proponents of mobile sports betting. He has indicated that his caucus will again push to legalize online betting during the 2026 legislative session.
Durkin said if Mississippi does legalize online betting, the legislation should include funding for addiction treatment paid for with a tax on gambling companies. Several states, such as Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, allocate tax revenues collected through gambling to addiction resources.  
“They should consider modelling our state after what other states have done and include in their legislation money to attend to these problems,” Durkin said. “They need to tax the people who are causing the problems to fund fixing them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08065906/Online-Gaming-2.jpg,,,2025-08-11 06:58:12.367055

At some point, most will be released.
The question for crime victims, people behind bars and the families of both is when.
How that question gets answered is at the heart of a working group created by Gov. Mike Kehoe earlier this year to examine Missouri’s parole system to bring “clarity, transparency and accountability” to the process. 
The deadline for the 15-member panel to complete its work is Oct. 1.
At the panel’s one and only public hearing June 13, Tony Helfrecht, the chairman of the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole, called the panel a “once-in-a-decade opportunity” that would overhaul supervision for paroled people with increased accountability “with the goal of safeguarding public safety while promoting successful reintegration, reintroduction and reducing recidivism.” 
Missouri math: How a 23-year sentence adds up to more than 40 years in prison

Helfrecht, who is leading the working group, and department Director Trevor Foley, who is vice-chair, declined a request for interviews until the report is complete. Six other members are corrections department employees or members of the state parole board, and five represent the judiciary and law enforcement. 
Only two members were previously incarcerated. 
Prisoner advocates worry the working group is stacked with Department of Corrections employees and law enforcement, and that will result in stricter rules and delayed releases.
“I have some serious concerns that the intent of the governor’s order is not going to be met and that this is going to be lip service when it’s such a wonderful opportunity to bring clarity to a process that provides release to so many people in Missouri,” said Amy Malinowski, co-director of the Missouri office of the MacArthur Justice Center, a non-profit that advocates on behalf of people involved in the criminal justice system. 
One area advocates hope the group addresses is the parole board’s reinterpretation of the minimum time that must be served for some offenses. While state statute sets some minimums, such as for repeat offenders or particularly heinous crimes, the board has wide latitude in state law to set percentages of time for particular levels of crime, or to change them by rule or policy decisions.
The Division of Probation and Parole is part of the state corrections department but independent in many ways. It was sued in 2019 for the new way it has applied a policy — in place since 1985 — that incarcerated people must serve at least 15 years on any life sentence that is eligible for parole.
The change that prompted the ultimately unsuccessful court challenges pushed the parole dates for hundreds of incarcerated Missourians years — in some cases a decade — into the future. 
Kent Gipson, a Kansas City attorney who represents several incarcerated people in appeals, said the change was unnecessary.
“If a guy’s shown he’s a worthy candidate for parole and he’s done 28 years, and he’s 50, or however old he probably is, what’s the point in keeping him another 15 years?” said Kent Gipson, Dunn’s attorney. “It’s stupid.”
The 2019 change was a topic of discussion at the working group’s brief June 13 public hearing, where only three people testified during the 25 minutes  meeting. In addition to the questions about how eligibility is calculated, issues identified in testimony are:

Boilerplate language on forms delivering parole board decisions that give no details on the reasons for denials.
Lengthy delays between parole being granted at a hearing and the actual release. Current rules allow the hearings to be held four months prior to potential release, but until recently, those hearings were up to two years in advance of release.
Unwillingness of the parole board to use its discretion to convert consecutive sentences to concurrent sentences in eligible cases.

“When we give people a chance to reunite with their families and communities in a timely manner, we reinforce public safety,” Clifton Davis of the Missouri Justice Coalition told the working group. “We do not weaken it.”
There will be no more public hearings because the working group is under a tight deadline, Pojmann said. Instead, she said, written comments are being accepted.
 Boilerplate language

When a person in a Missouri prison has a parole hearing, the board’s decision is delivered on a one-page form.
There are eight lines where an X indicates the decision, whether it is to deny and reschedule, set a release date or other action. At the bottom, there are 12 lines where reasons for the decision are given.
Many times, when parole is denied, the only reason provided is that “release at this time would depreciate the seriousness of the present offense…” 
The parole board should give more details, especially to tell the incarcerated person what they should do to mitigate the concerns listed, said Courtney Everett, coordinator of the St. Louis University Prison Education Program.
 This form, given to incarcerated people in the Missouri Department of Corrections after a parole hearing (screenshot).
Everett, along with Stacey Lannert, founder of Healing Sisters, is one of the two working group members who have served time in a Missouri prison. He was sentenced to 22 years for assault in 2004 and was released in 2021. 
When time came for his parole hearing, he said it seemed formulaic. He was approaching his conditional release date, when he had to be released barring a reason to deny it.
“They really didn’t ask me questions,” he said. “It was like, ‘Where are you going, who are you going to live with?’ It was like 10 minutes. I didn’t say anything. But at the same time, these are the people who control whether a person is being released from prison. And sometimes you don’t know what they’re thinking.”
When denying parole, Malinowski said, the board should be required to give concrete, detailed reasons.
“The board should be required to explain the basis for their decision, cite the evidence they relied upon, and then explain what that person can do to better prepare themselves for release,” she said. “It’s not individualized other than the offender’s name and number changing on the form.”
The working group should mandate the change, Davis told them at the hearing.
“When individuals meet all conditions and have clear plans for success, they deserve more than a form letter,” he said. “They deserve a response that recognizes who they are.”
 Parole particulars

How much time any person eligible for parole spends behind bars is determined in part by the classification of their offense in statute, as well their history of felony sentences. The harshest punishment, and the only one where no release is possible, is for first-degree murder.
Determining an individual’s earliest parole date is a calculation based partly in statute and partly in regulation. Basic eligibility is determined by the rules.
The minimum wait for parole eligibility is 15% of a sentence for the lowest-level felonies. 
The percentage escalates as the classification of felony goes up the scale. For any felony that is a sexual or violent offense, or involves abuse of a child, regardless of classification, regulations require 33% of the sentence be served before parole eligibility.
Statutes set minimum time before parole eligibility for anyone previously placed in the custody of the department. That can be up to 80% of their sentence, depending on the number of previous terms in prison. 
There are 25 offenses where the person sentenced to prison must serve 85% of their time before what is called conditional release. All prisoners have a conditional release period of up to five years at the end of their sentence where they are supervised until their term is completed.

The parole board does have some discretion, though advocates say it rarely exercises that discretion. It’s a scenario the working group was urged to address in its report to the governor. 
One area in particular that was highlighted to the working group is the board’s ability to convert consecutive life without parole sentences for crimes committed by juveniles into concurrent sentences.
Missouri law allows the parole board to consider paroling people who committed offenses with long terms as juveniles when they have served 15 years. But the board rarely uses its discretion,  Davis said.
“This isn’t about giving people a free pass,” he said. “It’s about recognizing that the law has already provided a mechanism to evaluate whether continuing consecutive time still serves the purpose of justice.”
The board also rarely uses its power to grant medical paroles for people near the end of their lives.
The MacArthur Justice Center sued the department to secure the release of Walter Hunter, who was serving multiple life sentences and was dying of liver cancer. The effort was unsuccessful and he died in 2017 at the South Central Correctional Center in Licking.
“I remember visiting with him, and he was in a wheelchair and was jaundiced and very swollen belly,” Malinowski said in an interview with The Independent. “And I got to know his sister very well, and all that he wanted was to be able to die with her.”
 Transparency

The working group is limited in what it can do because its directive is to examine the regulations governing the parole process, Pojmann said, not sentencing statutes or any other law.
But there are steps that could increase transparency and assure the public that each case is being considered on its merits, Malinowski said.
“They’re just too closed to provide any sort of comfort to the public that they’re doing their job well, making reasonable and evidence-based decisions and giving people a fair shot,” Malinowski said.
Some states televise their parole hearings, Everett said. That helps maintain a serious attitude and brings clarity to the individual issues the board must consider.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to a more transparent system is the anonymity the current process gives to decision-makers, he said.
“A lot of times, they’re looking for reasons to keep people incarcerated, to protect their own interest, their own conscience, or, sometimes, to protect their own careers.” Everett said. “Because if you’re the public official that lets somebody out of prison, you’re less likely to get voted in.”
One goal, Boone County Circuit Judge Brouck Jacobs, a member of the working group, said in an interview with The Independent, should be more certainty for crime victims, defendants and the public when a sentence is handed down.
Only someone familiar with the rules and laws governing parole would be able to estimate how factors such as the severity of the crime, the person’s history of incarceration and the age of the offender determine a release date. It should be clear to everyone in the courtroom what a sentence means, Jacobs said. 
“They think somebody’s got seven years for breaking into their home, a burglary,” Jacobs said, “and then I think they’re shocked and chagrined when the person’s out in a year-and-a-half.”

(KCTCS photo) About two-thirds of Kentucky community college students surveyed last year say they have experienced depression or anxiety while 1 in 5 reported engaging in “self-injurious behavior.”
In response, the Kentucky Community and Technical College System is launching a Mental Health Strategy for its roughly 100,000 students.
KCTCS President Ryan Quarles told the Lantern that since taking on his role in 2023, he’s sought to prioritize mental health.
“We know that …. half of all community college students across the country struggle with mental health issues, and the report that we see here clearly shows that Kentucky is higher than national averages,” he said. “So, we still have to learn from other states, but the need is very severe right now.” 
  Ryan Quarles (KCTCS photo)
The largest provider of postsecondary education in the state, KCTCS will educate employees and students about mental health, create a centralized document full of mental health resources for the whole system, develop a peer wellness program in which students can volunteer as mental health ambassadors for those around them, provide staff with trainings on how to spot depression and anxiety in their students and more. 
This comes in response to a 2024 Healthy Minds Study that showed that in the KCTCS system, 68% of surveyed students had depression and 66% had anxiety. That survey also showed 13% of students who took the survey were at risk of an eating disorder and 20% had already engaged in “self-injurious behavior.” 
“We know that our students are facing (a) heightened degree of mental health issues that, probably, previous generations have not faced or is undiagnosed,” Quarles said. 
Stressors facing students are numerous, he said: financial and housing concerns, food insecurity, upheaval following back-to-back floods in Eastern Kentucky, decimation by tornadoes in West and Western Kentucky and more. 
Mental health challenges already existed prior to the global pandemic that hit Kentucky in 2020, but “COVID peeled the onion peel off to show how big of an issue this is,” Quarles said. 
In 2022 the World Health Organization pointed to “unprecedented stress” during COVID-induced isolation as a key stressor driving worsening mental health. Children who switched to remote schooling also missed social milestones during that time. 
KCTCS plans to apply for grant funding to support the mental health efforts, but for now it comes out of the general budget. It’s too soon to say if the system will ask the General Assembly for project-specific funding in 2026, Quarles said. 
“I do think that our legislators are aware of the mental health issues of our students,” he said, “and I think it’s come to them both from their constituents … but also higher ed in general is talking more about this, deservedly so, across the state.”

Christopher Hetherington, executive director of strategic enrollment management at KCTCS, said more and more college students have faced mental health issues over the last two decades, and research is finally revealing the extent of the problem. 
“You’ve got the social media, you’ve got the constant, 24-hour news cycle,” he said. “You’ve got financial concerns, currently, within higher education.” 
Students also face concerns over where to get enough food — and a large percentage wouldn’t be able to easily get $500 in an emergency, Hetherington said. 
“Now that we have more resources, as far as data is concerned, we have  a more clear calling to do this work than maybe would have been 10, 15, 20 years ago,” he said. 
The Healthy Minds Study 
The Healthy Minds Study, which involved 2,500 students between Feb. 26 to March 18, 2024, presented KCTCS with a call to action: better address students’ mental health needs. 
The study showed, among other things: 

86% of respondents described their financial situation as stressful.
40% reported having moderate to severe depression with another 27% at mild. 
38% reported having moderate to severe anxiety, with another 29% at mild. 
29% of respondents felt isolated from others often, and another 36% felt that way some of the time.
72% reported that in the four weeks before being surveyed, they experienced some level of academic impairment caused by their emotional or mental difficulties. 
Among students screening positive for anxiety or depression, 27% received therapy.
23% of respondents reported that in the 12 months prior to being surveyed, they were worried about not having stable housing.
15% of respondents reported worrying about losing their steady place to live in the future and 2% reported not having a steady place to live at all.
45% of respondents were worried about not having enough food in the past year.

Quarles said this data demonstrates “a serious issue” in Kentucky. 
“I think that we always knew that mental health was an issue in America, but I think that during and post COVID, it only revealed how big of a crisis it is,” he said. “And it’s not just unique to higher ed. It’s in K-12. It’s in workplace environments. It’s in adult populations. We know that this is a national crisis right now.” 
Investments in mental health, Quarles said, should be viewed on the same level as any other type of student support. Prioritizing that, he said, will help students succeed in the long run. 
“A healthier society is going to create a healthier economy as well, meaning that students will be better prepared to finish their degree, finish their certificate and be more prepared to enter the job market and be able to fulfill the expectations that an employer may have,” he said. “And that, ultimately, increases the economic prosperity of the state as well.”
‘Nursing school is really hard:’ the pressures of being a student 
  Charlotte Boyd and her dog, Ted. (Photo provided)
Charlotte Boyd, who attended Jefferson Community and Technical College from 2019 to 2022 before transferring to Spalding University, believes such a mental health initiative would have helped her. 
Boyd, who studied nursing, suffered panic attacks, found virtual learning during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic to be “frustrating” and didn’t feel properly supported during an intensely stressful time of her life. 
“Nursing school is really hard,” she said. “I’m not an anxious person in general, but I had to have a pretty full cardiac workup when I was at JCTC in the nursing program to make sure I wasn’t having cardiac issues. And I wasn’t. I was having … panic attacks. It was really, really horrible.” 
Boyd is now working as a labor and delivery nurse at Norton Healthcare in Louisville.  
Wendy Johnson, who attended Southcentral Kentucky Community and Technical College from 2006–2009 for respiratory therapy, faced mild stressors during her time as a student. She was the first person in her family to go to college and was often the oldest person in her classes, having started at age 31. That was “a little bit stressful,” she said. She also had two children, 11 and 7 years old. 
Johnson, who lives in Scottsville and now works across the border in Tennessee, looked at school differently than some of her peers. She was a dental assistant and originally wanted to study dental hygiene. 
“‘You’re going to give yourself a raise right here, and you’re going to have a good career,’” she told herself. Because she started school with children, studying was difficult at times. 
“I would have to stay up late or … try to do things before the kids got home from school,” she recalled. 
Still, she managed to earn a 4.0 grade point average and received an excellence award.
“At 18 years old,’ she said, “I don’t feel like I would have done as well.”

‘Get it right.’ 
KCTCS plans to do more surveys of students and monitor what works to improve mental health, Hetherington said. 
In community college, there’s also a smaller window to help than at four-year universities, he said. “Our students are gone in a year or two.” 
Each  of the system’s 16 colleges will also have freedom to customize its mental health approach since each campus population will have different needs. 
“We’re very aware that … there tends to be more reluctance in rural areas for people to talk about mental health,” Quarles said. “We also know that perhaps in the more urban areas, there may be more resources or organizations addressing mental health as well. And so there’s going to be some nuances across the state, and this is also an opportunity for us to learn from each other.” 
At the spring graduation ceremonies, KCTCS colleges awarded around 10,546 associate degrees, 1,716 diplomas and 31,062 certificates. 
“We’re the entry point for the vast majority of Kentuckians starting college, and so it’s very important for us to address mental health needs of our students, because for a lot of our students, if they don’t have a good experience with us, they may never make it to that four-year university, or may never get that skill or trade to get a job,” Quarles said. “So it’s important for us to get it right.”

Carefully assess the actions of Missouri’s governor, Republican members of the state legislature and our Congressional delegation. Then ask yourself: Whose priorities, interests and concerns have they supported, fought for and voted for?


Certainly not those of most Missourians.


Missourians voted for candidates in various elective offices to represent and fight for their interests in Jefferson City and Washington, D.C.


Instead, many of the Republican elected officials seem to have forgotten and folded to the pressure of supporting and carrying out the agenda of the Trump administration, whether it is in the best interest and well-being of Missouri citizens or not.


Look at the behavior of Missouri senators and representatives in Congress. While some bothered to proclaim that Medicaid should not be cut, at the end of the posturing they all went along with approving the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”


Essentially voting for the cuts in Medicaid funding that will deny tens of thousands of Missourians life-saving services. How many rural hospitals will be affected or forced to close in the coming months and years because of these cuts?


Their actions, or failures to act, are disturbing and disconcerting.


How is it that members of the Missouri congressional delegation can get away with the abdication of carrying out their governance and oversight responsibilities?


When it comes to allowing the Trump administration to usurp Congress’s power and arbitrarily disrupt, disband and defund departments that will negatively impact Missourians. First it was the department of education that was the target, cutting needed funding for school districts.


The most recent is the proposal to decentralize the department of agriculture. Will these changes hurt Missouri farmers, causing them to lose necessary funding and programmatic support? What are the positions of members of the Missouri Congressional delegation?


Our representatives in Congress have been silent and given tacit support to other actions of the Trump administration.


When it comes to the impact of increased tariffs on farmers being able to export their soybeans and other produce, and the higher cost of consumer goods across the board for families already struggling to make ends meet.


When it comes to immigration tactics that disrupt business operations, the workforce in agricultural industries and the lives of innocent family members.


When it comes to the short and long-term effects of taxation policies and the national debt, the burden of which Missourians like all Americans must bear.


When there is no oversight, no checks and balanced guardrails, how can we be confident that the policies and decisions being made will be in our best interest?


The actions of our Republican governor, Republican-controlled state legislature and other government offices are in lock-step with the Trump administration as well.


An executive order adopted and ensured the implementation of dismantling DEI programs throughout governmental departments and agencies, colleges and universities, and wherever the state had authority to issue a mandate. Businesses have been sued by the state attorney general for apparent noncompliance.


What measures are being implemented to ensure that all Missourians are treated equal and have equal access and equal opportunity? A state with a diverse population base, who is helped or hurt?


Republican state legislators in the Senate and House wrote letters urging the Missouri U.S. Senators to pass the “Big Beautiful Bill” irrespective of the negative impacts on their constituents.


The latest influence of President Trump on what goes on in Missouri is his request for the legislature to draw a new mapto eliminate one of the two Democratic congressional districts to help ensure that the Republicans maintain the majority in the House after the 2026 midterm elections.


Such a move, if successful, would eliminate the congressional district that represents Kansas City and some adjacent counties, thereby diminishing or negating the impact the representation and vote of a large number of constituents, including large minority groups.


The Republican governor and Republican-dominated legislature are seriously considering calling a special legislative session to make President Trump’s wishes happen.


Congressional districts are usually revisited or redrawn following the U.S. Census taken every 10 years that tracks population shifts and other changes. Redrawing districts mid-cycle or in an off year is solely to provide a political advantage for one party or the other.


Missouri has six Republican and two Democratic Congressional districts.


Every Missourians should think about the meaning of the political move to change that to 7 to 1.


Fundamentally, elected officials, irrespective of their party affiliations, should represent all constituents living within their electoral boundaries despite the racial and ethnic make-up or how they may have voted.


Likewise, representative government means just that. It should represent, as best as possible, all the people it governs.


As there is growing disapproval of President Trump and many of his policies by most recent polls, why are Republican state leaders continuing to bow to the pressure of jumping on an increasingly unpopular Trump agenda?


It behooves each of us to ask a critical question.


Who, among our state Republican elected officials, is standing steadfast to promote, protect and put the priorities of Missourians first amid this national political morass?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/donaldtrumpfeb112025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 05:56:32.412755

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Public school enrollment continues to fall

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Photo provided by Humanities North Dakota)North Dakota Humanities says its financial future looks more stable after a federal judge indicated the executive branch was wrong to cancel two years of nationwide humanities grants.
The National Endowment for the Humanities was created by Congress in 1965 to support civics, arts and cultural education across the country. A total of 56 humanities councils, including Humanities North Dakota, rely on the agency for money.
Those humanities councils were dealt a significant blow after the federal government in early April walked back hundreds of millions in grant funding earmarked for them by Congress for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years, according to court records. The National Endowment for the Humanities at the time said it was “repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”
North Dakota Humanities in April said it stood to lose $600,000 in grant money it received for fiscal year 2024 because of the funding cuts. The organization later received $300,000 in private donations to keep its doors open, though it said it still would have to pare down its programming in light of the grant cancellation.
Humanities North Dakota in limbo after loss of federal funding

Oregon U.S. District Judge Michael Simon in a Wednesday order wrote that the executive branch’s decision to defund humanities councils is unlawful and will likely be overturned at a later date. Simon’s order doesn’t reinstate any of the grant money, but it does temporarily prevent the federal government from spending it elsewhere, according to the Federation of State Humanities Councils. 
“With the court’s decision, we’ll begin the process of resuming paused initiatives, reconnecting with community partners, and making responsible financial decisions that reflect both the uncertainty of the past few months and our long-term commitments,” said Brenna Gerhardt, executive director of Humanities North Dakota.
The grant cancellations were one of the many program purges carried out by executive branch agencies at the request of the Department of Government Efficiency. In addition to the funding cuts, the National Endowment for the Humanities this spring laid off roughly 65% of its staff, according to Simon’s order.
Simon’s decision came in a lawsuit against the Department of Government Efficiency and the National Endowment for the Humanities brought by the Federation of State Humanities Councils and one of its members, Oregon Humanities.
In their complaint, the plaintiffs allege the federal government canceled the funding “with no reasoned analysis and with total disregard for the Congressionally mandated role of councils: to ensure that humanities programs reach every part of the United States.”
The National Endowment for the Humanities has said that the grants were pulled because they were identified as promoting subjects like diversity, equity and inclusion, disability accommodation and environmental justice, which President Donald Trump pledged to eliminate in an executive order adopted earlier this year.
Simon said this flies in the face of how Congress wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities to use the grant money. Federal law directs the federal agency to support programs that “reflect the diversity and richness of our American cultural heritage” and “give particular regard to scholars, and educational and cultural institutions, that have traditionally been underrepresented.”
The funding cuts have disrupted funding for causes including an Indigenous language preservation program in Alaska, an end-of-life care department for an Ohio children’s hospital and rural libraries in Oregon, Simon noted in his order.
“From the largest cities to the most rural communities throughout our nation, humanities funding came to a screeching halt,” he wrote.
Phoebe Stein, president of the Federation of State Humanities Councils, in a Wednesday statement applauded Simon’s decision but noted that it still leaves humanities councils underfunded for the time being.
“Many have already laid off staff and canceled vital programs as a result,” Stein said in the announcement.
The National Endowment for the Humanities has argued in court documents that federal regulations allow them to terminate grants at will if they conclude that a grant does not further agency priorities.

President Donald Trump’s phaseout of clean energy tax credits will make solar and wind projects more expensive, but some states are still committed to clean energy mandates. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.




We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it.


– Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce



“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
Tax credits axed
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
A slower, costlier transition
Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)“Enough is enough,” Jason Woodby said in a crowd of Chesterfield residents at the Department of Environmental Quality’s Aug. 7 informational meeting for a new Dominion Energy gas plant air permit. The utility has said the new plant is necessary to help meet the state’s soaring energy demands. 
Over a hundred community members showed up to the meeting in red shirts to decry the proposed peaker gas plant that Dominion wants to build in their backyard. Their biggest concerns are the cumulative health impacts on the largely low-income and communities of color that surround the plant, which they say have already been breathing in coal dust for decades.
The proposed Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center (CERC), at the site of a former coal-fired plant, is only meant to run 37% of the time during peak energy demand hours. It will be able to power up in a matter of minutes to run for several hours at a time to take the strain off the regional PJM power grid during the hottest and coldest days when energy demands skyrocket.

But environmental groups believe that the company should be focusing on renewable energy as mandated by the Virginia Clean Economy Act. In case filings to the State Corporation Commission, they have proposed other ways for the company to meet energy demands, including through solar, wind, and battery storage.
“This plant is dirty and expensive. No two ways about it. Burning methane is bad for our health,” said Rachel James, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “If allowed, this plant would spew out several harmful contaminants, including fine particulate matter, which is one of the most deadly air pollutants.”
 Project background

The 1000-megawatt plant faced some permitting challenges at the original proposed location across the street, prompting Dominion to move it to the Chesterfield Power Station, just north of the Dutch Gap conservation area. The site used to be a coal-fired power station that began to be retired in 2018 and fully ended burning coal in 2023, after burning for over 70 years. The process of removing the ash from the pond on the site is still in progress.
Dominion still facing opposition to natural gas plant proposal after location change

The plant is still operational for gas production through two units that produce about 420 MW of energy. Those portions of the plant are not planned to be part of the peaker usage and will run more than the proposed 37% for the other units.
Dominion officials said this project is critical to meet the exponential growth of power demand – with Virginians expected to be using double the amount of energy they are now by the late 2030s. The CERC will be only used for peak energy demands on the hottest and coldest days of the year, according to Dominion. The plant can be fired up in about 15 minutes in order to help stabilize the grid on those high-use days, when the company gets the call from PJM that additional support for the grid will be needed.
“Our customers are using 5% more power every year, and by the late 2030s our customers will use twice as much power as they use today,” said Jeremy Slayton, a Dominion spokesperson. “…If we don’t do that, there’s going to be a power gap. Power demand will exceed power supply, and there won’t be enough energy for our customers on those hottest and coldest days of the year.”
 Environmental, health concerns

Since the coal-fired plant fully shut down two years ago, air quality has improved for the surrounding communities, according to DEQ. The CERC facility is projected to have significantly less emissions than the coal plant.
Representatives from DEQ at last week’s community meeting also stated that the proposed gas plant is much more efficient than other facilities around the country. It would not significantly raise air pollution compared to the former coal burning.
However, residents feel that since they just started to see air quality improve, they don’t want to see additional pollutants put into the air.
“It seems like Dominion and now DEQ is using the fact that there was this coal ash plant here, running for 70 years, (as) kind of a cover for introducing even more pollution to the same area.  From a community perspective, the fact that this community has been exposed to 70 years of coal pollution doesn’t justify exposing it to more pollution,” Woodby said.
DEQ uses air monitoring both inside the stacks of the plant and locally to ensure  gas plants are meeting the air quality standards. They use the ambient air monitoring to make their assessments, but community members said the monitors are too far away to get an accurate read on the impact of the Chesterfield location and should be placed on the fenceline of the facility. DEQ officials said the modeling for the plant’s emissions and reads on ambient air show the plant will be within the requirements,
Dominion has been working to meet the state’s renewable energy goals laid out in the Virginia Clean Economy Act, according to the company spokesman. The utility has stated that an estimated six methane gas plants in the state will be needed to meet the growing energy demand, on top of renewable energy, to prevent a grid collapse during hot and cold days.
“We are all in, all in on offshore wind, all in on solar. The one thing you’re dealing with renewables like offshore wind and solar, is that they are intermittent resources,” Slayton said. “So those renewables work hand in hand with natural gas to make sure we are able to meet our customers’ power demand so we can keep the lights on for our customers.”
Advocacy groups have taken to the courts over the county allowing the project to move forward with a conditional use permit from 2010 instead of the project needing to apply for a new one. The county said the location was already permitted to be a plant and additional review was not needed. Residents also took issue with the county not doing a site suitability process for the project, with regulators stating the project meets all local ordinances.
“We have determined that the area will be, unless we got something wrong, data will show that it’s going to be suitable from an air pollution perspective,” said Alison Sinclair, an air permit writer for DEQ. “That’s all we can do from the air pollution perspective…That’s why we look to the counties, because they know where everything is and what’s going on in their county.”
Chesterfield County decides to not take up zoning appeal for Dominion’s natural gas plant

Dominion held their own informational open houses about the project in the community despite not having to go through a conditional use permit process that would have required the county’s Board of Supervisors take a new vote on the zoning for the project. Advocates appealed the Chesterfield county decision to accept the old CUP permit in order to force a new vote by the supervisors, but a judge in July 2024 denied the appeal.

Dominion and the proposal’s opponents will present their cases to the SCC on Aug. 19.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs)In a sweeping policy shift that could reshape labor relations at one of the largest federal agencies, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has terminated collective bargaining agreements for most of its unionized workforce, citing a need to better serve veterans and implement long-stalled management reforms.
The decision, announced last week, follows an executive order from former President Donald Trump that excludes certain agencies from labor-management relations programs on national security grounds. 
The VA said it acted under that order to end union contracts covering hundreds of thousands of employees represented by five major labor organizations, including the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the National Association of Government Employees (NAGE), the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), National Nurses United (NNOC/NNU), and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).
The implications are particularly significant in Virginia, which is home to more than 700,000 veterans and thousands of VA employees working in hospitals, clinics, and benefits offices across the state — including major medical centers in Richmond, Hampton, and Salem. 
The commonwealth also hosts regional benefits offices and serves as headquarters for several federal unions and advocacy organizations.
While the VA will maintain agreements for approximately 4,000 police officers, firefighters and security guards — occupations exempt from the executive order — the vast majority of bargaining-unit employees across the country are now operating without formal union contracts.
The move drew swift criticism from labor groups but was celebrated by Trump allies and VA leadership as a long-overdue realignment of priorities at an agency that serves more than 9 million veterans annually.
“This decision is good news for Veterans, families, caregivers and survivors,” VA Secretary Doug Collins said in a statement. “Too often, unions that represent VA employees fight against the best interests of Veterans while protecting and rewarding bad workers. We’re making sure VA resources and employees are singularly focused on the job we were sent here to do: providing top-notch care and service to those who wore the uniform.”
VA officials said the decision will allow managers to more effectively reward high performers, hold poor performers accountable and eliminate bureaucratic hurdles to hiring and reform. 
According to the agency, more than 1,900 VA employees collectively spent over 750,000 hours on union activity during fiscal year 2024 — time that was compensated with taxpayer dollars. Some employees performing union work earned more than $200,000 annually, the VA noted.
Additionally, the agency cited the use of over 187,000 square feet of VA office and clinical space by union representatives, free of charge, as a significant cost burden. Officials said those resources — which also include union access to government phones and computer systems — should be redirected to patient care and veteran services.
The move also halts payroll deductions for union dues for most employees, a change that took effect on April 25 in compliance with the executive order.
Labor organizations say the agency is turning its back on frontline workers, many of whom are veterans themselves, and warned that terminating collective bargaining agreements will degrade working conditions and compromise patient care.
“This is a direct attack on the rights of the people who care for our nation’s veterans,” Irma Westmoreland, chair of National Nurses United, told Axios. “Without a contract, nurses fear they won’t be empowered to speak up about conditions that put our patients at risk.”
The VA contends that unions have consistently resisted efforts to modernize the agency and hold employees accountable. 
Officials noted that AFGE, NFFE and NNOC/NNU opposed the bipartisan MISSION Act, which expanded veterans’ access to private-sector care. NFFE has also supported repealing the 2017 VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which was designed to speed disciplinary action against employees and protect whistleblowers.
According to the VA, AFGE collaborated with the administration of former President Joe Biden to reinstate over 100 employees who were fired during Trump’s first term and helped secure nearly $134 million in back pay for more than 1,700 employees dismissed for alleged misconduct.
Labor advocates counter that these laws have been misused to retaliate against whistleblowers and sidestep due process protections, particularly during the Trump administration.
The action makes the VA the first federal agency to fully sever collective bargaining agreements under the Trump-era executive order, a move made possible by language exempting agencies involved in “national security” functions. 
Axios reported that the decision could affect up to 400,000 workers — roughly a quarter of the federal workforce with union protections. 
Though Biden revoked many Trump-era executive orders affecting federal workers upon taking office, this particular directive remained in place. A Trump spokesperson told Axios at the time that the action reflected the Republican’s priorities heading into the 2025 election, where he vowed to focus heavily on veterans’ issues and government accountability.
U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Virginia Democrats, criticized the move as harmful to the VA’s workforce and counterproductive to its mission. 
“The men and women who work at the VA, many of them veterans themselves, are on the front lines of making sure our nation keeps its promises to those who’ve served,” Warner said in an email Friday. 
He called the decision “shortsighted, counterproductive, and disrespectful to those who’ve worn the uniform,” warning that gutting collective bargaining rights would make it even harder for the agency to recruit and retain skilled professionals amid staffing shortages and rising demand for care. 
Kaine added that “VA employees in Virginia work tirelessly to deliver high-quality care to veterans in our communities,” and said that “diminishing their rights in the workplace will do nothing to strengthen services or improve efficiency — and those should be VA leadership’s real priorities.”
While the full impact of the VA’s action remains to be seen, labor leaders and policy analysts expect legal challenges and a new round of political fights over the balance between government efficiency and worker protections.
For now, the department insists its mission is clear.
“This is about putting veterans first,” said Collins. “And if that means upsetting union bosses who’ve been standing in the way of reform, so be it.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina Republicans attending the party’s annual fundraiser received a surprise phone call Saturday night from a previous keynote speaker — President Donald Trump.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who’s seeking re-election next year, took to the stage of the 58th annual Silver Elephant Gala and held his cellphone to the microphone so the president could speak to the crowd that twice helped elect him to the White House.
The unexpected call upstaged the main speaker for the event: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
“I will never forget your great state. South Carolina is a special state, and you’ve made it that way,” Trump told the nearly 770 Republicans in attendance.
Graham never mentioned his own campaign for a fifth term. Instead, he let Trump do the talking about his “full endorsement” of South Carolina’s senior senator.
“He’s a great guy. Every time I needed him, he was there for me, so I just won’t forget it,” Trump said on the call, earning whoops from the crowd.
“I don’t think it’s going to be a contest,” Trump added about Graham’s re-election. “I have a feeling you’re going to do very well.”
The surprise call stemmed from the golf course. Graham said he and former U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy played golf with Trump earlier in the day, though he didn’t say where.
“President Trump is an incredibly good golfer,” he said in introducing the call. “I have never played with anybody that consistent all the time.”

During the three-minute call, Trump also gave shout outs to Gov. Henry McMaster, first lady Peggy McMaster and state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick.
As Trump said goodbye and told attendees to have fun, the crowd clapped and cheered. It was the biggest applause of the night.
Trump carried 55% and 58% of the vote in South Carolina in 2016 and 2024, respectively. And even though he did not win the national race in 2020, Trump took 55% of South Carolinians’ vote that year.
The dinner, which cost donors up to $1,000 for a private pre-dinner reception, is the state party’s largest annual fundraiser. When Trump was the keynote speaker in 2023, he drew a record crowd of more than 1,300 people.
Other past headliners include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2021 and former Vice President Mike Pence in 2008, when he was an Indiana congressman. Then-Gov. Ronald Reagan was the speaker in 1967 for the inaugural Silver Elephant. Other former presidents to give the keynote address include Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.
 Candidates and endorsements

The gala came a day after former Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer suspended his bid to challenge Graham. Bauer announced his exit on social media just one month after launching his campaign.
Bauer’s departure left two Republicans in the race to unseat Graham. Paul Dans of Charleston, who attended the gala, said Graham’s Trump phone stunt “smacked of desperation.”
“It was a very bad miscue by the Graham campaign to try to force feed this endorsement to the people,” Dans, an architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, told reporters at the event.
Graham wasn’t the only 2026 candidate on stage Saturday.
Three other hopefuls “paid to sponsor for the privilege to come to address you beautiful people this evening,” McKissick announced before handing over the mic.
Attendees heard stump speeches from Attorney General Alan Wilson, who is running for governor; state Sen. Stephen Goldfinch of Murrells Inlet, who is running to replace Wilson as attorney general; and state Sen. Wes Climer of Rock Hill, who is running for Congress to replace another gubernatorial candidate, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of the 5th District.
“For those of you that are still on the fence, I just want the opportunity to earn your vote, earn your trust, to earn an opportunity to serve you as your governor,” Wilson told attendees.
Wilson, who’s in his fourth term as attorney general, was the only candidate among those who paid to speak who has an official GOP opponent for the June 2026 primaries.
So far, five Republicans have announced bids to replace McMaster, who can’t run again. Wilson was the first to hold an official launch event, though the race unofficially started soon after the November elections.
“The governor must not only be an agent of reform and change; the governor cannot be an agent of chaos,” he added.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of the coastal 1st District was the latest Republican to announce her bid, but she’s been pummeling her opponents on social media and at GOP events for months. She’s directed most of her ire at Wilson. Mace did not attend the gala.
Two other gubernatorial candidates — Lt. Gov. Pam Evette and Norman, the 5th District congressman — were there but did not address the crowd.
 ‘Know how to win’

In his main address following the campaign speeches, Youngkin invoked the fighting spirit of Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion.
He encouraged South Carolina Republicans to follow the Swamp Fox’s lead heading into the 2026 midterms that will decide whether the GOP will continue to control Congress.
“We don’t follow; we lead. And that is my challenge to all of you,” Youngkin said.
“Francis Marion showed all of us how to keep the fight alive,” he added, noting the country is gearing up to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution.
Youngkin pointed to the GOP supermajorities in both South Carolina’s House and Senate as a sign Republicans “know how to win” in the Palmetto state.
“And one of our largest missions in 2026 is to extend the majority in our House of Representatives in Washington,” he said. “That is a top priority.”
Youngkin’s election to governor in November 2021 put a Republican at the helm of the Old Dominion State for the first time in more than a decade.
“When you’re on the losing side, the consequences are dire,” Youngkin said. “When you’re on the winning side, Republicans can unleash prosperity and opportunity and lift up every South Carolinian, every Virginian, and every American. And because of those consequences, we have to continue to go to work.”
In his own race, Youngkin focused on education and tapped into parents’ anger over pandemic policies and classroom lessons in his upset win over former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who was the former Democratic National Committee chairman and chief fundraiser for the campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
His winning “parents matter” message helped fuel a GOP focus on parents’ rights.
In the wake of COVID-19, Youngkin said businesses were closing.
“We saw parents shut out of their children’s lives, and they were told boldly that parents should not have a role in determining what was being taught in our schools,” he told Silver Elephant attendees Saturday. “And for nearly a decade, more people were moving out of the Commonwealth of Virginia than were moving in.
“Now, a lot of them were moving here to South Carolina,” Youngkin added to laughter from the crowd. “A lot of them are moving here to South Carolina because South Carolina still believes in common sense conservative values: faith, family, and freedom.”
As for Youngkin, his term expires in January 2026. Virigina’s constitution does not allow governors to hold consecutive terms.
There’s some speculation he could make a bid for president in 2028. No mention of that was made Saturday.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved the sale of a coal-fired electricity generator along the Ohio River. The plant is said to be one of the dirtiest in the United States, and its sale from one private equity group to another is raising concerns among environmentalists that its operations won’t become any cleaner.
The groups are heavily invested in the dirtiest forms of power generation and they spent heavily in the last election cycle. That’s raising fears among environmental groups that they’re pushing to roll back regulations in order to make their investments more valuable.
The energy regulatory commission, or FERC, on July 23 approved the sale of the General James M. Gavin Power Plant in Cheshire from Blackstone and ArcLight Capital Partners to Energy Capital Partners, a subsidiary of London-based Bridgepoint. 
All four companies are private equity firms, which pool cash from wealthy people and corporations, buy other companies and then sell all or part of them.
The firms have been accused of ruthlessly seeking profit — often by loading their purchases with debt, selling off the most valuable parts, declaring bankruptcy, and walking away. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Last year, companies owned by private equity firms made up 75 of 697 — or 11% — of all corporate bankruptcies, reported the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group. 
Most — 27 of 48 — bankruptcies involving liabilities of $500 million or more were filed by companies owned by private equity firms, the report said. 
Continued private equity ownership of Ohio’s Gavin Plant is particularly concerning to environmental groups because a 2023 analysis by the Sierra Club found it to be the deadliest in the United States. 
It estimated that due to the toxicity of its emissions and because of the direction of prevailing winds, the plant causes 224 premature deaths in the eastern United States each year.
It will also cost about $40 million to make the plant compliant with rules regarding the storage of toxic coal ash. Advocates fear that the plant’s private equity owners won’t work to make the plant cleaner.
“It is irresponsible for FERC to approve the sale of the Gavin coal plant to yet another private equity firm, (Energy Capital Partners), with so few conditions, knowing that pollution from the plant causes adverse health outcomes across the eastern U.S.,” Ryan Leitner of the Private Equity Stakeholder’s Project said in a written statement. “It is now incumbent upon ECP and its parent company, Bridgepoint, to commit to responsibly transitioning Gavin away from coal while maintaining reliability.” 
Environmental groups have been pushing for the owners of the 50-year-old, 2,600 megawatt plant to convert it to cleaner fuels or retire it altogether.
“Gavin consistently ranks as one of the worst and deadliest coal plants in the country,” Neil Waggoner of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign said in a written statement. “Continuing to operate it with no plan for transition to clean energy is irresponsible. ECP should commit to a plan to end coal burning operations at the Gavin plant.” 
Energy Capital Partners didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but it seems unlikely that it would voluntarily retire the plant. Signal Ohio reported last month that electricity prices are spiking in Ohio because of demand from the state’s booming fleet of data centers.
Private equity firms are highly invested in companies that produce or consume fossil fuels. The group Private Equity Climate Risks estimates that private equity-owned companies are responsible for 1.17 gigatons of emissions annually.
And after they spent heavily last election cycle, the administration of President Donald Trump has been removing climate rules. That presumably makes private-equity-owned fossil fuel companies more valuable.
Last month, the Trump EPA proposed to scrap the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 Endangerment Finding, which compels the agency to regulate greenhouse gases.
That’s happening after some in the private equity world supported Trump and his vice president, Ohio’s JD Vance.
Blackstone was the 10th-largest contributor to Vance’s PAC, Working for Ohio, according to OpenSecrets.com, donating $20,000 since 2019.
And Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman in May gave a crucial early endorsement of Trump.

(Photo by Bill Oxford/ Getty Images)Legislation that came out of the committee focused on local government was often criticized this past session for being frivolous at a time when Maine faced pressing budget issues and mounting health care costs. 
Amid the proposals to appoint a new state amphibian and designate a new state anthem, there was one bill that didn’t draw much attention but ended up being the second most lobbied bill in the Maine Legislature this year, with outside groups spending nearly $50,000 talking to lawmakers about the measure. 
That bill was LD 556, which prohibits municipalities from banning a particular energy source. Gov. Janet Mills signed it into law on July 1. The Republican-sponsored legislation divided members of Mills’ own party as it straddled key priorities including local control, rising costs for Maine households and environmental issues. 
Conversations with both proponents and critics of the bill highlight how constituents’ concerns over rising energy costs ultimately opened the door for a new law that some worry could hamper local efforts to phase out fossil fuels. 
“A similar bill having been defeated a couple years ago, we just weren’t expecting it to pop up again,” said Nick Janzen, director of policy and partnerships for Maine Conservation Voters, whose disclosures show a sharp uptick in lobbying activity after the group realized it was gaining momentum and had some Democratic support. 
Assistant Senate Minority Leader Matt Harrington (R-York) introduced a similar bill back in the 131st Legislature, but it was rejected by both the Maine House of Representatives and Senate. During the committee process, that bill was amended to allow towns to incentivize certain energy sources, as well as leave room for restrictions rooted in safety or zoning issues. 
How key climate, environmental bills fared in Augusta this past session

The bill that succeeded in the 132nd Legislature mirrored that amended language. Harrington called it “instrumental in showing that bipartisanship can happen in Augusta.” 
During the March 24 public hearing before the State and Local Government Committee, Harrington argued it would not only safeguard a homeowner’s ability to choose how to heat their home, but it would also aid affordable housing construction by allowing developers to choose affordable energy systems.
After passing the committee, the bill sat on the Senate’s list of unfinished business for about a month and a half. When it was finally taken up in the final days of session, the Senate voted 17-17, with one member excused, rejecting the measure. The House then voted 81-67 in support, sending it back to the upper chamber, which ultimately backed the bill by a vote of 17-16, with two members excused. 
Concerns about environment
Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) said the bill was marketed to legislators as a tool for preserving consumer choice in an energy market where costs are high. But he also said there was some complacency in his caucus because the bill had been “beaten over and over again.”
“Had we sought to explain to people in our caucus earlier that this was incredibly dangerous, had we flagged this months ahead of time and understood that there was an actual threat of this passing, I think perhaps maybe we could have fended it off this time,” Ankeles said. 
On the House floor, Ankeles said he feared LD 556 would be “one of the more environmentally unfriendly bills” sent to the governor’s desk this year. He told Maine Morning Star he stands by those comments and believes it is a “terrible bill.”
Environmental groups were also caught on the back foot. 
The Environmental Priorities Coalition, a statewide alliance of 39 conservation, climate action, and public health organizations, designated the previous iteration of the bill a priority in the 131st Legislature. But Janzen said because that bill had been defeated by a safe margin in both chambers, the bill wasn’t on the coalition’s radar in December when it selected what bills to hone in on this session. 
However, after the public hearing, Maine Conservation Voters spent significant time lobbying against the bill because Janzen said it blocks local communities from achieving clean energy goals and protects fossil fuel infrastructure. 
“Under the cloak of words like ‘choice’ and ‘freedom,’ [LD 556] puts the state’s thumb on the scale for the fossil fuel industry, despite common knowledge that it contributes to climate change, poor health outcomes, air pollution, rising ocean temperature, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and more,” said former Director of Government Affairs Cathy Breen in her testimony to the committee.

Multiple House Democrats who opposed the bill also expressed fears that it would block environmental progress. Rep. Sue Salisbury of Westbrook, who co-chairs the local government committee, said on the floor it “hamstrings Maine’s climate response,” while Rep. Sophie Warren of Scarborough said the bill was “propped up and fueled by the fossil fuel industry.”
Heating oil and propane companies, including Dead River Company and Maritime Energy, testified in support of the bill. 
Also, at the same time environmental groups like Maine Conservation Voters were frantically reaching out to lawmakers about the legislation, fossil fuel interests were also throwing money behind the bill. 
Megan Diver, a lobbyist for Maine Energy Marketers Association, which represents heating oil, propane, biofuels and motor fuels sellers, submitted five reports where she records some level of compensation (less than $1,000) for lobbying on LD 556. The disclosures also show the organization spent almost $50,000 on what is described as grassroots lobbying, spending $27,500 on social media and website design and $20,495 in targeted texts and calls to action. 
The law’s passage was also celebrated by the National Propane Gas Association.
Maine has historically been highly dependent on heating oil, but that has been declining in recent years. In 2010, seven in 10 homes used heating oil. That dropped to just over half of homes in 2023, according to a news release from Mills’ office last October attributing some of that decrease to the state’s effort to transition people to electric heat pumps. 
Proponents of the bill countered those concerns by pointing out that the now-law won’t restrict a town from incentivizing a particular energy source, including heat pumps, solar or other renewables. 
However, Janzen argued towns don’t have the financial ability to offer effective incentives like tax credits or rebates that exist on the state level. 
While there weren’t examples cited during committee meetings or in interviews with Maine Morning Star of specific Maine towns actively seeking to ban an energy source for heating purposes, bill supporters pointed to the climate action plan for Portland and South Portland, which says those communities are looking for ways to eliminate the use of fossil fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
A question of local control
But environmental issues weren’t the only factor for lawmakers. There was also debate as to whether this decision should lie with local or state officials. 
Maine has been a “home rule” state since 1969, when an amendment was added to the state constitution that gave towns and cities broad power to create their own ordinances. Home rule allows residents more control over what their individual communities look like.
That authority is the reason why the Maine Municipal Association, which offers professional services to municipalities and local governments, opposed the bill, said Director of Advocacy and Communications Kate Dufour. Though the Legislature is allowed to prohibit certain action from municipal governments, Dufour said her organization felt this legislation would erode local control.
“We presented our thoughts with respect to home rule authority and the ability of the residents of the state of Maine to make decisions that suit their needs and unfortunately, that message did not prevail,” Dufour said.
The bill’s lobbying report mentions a couple lawmakers that the group spoke with directly, both of whom Dufour said are current municipal officials. Dufour said it’s not uncommon for the organization to participate in the legislative process to provide a municipal perspective.










We presented our thoughts with respect to home rule authority and the ability of the residents of the state of Maine to make decisions that suit their needs and unfortunately, that message did not prevail.


– Kate Dufour, Maine Municipal Association


Harrington said many legislators were hung up on the idea of this bill being a local control issue, but he sees it as “the ultimate local control,” because it ensures that homeowners aren’t being told how they can or can’t heat their homes.
He also noted that the Legislature passed other bills limiting local authority, including LD 731, which prohibits municipalities from barring homeless shelters, but maintains their ability to regulate those facilities. 
Since Republicans often defer to local control when making policy decisions in Augusta, Rep. Ann Matlack (D-St. George), who opposed the bill, said on the House floor it’s ironic that the other side of the aisle is “anti-home rule” on this issue.
Ankeles described the legislation as a “blunt instrument” that gives veto power over local energy policies to the fossil fuel industry.
Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot), who co-sponsored the legislation, believes local control is important on some issues, but said in this case he felt the public interest outweighed that authority. He argued that this sort of policy isn’t unprecedented, pointing to a statute that says municipalities can’t ban solar on residential property.
Additionally, the new law avoids a patchwork of more than 400 different energy policies across the state. Baldacci argued that uniformity could help stabilize energy prices for Mainers.
Why now?
While lawmakers couldn’t point to one factor that made the legislation successful this time around, energy prices were a throughline. 
Energy prices in Maine have increased in recent years for a variety of reasons, such as increased recovery costs from the series of winter storms that ravaged the state two years ago. But the biggest factor has been the volatility of electricity supply prices, in particular natural gas, said Phil Bartlett, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission. 
Data from the Office of Public Advocate show that residential customers’ bills increased by 20.7% in Central Maine Power territory and nearly 12% in the Versant Bangor Hydro district between June 2024 and June 2025. There was also a 15% increase for residential customers in the Versant Maine Public District, which is in the northern part of the state. 
Harrington pointed to the law’s ability to preserve energy choice at a time when the cost of heating homes is so front of mind for people. Hearing about that from their constituents probably influenced lawmakers when voting on this bill. 
“Full autonomy was the real nexus of the bill,” he told Maine Morning Star. 
Baldacci, who co-chairs the State and Local Government Committee, attributed its passage to “sound policy and luck.” 
Baldacci said his argument to his Democratic colleagues was that low- and middle-income residents are the ones who could be most hurt by policies like a ban on propane because they are least able to make those adjustments.
Once the bill got to Mills’ desk, it was unlikely to receive a veto, due to an energy choice pledge she signed when running for reelection in 2022. 
Maine Energy Marketers Association, which has been working on this issue for several years, had asked candidates running for state and federal office in 2022 and 2024 to sign a pledge promising to support legislation that preserved a Mainer’s ability to choose how to heat their homes, explained President and Chief Executive Officer Charlie Summers.
Summer also said a large portion of state legislators also signed the pledge during the 2024 election cycle. Baldacci, along with Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), participated in the campaign last year. 
Summers, whose organization had spent thousands of dollars texting voters about the legislation, said the bill’s success this year could be attributed to the time it can take legislators to become educated about a bill or issue. 
Summers said in addition to protecting a Mainer’s ability to choose how to heat their home, the new law also prevents a household that may use a mix of natural gas, wood heat or some other heating mechanisms in long Maine winters from relying on one source of energy.
“It doesn’t allow for all our eggs to be put in one basket,” he said.

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.











This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida



Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
States stiffen penalties for fentanyl, despite public health concerns

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
As Kratom Use Surges, Some States Enact Bans

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Brian Kemp's decision to back Derek Dooley in the GOP primary in next year's U.S. Senate race in Georgia is conjuring up memories of the governor's decision to appoint Kelly Loeffler to the Senate in 2019. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder (2020 file photo)Stop me if you’ve heard this story before.
Gov. Brian Kemp needs a U.S. Senate candidate. He promises to work with the White House toward a candidate both he and President Donald Trump can get behind. The governor then decides to go his own route and throws his full support behind a little-known candidate. His pick frustrates the White House and divides the Republican base ahead of a pivotal race.
By backing Derek Dooley for U.S. Senate, the governor is again finding himself on a collision course with the White House as he hedges his bets on a blank-slate candidate.
Kemp, who was his party’s dream challenger to take on Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff before ultimately declining to run, had committed to working with Trump’s team toward finding a consensus candidate. The governor told donors to keep their “powder dry” and made several trips to Washington to discuss the race with the White House and Senate Republicans.
But over the summer, word began spreading that Dooley was weighing a bid with Kemp’s support. A former coach at Tennessee and the son of Georgia coaching giant Vince Dooley, Derek Dooley began lining up a team that included many of the governor’s top advisers.
Kemp even called other candidates to tell them that he would not be supporting their campaigns as he works to boost his longtime friend. While he was able to nudge Insurance Commissioner John King out of the race, his involvement appears to have not only “p—-d off” the president’s inner circle but emboldened other candidates: U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-St. Simons Island) said he wasn’t going anywhere, and U.S. Rep. Mike Collins (R-Jackson) announced his own bid the next week.
Both Collins and Carter are competing for the MAGA lane in a primary almost certain to be dominated by Trump and his supporters, while Dooley works to prove himself as a reliable conservative who can bridge the divide between the party’s two factions.
It’s an eerily familiar situation for Kemp, who found himself in a nearly identical situation in 2019 after the resignation of longtime U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson. Despite being urged by the White House and conservative activists to appoint a more Trump-aligned figure, Kemp went his own route and appointed businesswoman and Republican donor Kelly Loeffler.
Loeffler tried to make inroads with the president’s supporters, but doubts about her conservative credentials — and tenuous ties to Georgia — seemed to follow her wherever she went. And U.S. Rep. Doug Collins (not related to Mike Collins), who was Trump’s preferred choice for the coveted appointment, campaigned for the seat anyway.
The two spent most of the campaign trying to out-right one another, driving up each other’s unfavorable ratings and dividing the Republican base in the process. Loeffler ultimately finished second in the top-two primary but was then defeated by now-Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) after failing to get the party back on a winning message.
This time around, Kemp is again hedging his bets on a blank-slate Senate candidate with thin (or questionable) ties to the Peach State. Dooley’s father might be an icon in Athens, but Derek Dooley has spent the majority of his coaching career outside of Georgia.
And like Loeffler, Dooley is sure to face questions about his voting trail. He hasn’t voted in many recent elections or Republican primaries and declined to declare his affiliation in states that have party registration. His only known political footprint is a $5,500 contribution to Kemp’s campaign.
His opponents wasted no time going on the attack. Collins’ campaign mocked Dooley by sharing a video of the Volunteers’ controversial loss to the Louisiana Tigers in 2010, when the Tigers were awarded an untimed down at the end of regulation after a too-many-men penalty against Dooley’s defense.
Collins’ team shared a separate ad taking aim at Dooley with a simple but potent line of attack: “Never fights. Never wins. Never Trump.”
Carter also thinks Dooley is ill-equipped to take on the first-term Ossoff. “This is serious stuff now — I don’t want to hear about, you know, we’re just going to put this to a popularity contest. That’s not what this is,” Carter said of his rival. “You got to have somebody who can go toe to toe with this kid, and I’m that person who can go toe to toe with him.”
Democrats also plan to make Dooley’s coaching career the centerpiece of their attacks, with party chair Charlie Bailey quickly labeling him as a “failed and fired former Tennessee football coach.”
“We’ll see what’s harder for Dooley — answering for a Trump bill that strips health care for 750,000 Georgians, or remembering which SEC team to root for,” Bailey said in a statement.
So as Kemp places all his eggs in the Dooley basket, he must keep in mind that he is doing so with a lot less capital than he had when he appointed Loeffler. With just a year left in his term and no (immediate) plans to run for office again soon, he has a lot less political leverage to wield over his legislative allies, many of whom are supporting Collins and are keenly aware of which direction their party is going.
What’s clear is that this Republican infighting in what had traditionally been a red state will play right into Democrats’ hands. As the Ossoff campaign asked in an email:
“Didn’t Republicans learn their lesson the last time they tried to oust a Democratic Senator in Georgia?”

As the Trump administration ramps up deportations nationwide, a new Arkansas law requires law enforcement agencies across the state to aid federal immigration authorities.
The law, which went into effect Tuesday, requires sheriffs to apply to a program with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that trains and certifies officers to serve immigration warrants on undocumented people already being held in county jails for other reasons.
But some agencies, including the Arkansas State Police, are going much further than the new state law requires. They are signing up for a different type of partnership with ICE that allows cops to stop people on the street, question them about their immigration status and potentially arrest them for deportation proceedings.
This program, which ICE calls its “task force model,” was discontinued during the Obama administration amid lawsuits over racial profiling but revived earlier this year under Trump.
On July 7, ICE signed off on a memorandum of agreement with Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar that gives participating troopers the “power and authority to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or remain in the United States.” Troopers don’t need warrants to make these arrests “if the officer has reason to believe the alien to be arrested is in the United States in violation of law and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained,” the task force agreement says.




Cindy Murphy, an Arkansas State Police spokesperson, said Thursday that no troopers are participating in the task force program as of now. (That may be because officers are required to undergo training first. ICE’s website says task force officer nominees must “complete a 40 hour online course covering, among other things, scope of authority, immigration law, civil rights law, cross-cultural issues, liability issues, complaint procedures and obligations under federal law.”)




Once the training is complete, though, participating troopers will have the authority to make immigration-related arrests on their own, even without an ICE agent being present.
That “will be up to the discretion of the trained trooper,” Murphy said. The program is expected to eventually operate in all areas of the state.



“Arkansas State Police looks forward to working with federal immigration officials through the 287(g) program to protect Arkansans from violent, criminal illegal immigrants,” Murphy said.



Immigration violations are typically civil offenses, not criminal ones, and ICE data shows the agency has arrested an increasing number of unauthorized immigrants in recent months who don’t have criminal charges or convictions. Axios reported in July that non-criminal ICE arrests rose in Arkansas last month, drawing from federal data obtained by the UC Berkeley School of Law’s Deportation Data Project. The New York Times reported in June that the daily rate of arrests made by ICE in Arkansas had jumped by 176% between Jan. 20 and June 10 when compared to 2024.
Murphy didn’t address a question from the Arkansas Times about whether the Arkansas State Police will arrest people solely for violations of civil immigration law, even if there’s no alleged criminal offense at play. She also didn’t answer questions about how the state police will determine who to ask about their immigration status or how the agency will avoid the racial profiling concerns that dogged ICE’s task force program in the past.



The cost to the state police is expected to be “minimal,” Murphy said, “as we already have training facilities and staffing.”



Arkansas isn’t the only red state to embrace the newly revived task force model. ICE’s website shows agencies overseeing state police departments in states including Missouri, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Florida have recently signed task force agreements. ProPublica reported in June that state troopers in Tennessee have assisted with large-scale ICE operations in Nashville by pulling over drivers.
Hundreds of local law enforcement agencies around the country are also participating in the task force program as of August, including five in Arkansas: the Baxter County Sheriff’s Office, the Miller County Sheriff’s Office, the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Office, the Texarkana Police Department and the police department in Hampton, a south Arkansas town of about 1,200.
All of those agreements have been signed within the past six weeks, ICE records show.
Though Arkansas state troopers may not yet be actively participating in the task force program, community advocates say they’re already helping out with ICE operations in Northwest Arkansas, which is home to a large immigrant population. Irvin Camacho, the co-founder of a group called the Alliance for Immigrant Respect and Education, or AIRE, said organizers began noticing about three months ago that state police were stopping and arresting an increasing number of people not just on the state highways they routinely patrol, but in other places, too. There have been a number of arrests in Springdale and Rogers, he said.
“Something is happening, because we’re seeing much more state troopers on the regular streets,” Camacho said. “And a lot of the time, when we see those stops, it’s immigrant-presenting people.”
AIRE tracks ICE activity in Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley. The group recently posted a picture to social media showing two alleged plainclothes ICE agents pretending to be shopping at a store in Fort Smith shortly before they reportedly detained a female employee. AIRE posted a video this week of a man in Fort Smith being pulled out of his truck outside of his home by two alleged ICE agents; he was later released, Camacho said, after immigration officials determined the man was in the country legally.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hagar_Shue_Jones-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-11 05:56:32.412755

It’s an article of faith on the political far right that the Trump administration’s mass immigrant deportation policies will be a boon to U.S. born workers.
A new report from economists at the Economic Policy Institute, however, finds the opposite to be true and that the net impact of mass deportation on employment – both for immigrants and U.S. born workers – is decidedly negative.
Indeed, the administration’s goal of deporting one-million people per year will lead to a loss of nearly six million jobs over the coming years – more than forty percent of them held by U.S. born workers.
To understand why, consider the following: When houses don’t get built because there aren’t enough immigrant workers to roof them, there are fewer jobs for the U.S. born workers who tend to handle more skilled professions like plumbing and electrical work. Other industries will experience similar phenomena.
The bottom line: The report is entitled “Trump’s deportation agenda will destroy millions of jobs,” and it’s a must read for anyone who cares about our economy. Check it out at epi.org.

The last few weeks of summer, heading into Labor Day weekend, can sometimes mean vacations and driving more miles on the road for all people, including teens.
Traffic crashes are the No. 1 cause of death for teens, and the crash rate for teen drivers is disproportionately higher than the share of licensed teen drivers.
In addition to this grim statistic, summer is the riskiest time for teen drivers. The 100 deadliest days represent the period from Memorial Day to Labor Day when the number of fatal crashes involving teen drivers dramatically increases. A third of each year’s teen driver crashes occur during the summer.
We are scholars who research transportation safety and teen driver behavior. Our expertise helps us understand that these 100 days are not just a statistical fluke – they reflect a dangerous intersection of factors such as inexperience and a propensity to take risks.

  More time on the road means more risk for inexperienced drivers. (Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Digital Vision via Getty Images)
 What makes summer different?

Regardless of the season, some teen drivers engage in risky behaviors that increase their likelihood of a fatal crash, such as getting distracted, driving with friends in the vehicle, driving under the influence, not wearing seat belts and a lack of hazard awareness.
Teens also have more free time in the summer, since most aren’t in school. Combined with the longer days and better weather, teens drive more over the summer. More time on the road means more risk, especially for inexperienced drivers.
Teens may also be more likely to drive after dark during the summer, in comparison to more experienced drivers. But nighttime driving is also when visibility is reduced and crash risks are higher, particularly for teens who haven’t fully developed the skills necessary for night driving. This increased exposure, in addition to teens’ general risky driving tendencies, contributes to the 100 deadliest days for teen drivers.
The increased crash risk for teens over the summer isn’t equally distributed either. Crashes with teen drivers that lead to serious injuries are more likely to occur with male drivers, in rural areas, for those of lower socioeconomic status and for those with disorders, such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.

  Driver’s education programs can be effective, but not all teenagers have access to them. (Photo by Antonio Diaz/iStock via Getty Images)
 Teaching young drivers

Driver’s education programs are the formal method to teach teen drivers the rules of the road.
In driver’s education programs, teens receive information about driver and road safety though classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction in preparation for the licensing exam. Some states require teens to complete a driver’s education course if they want to receive a license under the age of 18. Of teens who have a license, nearly 80% of them have gone through some form of driver’s education.
Though driver’s education programs can be helpful, their effects are not equally felt. In some states, teens and their guardians must pay out of pocket for driver’s education courses to obtain a license. This makes driver’s education and, as a consequence, obtaining a driver’s license inequitable.
There are also driving school deserts – areas where the poverty rate is 20% or above and there are no behind-the-wheel driver education courses within a 10- to 15-minute drive. This makes driver education courses inaccessible. Many of these driving school deserts happen to be in areas with high populations of minorities.
Over 20 years ago, graduated driver licensing was introduced to reduce teen crash rates. This is a phased licensing system wherein teen drivers are restricted in terms of when, where and with whom they can drive until they turn 18. Such a system allows teens to gradually learn and gain experience with driving over time.
Graduated driver licensing has been implemented in all 50 states, and it has been shown to reduce teen driver crash rates. However, its effectiveness is limited to those who participate in the system. A large number of teens are unlicensed and are of low socioeconomic status. Many of these unlicensed teens forgo the entire process and remain unlicensed but still drive, well into their 20s when the graduated driver licensing restrictions are lifted.

 Making summer safer

There are two things people can do to turn the 100 deadliest days into the 100 safest days.
First, it is important that communities offer free supplementary training programs for teen drivers, because becoming a safe and responsible teen driver shouldn’t be limited to those with resources. As one example, in collaboration with industry partners, we have developed a program called Risk-ATTEND. It is a free, online, evidence-based program that teaches teen drivers how to anticipate risks while driving. Our research has shown that programs such as these can improve teen driving skills and may be especially effective for teen drivers in high-poverty areas.
Second, our research has shown that parents and guardians still play an important role in influencing teen driver behavior. Studies show that teens mirror the behaviors they observe: If they see adults text and drive, they’re more likely to do the same.
Once teenagers become old enough to drive, it is also important to establish rules and guidelines about expectations to establish clarity and accountability. Written agreements or checklists can address high-risk conditions such as nighttime driving, driving with other young passengers, phone use and adherence to speed limits.
Systems to help monitor and enforce rules have been shown to be effective in improving teen driver behavior. One such program is Checkpoints, which is a Connecticut-based program in which families agree to limit teen driving during high-risk conditions. Teens face consequences for violating these limits, such as a temporary loss of driving privileges. However, the limits are gradually lifted as they gain driving experience.

 More than rules matter

Ultimately, preventing crashes in the summer and beyond extends beyond mere adherence to regulations. Avoiding them fundamentally hinges on cultivating a robust safety culture that emphasizes a collective commitment to risk reduction and continuous improvement in driving practices.
For teens, the summer months present unique challenges and opportunities.
Drawing on best practices, such as training programs, teens can build essential skills in varied conditions before gaining full, unsupervised privileges.

Here, she talks during a meeting last spring. (File photo by Annmarie Timmins/New Hampshire Bulletin)Tara Ryan was only seven weeks pregnant with her first child when she secured slots on four child care waitlists. Even then, her daughter didn’t get a full-time space until she was 1.
Now expecting a son through in vitro fertilization, Ryan said the first to know about her embryo transfer was the child care center, “so that we could secure a child care spot for him” — more than a year out from when they’ll need it. The price tag to have both children at the facility is over $50,000, though they’re sitting on waitlists at two less-expensive options.
“It’s unaffordable to us,” said Ryan, of Durham, a founder of the state chapter of Chamber of Mothers, a nonprofit, grassroots group focused on issues such as parental leave, maternal health, and child care. “Like, who can afford that for child care? I just, I don’t even know who can, but we’re gonna figure it out. We have to figure it out.”
Her story is emblematic of a child care system in New Hampshire and beyond that gobbles up household incomes while providing few options for families and low wages for workers as the average provider operates on razor-thin profit margins. Amid a busy budget session, New Hampshire lawmakers directed some attention to the topic, though early care and education issues made up only a small sprinkle of bills in a sea of more than 1,100 weighed in Concord this year.
While advocates and lawmakers involved in the issues came out of the session with some wins, they felt the state had a long way to go in making a dent in addressing affordability and access. Several said New Hampshire needed to bring in more revenue to make lasting, systemic changes to the child care issues plaguing the state.
The new budget will allow additional federal dollars to be routed to the child care scholarship program, a state-federal partnership that more families have become eligible for in the last year with an expanded income cap, should the funds be needed to prevent a waitlist. 
The Legislature also greenlit a pilot program, coming in 2026, that aims to cut down on administrative burdens for the scholarship for families and providers. It would provide a presumptive eligibility period for families after an initial screening, allowing earlier access to scholarship funds while they complete the application process. 
Lawmakers also hope to use $15 million in federal dollars over two fiscal years for a child care workforce grant program, but it remains unclear whether the federal government will allow the money to be used for that purpose.
In other action, a new law will include pending charges, instead of just convictions, in criminal record checks for child care workers and dissolves the child care licensing fund into the general fund. Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican who sponsored the enacting Senate Bill 22, said the measure was requested by the state Department of Health and Human Services. 
Also this session, the Legislature rejected a bill that would’ve provided property-tax relief and school building aid to some child care agencies. 
In a statement through her office, Gov. Kelly Ayotte emphasized the action related to the scholarship program, and also highlighted $1 million that will go to the state’s community college system for creating pathways for child care workforce training. She said helping families access affordable child care was a “critical need and an important part of ensuring we remain the best in the nation for economic opportunity.”
“Looking ahead,” said Ayotte, a Republican, “we will ensure Granite Staters can continue to access child care scholarships, remove unnecessary barriers to entry for new providers, and partner with our community colleges, the private sector, and nonprofits like the Boys and Girls Club to expand child care options for our families and advance career opportunities in the child care workforce.”
Scholarship program
It costs the average family over $30,000 a year to put an infant and toddler in a child care center in New Hampshire, according to 2024 data from Child Care Aware of America.
In the last budget, lawmakers expanded eligibility for the state’s child care scholarship program to families making up to 85% of the state median income. Those in the program pay a cost-share for child care ranging from $0 to 7% of the family’s income. (For child care to be considered “affordable” by the federal government, it must take up no more than 7% of a family’s income.)
Some families who didn’t meet the income threshold last year may be newly eligible due to adjustments to the state median income this July. A family of four earning up to $124,595 and a family of three earning $104,660 may now be eligible for the scholarship, said Nicole Heller, senior policy analyst at the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research nonprofit. 
In this state budget, lawmakers focused on cutting down paperwork burdens that may have dissuaded eligible families from accessing assistance and providers from participating in the program. 
Trina Ingelfinger, the early care and education policy coordinator at New Futures, a health policy advocacy group, said her organization had heard “from both providers and families over the last year or so that overly burdensome paperwork requirements were making it difficult to access the program, and as a result, this was interfering with families’ path back to work, and we also understood that some child care providers were opting out of the program because of these issues.”
The budget establishes a two-year pilot program, starting in January 2026, that will give families who have undergone an initial screening access to the scholarship while they complete the application process. This period may be 60 days; until a final eligibility determination is made; or when a timeframe to submit necessary information and documents, determined by DHHS, has expired — whatever comes first. 
Neither child care providers nor families will be on the hook for paying back scholarship funds should it ultimately be determined a child is ineligible for the program, “except in cases of fraud or intentional violation of program rules,” the law says.
The budget also aims to reduce burdens on providers by eliminating the requirement to report hourly attendance for scholarship recipients, “to the extent that such reporting is not necessary for administrating child care scholarship payments.”
The department will write a detailed report about the results of the pilot program for agency oversight committees in the Legislature by May 1, 2028. 
The law also requires the department to, by December, implement a system that will allow providers to receive scholarship payments “in advance of or at the beginning of each payment period.”
The budget appropriates $100,000 to the department to implement these directives. It also allows the state to tap into additional Temporary Assistance for Needy Families reserve funds if they’re needed to prevent a waitlist from forming.
Sen. Denise Ricciardi, a Bedford Republican, said in a statement to the Bulletin that the law “simply makes it easier for eligible families to participate in the scholarship program and return to work.”
“Because of the safeguards in the bill, like a family screening process, the program is not expected to expand eligibility or create any new costs for the state once it is up and running,” Ricciardi said.
Historically, many families who are eligible for the program have not participated in it, but increased enrollment numbers have followed expanded eligibility. Heller pointed to April data from the state that showed the number of children using scholarships has jumped 66% since the expanded eligibility went into effect in January 2024, adding another 1,700 children to the program. 
Workforce grant uncertain, tax relief quashed
The budget directs DHHS to ask the federal government for permission to use TANF reserve funds “for the purpose of financing recruitment and retention bonus and benefit grants for New Hampshire child care employees.”
It’s not yet clear whether the federal government will approve the use of the money. 
The child care workforce in the state faces massive stressors, with high turnover and low wages. With cost-of-living adjustments, New Hampshire’s child care workers “have the second-lowest wages in the country,” according to a primer from the University of New Hampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy. (The Couch Family Foundation, which funds the New Hampshire Bulletin’s early care and education reporting position, provided support for this research.)
To put the intersecting challenges of the sector into perspective, the researchers found that “if a child care worker were to purchase center-based care for their own infant and four-year old, this expense would utilize 98.6 percent of the average New Hampshire child care worker salary.”
One possible method for cutting down costs for providers was ultimately quashed this year. Senate Bill 275, led by Dover Democratic Sen. David Watters, sought to provide property tax relief for some child care agencies, as well as allowing school building aid to be used for some pre-kindergarten programs. 
The Senate voted, 16-8, along party lines, to shoot down the legislation. Sen. Timothy Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, argued the bill was too broad and would deplete limited school building aid resources.
Watters said it became apparent, once the session was rolling, that there would be “real resistance” from his Republican colleagues on the issue. But looking ahead to the future, he said the chamber has historically been able to get “some very good things done in a very strong, unanimous, bipartisan fashion.”
“The governor campaigned on this. We all did, Republicans and Democrats,” Watters said. “We all campaigned on … housing and on child care and on energy and, you know, some other things. But you know, I mean, the very top priorities are for housing and child care.”
Looking ahead
State investments are needed to make significant changes to the child care landscape in New Hampshire, some of those involved in the issue said.
Shannon Tremblay, director of the New Hampshire Child Care Advisory Council, enacted by the Legislature in 1995, emphasized a need for the state to find revenue sources to invest in child care. She said that should include revisiting the recently eliminated interest and dividends tax, which generated tens of millions of dollars for the state each year.
“We’re rich. I mean, we’re one of the most wealthiest states, but we don’t invest that money,” Tremblay said. “And if you say the word taxes, you know, people tend to cringe, but I think that’s what it’s really going to take.”
MacKenzie Nicholson, New Hampshire’s senior director of the advocacy group MomsRising, said she wants to “see a system that actually invests in child care.” Small policy fixes that act as “little Band-Aids aren’t doing enough to cover the gaping wound that is our child care crisis right now,” she said.
“The reason that we didn’t really lose child care dollars in the budget process this year is because there is none to cut. As a state, we don’t invest in child care,” Nicholson said. “The money that comes in comes from the federal government, and so there’s no way to offset the costs for families or for providers, who ultimately are the workforce behind the workforce.”
On the issue of child care, Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, a Portsmouth Democrat and the Senate’s minority leader, said “we just continue to not do enough.” That could have serious consequences for the state, she said.
“This is a huge issue, you know, for people that want to come and build a family and live and work in New Hampshire,” Perkins Kwoka said. “The availability of child care and housing is just fundamental to them being able to move and build their lives here, and if we don’t accommodate it, they’re going to find and build their lives somewhere else.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tararyanchamberofmoms-1024x711.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 05:56:32.412755

This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra and Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th. Meet Shefali and Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics, and policy.
When there’s a maternal health emergency, Jessica Wheat springs into action.
Alongside a group of specialized health providers at Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Wheat works fast to make sure patients are able to have their babies delivered safely or their children given critical treatment at the Level III neonatal intensive care unit on site.
“We have just an abundance of resources, and people that know what they’re doing,” the labor and delivery nurse said.
That abundance is coming to an end. Last month, HCA Midwest Health, which owns Research Medical Center, announced it was closing its obstetrics program and NICU. The umbrella company that runs HCA Midwest Health, which oversees multiple hospitals and related sites of care in nearly two dozen states, cited declining births at the hospital as part of its reasons for the closure.
Wheat is worried about the implications for local patients who often struggle to find transportation even across Kansas City. But she’s also concerned about the rural patients outside of the metro area.
“We tend to get smaller hospitals that will Life Flight bleeding moms or moms who are breech or moms who are having a hypertensive crisis,” she said. “We can do the emergency C-section — a lot of smaller hospitals do not have those capabilities. The farther they have to go, the more at risk they’re going to be for complications, even death.”
The availability of obstetrics care in America has been dwindling for years. That could accelerate now, as hospital leaders across the country warn that President Donald Trump’s massive cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income Americans, could leave pregnant people in rural communities with vanishingly few options for medical care.
Obstetrics is one of the most expensive services provided by hospitals, especially in rural areas, which often see a larger portion of Medicaid patients. Nationwide, the program pays for about 40 percent of all births. With financial hits looming, hospitals are primed to close maternity wards first, and rural areas are particularly vulnerable.
“This is going to have an enormous impact,” said Dr. John Cullen, a family physician in Valdez, Alaska, a remote city of about 4,000 people. “Already we’re seeing OB deserts that are increasing in size, and after the passage of this bill those are going to be markedly worse — where people are going to have to drive hundreds of miles before they can get prenatal care, much less delivery.”
For years, hospitals facing financial pressure have shuttered maternity wards. Between 2010 and 2022, more than 500 hospitals across the country dropped obstetrics, per a recent study that also shows more than half of rural counties now have no hospital-based obstetric services. A report from the advocacy group March of Dimes found that 1 in 3 U.S. counties had no OBGYN at all.
There are numerous reasons for the recent closures, ranging from declining births to difficulties hiring local providers. But the biggest issue is financial: Hospitals typically don’t earn enough from labor and delivery to cover the cost. Now, cuts to Medicaid — which will further cut hospital revenues and increase their share of uncompensated care — threaten to strain finances further.
“I do have a lot of concern that we’ll continue to see labor and delivery units close in rural hospitals and potentially even at an accelerated rate, as hospitals feel greater strain due to cuts in the bill,” said Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association.
The National Rural Health Association and Manatt Health, a consulting firm, estimated in June that the proposed Medicaid cuts over 10 years could reach almost $70 billion just for rural hospitals. Nearly half of all children and 1 in 5 adults in rural communities are enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program. The health insurance plan also pays hospitals less for the same services than private insurance does.
“When rural hospitals say, ‘We have these big Medicaid cuts, how do we deal with that shortfall?’ the OB units are going to be first on the chopping block,” said Jamie Daw, an associate professor of health policy at Columbia University.
One analysis from the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonpartisan organization that supports policies such as equal pay and access to health care, suggests that the new cuts to Medicaid put almost 150 rural hospitals with maternity services at risk of serious downsizing or closing altogether.
The changes to Medicaid — including cumbersome new paperwork requirements for people insured through the program, and cuts to some of the taxes used to finance state Medicaid programs — largely won’t take effect until after the 2026 midterm elections. But already, hospitals are preparing for huge reductions in services, and pointing to labor and delivery as one of their most vulnerable offerings.
Michigan-based Trinity Health operates five hospitals that include maternity services. Hospital leaders are deeply concerned about service cuts that would make it harder for pregnant patients to get appropriate medical care, said Dr. Sharon O’Leary, an OBGYN and the organization’s chief data analytics and chief equity officer.
When patients have to travel further for prenatal care, they are more likely to cut the number of doctors’ visits or to receive no prenatal care at all. Studies over the past several years have shown that obstetrics unit closures — and increased travel time for pregnant patients — result in higher rates of pregnancy-related complications, including premature birth and low birth weight.
“Our biggest fear is that as women lose coverage that they will not seek prenatal care,” O’Leary said.
The consequences are likely to be heightened in areas that are already underserved, and where birth outcomes are worse: rural parts of the country, and, in particular, large swaths of the South.
“While we are concerned about the impact the bill will have on all hospital services, we are particularly concerned about its impact on labor and delivery services,” said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
Already, rural areas have seen access to reproductive care dwindling, particularly in the past three years, since the fall of Roe v. Wade allowed states to outlaw abortion. Preliminary data shows that medical residents for OBGYN are applying in smaller numbers to states with abortion bans and a recent study in the medical journal JAMA, the first to assess the relationship between abortion bans and provider availability, found that in Idaho, the number of OBGYNs fell by 35 percent between August 2022 — when the state implemented its near-total ban — and December 2024.
Abortion ban states, which are largely in the South, also have higher rural populations, worse birth outcomes, and larger shares of hospitals at risk of closure.
“It’s an additional trend — on top of this piece of the general financial pressure  — that’s going to also affect predominantly rural Southern communities,” Daw said. “It seems like a perfect storm of these concurrent trends really really affecting access to care.”
If hospitals reduce their pregnancy-related offerings, few alternatives will be able to fill in the gap. Earlier this year, the Trump administration began withholding millions of dollars in family planning grants through Title X, the federal program that supports family planning services for low-income people. Planned Parenthood, a major provider of services that include cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, and contraception, is also one of the largest Title X providers. Most Planned Parenthood clinics are in rural or otherwise medically underserved areas. The federal budget and tax law also includes a provision that would cut federal Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, though that policy has since been blocked by a federal court ruling. In recent weeks, several clinics have announced their plans to close.
“You have to think of them as related,” Daw said. “It’s definitely not helpful to have all of these changes happening at the same time and really undermining the safety net for reproductive-aged women.”
Cochran-McClain said when a provider with a background in obstetrics care leaves a rural town or city, that impacts health services more broadly: Often, that provider was also providing contraception, general gynecological care and routine screenings.
“It’s so interconnected. While we’re talking specifically about labor, delivery, and pregnancy, it can have an impact more broadly on access to women’s health in rural communities,” she said. “It’s been a rough couple of years before all of this, so it just feels like it’s a worsening trend in terms of overall access.”
The closure at Research Medical Center in Kansas City — where its obstetrics program is scheduled to close down in early September — also shows that even when a person in a rural area is forced to travel greater distances into a city setting for specialized care, those services aren’t guaranteed.
Wheat and other affected nurses at Research Medical Center, where they are represented by National Nurses United, said HCA Midwest Health has not provided enough information about the logistics of winding down services. Will the rest of the hospital, including its ICU unit, take emergency patients who need labor and delivery services? Or will the remaining staff in other areas of the hospital get specialized training?
HCA Midwest Health, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The 19th, said in a statement to a media outlet that it is working with area health providers to ensure patients have other delivery options.
Wheat has lined up another nursing job in labor and delivery with a different hospital system. In her text group chats with other impacted staff, there is a sense of sadness. She believes the obstetrics-related health providers will find other work, even if it means even more gas mileage to get to a new job. But Wheat keeps thinking about what’s to come for the patients.
“I’m emotionally exhausted. It is hard,” she said. “We’re just grieving for the community at this point, because we know they’re going to have a lot of issues after we’re gone.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pregnancyrural-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 04:56:17.480358

State Reps. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood, and Christine Cockley, D-Columbus, recently introduced Ohio House Bill 399. 
The bill would prohibit the director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources from issuing a permit that would remove oil or natural gas from under a state park or Lake Erie. 
“Protecting our environment is just a critically important thing,” Rader said. “I think protecting our public lands, conserving the space we’ve already decided should be conserved, is actually a pretty salient idea.”
“Who’s gonna want to move here?” How fracking around Ohio’s Salt Fork State Park is changing area

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law in 2023 that allowed fracking for natural gas in Ohio’s public lands and state parks. Since then, fracking has begun in Salt Fork State Park, the state’s largest state park. 
“I think the natural progression of where we’re headed next is drilling in state parks,” Rader said. “So my goal is to try to stop that at all costs. Let’s actually do what we set out to do, and preserve these lands, instead of extracting from them, farming them, destroying these habitats.”
There have been approximately 2,000 incidents associated with oil and gas wells in Ohio over the past eight years, according to FracTracker Alliance — a nonprofit that collects data on fracking pipelines. 
Ohio has 76 state parks that are managed by ODNR. 
“Our state park network is just so phenomenal,” Rader said. “We own a lot of lands as a state that’s conserved for various reasons.”
Lake Erie 
Federal law prohibits drilling in the Great Lakes and Rader said he thinks it’s important to “have some state protections to layer on top of some of these federal protections.” 
“I think redundancy, right now, when it comes to federal law is incredibly important, especially when you see an administration that is absolutely gung ho and drilling in all places, and doesn’t seem to really respect federal law very directly, and is willing to either go to court or ignore courts,” Rader said. 
Ohio Oil and Gas Association President Rob Brundrett said he is unaware of interest in drilling under Lake Erie. 
“We have not seen much interest from our members over the years to explore Lake Erie,” he said. “However, we do believe there could be a potential benefit in the exploration and production from the Great Lakes.”
Drilling in Lake Erie could pose risks to the drinking water and wildlife, including millions of walleye, Rader said.  
“Oil wells, oil drilling, (and) oil pipelines have a high risk of adding all kinds of toxins, whether it’s from the brines they use or spills that happen all too often,” he said. “I want to try my best as a human being to leave this planet better than where I found it, and part of that is keeping our lakes and streams and green spaces free of pollution.”
Environmentalists fear Lake Erie fracking, oil and gas industry says not to worry

This is not the first time a bill like this has been introduced. Former Democratic state Rep. Mike Skindell introduced a similar bill in 2023 during the last General Assembly that would have prevented fracking under Lake Erie, but the bill only received sponsor testimony. 
Rader is hopeful his bill will get a couple of hearings and maybe a vote, but as a Democratic bill in a Republican-controlled Statehouse, the cards are stacked against H.B. 399.
“Of course it’s Ohio, I’m not holding my breath,” Rader said. “But without putting the idea forward, without having the bill in, you don’t have that chance. So that’s what we’re doing.”
Protecting the planet should be a partisan issue, Rader said. 
“I think there are some folks on both sides of the aisle that think this is actually pretty important,” he said. “I think conservation is a concept that’s pretty core to conservatism, actually, as well as liberalism. It’s something that I do think we’ll get some buy in.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal / Republish photo only with original story)Ohio U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno has joined President Donald Trump in asking for tech giant Intel’s CEO to resign due to his reported ties to the Chinese government.
Moreno has also asked for a fraud investigation into Intel’s continued delays on the state’s long-awaited semiconductor manufacturing plant.
Ohio’s multi-billion-dollar semiconductor manufacturing plant has faced delay after delay after delay, and was supposed to be operational by now.
“It was an unrealistic expectation that they would be producing chips in the summer of 2025,” Dorsey Hager with the Columbus/Central Ohio Building Trades Council said last Thursday.
That’s thousands of construction jobs stalled, ones that Hager said Intel promised when they broke ground at the central Ohio construction site in 2022.
“They talked about ramping up to close to 8,000 construction workers at the peak,” Dorsey said. “We have close to 1,200 people out there right now.”
That’s also hundreds of millions of Ohio taxpayer dollars that state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, says are being unused by Intel.
“We’re never getting the jobs we were promised, we’re never getting the economic development we were promised,” DeMora said. “All that’s happened is we spent a lot of state money on infrastructure, drove up property rates for all the people that live there, and now we’ve got a boondoggle.”
After years of the company’s stock plummeting, plus repeated layoffs, the company moved its expected completion date from 2025 to the 2030s.
Still, Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel said he believes Intel will stay true to its original promise of the multi-billion-dollar investment.
“Nothing’s easy, especially in a changing industry like the one they’re in, but they’ve already made a lot of investment and they’re still working on it,” Tressel said Thursday.
Asked about Ohio taxpayer money being spent on something that doesn’t exist yet, Tressel said that’s fair and frustrating for sure.
“We have contractual things that have to be met, I don’t think those are for a couple more years, but I understand the frustration,” he responded. “Big things are hard; sometimes the progress doesn’t happen like you’d like it to.”
Another issue is causing concern among other Republicans.
Both U.S. Sens. Jon Husted and Moreno have raised concerns about the new Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. This year, Tan invested hundreds of millions in Chinese companies that have ties to their government, according to a report by Reuters.
President Donald Trump and Moreno have asked for Tan to resign, and Moreno said that the project needs to be completed, “and a fraud investigation should be initiated.”



Husted, who has been the face of Intel in Ohio since he helped bring it to the state when he was lieutenant governor, took a softer approach.



“Obviously, if someone’s a part of the CCP, it’s a problem in my mind, but I think you have to be fair until facts come out,” Tressel said.
Gov. Mike DeWine, to reporters in Dayton, echoed his second-in-command’s thoughts.
“We are always very careful who the state deals with. Anybody who is associated with the Communist Party in China — that’s a problem. We don’t trust them, we don’t like them, they’re not good,” DeWine said. “I think we have to wait, though, in this case to see what the facts are.”
DeWine referenced how “we” have not heard from Intel about this matter, he said.
“I’m sure that Intel does not, would not want to be associated with someone, and we wouldn’t want them associated with someone who would be close to the Communist Party in China, but we don’t know that for a fact at this point, so I’m going to reserve judgment on that,” he said.
We reached out to Intel, but it didn’t respond directly to us. The company released the following statement to the public later in the day:

“Intel, the Board of Directors, and Lip-Bu Tan are deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests and are making significant investments aligned with the President’s America First agenda. Intel has been manufacturing in America for 56 years. We are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country, and are the only company investing in leading logic process node development in the U.S. We look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration.”

However, its spokesperson has told us for years that their commitment to Ohio remains strong. Hager is keeping with that optimism, but DeMora doesn’t believe it’s happening.
“Intel is dead,” he said. “We’re never going to see Intel.”
DeWine said the state won’t be able to claw back money from the state’s investment in the Intel project until at least 2029.
“On January 1, 2029 is the time when we look back and we see ‘did they produce the jobs when they said they were going to do or not,’ but up until then, the contract does not provide any remedy for the state,” the governor said Thursday. “I remain confident that Intel is going to be making chips in Ohio.”

Arroyo revealed city police investigated her citizenship status and required her to prove her citizenship. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)There’s a word for what happened to Lenexa City Council member Melanie Arroyo, and it begins with an “r” and ends with “ism.”
Go ahead. Take a wild guess.
Arroyo was forced to prove her citizenship to city police after someone left a voicemail with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. We subsequently learned that the KBI deleted the message after informing local law enforcement of its contents. That could well conflict with document retention rules, but let’s save that for later. Instead, let’s scrutinize what the statewide crime-fighting agency told Lenexa police via email.
Their words suggest that Kansas has a long way to go in treating residents respectfully and equally.
According to a KBI agent, a man “called with a question regarding the citizenship of a member of the Lenexa City Council. He stated that in February of 2025 Melanie Arroyo (possibly Melanie Arroyo-Lopez), a representative for Ward 3, gave testimony wanting to give illegals more benefits. During this testimony she acknowledged that she came to this country illegally as a child, but never acknowledged naturalization. He stated that this testimony was posted to the internet. He stated that to be a qualified elector, they had to be registered to vote and be born here or naturalized. He wanted to report this information for investigation.”
Big problems come to mind immediately. Namely that the KBI has passed along a bunch of patently false information.
Not a good look for the agency we depend on to keep Kansans safe.
First off, Arroyo’s full last name is Arroyo Pérez, not Arroyo-Lopez. Those two names actually sound quite different!
Secondly, “gave testimony wanting to give illegals more benefits” patently misstates Arroyo’s testimony. She argued for the continuation of current Kansas policy, not extending or expanding any policy.
Third, the email states that Arroyo “came to this country illegally as a child” based on her legislative testimony. That’s also untrue. She writes that she grew up as an undocumented migrant, but that doesn’t mean she or her family entered the United States illegally. Indeed, in a Kansas City Star op-ed published March 6, Arroyo notes that she came here legally but overstayed a visa.
Finally, the email claims that she “never acknowledged naturalization.” Actually, both the testimony and column state that her undocumented status had been “resolved.”
To summarize, the information that the KBI forwarded to the Lenexa Police Department contains four factual errors. These aren’t the kind of mistakes that take time or effort to uncover, either. You literally just have to read Arroyo’s actual words, as submitted to lawmakers and as published in the region’s newspaper of record.
Did no one at the KBI do this?
Did no one on the Lenexa police force do this?
If not, why?
Taken as a whole, I see clear signs of racism. You can see it in the confusion of last names. You can see it in the use of the word “illegals.” You can see it in the automatic assumption that anyone who looks a certain way, sounds a certain way, comes from a particular background, necessitates scrutiny. As I wrote last week, there’s just as much reason to ask Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach about his citizenship status. (That is, none.)
State and local law enforcement also failed to think critically. Ponder this: Would a Lenexa resident of distinction — a city council member, no less — give public testimony about benefits for undocumented Kansans and not have her own papers in order? Officers were asked to believe Arroyo was somehow willing to risk prison time, removal from office and deportation just so she could voice her opinion on a proposed bill.


That doesn’t pass the smell test. It’s bias, plain as day.


The KBI and the Lenexa police force probably didn’t set out with a explicit intention of harming Arroyo. Yet they did not give her the benefit of the doubt, either. They did not consider publicly available sources. They did not treat the recorded words from a “Johnson County man” with the appropriate amount of skepticism or critical thought. They decided that shaming a public official made more sense than questioning their own motives.
Take it from your friendly neighborhood journalist. Public officials in Kansas need to do a better job of checking their sources.

Mike DeWine’s veto of a line in the state budget that would ban certain types of levies from being put on the ballot by local governments or school districts.
The reason House members thought this was so important that they needed to get together and have this vote even when their chamber was closed for renovation was because they saw this as a way to reduce the burden of property taxes.
In the wake of COVID-19, global supply chain disruption, a contraction of building materials, and changes in demographics caused substantial shifts in housing supply. 
Many in Ohio have seen the value of their home increase precipitously in the years since 2020, especially in 2022-2024. 
With three-year valuations coming in, many were hit with sticker shock of their new property taxes, and state lawmakers leapt into their fighting stances, ready to find a way to reduce the impact of property taxes on households.
The Ohio General Assembly commissioned a committee to study ways to reduce the burden of property taxes. This led to a series of provisions in the new state budget trying to reduce the burden of property taxes in the state.
The provision that was vetoed and the focus of the Ohio House override is focused on a specific type of levy: an emergency or replacement levy. 
This is still a levy that has to go before voters, the same way any other property tax levy does. 
The argument made by House members on the floor was that by banning the use of the phrase “emergency” or “replacement,” voters would not be “tricked” into voting for property taxes they didn’t believe in.
So basically, the diagnosis here is that property taxes are so burdensome, at least partially, because people mistakenly vote for them.
Ultimately, these sorts of policy changes to the property tax system will do little to reduce the burden of property taxes. 
Yes, legislators can now go to their constituents and say “Hey, I went out there and voted even as the House chamber was under renovation to deliver property tax relief to you.” 
But these are small administrative changes to the types of property taxes that are being put before voters. They will do little to reduce the burden of property taxes.
It is worth asking the bigger question: are property taxes really the problem residents of Ohio are struggling with? 
Or is the real problem that property taxes grew in a short period of time relative to incomes? 
Because that is unlikely to happen again soon with interest rates high and the global supply chain for building materials at a new equilibrium. 
There is good reason to believe that legislators are stuck fighting the last war around property taxes.
So what can policymakers do? 
They can improve upon the system by moving from a property tax to a land value tax, which falls less heavily on low-income renters and does not penalize people for developing their land. 
They can invest in programs like early childhood and K-12 education which improve incomes in the long-run or the earned income tax credit and child tax credit which would improve incomes in the short-run.
Or they can keep beating around the bush, making small changes to the property tax system that do little more than to complicate an already-complicated system.

When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

Those go to U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., who faced a hostile crowd at an in-person town hall meeting last week in Lincoln. 
From my seat in the back of beautiful Kimball Hall on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s City Campus, the gathering did not disappoint. Nor — without mentioning names but their initials are Adrian Smith, Don Bacon and Deb Fischer — would Flood’s experience do anything but dissuade other Nebraska electeds to take the hot seat. To wit: The guy deserves an attaboy.
  Nebaska U.S. Rep Mike Flood talking to attendees before his town hall at lincoln on Aug 4. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)
Before we get carried away, however, whatever information exchange he or the throng hoped for never materialized. Such is the nature of the modern political in-person town hall. Some peg the beginning of these boisterous beasts to 2009, when conspiracy theorists started showing up at town halls, shouting about President Obama’s birth certificate. The noise and the lie persisted at town halls and among true believers. Then we elected one president. Twice.
While the data dissemination at the Flood’s town hall was disappointing, clear from the outset was that he is all in with the president and MAGA — unremarkable, given Flood’s voting record. Any sense that we’d have a meeting of the minds or a parsing of policies was a long shot.
Nevertheless, several of Flood’s answers and comments were instructive as much for what they didn’t say as for what they did.
He stumbled out of the blocks when he began by suggesting that perhaps some Nebraskans may be misinformed about the Big Ugly, for which he unsurprisingly voted yes. While he cleared up the difference between Medicaid and Medicare for the three people there who didn’t understand it, his implication that the Big Ugly had nothing to do with Medicare runs contrary to the Center for Medicare Advocacy, which should know.
At least five times he said that the bill “saved Medicaid,” inexplicably equating increased funding for state hospitals and work requirements for Medicaid recipients as solving the loss of health care for 78,000 Nebraskans. 
Few in the assembly bought that calculus, their boos reaching quite a crescendo. With no number on which to hang his hat, he also contended that apparently large numbers of Medicaid recipients who could work were government cheats, lolling at home and getting free health care. 
Curious, I checked three different analyses, finding the percent of able-bodied adults on Medicaid who could work but didn’t in the 5%-8% range.
On Gaza, Flood was clear. “I stand with Israel.” Before he repeated that sentiment, he referenced the horrors Hamas visited on Israelis and that no one likes watching children suffer. Missing was what’s missing in too much of the war’s public discourse: that one can support Israel’s right to defend itself but be critical of its prosecution of the war, including the moral imperative it now faces while Palestinians dodge aerial assaults and starve to death, and be neither an anti-Semite nor a supporter of Hamas. 
Both can be true and, as the war continues unabated, the distinction grows ever more pertinent.

The town hall was held before news that the feds are considering Nebraska as a site for one of its immigrant detention camps, an incredibly bad idea. Nevertheless, Flood was enthusiastic in his support of the president’s immigration policies and completion of a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, insisting we detain and deport violent criminals and stanch the flow of fentanyl into the country. 
Great, except most data confirms that among those now detained, 65-70% have no criminal record, and less than one in ten are violent criminals. Plus, most fentanyl, 80-90%, comes across our border at legal crossing points.
One other lowlight was ironically glaring. Flood said of the president firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics director because he didn’t like the jobs report, that “there are always two sides to every story.” Really? This is the same BLS Flood and his GOP posse used during the creation of and argument for the Big Ugly.
Finally, in answering a query about why the administration is withholding medical science funds from major research universities, Flood pledged his support for such endeavors at both private and public institutions, adding that some of schools “have a poor record of anti-semitism.” To which one might ask … such as?
As in-person town halls go, Flood’s Lincoln soiree was louder and more raucous than most. The real test for those in Kimball Hall and like-minded Flood constituents in Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, however, is to turn up at the only place louder than a town hall meeting: the ballot box.

Too many fish.
Our damn fish.
For 450 million years, the sharks have had everything their way, swimming around the ocean like they own the place, chowing down on that endless seafood buffet.
Who do those sharks think they are? Other than, like, sharks.
We celebrate George Washington and Abraham Lincoln one lousy day a year.
Sharks get a whole week.
  U.S. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida. (U.S. Senate website)
No más. Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott means to show these arrogant top predators he means business.
Sen. Scott’s elegantly named and creatively capitalized “Supporting the Health of Aquatic systems through Research, Knowledge, and Enhanced Dialogue (or SHARKED) Act will address bad behavior in the shark community. 
No longer will the sharks be allowed to appropriate fish for their own selfish nutritional ends.
It’s a bipartisan effort: Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat, is Scott’s SHARKED co-sponsor, although he’s being cautious about what he says.
Schatz is from Hawaii, where certain sharks are considered sacred, what with them being people’s reincarnated ancestors.
Funnily enough, Schatz was once part of the shark-coddling caucus, all-in on legislation to protect those deep sea devils.
But he’s clearly seen the light, read the room, and smelled the Trumpy zeitgeist: It’s all about the money.
Sport fishing in Hawaii is worth hundreds of millions.
Scott also once expressed a bit of sympathy for sharks.
When he saw images of boaters “abusing a young tiger shark in Citrus County,” he wrote a tough letter to the head of NOAA demanding somebody do something.
The senator still wants somebody to do something, and, by God, the Scott-Schatz bill is going to do it.
More or less.
‘Unnatural food source’
It directs the secretary of commerce to put together a task force to figure out why elasmobranch cartilaginous fishes (as ichthyology nerds call them) gobble up the very fish sportsmen and women spend so much cash to catch.
You drop big money on a three-day charter out of Destin, spend another grand on your Yeti cooler, your Bora Bora hat, your Columbia convertible pants, your Coors, your Jack, your Pringles, your Publix subs, your peanut M&Ms, you finally get something on the line, but next thing you know, Mister Jerk Shark smells the blood in the water, swims up, and takes a big old bite of your 400 lb. blue marlin.  
OK, maybe the shark was hungry, but that’s no excuse.
The American Sportfishing Association, the American Fisheries Society, and others rightly upset about sharks’ indefensible habit of consuming their usual source of protein, complain “shark depredation is clearly detrimental to anglers and predated fish that would otherwise be released.”
They point out all that illicit predation “creates an unnatural food source for sharks.”
The sharks would argue fish are, in fact, their entirely natural food source, but if it comes to a choice between those toothy behemoths and a $230 billion industry, the sharks lose.
Enviros whine about declining shark populations, pointing lefty fingers at all-American events such as Alabama’s Deep Sea Rodeo which is all about killing the biggest shark you can find.
Bottom line: Sharks are hurting the economy.
Scott has principles.
These principles, largely devoted to profit, were amply on display in a Senate committee the other day when he waxed passionate — practically Shakespearean — about the sacredness of unfettered capitalism.
Capitalism
Fellow Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley had the brass-faced gall to put forth a bill banning members of Congress from trading stocks and forcing them to divest by the beginning of their next term.
How are our elected representatives supposed to get rich if you deny them all that sweet insider information?
Scott accused Hawley of attacking Donald Trump, who, as he put it, “has gone through unbelievable hell.”
Too right: The president has been forced to suffer impertinent press questions about his pedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein, disrespectful comments on his cheating at golf, and a painful lack of gold leaf in the Cabinet room.
A lesser man would have crumbled. 
But Hawley’s real ire was directed at Florida’s senior senator. He said, pointedly, “I’m not a billionaire, unlike others on this committee.”
Stung, shocked, affronted, even, Rick Scott hit back: “I don’t know when in this country it became a negative to make money. This idea that we’re going to attack people because they make money is wrong. It’s absolutely wrong.” 
Damn straight, senator: Money isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.
When they start picking on the super-rich, everybody might as well start singing “The Internationale” and pledge allegiance to the hammer and sickle.          
Just because Rick Scott’s worth at least $500 million (probably more — some of his wealth is in his wife’s name) is no reason to be mean. 
Scott will be the first, second, and probably third to tell you he grew up in public housing and in the early 1970s enlisted in the United States Navy, serving on a ship that sailed to danger zones such as Bermuda (when it wasn’t in dry dock), selling soft drinks at a huge mark-up to his fellow sailors.
Nothing more American than price-gouging!
Unless it’s big money sport fishing.
Shark chow?
So, what are we going to do to stop those sharks from snatching our fish, robbing us of the pleasure of shooting the breeze with the guys, drinking beer on a big boat, and finally piercing some fishy cheeks with metal hooks?
As former Louisiana U.S. Rep. Garret Graves, a supporter of the bill, describes it, when the shark bites a fish on somebody’s line, it’s like “the tax collector taking more off the top.”
Spit-balling here, but how about alternative shark food sources? 
If humans can learn to eat tofu, sharks can learn to eat things that aren’t fish.
Let’s get some business buy-in. Purina makes deer chow, goat chow, rabbit chow, chicken chow, sheep chow, pig chow, and cow chow.
It even makes food for large-mouth bass: Surely it can’t be that hard to manufacture shark chow.
The feds could hire a bunch of deadbeat Medicaid recipients to buzz around on the sea with great big shakers, sprinkling the shark chow onto the water — just like you do with your home aquarium.
Woke scientist types are always telling us sharks are not mindless killers like that nasty thing in “Jaws.”
In fact, they’re smart.
So maybe we could reason with them.
Find a way to communicate: It’s possible those military dolphins can speak shark. The dolphins could inform them we’re serious about our sport fish and they’d better back off.
The problem with this plan is sharks eat dolphins.
A modest proposal
If persuasion doesn’t work, there’s always firearms.
Shoot enough of them when you catch them chomping down on somebody else’s catch, and the greedy bastards will get the message.
Or what if we could solve two problems at once: the illegal immigrant thing and the shark thing?
How about we dig two deep canals, one from the Gulf of God Bless ‘Merka heading east from Chokoloskee; one from the Mar-at-Lantic heading west from Fort Lauderdale?
The canals meet at the Big Cypress detention camp, making a saltwater moat all the way around.
Stock the moat with sharks. Pen them in with big gates. 
Once the illegals realize there are 20-foot great hammerheads and 500-pound bull sharks swimming around and around, they’ll stop demanding to speak to their lawyers.
The sharks get fed, the illegals stay in jail — at least until they get sent to Sudan or Nicaragua or wherever.
Win-win.
Sport fishing — indeed, America herself — is saved.

Andy Beshear (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT, Ky. – Gov. Andy Beshear’s super PAC reported another $824,800 in contributions on Friday bringing the total it raised in the first six months of this year to $1,443,000.
The largest of the contributions by far was $225,000 from Andrew Nathan Schwartzberg, a real estate developer based in Maryland who focuses on affordable housing projects.
Beshear created his super PAC, called In This Together PAC, soon after winning re-election in 2023. Beshear is prevented by the Kentucky Constitution from seeking a third term as governor, and the super PAC is a mechanism that allows him to raise money to promote political candidates and issues in Kentucky and across the country while he considers a possible candidacy for president in 2028.
The report filed on Friday with the Internal Revenue Service shows the super PAC gave significant support in the past six months to candidates in other states. It spent $143,568 in March for direct mail supporting Susan Crawford’s successful campaign for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Crawford was the candidate favored by Democrats in that hotly-contested race that determined control of the Wisconsin high court. Also in March, In This Together donated $25,000 to Copper State Values, a PAC that supports Democrat Katie Hobbs, the governor of Arizona.
In This Together is a hybrid super PAC that can accept contributions of unlimited amounts and accept contributions from corporations. It discloses some of its financial activity to the Federal Election Commission and the rest to the Internal Revenue Service.
Early last week, In This Together filed its report with the FEC covering the first half of this year – a disclosure reported by Kentucky Lantern and other news outlets. On Friday it filed its report covering the same period with the IRS allowing a comprehensive look at its activity over the period.
The reports combined show roughly $1,443,000 in contributions, and $558,400 in spending between Jan. 1 and June 30.
The total reflects a slight increase in the pace of contributions over last year when In This Together reported raising $2.56 million over 12 months.
The vast percentage of the money taken in by In This Together so far this year came in big contributions from a small number of people, and several of the largest donors are real estate developers.
Here is a list of its largest donors during the period as listed in the report filed Friday.

Andrew Nathan Schwartzberg, Rockville, Maryland, $225,000. Schwartzberg is president of Preservation Services LLC, a national real estate development business focusing on affordable housing. The report lists his address in Maryland. Last year he gave $250,000 to In This Together. The total of $475,000 makes him the largest donor ever to In This  Together.
Maegan Ford Nicholson, $100,000. The report lists a Dallas, Texas, address and does not list an occupation. But Nicholson is listed with a Versailles address, and identified as an executive with Diamond A Farm, in a contribution she made to Beshear’s 2023 re-election campaign.
Christopher Dischinger, Louisville, developer, LGD Inc., $50,000.
Christian Larsen, San Francisco, executive chairman of Ripple Inc., $50,000.
John and Marcia Goldman, Atherton, California, not employed, $50,000.
Tracy W. Farmer, Naples, Florida, self-employed, $25,000. Though the report lists a Naples address, Farmer is a longtime businessman and horseman from central Kentucky and past donor to campaigns of Andy Beshear and Beshear’s father, former Gov. Steve Beshear.
James Gray, Lexington, secretary of Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, $25,000.
Morgan Chu, Los Angeles, lawyer with Irell Manella LLP, $25,000.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-11 04:01:08+00:00,CT Mirror,Tong should sue Prospect Medical,Joe Bentivegna MD,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/11/tong-should-sue-prospect-medical/,Company owners took obscene profits at the expense of CT's healthcare system. They should not get away with it.,"Connecticut’s Attorney General William Tong is suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from education, Planned Parenthood and disaster relief. He is also suing this adminstration for restricting health care to transgender youth. Whether these cases have merit remains to be seen.
But there is one group that Tong has so far given a free pass: the private equity firms who ravaged Connecticut hospitals while enriching themselves with hundreds of millions of dollars.

Joseph Bentivegna MD
First some background. Prospect Medical Holdings is a private healthcare company that purchases hospitals “with a core mission to provide quality, compassionate, and accessible healthcare.”
In actuality, their goal is to buy hospitals, suck out the equity and pay investors and company executives gargantuan sums of money.
How did this happen? In 2010, a private equity group, Leonard Green and Partners, bought a 61% stake in Prospect Medical Holdings for $363 million and assumed their $158 million debt. They then went on a rampage, buying hospitals across the country. In Connecticut, they purchased Manchester Memorial Hospital and Rockville Hospital for $105 million and Waterbury Hospital for an undisclosed amount.
These hospitals owned the land and buildings in which they were housed. But Prospect Medical Holdings sold this property along with that of other hospitals across the country for $1.4 billion to a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) called Medical Properties Trust (MPT). Thus, the hospitals now had a huge expense they did not have before, monthly rent. Meanwhile, Leonard Green and Partners used Prospect Medical Holdings as the conduit to receive the money for these land purchases along with the cash flow from the hospital to borrow $1.1 billion. They paid off previous debts and then the executives of these companies took obscene salaries.
The Prospect Medical Holdings CEO Sam Lee took home $128 million! Leonard Green and Partners, the majority owner of Prospect Medical Holdings, received $658 million in dividends and management fees during its ownership of the hospital chain. While there are no public disclosures on how much the executives of Leonard Green and Partners pocketed, there are two managing partners, Jonathan Sokoloff and John G. Danhakl. Sokoloff’s net worth is estimated to be $150 million (although it is probably much higher) and Danhakl is worth a cool $1.7 billion. It’s safe to say these two each put at least $100 million in their pockets.
Meanwhile, the once-thriving 102-bed Rockland Hospital that served the working-class Vernon community now only offers an emergency room, one-day surgical service and behavioral health services. And at Manchester Memorial doctors have not been paid, nurses are short-staffed and working like dogs while Prospect Medical Holdings stopped funding their pensions.
And what happened when the staff tried to receive their compensation? If you said Prospect Medical Holdings declared bankruptcy, go to the head of the class!
So now what happens to these hospitals? Either some other conglomerate buys them, or they must close. Yale attempted to do so but no agreement could be reached. Prospect Medical Holdings’ bankruptcy caused two hospitals in the Philadelphia area to close and then patients had to pay $75 to get access to their records.
And it gets worse. Waterbury Hospital owes the Town of Waterbury $29 million in back taxes. But with Prospect Medical Holdings in bankruptcy, the taxpayers will get the bill.
And to add insult to injury, the bankruptcy judge approved an incentive program for six top executives, including undisclosed salary boosts, aimed at retaining key personnel during the hospital-sale process. Thus, the same people who raped the hospitals will generate huge fees by trying to sell the hospitals they destroyed. You can’t make this up.
Tong simply cannot allow this without a fight. Leonard Green and Partners must be sued along with Sokoloff, Danhakl and Lee personally – preferably in the Waterbury Courthouse.
The problem is that any lawyer reading this article, including Tong will say, “What these guys did may have been immoral, but it is not illegal. There is no case here.”
But perhaps with some creative legal thinking, a statute can be found or least possibly interpreted to mean that private equity firms cannot destroy the health care of working class communities so that their executives can buy bigger yachts.
Tong graduated from Phillips Academy, Brown University (with honors) and the University of Chicago Law School. Even if one does not agree with his politics, he must be a sharp guy. He should be able to figure out how to make a strong case while showcasing the malfeasance of these executives and letting a jury decide. Even the threat of a jury trial and the adverse publicity these executives will receive could cause them to settle for a large sum that could be used to improve health care in these communities.
And even if Tong does not win, he will become a hero to many voters outside of the Democratic bailiwick. Even hardcore Republicans are disgusted by the behavior of these plutocrats. The destruction of community hospitals by avaricious private equity executives who game the system cannot go unchallenged.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The U.S. Coast Guard commissioned its first additional polar icebreaker in 25 years in Juneau on Sunday, marking what officials called a new era in Arctic activity for the United States.
The newly rechristened Storis, formerly the oilfield supply ship Aiviq, is the first in a series of icebreakers expected to join the Coast Guard in coming years. The Storis and subsequent ships, officials said, are critical for the United States to maintain its sovereignty and control of its borders in and near the Arctic Ocean. 
“What we’re doing here today is we’re really just preparing to build our Arctic fighting force,” said Troy Edgar, deputy undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, parent agency of the Coast Guard.

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was one of several members of Congress who secured funding for the Coast Guard to purchase the Storis for $125 million under a special contract and operating arrangement during the Biden administration. The purchase deal passed Congress after years of lobbying and political donations by the ship’s former owners.
The Aiviq, built to support Royal Dutch Shell’s oil drilling operations in the Arctic Ocean off Alaska, was available because of a disaster that saw Shell’s drilling rig break loose from the Aiviq during a 2013 storm in the Gulf of Alaska. The rig ran aground in the Kodiak archipelago and Shell abandoned its drill plans for the Arctic. 
The Aiviq was modified after post-disaster reviews found flaws in its design, and it went on to serve under contract with the Australian government in Antarctica. Then, the U.S. government became interested in the ship to fill a gap in Arctic coverage.
The U.S. Navy has no icebreakers, which leaves the Coast Guard as the agency in charge of icebreaking operations, critical for opening frozen seas to commerce, research and military missions. The agency currently has just one heavy icebreaker, and that ship is typically assigned to help operations in Antarctica. That leaves the medium icebreaker Healy as the only U.S. icebreaker available for general-purpose missions in the Arctic. 
A 2023 analysis by the Coast Guard concluded that the service needs eight to nine polar icebreakers, including four or five heavy ships and four or five medium ones to perform its assigned missions.
“I think Singapore has more icebreaking capacity than we do,” Sullivan said. “That has left us far behind our adversaries. Russia has more than 50 operational icebreakers, many nuclear-powered, many weaponized. China, which has no Arctic territory, is building a polar fleet and is spending a lot of time off our shores, including this summer.”

As Sullivan spoke, China is operating at least five research icebreakers in international waters near Alaska.
Capt. Corey Kearns is the ship’s first commanding officer, fresh from an assignment in Japan as a liaison officer with the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet.
“For the Coast Guard, the big strategic thing is to show that we can operate it, get it up north, show the flag,” Kearns said.
During his time in Japan, he became familiar with the disputes over the Senkaku Islands, whose ownership is disputed among China, Taiwan and Japan.
Ships from all three nations visit the waters around those islands.
“The ability to be present guarantees your ability to to maintain sovereignty. And that’s what we’re trying to get at here in the Arctic. We need more icebreakers to be present in our waters and be clear what is our waters,” he said.
First of many icebreakers planned for Coast Guard
In January, President Donald Trump said he would seek to acquire 40 Coast Guard icebreakers. The “Big Beautiful Bill” signed by Trump in July included almost $9 billion to build a series of heavy, medium and light ships.
Those include a series of heavy Arctic icebreakers larger than the Storis. The first of those, the Polar Sentinel, is expected to come from Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding in 2030, with additional ships every two years afterward.
“This is an amazing moment, because it doesn’t happen that often, but it’s going to be happening a lot more,” said acting Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Kevin E. Lunday.

The Storis is scheduled to be homeported in Juneau, where Sunday’s commissioning took place, but not for several years. For the time being, it will be homeported in Seattle, Washington. 
Sullivan, speaking at the commissioning, said he would like to see the new ships homeported in Alaska as well — it’s where the ice is, he said to applause.
The Trump-signed budget measure includes $300 million for a new Coast Guard pier and other facilities in Juneau; construction has not begun, and no site has been finalized.
Both the Storis and the under-construction heavy icebreakers are too large to fit in the Coast Guard’s Kodiak base or in any port north of the Aleutian Islands. The Storis draws 34 feet, according to specifications published in 2013. The new heavy icebreakers are expected to have a similar draft. Either figure is deeper than what’s available in northern Alaska right now.
By the book, said Cmdr. Philip Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, it takes the Coast Guard eight to 10 years to set up a new port from the time it’s chosen.
“We want to move much faster, but there’s a lot of work that has to be done to build out the pier and the shore infrastructure,” Lunday said.
He said things like housing and child care need to be available to accommodate Coast Guard personnel.
Currently, Juneau is experiencing major shortages of both.
“I chair the Coast Guard subcommittee,” Sullivan said, “so working with the Coast Guard, working with Juneau, working with the state, we’re going to press this. We’ve already made good progress on that.”
Additional work needed aboard Storis
The Storis, too, will need work and testing before it can fully perform its duties. During a pre-commissioning cruise on Saturday for members of the media and the families of the crew, one of the ship’s variable-pitch propellers malfunctioned, helping turn a planned five-hour excursion into an eight-hour one. 
The malfunction was a minor one, but fixing it may have required turning off main power for a time, the ship’s captain said, and he didn’t want to do that while families were aboard.
The Storis has a helipad, but a Coast Guard helicopter has never landed there, tried a mid-air hoist, or refueled from the ship. Some labels throughout the ship still bear the name Aiviq, and the ship’s interior art includes photos from Louisiana bayous and New Orleans streets. In the ship’s mess hall are condiments bearing the names of southern grocery stores.

On Saturday’s cruise, employees from Edison Choest Offshore, the company that formerly owned the Storis, stood alongside uniformed Coast Guard officers on the ship’s bridge.
“He’s my coach,” said Lt. j.g. Sophia Scott of chief mate Devin Keister, who wore civilian clothes next to her. 
Since the spring, employees from Edison Choest have been operating the Storis alongside enlisted Coast Guard members and officers, a unique setup for a Coast Guard ship.
Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, helped organize the purchase of the Storis and the sprint to get it ready.
“I’ll never forget March 4 of 2025 when Admiral Lunday, our acting Commandant of the Coast Guard, directed me and my team to prepare Storis for operations and to sail away from Pascagoula, Mississippi, where the ship had been purchased and put into storage, no later than 1 June of 2025. I’m no mathematician, but that’s less than 60 days later, and at that point, zero crew members had reported aboard,” he said.
After sailing away, the ship spent another two weeks in Seattle for additional work, then arrived in Juneau during the first week of August.
Lunday said the Coast Guard’s partnership with Edison Choest enabled the Coast Guard to put the Storis in service “much faster than we would have traditionally done.”
“The imperative,” Lunday said, “is that we build out the nation’s icebreaker fleet. When we see the potential adversaries that are moving to build their icebreakers, we’ve got to move faster as the United States, and we’re going to do that. … The original plan was not to have Storis up here for another year, but the national imperative was to move faster, and so that’s why it’s here.”
Storis has a mixed history
In 2012, while towing the circular drill rig Kulluk from the Arctic Ocean to Seattle, the Aiviq ran into a heavy storm south of Kodiak. The ship’s engines died, the tow line broke, and the Kulluk ran aground after the Aiviq’s crew was unable to re-establish the tow.
No oil spill resulted and no one was injured, but it contributed to Shell’s decision to abandon its Arctic drilling plans.
Two years later, the Coast Guard published a report on the accident, concluding that actions by the tow crew, management decisions and “design engineering deficiencies … relating to the Aiviq” contributed to the wreck.

Specifically, the report noted that vents allowed seawater to contaminate the ship’s fuel.
Since then, those vents have been modified, raised farther above the deck, and the ship went on to conduct two successful voyages to Antarctica. The ship is rated to break three feet of ice while moving at five knots, but during those trips, it was able to break between three and five feet while still moving forward, Baxa said.
After Shell discontinued its Alaska offshore drilling, Edison Choest lobbied members of Congress and urged lawmakers to purchase the Aiviq for use by the federal government.
The Coast Guard initially resisted. In a 2016 hearing of the U.S. House’s Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, then-Coast Guard Vice Commandant Charles Michel told lawmakers that “our current opinion is that the ship is not suitable for military service, without substantial refit.”
Then-Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, called Michel’s statement a “bulls**t answer” because the Aiviq would be asked to move ice, not perform military duties.
In 2022, after Young’s death in office, Congress passed the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act, which approved funding for the Coast Guard to buy a “United States built available icebreaker.”
The Coast Guard, which had been considering a Finland-built ship, switched to the Aiviq as the only available ship that met Congress’ qualifications. 
Subsequent reporting by ProPublica showed an extensive history of political donations by Edison Choest to members of Congress, including Alaska’s delegation.
“It is ready for Coast Guard service,” Lunday said of the Aiviq-turned-Storis when asked about the July 2016 hearing that labeled the Aiviq as unfit.
“We’ve learned a lot since then, and we’ve had great support from Congress to have the appropriations necessary last year to purchase the ship,” he said.
Sullivan, among the members of Congress who received contributions from Edison Choest, denied that those donations contributed to the decision to purchase the Aiviq.
“It has nothing to do with it,” Sullivan said. “Zero. I’ve been pressing for more icebreakers any way possible for our country … and the Coast Guard was looking at the idea of a commercially available one.”
New ship carries relics of prior history
The new Storis is named after its predecessor, an icebreaker that was commissioned in 1942 and served until 2007, becoming the oldest commissioned Coast Guard cutter in the fleet at the time of its decommissioning and scrapping.
In 1957, it and several other ships sailed through the Northwest Passage, marking the first time an American ship had taken that route.
Thirty-two years after that historic voyage, the Storis assisted with the cleanup after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Ed Sasser was a crewman on board at the time. On Saturday, he sailed aboard the new edition of his former ship.
“It’s pretty cushy compared to the old Storis,” he said, noting that both ships were and are unique vessels, not part of a larger class of ships.
If he were young again, he’d serve aboard the new ship “in a New York minute.”
“Time will tell how useful it is,” he said.

Remnants of the ship’s former life remain obvious throughout.
Belowdecks are large steel containers, intended to haul bulk dry concrete or other material to offshore oil fields. For now, they’re empty until the Coast Guard either removes them or finds a use for them. 
Other pieces of the Storis’ original purpose could be useful to its new mission. Its stern holds heavy-duty towing gear, and large firefighting cannons jut from its superstructure. 
The ship has no internal laboratory space, as does the Coast Guard’s other medium icebreaker, the Healy, but it does have deck attachments for container modules that could allow it to accommodate labs.
Already, one of those spaces was in use Sunday, holding the ship’s brand-new armory, including four .50-caliber machine guns. 
“I’ve made this joke for many, many years … it’s that if you can imagine it, and you can put it into a standard 20-foot IMO container, I can embark it on board. … we had on board a very, very senior Marine Corps officer, and he asked, ‘hey, what if I put a Marine Raider team in a box?’ I said, ‘Yes, sir, I can embark that on board.’ It really does provide that flexibility for missions,” Baxa said.
The Coast Guard’s staffing contract with Edison Choest is scheduled to run through November, and it could be extended for one year. 
Both Baxa and the ship’s captain said they’ll be recommending that extension.
Lt. Cmdr. George Greendyk, the engineer officer on board the Storis, said he hasn’t had problems with the Edison Choest civilian crew. 
“Everywhere we go, we have people that have seen something like this before, and they’ve been certainly helpful answering questions for us and guiding us as we run the engineering plant,” he said.
“Right now, our primary mission is to just focus on learning the ship, training, preparing our policy and procedures,” said Lt. D.J. Corbett, the ship’s operations officer.
Corbett said that over the next two months, the Storis will head west, to Kodiak, then through the Bering Sea and north, through the Bering Strait. The ship’s port calls are still being finalized. 
Corbett said being aboard an icebreaker means being able to see and do things that no other Coast Guard cutter experiences.
“I still remember the first time that I ever saw ice,” she said. “We were going down south. We had crossed the Antarctic Circle, and all of these massive icebergs just started flowing past us. And then we had right whales that were popping up and coming to see the ship. We had orcas. It was our last sunset. As we were heading south, it would be 24 hours of sunlight. So all of this was happening, the sun was setting, and then we saw a green flash that night. At first, we didn’t believe it. We were like, Did everyone see that? And so it was my moment of, I’m living in a National Geographic special. It was really amazing.”
The ship’s first captain looks ahead
Kearns, the ship’s first captain, is an officer who started as an enlisted man in 1996 and rose through the ranks, later earning degrees in ship design. He helped design a new class of icebreakers for the Great Lakes and served as the Coast Guard’s liaison to the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet, which patrols the western Pacific.

“Normally, you start off a ship designed by (the question): What capabilities are you trying to achieve? In this case, we need Arctic presence. That was the most important thing. So we’re willing to take some risk or we’re forced into it because our shipbuilding projects are so behind,” he said. 
Critically for the ship’s future, he said, is to come up with the equivalent of the ship’s operating manual. Coast Guard officers are trained to run ships, but the Storis is unique.
“What are all the things you need to learn to do the same job on Storis? And then run all of our people through that. … I think success will be when we get all of that documentation done and then get all of our watchstanders what would be considered fully qualified,” he said.
Kearns acknowledged that there are some people who would prefer that the Storis jump quickly into law enforcement, fisheries patrols and search and rescue. He prefers a slower pace.
“We need to learn how to crawl. And that’s what we’re doing, Kearns said.
For example, the crew of the Storis hasn’t yet launched the ship’s small craft, which are stored in bays along the side of the hull, in open water.
“We’ve just started to gain proficiency in launching that in protected, calm seas. So next would be, what does it look like to launch that in open water? And then how do we need to drive the ship from the bridge to create the right conditions to safely launch that boat? And then that would help us build into, ‘Oh, this is how we would  perform Coast Guard mission sets.’”
Asked about the ship’s history, the critical 2014 report and whether he has safety concerns, he said no.
“I have no concerns. I feel totally safe on Storis,” Kearns said.
He said he’s familiar with reporting that analyzed what went wrong with the Aiviq and why it was unable to keep the Kulluk from running aground.
“It easily gets attributed to design flaws for the ship, which is a little bit misleading. In extreme weather, every ship has design flaws. There’s constraints on operations. Ships are designed to operate in certain conditions to a certain extent, and if you operate the ship past those constraints, you’re going to find out what’s going to fail first,” he said.
Some engineering changes were made after the Kulluk accident — the Aiviq’s fuel vents were raised, “which means you can take more water in the vicinity of them before it would down-flood. It’s not that it couldn’t possibly happen again, but it’s less likely.”
Kearns said the “creature comforts” aboard the ship are the most easily noticeable difference from a purpose-built Coast Guard ship. 
The Storis has heated handrails, walkways and exterior stairs, a feature intended to eliminate the need for crew to beat ice away as it forms.
“There’s a lot of automation in places that we might not use it, because we use manpower instead,” he said.
Kearns said he’s also been impressed with the ship’s multiple redundancies.
“Almost every system has backups to the backups. They really thought about this thing being in the Arctic and independent and away from logistical support. There’s different ways to make water. There’s ways to handle sewage. I actually feel very comfortable with what the capabilities are,” he said.
“I’m definitely looking forward to doing ice breaking on this thing. It’s a lot of fun to drive,” Kearns said.

(Capital-Star photo by Peter Hall)The state House convened on Sunday evening to advance a Democrat-backed bill that would fund mass transit agencies across Pennsylvania, as SEPTA and other transit agencies warn of service cuts if imminent action isn’t taken.
House Democrats had hoped to include a mass transit funding increase in this year’s state budget. But that spending plan has still not been passed, six weeks after the constitutionally imposed June 30 deadline. 
The move to advance a standalone transit funding bill is something of a pressure tactic on the part of Democratic lawmakers, who say Senate Republicans need to do their part to ensure funding reaches transit agencies, and a budget is passed, before severe service cuts become a necessity.
“We can not tolerate this going on any longer,” said House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery). “The other body in this building has an obligation to forthwith show what they can do to pass an annual 12-month budget for this commonwealth.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The bill follows a proposal set forth by Gov. Josh Shapiro, which would direct an additional 1.75% of the state’s total sales tax revenue to transit agencies, in order to meet their needs across the commonwealth. It also incorporates key Republican demands, such as increased funding for roads and bridges in rural areas of the state, and accountability measures that would have transit agencies take steps to address issues like fare evasion, and propose public-private partnerships that could boost revenue.
The House plans to take it up again Monday for final passage.
However, no funding plan can be passed until Senate Republicans are willing to agree to it, and the issue itself is tied up in broader negotiations over the budget that are ongoing. House Democrats, several of whom are from the Philadelphia area, have called mass transit funding one of their highest priorities. Passing a standalone bill to address the issue would mean Republicans giving up a bargaining chip in broader budget negotiations.
What’s at stake over proposed increase in mass transit funding in Pa.? 

“This is not going to become law,” said House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford). Referring to broader budget talks between party leaders, he added, “If we want to do the job, it has to be in that negotiation. Passing bills just to show we can pass them out of the chamber sets us back in that initiative.”
The Senate is scheduled to return on Tuesday, but spokespeople for Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) and President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) did not respond to requests for comment from the Capital-Star, including questions about whether they plan to bring the transit bill for a vote, or propose a larger plan for the state budget.
Bills coming due
Most Pennsylvanians likely won’t have noticed any impacts on their day-to-day lives because of lawmakers’ failure to pass a budget by the deadline. But that could soon change.
Last week, SEPTA announced that, unless lawmakers can secure new funding by Aug. 14, service will have to be cut by 20%. That would mean the elimination of 32 routes and fewer trips on remaining bus and train lines. If funding is not increased after that, SEPTA says it will have to make more drastic cuts, including the elimination of five rail lines, 18 additional bus routes and the implementation of a 9 p.m. curfew. An estimated 800,000 people a day use SEPTA trains and buses.

Across the commonwealth, many transit agencies, serving urban, rural and suburban areas, could soon be facing similar decisions if the budget deadlock continues. More than one million Pennsylvanians – about one in 13 – utilize mass transit services each day. 
The agencies not only provide fixed route options like bus and train service, but play a key role in the operation of the state’s Shared-Ride program. The service provides seniors and disabled people with subsidized transportation to places like doctor’s appointments and grocery stores they may be unable to reach on their own.
County government officials across the state have also warned that, if budget negotiations in Harrisburg drag on much longer, safety net programs will likely be the next to feel the strain.
Shapiro says ‘the time to act is now’ on mass transit funding as potential service cuts loom

Many county-run services, such as rape crisis centers, child support enforcement programs, behavioral health services, local health departments and more, are funded at least in part by money from the state. Without a spending plan approved by lawmakers, payments will soon be delayed, which means county governments could have to cut services or begin to triage with the funds they have available.
School districts may also be forced to make due with less until lawmakers pass a budget enabling the state to distribute money. 
 Where do things stand?
Lawmakers, however, have been tight-lipped about what progress has and hasn’t been made in negotiations between Shapiro and leaders of the House Democratic and Senate Republican caucuses.
Primarily, it’s up to the governor, the majority leaders in the two chambers, and the chairs of the House and Senate appropriations committees, to reach an agreement that can earn support from a majority of lawmakers in their caucuses.
In previous press conferences, Senate GOP leaders said their goal is to rein in spending and address the structural deficit in the commonwealth’s existing budget.
While the state’s rainy day fund has more than $7 billion, Republicans have stressed that the money is easier to spend than to save. Treasurer Stacy Garrity has said the fund could support the expenses of the state’s general fund for just over 53 days.
Ward also recently told reporters that she would be open to passing a short-term budget, allowing the state to continue funding schools and other services and allowing lawmakers more time to bridge their differences.
Shapiro, however, appeared to push back on the idea at a press conference Sunday. 
“We are past the point of short-term stopgap measures,” he said.

Democratic leaders, meanwhile, have been vocal about the need to fund mass transit before services across the commonwealth are cut, but have offered little insight into what other issues may be the source of disagreement.
“40% of this commonwealth’s revenue comes from southeastern Pennsylvania,” House Appropriations Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia), told reporters Sunday. “ If folks cannot get to work and commerce doesn’t happen in southeastern Pennsylvania, it will eventually affect the budget of the entire commonwealth.”
Harris also stressed that the Democratic-controlled House already passed a full budget, as well as four standalone transit funding bills, though the Senate has yet to take similar action.
The budget bill the House voted on last month would see the state spend less than what Shapiro proposed in his February budget address, an apparent concession to Senate Republicans, who have said they want to shrink the deficit. 
“We just passed a budget that was a billion dollars short [of Shapiro’s proposal]. What the hell else do they want us to do?,” Harris said. “They need to pass something. They need to show us something that we can get done so we can close this thing out.”
Speaking to PCN last month, Pittman said that the budget already passed by the House was not reflective of ongoing negotiations.

“What the House passed was not something that we agreed to, and that’s okay. They have their vision of how the budget should look and we have our own vision,” he said. “In divided government, we have some very philosophical differences that are deep, and those deep philosophical differences need to be reconciled somehow, some way.”
Asked at Sunday’s press conference whether the Senate’s return is an indication lawmakers are ready to move on transit funding or a budget, Shapiro said, “I’m not going to negotiate with Leader Bradford and Leader Pittman through the media.”
However, in recent weeks Pittman has also told reporters that Republicans are interested in school choice measures — public funding to help families afford private school tuition.
The issue represents a particular sore spot for some Republicans supporters, and a stain on their relationship with Shapiro. In 2023, after backing the GOP-supported plan to include funding for school vouchers in that year’s budget, Shapiro ultimately reneged. The House Democratic majority refused to pass a budget that had already passed the Senate over the measure, so Shapiro agreed to veto the funding if the chamber passed the legislation.
Pittman has also signaled support for regulating so-called skill games, slot machine-like devices that have grown common in Pennsylvania restaurants and corner stores. As it stands, they’re not subject to taxes and regulations like the games found in casinos.
Taxing skill games is one proposal to bring in new revenue and fill the state’s deficit. Another proposal, legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana, is supported by House Democrats and a handful of GOP lawmakers, but Senate Republican leaders like Ward and Pittman have thrown cold water on the idea.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_6205-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-10 20:56:17.207817

As a single mother working three jobs to support her two children, her family is one of thousands in the region who rely on the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA).
With the transit agency that serves some 800,000 people daily just days away from implementing service cuts, if funding isn’t delivered from the state, she and a group of lawmakers on Sunday had a clear message.
“It seems that there has been a war declared on our community,” Fingerhold said. “And the politicians who serve Harrisburg, you need to wake up.”
“You need to get it together. You need to do your job, and you need to fund SEPTA,” she added. “We, the working people, do our job every day. It’s time to do your job and put working families over billionaires.”

Fingerhood was one of several speakers at a press conference on Sunday at SEPTA’s headquarters in Philadelphia, as Gov. Josh Shapiro and Democrats apply a full court press to get the transportation spending bill approved along with a state budget.
“We are past the point of short-term stopgap measures. We are past the point of a few months of fixes,” Shapiro said. “It is time to have recurring long term revenue for SEPTA and for the other mass transit agencies across Pennsylvania, and the time to act is now.”
Shapiro’s budget proposal included a spending package that would fund mass transit agencies across the state and increase spending for roads and bridges.
The state House has passed legislation on multiple occasions, but it has not advanced in the Senate.

The latest bill Democrats have put forward is House Bill 1788, authored by Rep. Sean Dougherty (D-Philadelphia). The bill would provide $600 million to mass transit and roads and bridges, while also increasing accountability on the transit agencies and public-private projects. The accountability portion of the proposal was originally put forth by GOP Sen. Joe Picozzi, of Philadelphia.
The House Transportation Committee voted to advance this bill by a 16-10 vote on Wednesday with the support of every Democrat and two Bucks County Republicans.
Shapiro said he met with SEPTA General Manager Scott Sauer, state Transportation Secretary Mike Carroll and other leaders about the urgency of the issue.
“I want to be clear. We do not want to make these devastating changes,” Sauer said. “However, without a funding solution, we will have to advance a 20% service cut that starts on August 24 and an overall 45% cut this fiscal year.”
Shapiro lauded Sauer’s leadership and said SEPTA’s GM walked him through some of the changes made by the transit agency to create a “far more efficient operation.”
Sauer said that SEPTA has enacted an austerity plan that has resulted in more than $30 million in savings over the last eight months, lowered its structural budget deficit from $240 million to $213 million and is embracing the accountability and oversight measures being considered by the General Assembly. He also noted that ridership is up for the fiscal year that just ended and that they have seen a reduction in crime on the system.

“I’m confident that SEPTA is on the rise, and all of us have embraced a customer focused mission that puts safety and security, reliability and service at the forefront, and if we can get the support that’s needed to avoid these devastating cuts, we’ll move swiftly to implement new initiatives that will enhance service across the system,” Sauer said.
Lt. Gov. Austin Davis was also in Pittsburgh on Sunday in an effort to raise awareness about mass transit funding. Adam Brandolph, a spokesperson for the Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT), told the Capital-Star earlier in the week that although they don’t have a “hard and fast deadline” at this current time for state funding, service cuts and fare increases will not occur until February 2026 at the earliest.
House members returned to Harrisburg for a voting session on Sunday and the Senate is due back in session on Tuesday, But, a budget bill passed by the House still has not been taken up by the GOP-controlled Senate.

Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) said she would support a short-term budget solution that would allow the commonwealth to provide funding for school districts and local governments, City & State PA reported on Aug. 5.
However, Shapiro said he is not open to a short-term budget proposal.
“I can tell you the time for short-term spending plans is long over and will not be entertained by me,” Shapiro said on Sunday. “We need to pass an annual budget, and that annual budget needs to fund mass transit.”
“Lawmakers have very few enumerated responsibilities. One of them is to pass an annual budget,” he added. “It’s time for them to do that now.”
One proposal championed by Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia) would legalize adult-use cannabis that would provide funding for mass transit agencies.
“So, that bill has support from Senate Republicans, House Republicans, House Democrats and Senate Democrats. It is both bicameral and bipartisan,” Street told reporters. “It would provide adequate funding to fund mass transit and transportation on a recurring basis for the foreseeable future. So it’s not a one time fix. It’s a permanent fix, and certainly, I think all things remain on the table until there’s a solution.”
However, Republican leaders in the Senate have not appeared to be as open to passing adult-use cannabis legislation.
Another recent change for SEPTA was a state-appointed special prosecutor beginning to prosecute incidents taking place on the transit system. That was the result of a bill that passed the General Assembly with bipartisan support and signed into law by Shapiro, despite opposition from Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, who argued it was unconstitutional.

State Attorney General Dave Sunday told NBC 10 in Philadelphia in late July that he believes the term for the prosecutor, which is set to expire at the end of 2026, should be extended.
“I think if it is extended, maybe with a few tweaks, I think that we will be in a place where we can really provide a tremendous value added to the citizens of Philadelphia,” he said.
Shapiro didn’t endorse or dismiss the possibility of extending it past the current deadline.
“Well, it’s in place until the end of next year,” Shapiro said in response to a question from the Capital-Star. “And if that’s an issue that’s important to folks who are involved in the conversations, I’m sure we’ll talk about it.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/septa_sign_august_2025_720.jpg,,,2025-08-10 18:56:31.953458

(Photo courtesy of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections)Rian Nyblom, 18, was sentenced to five years in prison Wednesday after pleading guilty to charges stemming from the death of a staff member at Wisconsin’s infamous juvenile prison, the Lincoln Hills School for Boys. Nyblom pleaded guilty in April to two counts of being party to a crime of battery by a prisoner, a deal which reduced felony murder charges, and dropped an additional battery charge, against the teen, the AP reported. 
Prosecutors say that in June 2024, tensions arose between a then- 16-year-old Lincoln Hills resident and a female guard who the teen felt was abusing her power. The 16-year-old threw a cup of what he believed was soap on her, and proceeded to punch her repeatedly. When the teen ran out into the courtyard 49-year-old staff member Corey Proulx followed. After Proulx scuffled with  the teen, he sustained a head injury after falling to the pavement. Proulx died a day later. 
Nyblom allegedly told investigators that he knew of the 16-year-old’s issues with the female guard. Shortly before the fighting began Nyblom retrieved extra soup and conditioner, he told investigators, and gave it to the 16-year-old. Nyblom said he hadn’t witnessed the attack on the female guard, but did see the teen hit Proulx. 
Nyblom was sentenced to five years in prison, with 405 days counted as time served. He was transferred to the Lincoln County Jail last year. The 18-year-old had been sent to Lincoln Hills after being charged with misdemeanor criminal damage to property and disorderly conduct. To those charges, AP reported, Nyblom pleaded no contest and was found guilty in May. 
The teen to whom Nyblom supplied the soup and conditioner, who is now 17, faces one count of first-degree reckless homicide, and two counts of battery by a prisoner, and is charged as an adult. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, with a trial expected to begin in February. It’s possible that the teen’s lawyers will attempt to move the case back to juvenile court.
As of Aug. 1, there were 80 boys in Lincoln Hills, four girls in the Copper Lake School, and 26 youth at the Mendota Juvenile Treatment Facility, according to the Department of Corrections’ latest population report. That’s slightly up from the 78 boys held at Lincoln Hills in late April. The higher population number at the juvenile prison was noted by the Lincoln Hills’ court-ordered monitor around that same time. The monitor also highlighted enduring staffing vacancies and, in the past, had complained about staff treating students poorly, even exhibiting racist behaviors. 
In August 2024, following Proulx’s death, Republican lawmakers wrote letters to DOC Sec. Jared Hoy saying that Lincoln Hills had become less safe, and blamed the consent decree for limiting the ability of staff to use force against juvenile residents.

Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires as of Aug. 8 had burned more than 100,000 acres in Colorado in 2025.
By that time it was already Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” extend across the majority of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least mid-August.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Here is a look at three 2025 Colorado fires:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 106,672 acres with 6% containment as of Aug. 10. It’s believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, is also believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It has burned an estimated 14,635 as of Aug. 8, and is 9% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 49% contained and has burned an estimated 28,403 acres since it was started by lightning on July 10.

Gov. Jared Polis recently issued disaster declarations for fires in Delta, Mesa, Montrose and Rio Blanco counties. On Aug. 6, he mobilized the Colorado National Guard to support firefighting efforts on the Lee and Elk fires.
Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm


















High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

Purists might have said the cross should have been flaming, but at least there were the hoods and the white robes and the desperate oaths and the silly language rife with the letter “k.”
This wasn’t the original Ku Klux Klan, the secret society formed by a half-dozen former Confederate officers in 1865 to terrorize newly freed Black people and to fight Reconstruction. That first Klan had been dismantled by 1872 and its hooded leaders jailed.
No, this was a reimagined Klan, a movement that had been sweeping Main Street America in a wave of nostalgia and bigotry. What was happening at night on the big hill just outside Coffeyville was similar to other meetings held across the country, with Protestant religion and patriotic fervor masking the worst impulses of those beneath the hoods.
The meetings weren’t strictly social occasions.
The Klan was organizing, running candidates for office, and attempting to insinuate itself into every aspect of civic life, under the guise that it was doing good charitable and patriotic work.
One citizen who wasn’t buying it was A.J. Valentine.
Valentine was the 39-year-old editor of the Coffeyville Morning News who thought the Klan meetings were both absurd and dangerous. In October 1922, he announced that the News had an informant in the ranks of the local Klan.
“One of the indoor sports in Coffeyville for several months has been figuring out who are the members of the cow pasture parties, held around Coffeyville about once a week,” a Page One notice read. “These parties have created so much interest that The Morning News has undertaken to enlighten its readers about them. So beginning tomorrow morning the News will start a serial story, giving the license tag numbers of these cars that assemble in cow pastures, also the owners of the cars, as shown by the secretary of state’s records.”
It was a risky move for Valentine.

A rival editor would later note, in a 1943 local history, that what Valentine may have lacked in discretion he made up for in bravery.
“Mr. Valentine was a courageous editor,” remembered local newspaperman C.C. Drake, who had helmed the Daily Dawn — a Klan newspaper. “He opposed the invasion of the Ku Klux Klan here and created a good deal of discussion as to the identity of his Klan reporter, who ignored the secrecy of the order and boldly published many inner happenings.”
Valentine’s paper was an upstart not yet three years old, struggling against the well-established Coffeyville Journal and other publications, including by 1923 the Daily Dawn.
Valentine had been born in Louisiana, married his wife, Mary, in Missouri, and had worked there as a bank solicitor. He came to Coffeyville in 1912 to become advertising manager for the Journal and was later elected county clerk as a Democrat. The Morning News had leaned Democratic from the start, Drake noted in his local history, but Valentine was never tied to party dogma.
The summer of 1922 had burned like a torch as the resurrected Klan spread its hooded influence across Kansas, its kleagles organizing new chapters in towns big and small. It may have seemed an unusual turn for a state that had been admitted to the Union as free on the eve of the Civil War, but that had been 61 years ago, and Kansans, like just about everyone else in America, had been buffeted by change.
A world war, a pandemic, and the disorienting rush of the Jazz Age had frightened many into longing for an imagined earlier time, a fictional America where there was moral order and political stability. There was also a cancerous nostalgic yearning for a time before so many people had so many freedoms. Like the old Klan, the resurrected version targeted Black people, Jews and Catholics.
Encouraged by the 1915 film “Birth of a Nation,” the first blockbuster, which portrayed the original Klansman as heroes and Black people and carpetbaggers as rapists and villains, Americans in the millions flocked to join the new “Invisible Empire.”
For them, the hood and robes and fiery crosses had become symbols for real Americans, an exclusive club of white Protestant men (although there was a women’s auxiliary). If old Nathan Bedford Forrest had lived to see the new Klan he would have been perplexed, because the organization claimed to revere the American flag, a symbol of union the original Kluxers reviled.
Most of the 1920s Klan members were described as solid middle class citizens, according to historian Tim Rives, who wrote a history of the Klan in Kansas City.
“The stimulus to this Klan’s creation is more mysterious” than the original Klan or the one that would resurface in the 1960s to oppose the civil rights movement, according to Rives. “Its program of Americanism, Protestantism, Law and Order, and White Supremacy (was) less definite than the simpler hates of other Klan eras. The amorphous character of the Klan of the 1920s gave it the flexibility to adjust to whatever local conditions it found.”
Coffeyville became a stronghold of Klan activity, with the local chapter of the Invisible Empire railing against the perceived lawlessness of South Coffeyville, a town a mile to the south, across the Oklahoma line. It was Prohibition, and the Klan said bootleggers from South Coffeyville were a corrupting influence. But then, it thought jazz music and teen necking parties were wicked, too.
Valentine’s Klan reporter, whoever he was, first appeared in the Oct. 11, 1922, edition of the Morning News. The writer took the tone of a society editor reporting a black tie affair.
“One of the most delightful cow pasture parties of the season was held on the big hill west of the city,” the piece began. “It was a masquerade affair, white robe and white mask completely concealing the identity of each guest. The decorations consisted of a large cross which was lit up with electric light bulbs — the cows having been removed before the fun started.”
In a ceremony called “naturalization,” an oath was administered to new members, requiring allegiance to the Invisible Empire. The initiates were required to swear they would die before divulging Klan secrets.
“The guests did not give their names to the News’ cow pasture society reporter but the following automobile tags were noticed attached to the cars that were assembled.” A list of 10 tag numbers and the names the secretary of state had registered for each vehicle followed.
“At a late hour refreshments were served,” the reporter noted.
Over the next few days, additional installments in the cow pasture saga identified more vehicles and their owners. Letters began appearing in the Morning News from citizens who claimed somebody else had borrowed their cars to attend the Klan meeting. In one case, the executive of a pipeline company said he was the owner of record for a number of company vehicles, but he couldn’t control the movements of every auto.
Some of the hoods, at least, were finally off.
Other Kansas journalists had squared off against the Klan, with Emporia’s William Allen White the most noted. But Valentine, a relatively obscure editor astride a powder keg of bigotry and popular influence, may have had the most to lose.
He certainly was among the most audacious.
But Klan influence continued to swell in southeast Kansas, culminating in the beating of a local mayor, Theodore Schierlmann. His offense? He was Catholic, had spoken out against the Klan, and had refused to rent a local hall for a Klan function.
“Reign of Terror is On,” a Morning News headline declared.
On Oct. 30, Gov. Henry J. Allen came to Coffeyville and during a speech at a local theater denounced the Klan. It was a secret order, he said, operating without benefit of a state charter as required of other social and fraternal organizations.
“We confront in Kansas an astonishing development of prejudice, racial and religious,” Allen said, as reported by the Associated Press. “It is seeking to establish the un-American idea that we can improve the conditions in the state by turning it over to a masked organization which arrogates to itself the right to regulate the individual.”
Allen, a Republican, said he had instructed the state attorney general to expel every Klan official from the state.
The organization, he said, “has taken the old Ku Klux Klan from its grave. It has set up the incredible philosophy that we require religious instruction from masked men whose characters and capacities are concealed by disguise.”
On Dec. 8, 1924, an explosion wrecked the publishing offices and plant of the Daily Dawn, the Klan newspaper. Nobody was hurt in the 1 a.m. blast, but damage was estimated at $75,000 — or about $1.4 million in today’s dollars.
“Nitroglycerine was used,” reported a Nevada, Missouri, newspaper. “Besides wrecking the newspaper plant the blast badly damaged an adjoining grocery store, a bicycle shop and a florist shop. Almost the entire roof of the Daily Dawn building was blown off and the front and rear walls were blown out. Windows for several blocks were shattered.”
The damage wasn’t covered by insurance, editor C.C. Drake said. The newspapers the Journal and the Morning News offered the use of their plants to Drake, who attributed the blast to bootleggers. Although there were various suspects over the years, there were no arrests. The paper ceased operations in 1925.
Also in 1925, the Klan was officially declared illegal in Kansas.
But the legacy of the Klan lived on, especially in places like Kansas City, where a former Klansman held office for 30 years, according to Rives. There were also at least 41 incidents of lynching of Black people across the state to 1927, and perhaps more.
Race relations in Coffeyville boiled over when a white mob of thousands stormed city hall in 1927 seeking to lynch three Black men. The men had been falsely accused of raping two white high school girls. Although the Klan was not involved in the riot, the incident had the potential to be a disaster similar to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, which left up to 300 Black people dead and destroyed the city’s prosperous African American neighborhood.
“The (Coffeyville) mob was driven back,” according to Geoffrey Newman in a 2013 master’s thesis, “first by Black deputies at the jail, then by armed African Americans who prevented their neighborhood from being torched. The National Guard occupied the city for five days.”
The incident was largely forgotten local history, Newman said, but deserved to be remembered.
“Coffeyville demands our attention because its activists won a victory against racism almost 25 years before the Montgomery Bus Boycott,” he argued. “Furthermore, the victory had its roots in a little-known court case that desegrated junior high schools statewide in Kansas 30 years before Brown. Yet these victories never created a national wave of change. Kansas … has remained remote from the centers of national discourse on race.”
In 1928, Valentine sold the Morning News. The paper was absorbed by the Journal the next year. In 1929, he took over as editor of a paper at Lincoln, Nebraska, and by 1940 was running a bookstore there.
Andrew Jackson Valentine died in 1966, aged 82.
His story — that of a small-town editor fighting a cultural torrent of hypocrisy and violence — is a just a minor part of the American saga. But it’s a story worth remembering, because all history is ultimately local history. What we do has meaning. Our individual acts of kindness and cruelty, our refusals to remember and our embrace of the past, imagined or actual, contribute to who we are as a nation.
Personally, I’d rather live in the America that A.J. Valentine thought was worth saving.

More than 60% of Idaho is federal public land. (Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)A Republican state senator from Nampa said he will introduce a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution that would prevent the state of Idaho from selling any future public lands granted or obtained from the federal government.
Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, said he will introduce the proposed constitutional amendment at the beginning of the 2026 session of the Idaho Legislature, which begins in January.
He hopes the amendment will go before voters in the November 2026 general election.
“The idea of selling public land really didn’t sit well with me,” Adams said in a phone interview Friday morning. “I have young kids and we like to hike and we like to fish, and our public lands here in Idaho have so many amazing places to do all of those things. Selling it off is just not an option in my mind.”

Access to public lands became a flashpoint this year after U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced an unsuccessful proposal in Congress that would have allowed millions of acres of public land, including in Idaho, to be sold off to the highest bidder.
Lee ultimately removed his public lands sell off proposal from an earlier version of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” following a public backlash that included opposition from within the Republican Party by U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch and U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, all R-Idaho.
How would the proposed public lands amendment in Idaho work?
If the amendment passes, it would create a new land trust and all future new public lands granted by or acquired from the federal government would be placed into that trust, Adams said.
The amendment would not change anything for the roughly 2.5 million acres of state endowment land Idaho already has, Adams said. Under the Idaho Constitution, existing state endowment lands are managed to secure the “maximum long term financial return” to the state and beneficiaries, which means the land can be sold. That’s not changing.
Instead, the new amendment would apply to all new and future public lands that would be placed into a new trust created by the amendment. That land could not be sold.
“In this new land trust, there is no provision for maximum financial return,” Adams said.
Instead, those new lands would be managed to allow for multiple uses, including recreation, timber harvest and grazing. Adams said revenue raised by grazing and timber harvest would support rural schools in communities that are surrounded by public lands and have a smaller property tax base.
As for the specifics of the amendment, Adams said he will unveil the text of the proposed constitutional amendment during a free, public kickoff event at noon on Aug. 15 at the Pine Cafe in the small mountain town of Pine, which is located in Elmore County and situated along the South Fork of the Boise River.
Adams picked the spot because he enjoys fishing in the area and Pine is surrounded by public lands, which guests will drive through and experience on their way to the kickoff event.
Adams, a retired U.S. Marine Corps sergeant who saw two combat tours in Afghanistan, said Idahoans have many different reasons for enjoying public lands.
“It’s where I healed when I came back from deploying overseas,” Adams said. “It’s wide-open and you can be all alone. On public lands every man is a king, and it is the only place in the world you can do that. It’s because it belongs to you, and it belongs to all of us.”
What is the process for amending Idaho’s constitution?
To pass, the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution must receive at least a two-thirds supermajority of support from both the Idaho Senate and the Idaho House of Representatives.
If that happens, the amendment would go before voters in the November 2026 general election, where it would require a simple majority vote to pass.
Although there is a high bar for amending the Idaho Constitution, Adams said support for public land crosses political lines and he is confident the amendment will receive the two-thirds support in both chambers of the Idaho Legislature.
“It’s a huge issue given the times we are living in, and it’s good to fight for something we all agree on,” Adams said.
Public lands have near universal public support in Idaho
More than 60% of all land in Idaho is public land of some form, including U.S. Forest Service land and Bureau of Land Management land.
Public land, where Idahoans and visitors enjoy hunting, hiking, fishing, camping, snowmobiling, bird and wildlife watching, climbing, skiing and more, is extremely popular with Idaho voters.
In the wake of this year’s proposed public lands sell off, a poll sponsored by Conservation Voters for Idaho found that 96% of all registered voters in Idaho believe public lands should stay in public hands, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Adams told the Sun he began working on his proposed amendment at the end of this year’s legislative session.
“At that point this idea had legs, but once Sen. Lee proposed selling off millions of acres of public lands, it gave this idea wings and I knew this was the right time to put it out,” Adams said.

(File photo courtesy of Jacob W. Frank/ Yellowstone National Park)A coalition of outdoor sporting groups intend to appeal the decision of a federal judge in Montana made last week that directed the federal government to reconsider whether gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains require additional protections under the Endangered Species Act.
The Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, Safari Club International and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation on Wednesday submitted their notice to appeal the decision of U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy of Montana to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Wolves remain under state control in Idaho following legal victory for conservationists 

“This ruling is the latest string of nonstop litigation by environmental groups seeking to frustrate the original intent of the ESA, which is to recover endangered species and return them to state-based management, not keep them perpetually listed and under the authority of the federal government,” Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation President and CEO Kyle Weaver said in a press release. “Whether it’s the wolf or the grizzly bear, once an animal receives ESA protections, it becomes nearly impossible to remove them, even if populations meet recovery criteria over an extended period of time. The ESA needs an adjustment to renew its focus on real species recovery.”
In Tuesday’s ruling, Molloy vacated a 2024 determination made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that gray wolves in the Western United States do not need increased federal protections.
Currently, gray wolves are listed as an endangered species in the contiguous 48 states, except in the Northern Rockies — Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of Oregon and Washington — after management of the species in those regions was given over to the states following Congressional action in 2011.
 Conservationists argued in lawsuit that states are using inadequate scientific methods to assess wolf populations

A coalition of more than 70 environmental and conservation organizations submitted a petition to the federal government in 2021, asking the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist gray wolves in the Northern Rockies, or create a western Distinct Population Segment, or DPS, for the species with added protections.
The coalition argued in its petition, and subsequent lawsuit following the Fish and Wildlife Service’s determination against added protections, that due to concerns that states are using inadequate scientific methods to assess population statistics, harsh political rhetoric and increased mandates in Montana and Idaho to reduce wolf populations, and because wolves do not inhabit the full extent of their historic range — which once broadly comprised the entire western U.S — the species meets the criteria for reconsideration under the Endangered Species Act.

“Management of Canis lupus must not be by a political yo-yo process,” Molloy wrote, adding that the federal government had “failed to use the best available science” in its species analysis.
Molloy’s ruling requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to reevaluate whether gray wolves should receive increased federal protections.
 Montana state officials disagree with federal judge’s wolf ruling

While members of the conservation coalition praised Tuesday’s decision, officials in Montana, which joined the lawsuit as an intervenor-defendant, and Idaho, which filed an amicus brief on behalf of the federal government, disagreed with the ruling by an “activist judge.”
“Montana has a healthy, sustainable population of wolves. While we are reviewing the decision, it will not implicate our state’s management efforts or our wolf season,” said Kaitlin Price, a spokesperson for Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office. “Unfortunately, we’re not surprised to see another activist decision in favor of environmental extremists.”
Price said that if the Fish and Wildlife Service appeals the decision, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks “will be there to support them.”
Price could not be reached before publication about whether the state and Fish, Wildlife and Parks would sign on to the current notice of appeal.
“We’re extremely disappointed with the decision considering Idaho has managed a wolf population above federal recovery goals for decades and sustained more-than-adequate wolf populations since Congress removed them from Endangered Species Act protection in 2011,” Idaho Fish and Game Director Jim Fredericks told the Idaho Capital Sun in a written statement.
Molloy’s ruling does not currently change the status of gray wolves, which are managed by each state’s respective wildlife agency.
In Montana, where gray wolves number approximately 1,100, Fish, Wildlife and Parks has proposed new hunting and trapping regulations for the upcoming wolf season that would set a statewide quota of 500 animals — up from 334 in 2024 — and would significantly increase bag limits allowing hunters and trappers to kill up to 15 wolves on a single hunting or trapping license, for up to 30 total wolves.
Arguments from the coalition in support of its appeal are expected to be filed soon, according to Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation staff.
“We had to appeal this decision,” Michael Jean, litigation counsel for Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, said in a press statement. “This decision seems to hold that unless a species is not recovered across its entire historical range, then it has to stay listed — regardless of thriving populations. It’s difficult to see how the wolf, or other listed species, will ever be deemed recovered under that standard.”

A new study found that hospitals are increasingly buying up private physician-owned practices, and costs for services are rising. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As more hospitals have gobbled up private physician practices, costs for childbirth and other services have gone up, according to a new study.
Since the early aughts, the share of physicians in the United States working for hospitals has nearly doubled, according to the study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization.
And as fewer doctors work in physician-owned practices, patients or their insurers end up paying more, the study’s authors found.
For example: Two years after a hospital buys an OB-GYN practice, prices for labor and delivery jump an average of $475 and physician prices rise by $502, according to the study. Researchers focused on births, which are the most common reason for hospital admission among people with private insurance.
This rapid acquisition by hospitals is reshaping a U.S. industry once dominated by tens of thousands of small, physician-owned practices.
Only about 42% of U.S. physicians work in a physician-owned private practice, according to the most recent survey data from the American Medical Association. Nearly 47% work for hospitals, a sharp rise over the past several years. Most emergency room physicians are now employed by hospital systems or by private equity-owned staffing groups.
The new research offers further evidence for how hospital acquisitions of private practices “can result in anticompetitive price increases,” said Matthew Grennan, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor of economics at Emory University, in a news release.
“As a result, I think economists and others in the antitrust community are likely to give more careful consideration to these potential sources of harm,” he said.
Medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, with about 14 million Americans owing more than $1,000 in medical debt, according to research nonprofit KFF.
These post-merger price increases are driven by reduced competition, Grennan and his fellow researchers found. Yet there’s been little effort by federal or state regulators to halt hospital mergers that could lead to higher prices for consumers.
But states have taken some steps toward lowering medical costs in recent years.
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have addressed so-called “facility fees,” which are charges that some hospitals tack on for patient visits to hospital-owned physician offices.
This year in Oklahoma, Republican lawmakers passed a bill requiring hospitals to make the cost of many of their services more transparent to patients so they’re aware of the costs. Providers can face penalties for noncompliance. A similar Oklahoma law authored by Democrats and passed last year requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients.
Some states have capped the rates hospitals or physicians can charge. Colorado sets provider and hospitals rates based on a specific formula if insurance plans aren’t able to lower peoples’ premiums to a certain level, while Montana and Oregon limited the amount hospitals and other providers can charge for their state employee health plan.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA, S.C. — South Carolina Republicans attending the party’s annual fundraiser received a surprise phone call Saturday night from a previous keynote speaker — President Donald Trump.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who’s seeking re-election next year, took to the stage of the 58th annual Silver Elephant Gala and held his cellphone to the microphone so the president could speak to the crowd that twice helped elect him to the White House.
The unexpected call upstaged the main speaker for the event: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
“I will never forget your great state. South Carolina is a special state, and you’ve made it that way,” Trump told the nearly 770 Republicans in attendance.
Graham never mentioned his own campaign for a fifth term. Instead, he let Trump do the talking about his “full endorsement” of South Carolina’s senior senator.
“He’s a great guy. Every time I needed him, he was there for me, so I just won’t forget it,” Trump said on the call, earning whoops from the crowd.
“I don’t think it’s going to be a contest,” Trump added about Graham’s re-election. “I have a feeling you’re going to do very well.”
The surprise call stemmed from the golf course. Graham said he and former U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy played golf with Trump earlier in the day, though he didn’t say where.
“President Trump is an incredibly good golfer,” he said in introducing the call. “I have never played with anybody that consistent all the time.”
During the three-minute call, Trump also gave shout outs to Gov. Henry McMaster, first lady Peggy McMaster and state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick.
As Trump said goodbye and told attendees to have fun, the crowd clapped and cheered. It was the biggest applause of the night.
Trump carried 55% and 58% of the vote in South Carolina in 2016 and 2024, respectively. And even though he did not win the national race in 2020, Trump took 55% of South Carolinians’ vote that year.
The dinner, which cost donors up to $1,000 for a private pre-dinner reception, is the state party’s largest annual fundraiser. When Trump was the keynote speaker in 2023, he drew a record crowd of more than 1,300 people.

Other past headliners include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2021 and former Vice President Mike Pence in 2008, when he was an Indiana congressman. Then-Gov. Ronald Reagan was the speaker in 1967 for the inaugural Silver Elephant. Other former presidents to give the keynote address include Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.
Candidates and endorsements
The gala came a day after former Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer suspended his bid to challenge Graham. Bauer announced his exit on social media just one month after launching his campaign.
Bauer’s departure left two Republicans in the race to unseat Graham. Paul Dans of Charleston, who attended the gala, said Graham’s Trump phone stunt “smacked of desperation.”
“It was a very bad miscue by the Graham campaign to try to force feed this endorsement to the people,” Dans, an architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, told reporters at the event.
Graham wasn’t the only 2026 candidate on stage Saturday.
Three other hopefuls “paid to sponsor for the privilege to come to address you beautiful people this evening,” McKissick announced before handing over the mic.
Attendees heard stump speeches from Attorney General Alan Wilson, who is running for governor; state Sen. Stephen Goldfinch of Murrells Inlet, who is running to replace Wilson as attorney general; and state Sen. Wes Climer of Rock Hill, who is running for Congress to replace another gubernatorial candidate, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of the 5th District.
“For those of you that are still on the fence, I just want the opportunity to earn your vote, earn your trust, to earn an opportunity to serve you as your governor,” Wilson told attendees.
Wilson, who’s in his fourth term as attorney general, was the only candidate among those who paid to speak who has an official GOP opponent for the June 2026 primaries.
So far, five Republicans have announced bids to replace McMaster, who can’t run again. Wilson was the first to hold an official launch event, though the race unofficially started soon after the November elections.
“The governor must not only be an agent of reform and change; the governor cannot be an agent of chaos,” he added.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of the coastal 1st District was the latest Republican to announce her bid, but she’s been pummeling her opponents on social media and at GOP events for months. She’s directed most of her ire at Wilson. Mace did not attend the gala.
Two other gubernatorial candidates — Lt. Gov. Pam Evette and Norman, the 5th District congressman — were there but did not address the crowd.
‘Know how to win’
In his main address following the campaign speeches, Youngkin invoked the fighting spirit of Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion.
He encouraged South Carolina Republicans to follow the Swamp Fox’s lead heading into the 2026 midterms that will decide whether the GOP will continue to control Congress.
“We don’t follow; we lead. And that is my challenge to all of you,” Youngkin said.
“Francis Marion showed all of us how to keep the fight alive,” he added, noting the country is gearing up to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution.
Youngkin pointed to the GOP supermajorities in both South Carolina’s House and Senate as a sign Republicans “know how to win” in the Palmetto state.
“And one of our largest missions in 2026 is to extend the majority in our House of Representatives in Washington,” he said. “That is a top priority.”
Youngkin’s election to governor in November 2021 put a Republican at the helm of the Old Dominion State for the first time in more than a decade.
“When you’re on the losing side, the consequences are dire,” Youngkin said. “When you’re on the winning side, Republicans can unleash prosperity and opportunity and lift up every South Carolinian, every Virginian, and every American. And because of those consequences, we have to continue to go to work.”
 

In his own race, Youngkin focused on education and tapped into parents’ anger over pandemic policies and classroom lessons in his upset win over former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who was the former Democratic National Committee chairman and chief fundraiser for the campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
His winning “parents matter” message helped fuel a GOP focus on parents’ rights.
In the wake of COVID-19, Youngkin said businesses were closing.
“We saw parents shut out of their children’s lives, and they were told boldly that parents should not have a role in determining what was being taught in our schools,” he told Silver Elephant attendees Saturday. “And for nearly a decade, more people were moving out of the Commonwealth of Virginia than were moving in.
“Now, a lot of them were moving here to South Carolina,” Youngkin added to laughter from the crowd. “A lot of them are moving here to South Carolina because South Carolina still believes in common sense conservative values: faith, family, and freedom.”
As for Youngkin, his term expires in January 2026. Virigina’s constitution does not allow governors to hold consecutive terms.
There’s some speculation he could make a bid for president in 2028. No mention of that was made Saturday.

U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who’s seeking re-election next year, took to the stage of the 58th annual Silver Elephant Gala and held his cellphone to the microphone so the president could speak to the crowd that twice helped elect him to the White House.

The unexpected call upstaged the main speaker for the event: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
“I will never forget your great state. South Carolina is a special state, and you’ve made it that way,” Trump told the nearly 770 Republicans in attendance.
Graham never mentioned his own campaign for a fifth term. Instead, he let Trump do the talking about his “full endorsement” of South Carolina’s senior senator.
“He’s a great guy. Every time I needed him, he was there for me, so I just won’t forget it,” Trump said on the call, earning whoops from the crowd.
“I don’t think it’s going to be a contest,” Trump added about Graham’s re-election. “I have a feeling you’re going to do very well.”
The surprise call stemmed from the golf course. Graham said he and former U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy played golf with Trump earlier in the day, though he didn’t say where.
“President Trump is an incredibly good golfer,” he said in introducing the call. “I have never played with anybody that consistent all the time.”
During the three-minute call, Trump also gave shout outs to Gov. Henry McMaster, first lady Peggy McMaster and state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick.
As Trump said goodbye and told attendees to have fun, the crowd clapped and cheered. It was the biggest applause of the night.
Trump carried 55% and 58% of the vote in South Carolina in 2016 and 2024, respectively. And even though he did not win the national race in 2020, Trump took 55% of South Carolinians’ vote that year.
The dinner, which cost donors up to $1,000 for a private pre-dinner reception, is the state party’s largest annual fundraiser. When Trump was the keynote speaker in 2023, he drew a record crowd of more than 1,300 people.
Other past headliners include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2021 and former Vice President Mike Pence in 2008, when he was an Indiana congressman. Then-Gov. Ronald Reagan was the speaker in 1967 for the inaugural Silver Elephant. Other former presidents to give the keynote address include Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.
Candidates and endorsements
The gala came a day after former Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer suspended his bid to challenge Graham. Bauer announced his exit on social media just one month after launching his campaign.
Bauer’s departure left two Republicans in the race to unseat Graham. Paul Dans of Charleston, who attended the gala, said Graham’s Trump phone stunt “smacked of desperation.”
“It was a very bad miscue by the Graham campaign to try to force feed this endorsement to the people,” Dans, an architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, told reporters at the event.
Graham wasn’t the only 2026 candidate on stage Saturday.
Three other hopefuls “paid to sponsor for the privilege to come to address you beautiful people this evening,” McKissick announced before handing over the mic.
Attendees heard stump speeches from Attorney General Alan Wilson, who is running for governor; state Sen. Stephen Goldfinch of Murrells Inlet, who is running to replace Wilson as attorney general; and state Sen. Wes Climer of Rock Hill, who is running for Congress to replace another gubernatorial candidate, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of the 5th District.
“For those of you that are still on the fence, I just want the opportunity to earn your vote, earn your trust, to earn an opportunity to serve you as your governor,” Wilson told attendees.

(Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)DES MOINES — U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins came to the Iowa State Fair Saturday to compete in the Governor’s Charity Steer Show — and to announce $152 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture investments for Iowa rural development projects.
Before heading to the Livestock Pavillion to show the steer Snoop Dog, Rollins announced that 19 projects in Iowa would receive funding through USDA Rural Development grant and loan programs. The announcement was made at a news conference where she was joined by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and state Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig.
Approved projects include a $37 million loan for the Guthrie County Hospital in Guthrie Center to expand and renovate its facility, a $5 million grant and $39 million loan for the City of Emmetsburg to replace its wastewater treatment facility, and a $27.7 million loan to the Southern Sioux County Rural Water System for the building of new wells, a treatment plant and transmission lines in Plymouth and Sioux Counties.
“This unprecedented, coordinated rural development project will help boost the rural economies, develop rural infrastructure and encourage private investments,” Rollins said.
Reynolds celebrated the investment and thanked Rollins for working closely with Iowa, saying “during this time of uncertainty in the ag economy, I’m so grateful to have a partner that we can rely on.”
She said the new investments will make a difference in rural Iowa communities. Reynolds said when she visited the Guthrie County Hospital in May, where she signed a law aimed at expanding medical training opportunities and rural health care access, the hospital CEO had told her about how much of a difference the USDA funding would make in helping the facility continue to provide health care in their community.
Rollins said the investment is part of a larger effort from President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress aimed at “putting farmers first again,” which she said is also being done through new international trade agreements, investments in farm safety net programs and agriculture components of the budget reconciliation bill passed.

Though much of the focus on discussing the “big, beautiful bill” has surrounded the cuts and changes to public assistance programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Rollins said the bill “protected two million family farms from the death tax,” increased reference prices and extended clean fuel production tax credits.
“Most of the mainstream media focused on, ‘Oh, these horrible cuts that are going to cause death and destruction across the world’ — which, of course, none of that was true,” Rollins said. “In fact, we were investing more money, Congress was, into our agriculture sector and putting farmers first.”
Some agriculture policy advocates have said the budget reconciliation bill, which cuts SNAP funding while increasing spending on farm subsidies, will further consolidate the agriculture industry and benefit wealthy farmers.
It’s the second event Reynolds and Rollins have held together this week. On Monday, the Iowa governor was in Washington, D.C. for a news conference where Rollins signed six waivers approving restrictions on purchases of certain food items through the SNAP. Rollins approved Iowa’s waiver to limit unhealthy foods available to buy through SNAP in May.
USDA also approved an Iowa waiver to implement an summer eating program for kids, called Healthy Kids Iowa, earlier in the year. The demonstration project, providing a box of food valued at $40 each month for families in need through 264 access points across the state, is an alternative to the SUN Bucks program, also known as Summer EBT, that provides $120 per child each month during the summer to eligible families that can be used at retailers accepting SNAP.
Both of these efforts are aimed at reducing unhealthy eating habits, the governor said, though hunger advocates have argued these steps make it more difficult for Iowans to access food assistance.
Rollins also spoke on her announcement in July for the USDA to restructure and consolidate parts of the agency, in part by relocating some of USDA workforce outside of Washington, D.C. to five regional hubs in North Carolina, Missouri, Indiana, Colorado and Utah.
The list has “no Iowa, but there are more announcements coming,” Rollins said. She said Iowa is well represented at the USDA, with many agency employees in the state and several Iowans in USDA leadership positions.
“The bottom line is moving the power out of Washington, returning the government to the people, and having people that are better able to serve our constituents, who are closer to them,” Rollins said. “So that is the bigger (arch), but more news coming in the days to come.”

In […]","When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, joined demonstrators outside the U.S. Supreme Court on May 15 to protest the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, as justices heard a challenge to the order. (Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A federal judge in Maryland ordered a nationwide halt — again — to a Trump administration order that sought to deny citizenship to babies born in the United States if neither parent is a citizen or green-card holder.
The ruling late Thursday by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman is the fourth to block President Donald Trump’s executive order since June. That’s when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges around the country had exceeded their authority by issuing nationwide blocks to presidential orders.
But the justices said lower courts could issue nationwide injunctions to class-action lawsuits on behalf of all newborns in the U.S. who might be affected. That’s what Boardman did Thursday.
Boardman rejected a request to include parents in the class-action suit.
But she identified a nationwide class of children born in the U.S. who “unquestionably would be citizens but for the Executive Order” — an order the judge said is “almost certainly unconstitutional.”
She wrote that the plaintiffs — eight undocumented mothers who are pregnant or gave birth in the U.S. — “are likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional claim because the Executive Order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth amendment,” which says that “all persons” born in the U.S. are citizens of the country and of the state in which they were born.
While the immigrants would be harmed in the absence of an injunction, Boardman wrote, there would be little harm to the government by continuing to extend birthright citizenship while the lawsuit plays out.
White House to delay birthright citizenship restrictions — but may start planning now

Boardman rejected the government’s argument that she should limit her injunction to Maryland.
“That relief must include every child in the United States who is subject to the Executive Order. After all, the Executive Order does not target only children born in Maryland; it seeks to deny citizenship to ‘persons born in the United States,’” she wrote.
A government attorney declined to comment Friday on the order, and emails seeking comment from the White House were not immediately returned.
But immigrant advocates welcomed Boardman’s order.
“This is a national issue that affects every single one of us in this country,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA, which filed suit with the immigrant women. (The national immigrant advocacy organization originally stood for Central American Solidarity Association.)
The Maryland suit was one of several around the country that were filed soon after Trump’s order on “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” which he issued on Jan. 20, his first day back in office.
It claimed that birthright citizenship was never meant to be a universal right, and it said that anyone born after Feb.19 — a month after the order was signed — would be denied citizenship unless one parent was a citizen or permanent legal resident.
The order was swiftly challenged. Three judges, including Boardman, issued nationwide injunctions to halt the order. When those were upheld on appeal, the government took the case to the Supreme Court, which said a national injunction could only be issued in a class-action suit with a legitimate nationwide class of plaintiffs.
Within hours of that ruling, attorneys for CASA were back in court, filing paperwork to turn their case into a class-action suit, adding women from North and South Carolina, among other states as plaintiffs.
Boardman’s approval of a class-action suit, and a national preliminary injunction, comes almost a month after a U.S. District judge in New Hampshire did the same thing.
Frimpong called Trump’s order “just a part of the usual fear tactics to make people afraid of what they believe the federal government will do — even though it will never happen because it is blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional.”
She said she anticipates that the Trump administration will again appeal the decision. She predicts the case will go through the ordinary course of litigation.
“What we are looking forward to is, once and for all, putting the issue to bed and our courts making absolutely clear that the 14th Amendment is not up for debate, and it’s not up for subjective interpretation,” Frimpong said. “It is the law, and it is going to remain the law.”

Political officials, environmental advocates and organizers speak at halftime breaks, and a recent fan-organized fundraiser collected over $25,000 for assistance to immigrant communities.

One was in the club’s first national championship game in the United Soccer League’s second tier, and the other was in a fan-organized fundraiser for assistance to immigrant communities.
During the club’s deep run into the playoffs, banners in the stands bore not just Vermont crests and “Allez les Verts” messages, but illustrations of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, and “Abolish ICE” in block letters. 
Political neutrality in soccer has been the subject of international debate at the professional level. According to Mike Jenack, a Vermont Green fan who organized much of the effort to raise over $25,000 for Migrant Justice and the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund, the club’s core identity is inextricable from its founding commitment to social issues. Political advocacy is not just a silver lining, Jenack said — it’s part of why people show up in the first place.

“I have conversations frequently with people who were never fans of soccer prior to attending a Vermont Green match,” he added.
“Sports are a place (where) people should be organizing,” said Patrick Infurna, the club’s co-founder. 
Infurna described environmental justice as “the center of our mission” for Vermont Green. It’s a goal that can contain a wide variety of issues, he said. The club’s 2024 mission report details its progress toward net-zero emissions, work to address systemic racism in the sport and donations to a number of local climate organizations.
In July, the club organized a raffle benefiting the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont. The nearly $4,000 raised will be a significant addition to the organization’s Farmer Emergency Fund for disaster relief, according to Lindsey Brand, a spokesperson for the organization.
“The way we tend the land and grow the food not only determines food is available for people to consume, but also how our ecosystems are stewarded,” Brand said. “Farming is really kind of a core intersectional issue.”
Beyond the club’s own limited capacity for advocacy, Infurna said, fans have created an independent network of social advocacy that springs from the same priorities. 
“We’re relying on the voices of our neighbors … to come use the platform that we’ve worked hard to build,” he said of the fans and advocates who speak at games.
The Green had its most successful season ever this year, with no losses in 22 games. The national final in Burlington, the hosts said, sold out “instantaneously.” They estimated over 5,000 people attended the game — twice the capacity of the ticketed stand.

Along with momentum on the pitch came unprecedented levels of engagement with the club’s socially-engaged fundraisers, Jenack said. His was by far the largest fan-run fundraiser in the club’s history.
Will Lambek, a spokesperson for Migrant Justice, said the club reached out shortly after its founding in 2022. This season, Lambek participated in halftime speeches at several games.
“It’s a great way to share the work of the organization and bring calls to action to a large group of people,” he said.
Lambek called the fundraising efforts at the end of the season both “tremendous” and well-timed.
“The workload is increasing because of the intensification of attacks against immigrant communities,” Lambek said.
At halftime in the national semifinal game on July 27, Lambek translated statements from Jose Ignacio “Nacho” De La Cruz, a farm worker who was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol in a high-profile incident in June.
Jenack said these speeches, heard by thousands of spectators, are an important part of the club’s culture. 
“They’re telling us what it is that they do and why it matters,” he said.
The club also has held themed games like “pride night” and “labor night” in its four seasons to date, during which the club highlights local leaders in relevant organizations, and sometimes organizes donations.

Mike Popovitch, a member of the Green Mountain Bhoys — a group of ardent Green supporters — is also in a leadership group of the Vermont Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, a local affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers. He said this kind of exposure can be important for unions to explain their work.
“A labor movement on its own cannot survive without community support,” Popovitch said.
The Green Mountain Bhoys have often been at the center of fan-led activism. The group announced a fundraiser Friday for Medical Aid for Palestinians.
The club’s affiliation with political movements has not come without disagreement, largely from visiting away fans, Jenack said. He urged any locals who don’t feel represented to attend anyway. 
“I’m still gonna shake your hand,” he said.
Infurna said he wanted to create an inclusive environment, but that the club wasn’t willing to be neutral on issues it feels are urgent.

“We don’t believe that we’re doing something so egregiously provocative or politically inappropriate,” Infurna said. “If there was somebody who is so uncomfortable with what our club is doing that they didn’t want to come, then I’m at peace with that.”

Dias Goncalves was arrested by federal immigration authorities shortly thereafter. (Screenshot from Mesa County Sheriff’s Officer YouTube)Mesa County is suing top Colorado officials over a state law that limits the type of information local law enforcement can share with federal immigration authorities, continuing fallout from a June traffic stop in the county that led to a Utah college student’s 15-day detention.
The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Denver, alleges that the Colorado law, known as Article 74, is vague to the point of being unconstitutional and interferes with the federal government’s constitutional discretion over immigration.
“The vagueness and lack of clarity surrounding the operation and scope of Article 74, coupled with the severe penalties and hardships for noncompliance, has caused confusion among law enforcement agencies, systemically chilled Plaintiffs’ interactions with federal law enforcement, and caused the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office to pull back from cooperation with federal law enforcement agencies,” the lawsuit says.



Article 74, created through bills passed in 2021 and this year, prohibits local law enforcement and government officials from sharing certain information with federal agents for the purpose of immigration enforcement. There are exceptions for active criminal investigations.
Earlier this summer, Mesa County Sheriff’s Deputy Alexander Zwinck pulled over a 19-year old college student from Utah, Caroline Dias Goncalves, for trailing a semitrailer too closely. Zwinck let Goncalves go with a warning, but told immigration officials about her presence in the county through a Signal group chat meant for drug enforcement operations. Goncalves, who is from Brazil and has applied for asylum, was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for nearly two weeks.
Afterwards, Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell placed Zwinck on a three-week unpaid leave and Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against the deputy.
Rowell is a plaintiff in the county’s lawsuit against the state.
 










We will not stand by while our employees are targeted for doing their jobs.


– Mesa County Attorney Todd Starr




“The statute’s lack of clarity creates a significant risk, as we’ve already seen, of arbitrary enforcement, which could lead to substantial fines and legal challenges against our employees,” Mesa County Attorney Todd Starr said during a county commissioner meeting on Tuesday. “This action sends a clear message: We will not stand by while our employees are targeted for doing their jobs. This step is not just lawful, it’s necessary. It protects those who protect our community and ensures they can continue to work without fear of politically motivated litigation.”
The lawsuit alleges that Article 74 has compromised criminal investigations in Mesa County related to drug smuggling, child exploitation and sex crimes because it limits collaboration with local and federal law enforcement.
The county wants a federal judge to clarify that law enforcement and government employees violate Article 74 only if they disclose personal information for the “sole” purpose of helping with immigration enforcement, and that local law enforcement can inquire about someone’s immigration status for “reasonable and legitimate law enforcement purposes.”
Weiser and Gov. Jared Polis are named as defendants.
In a statement, Weiser spokesperson Lawrence Pacheco wrote that Colorado’s law is clear that state law enforcement does not do federal civil immigration enforcement.
“It’s unfortunate that Mesa County filed this lawsuit. The Department of Law has a responsibility to follow facts and defend and enforce state law. We’ll continue to take this duty seriously,” he wrote.

(Illustration by Tara Anand for Bolts)This article was originally published in Bolts, a nonprofit newsroom, as a collaboration between Bolts and the Investigative Reporting Lab at Yale.
It was an idyllic Saturday afternoon on Feb. 5, 2022, as Kambran Young drove down Appalachee Street near downtown Birmingham with his two brothers and three of their best friends. Residents of the city’s Kingston neighborhood were outside, blasting loud music and washing cars as the group cruised up and down the street where they spent a lot of their time—the street where Jenkins’ and Young’s dad has his car repair business, and where their grandmother lives.
Young, 19 at the time, was the free spirit of the group, always looking for the next adrenaline rush. Justin Jenkins, one of Young’s older brothers riding with him that afternoon, remembers Young seeming restless before announcing to the car that he was thinking about stealing a wad of cash he’d spotted on a parking lot attendant’s stand a couple blocks away. Jenkins immediately tried to lure his little brother away from trouble, suggesting they go back to the nearby recording studio their father had built for them, where they had recently started making music together.
Colby Cade, another of Young’s older brothers who was also in the car that day, scolded him for even thinking of taking the money. “Sit your ass down somewhere, bro,” Jenkins remembers Cade telling the younger kids in the car. “Y’all wanna take from other people? They work hard for this stuff.”

As Cade and Jenkins left their brother with the rest of the group, Jenkins remembers asking their friend Robert, who was now driving, not to take Young back to the lot where he’d spotted the cash. “Don’t take them where they wanna go.”
Less than an hour later, Robert called Jenkins to say there had been an emergency, telling him to rush to the hospital. Young and their 17-year-old friend, Chico Guest, had been shot. “Stop playing,” Jenkins remembers saying before he felt himself begin to cry.
Young and Guest had gone to the lot to try and take the money after all, despite the pushback from Young’s brothers. While the state alleged that both Young and Guest were armed, Young and Jenkins maintain that Young was not carrying a weapon, and prosecutors never presented evidence that he did. According to Young, Guest carried a pistol, as he usually did, which he kept hidden in his sweatshirt pocket as the teenagers approached the parking lot stand. The attendant, who spotted the pair as they got close, pulled out a gun of his own and shot Guest in the chest.
Young, who ran away as fast as he could after Guest fell to the ground, was shot four times, with bullets hitting Young’s back and leg. Guest never got back up.
When Jenkins got to the hospital after an angry, anxious drive, he started to mourn the loss of Guest, who felt like a brother. Then he started to brace himself for the possibility of also losing Young, who’s been more like a twin all his life. The two were born just three months apart, to the same father and different mothers. They’ve been best friends since, and even look enough alike that people used to confuse them, with matching braids and each with tattoos of their respective moms’ names.
Jenkins prayed: Please give him one more chance, I know he’ll change. Cade tried to comfort his brother, telling him, “Kam loves you too much, he’s not going to leave you.”
Young awoke two days later inside a hospital room with around 40 staples in his stomach, and surrounded by police officers. Barely able to move, Young was handcuffed to a wheelchair and transported to the Jefferson County Jail. As he came to, Young started replaying the events of the shooting, asking himself over and over, Was there anything I could have done to save Chico?
Young says he was still in tremendous physical pain as he waited for police to question him and wanted to get home to be with family. He still hadn’t seen Jenkins.
Then the interrogation started, with police asking Young, who was still recovering from multiple gunshot wounds, to tell them everything he could remember from that Saturday.
During the interrogation, a detective asked Young whether he was aware that he was being charged with his friend’s murder. Young says he was dumbfounded and didn’t know how to respond, so the detective repeated himself: Chico Guest’s murder, you are being charged with Chico Guest’s murder.
Prosecutions for killings they didn’t commit
Felony murder is a particularly American form of punishment. The idea—that if you commit a felony, and someone dies in the process of that crime, you can be charged with murder, even if someone else committed the killing—was likely inherited from English common law. However, the U.K. abolished the doctrine in the 1950s, following public unease over the execution of a 19-year-old Londoner for the murder of a policeman, who had been shot and killed by a 16-year-old accomplice during a robbery. (Another doctrine similar to felony murder reemerged in the U.K. in the 1980s, but in 2016 the Supreme Court significantly limited its scope.)
While other Commonwealth nations like Canada eventually abolished their versions of the felony murder doctrine, the charge became even more widespread in the U.S. under mass incarceration. Today, forty-eight states permit some version of the charge.
Alabama is one of 14 states where felony murder can be applied most broadly, allowing prosecutors to charge defendants with the death of an accomplice, even when the killing was committed by someone else. Felony murder, like other murder charges in the state, is punishable by up to life in prison or even the death penalty—as illustrated by the case of Nathaniel Woods, who was executed in 2020 for the murder of three Birmingham police officers who were shot by someone else.
Law enforcement officials who prosecute people for murder under the doctrine say it aims to hold people responsible for creating dangerous situations with potentially fatal outcomes.
But critics of felony murder say the charge undermines baseline tenets of criminal law—namely, that murder requires criminal intent, or mens rea (Latin for “guilty mind”).
“Basic criminal law is that intentional murder requires mens rea and actus rea—criminal intent and criminal act. You learn that in your first semester of criminal law,” said defense attorney Mark McDaniel, who formerly served as a special assistant attorney general in Alabama. “Where is that in felony murder? It’s not there, there’s zero intent.”
The seeming disconnect of prosecuting someone for murder over a killing they didn’t actually commit often sparks public outrage and confusion around felony murder cases, including in Alabama, where McDaniel says the charge is still commonly used by prosecutors.
Darnell Coates and Lonze Byrd, for instance, were charged with the murder of William Michael Thomas, who died from a heart attack after confronting the men while they were trying to steal catalytic converters and other scrap from his recycling business in Greensboro in 2019; Thomas, 60, punctured the tires on Coates’ car to try and prevent him from fleeing and fired a warning shot before he collapsed. In 2021, law enforcement in Mobile charged Jamon Merrida and Demarcus Longmire with the murder of their friend Calvin Horne Jr., after the three went to buy marijuana and Horne was shot and killed by a third party. In 2022, Casey White was charged with murder for the death of a corrections officer who had helped him escape the Lauderdale County jail, and who subsequently took her own life following a high-speed police chase.
Another infamous case in Alabama shows how felony murder can allow police to kill someone and pin the murder charge on someone else. In 2015, LaKeith Smith, then 15 years old, and four friends broke into some unoccupied homes to steal video games and other electronics when a neighbor called the police. While Smith ran into the woods, one of his friends, 16-year-old A’Donte Washington, was shot and killed by one of the responding officers after allegedly running toward them with a weapon. Police charged the rest of the four teens with felony murder and prosecuted them as adults. Smith, who is Black and was the youngest among them, was the only one who refused to accept a plea deal and took his case to trial, where an all-white jury convicted him of murder; a judge sentenced Smith to 65 years behind bars, which an appeals court later reduced to 30 years.
There is no full accounting of how many people have been sent to prison for felony murder and for how long. In Alabama, like many states, officials do not specifically track felony murder charges but record them simply as murder—making the charge on Young’s record indistinguishable from premeditated or first-degree murder charges, with the same range of potential penalties.
In 2022, Sarah Stillman, a staff writer at The New Yorker, began working with students and colleagues at the Investigative Reporting Lab at Yale to gauge the scope and impact of the punishment. That work led to the Felony Murder Reporting Project (of which I am a part), which between early 2022 and late 2023 collected and analyzed over 10,000 cases of people charged with felony murder, to create a public data hub for exploring how the charge is applied across the country.
The Lab’s analysis revealed that felony murder is disproportionately imposed on low-income defendants, young people and people of color.
In Alabama, defendants with felony murder charges skew especially young, according to state records obtained by the Lab. Between 2009 and 2017, people charged with felony murder in Alabama were nearly nine years younger on average than those charged with other crimes.
During the same time period, 83 percent of people charged with felony murder in Alabama were Black, even though the state population is only about 27 percent Black. That means a Black Alabaman is 13 times more likely to be charged with felony murder than their white counterpart.
Records compiled by the Lab also show that, between 2009 and 2017, almost 10 percent of all murder charges in Alabama, or 281 cases, were actually for felony murder. Of those 281 people, 70 percent were convicted, meaning nearly 200 people in Alabama are likely still serving time behind bars for murders that they didn’t actually commit.
Jenkins was shocked when his brother became one of them. “I just never got it,” he said. “I never understood it.”

‘I really don’t know how to take it’

Jenkins and Young liked Chico Guest right away, after the brothers met and started hanging out with him on Appalachee Street as teenagers. Young, the more outspoken and adventurous of the brothers, got along especially well with Guest. “He had this confidence about himself,” Young told me.
Guest is one of the many people Jenkins and Young have lost to gun violence since childhood—including Guest and three of their brothers. Jenkins was in fourth grade the first time he witnessed gunfire, when he saw his brother’s friend die in a drive-by shooting. “I was traumatized,” he said of the memory.
Jenkins told me that, in the northeast Birmingham neighborhood where he and Young grew up, people start carrying guns in their early teens as a matter of survival. Jefferson County, where Birmingham is located, has seen a record number of homicides in the past several years, though killings have recently started to fall below pre-pandemic levels (as they have in much the rest of the country).
Jenkins says Young was aware that Guest was carrying a pistol the day of the robbery, but didn’t register it as a serious threat or consider the possibility that it might actually be used, because guns were so routinely present. Looking back at Young and Guest now, over 3 years later, he sees their mindset at the time of the robbery as impulsive, shortsighted and careless—but not as violent.
  A growing body of research in criminal psychology is beginning to take this characteristic of the adolescent mind into account when assessing the culpability and sentencing of young people.

A growing body of research in criminal psychology is beginning to take this characteristic of the adolescent mind into account when assessing the culpability and sentencing of young people. Research shows that the prefrontal cortex of the brain, critical for impulse control and decision making, continues to develop well into the mid-20s.
Over the past two decades, the U.S. Supreme Court has abolished the death penalty for those under 18, banned life without parole sentences for non-homicidal juvenile crimes, and deemed it unconstitutional to automatically sentence juveniles convicted of homicide to life without parole. In recent years, a wave of states, including Massachusetts and Michigan, have also restricted life sentences for young adults up until age 21, blurring the bright line distinction for adulthood that the criminal legal system has traditionally set at age 18.
Some other states, like Pennsylvania, have also started to assess whether extreme sentences for felony murder, like life without parole, violate state and federal constitutional protections. In a high-profile case now before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, critics argue these harsh sentences are disproportionate and fail to account for individual culpability, especially for young or minimally involved defendants.
As the law stands today in Alabama, prosecutors aren’t required to consider a defendant’s age, unless they’re under 14, or degree of direct involvement in a killing when deciding whether to charge them with murder.
Young spent over one year waiting to be indicted, and more than two years overall waiting for trial. At the start, he was bailed out by his dad and placed on house arrest, where he and Jenkins had time to process Guest’s death and Young’s criminal case together.
Jenkins visited Young at home nearly every day during the year he spent on house arrest. “We were talking about life, thinking about the things we wish we never did, wishing life had a rewind button,” Jenkins said.
Sometimes the brothers would visit friends or go to the studio when Young’s probation officer allowed it. “We rap about what’s going on and what we’ve been through,” Jenkins said. “We make pain music.”
They call one song that they wrote together their “Letter to Chico,” which currently has more than 130,000 views on YouTube:
“I remember the day my brother died, yeah I swear I cried. 
Holding all this shit inside, I swear it left me traumatized. 
Baby boy I miss you, Imma ride until I blow the tires.”
Young’s bail was revoked in 2023 when he missed a court date, which he says he didn’t know about because he hadn’t been notified of the hearing. He found out he had to go back to jail after his dad was told that Young had 21 days to turn himself in, or else his dad would lose his house, which had been posted as collateral to cover his bail. Young cried nearly every one of those 21 days, and turned himself in on the last morning he could.
Jenkins’s daughter was born just days after Young went back to jail. “I was trying to keep him out so he could see my baby,” Jenkins told me.
In the spring of 2024, Young’s attorney informed him that he’d negotiated a deal with prosecutors to drop the felony murder charge in exchange for him pleading guilty to manslaughter, a Class B felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
Young recoiled at the idea of pleading guilty to something he didn’t do, but worried that taking the case to trial would nevertheless result in him being convicted for murdering his friend.
On April 8, 2024, Young pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Chico Guest, one of his closest friends, and was later sentenced to up to 15 years in prison, with the possibility of parole in 2028.
As we talked about the felony murder charge, and how it ultimately persuaded him to enter a guilty plea for a lesser charge, Young still seemed to be processing the sequence of events that led to his prison sentence. “I really don’t know how to take it, or explain how I feel,” Young told me.

Seeking law changes

Last year, as Young started serving his prison sentence inside Kilby Correctional Facility, advocates 15 miles away in Montgomery were lobbying for legislative changes to prevent felony murder charges in cases like his. House Bill 32, filed during the Alabama Legislature’s 2024 session by Chris England, a Democratic state representative from Tuscaloosa, would have narrowed the state’s felony murder law to exclude cases where the killing was committed by a third party—like when a cop or a store clerk kills someone’s accomplice during a robbery.
When discussing the legislation at an Alabama House committee hearing last year, England said, “What we’re trying to do is something where we don’t ensnare someone that shouldn’t be serving the range of punishment of a class A felony because of some unfortunate incident that occurs that they were not involved with, and that they didn’t intend to happen.”
Among the advocates who spoke in support of the bill at the committee hearing was Andre Washington, the father of A’Donte Washington, who was shot and killed by a police officer while committing a burglary, leading to the felony murder convictions of four of his friends, including LaKeith Smith, who remains in prison.
“This is the first in-person public statement I’ve ever made, and I’m doing this in support of HB 32,” Washington told lawmakers during the hearing. “My son lost his life, and now I’m having to sit and watch another son’s life be thrown away.” Brontina Smith, LaKeith’s mother, also testified at the hearing in support of the bill.
HB 32, however, stalled in the committee without a vote after three district attorneys spoke in opposition, including CJ Robinson, who prosecuted LaKeith Smith.
Months after he testified against HB 32, Robinson told me in a phone interview in late August 2024 that, despite his opposition to the reform bill, he was open to proposals for narrowing the application of felony murder. He explained that he disagreed with the bill’s suggested elimination of proximate cause—the idea that someone can be enough of an indirect cause for someone’s death to be treated as though they themselves directly committed the murder—saying a defendant in Smith’s position had “created that situation that ended up with a friend dying.”
But Robinson did seem to be reconsidering the fairness of the charge he prosecuted against Smith and his friends. “Old fashioned intentional murder shouldn’t carry the exact same range of punishment and class of felony as what Lakeith Smith did,” Robinson told me. “I don’t know if I would have this opinion if I hadn’t lived that case.”
Alabama lawmakers this year didn’t file any proposed legislation to reform how felony murder is prosecuted.
Young, who has spent the last year trying to adapt to his new life in prison, says he feels lucky to have a family who supports him; Jenkins and his mother still call him every day.
But incarceration doesn’t insulate him from the trauma that gun violence continues to inflict on his community back home. Last February, while he was still awaiting trial at the Jefferson County jail, he called his mom soon after seeing news of a murder near his neighborhood pop up on TV, only to have her confirm his worst fears: Colby Cade, one of his brothers, had been shot and killed.
Young, who had spoken to Cade earlier that day, remembers being speechless, how he could barely breathe and just cried. He spent the next eight days in his cell and was placed on suicide watch.
“We felt so bad for him that he wasn’t with us,” Jenkins told me. Young wasn’t able to grieve alongside his family.
Still, Jenkins lights up when he’s thinking about the future with Young. He says they dream of one day moving to New York together and making music.
When Jenkins looks back on that fateful day in February 2022, what strikes him is that every other guy in that car with him cruising down Appalachee Street is now either dead or incarcerated. “I’m the only one here,” he said.
Jenkins is beginning to release music again—a practice he had stopped since Young’s arrest, Cade’s death, and the birth of his daughter. Although he can see how difficult this period has been for his brother, Jenkins says he also feels proud of Young.
“He’s changed, he’s growing up,” Jenkins said. “He wants to do the right thing, and his conversations, the way he talks, he’s just totally different.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Illustration-for-Aug-10-2025-story-1024x695.jpg,,,2025-08-10 08:56:10.270035

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)It’s not as bad as it could’ve been: That’s the new bar for public health success in South Dakota.
The leader of the state Health Department, Melissa Magstadt, made that clear Thursday when she declared herself “so proud” of the state’s measles response.
In an opinion piece she wrote and sent to the media, Magstadt summarized the state’s efforts since measles cases surged earlier this year in other parts of the country and reached South Dakota in May.
Her staff identified at-risk counties, provided updated advice for health care providers, increased the state health lab’s testing capacity, notified over 400 potentially exposed people, helped concerned patients review their vaccination records, and conducted pop-up immunization clinics.
Results of SD’s special measles clinics: 14 vaccinations, including zero in seven of 11 locations

There were some missteps, too, which we at South Dakota Searchlight pointed out in a recent news story that might have motivated Magstadt’s piece.
In June, when the department announced a schedule of measles vaccination clinics in 11 cities, the announcement didn’t say whether the clinics would be free — an important bit of information to share when trying to avert the rapid spread of a disease. The department eventually told us it provides immunizations “at no cost when insurance isn’t an option.”
It took us weeks to learn the results of the clinics, after the department initially claimed that disclosing numbers would violate patient confidentiality. When we finally pried the data free, the likely reason for the secrecy was apparent. At seven of the 11 announced locations, nobody got vaccinated for measles on the days of the special clinics, while a total of 14 measles immunizations were administered at the other four locations.
Although those clinics were largely a bust, the department said its other efforts have helped to push the number of measles vaccinations in the state past 6,000 this year, which is about 1,200 more than the same time last year.
The department deserves credit for that, and for helping to stop the spread of measles at 12 known cases so far. Magstadt said the absence of any new cases during the past four weeks is evidence that the state “has done remarkably well.”
That’s as it should be. When an infectious disease threatens South Dakotans, we should expect no less of our Department of Health than to do its job. We should’ve expected more of the department before the crisis arrived, and we should expect more of it going forward.
Magstadt didn’t mention in her opinion piece that the state’s kindergarten measles vaccination rate tumbled from 97% to 90% during the past 10 years, while she and other public health officials failed to effectively counter the false and conspiratorial narratives about vaccine safety and efficacy that drove the decline. Nor did she mention the role of falling vaccination rates in the return of measles after the disease was eliminated in the United States 25 years ago.
Magstadt seems uninterested in asking what went wrong, choosing instead to proclaim victory amid a still-unfolding situation and insisting that South Dakota did “so well” at limiting the spread of measles “because we were ready.”
If scrambling to contain the predictable results of a decade-long drop in the vaccination rate is what passes for preparedness in South Dakota, maybe we need to set the bar for disease prevention a little higher.

Our wildlife biologists apply methods that are used all over the world with positive results. To denigrate their professional efforts is to be totally out of touch with reality. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Devon Craig: A response to a commentary on Vermont wildlife .","Dear Editor,
It’s interesting that Brenna Galdenzi’s opinion piece starts off with a Walt Disneyesque description of animal behaviors. 
They are not humans and should not be treated as such. Every second of every day, a bear kills a deer, a coyote kills a woodchuck, a hawk kills a chipmunk. They don’t talk with each other. 
She notes that our history of hunting is not in tune with the times and that our traditions are no longer viable. I guess she forgets about the hunting, fishing and trapping communities self-regulating that everyone — herself included — benefits from. 
I am referencing the billions of dollars made available through taxation of which the hunting and fishing communities levied upon themselves have paid for untold millions of acres of lands for wildlife to live in — dollars in the amounts of which non-consumers of wildlife will never equal or exceed. But they, too, receive the benefits of our largess.
Those dollars have supported our country’s fish and wildlife departments for many decades, allowing the scientific results of wildlife biologists’ studies to benefit viable numbers of wild animals. To denigrate their professional efforts is to be totally out of touch with reality. 
Wildlife management is a work in progress. With human influence in our land becoming greater every day, it is now, more than ever, the time to use science to solve problems — not simple emotions.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As more hospitals have gobbled up private physician practices, costs for childbirth and other services have gone up, according to a new study.
Since the early aughts, the share of physicians in the United States working for hospitals has nearly doubled, according to the study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization.
And as fewer doctors work in physician-owned practices, patients or their insurers end up paying more, the study’s authors found.
For example: Two years after a hospital buys an OB-GYN practice, prices for labor and delivery jump an average of $475 and physician prices rise by $502, according to the study. Researchers focused on births, which are the most common reason for hospital admission among people with private insurance.
This rapid acquisition by hospitals is reshaping a U.S. industry once dominated by tens of thousands of small, physician-owned practices.
Only about 42% of U.S. physicians work in a physician-owned private practice, according to the most recent survey data from the American Medical Association. Nearly 47% work for hospitals, a sharp rise over the past several years. Most emergency room physicians are now employed by hospital systems or by private equity-owned staffing groups.
The new research offers further evidence for how hospital acquisitions of private practices “can result in anticompetitive price increases,” said Matthew Grennan, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor of economics at Emory University, in a news release.
“As a result, I think economists and others in the antitrust community are likely to give more careful consideration to these potential sources of harm,” he said.
Medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, with about 14 million Americans owing more than $1,000 in medical debt, according to research nonprofit KFF.
These post-merger price increases are driven by reduced competition, Grennan and his fellow researchers found. Yet there’s been little effort by federal or state regulators to halt hospital mergers that could lead to higher prices for consumers.
But states have taken some steps toward lowering medical costs in recent years.
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have addressed so-called “facility fees,” which are charges that some hospitals tack on for patient visits to hospital-owned physician offices.
This year in Oklahoma, Republican lawmakers passed a bill requiring hospitals to make the cost of many of their services more transparent to patients so they’re aware of the costs. Providers can face penalties for noncompliance. A similar Oklahoma law authored by Democrats and passed last year requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients.
Some states have capped the rates hospitals or physicians can charge. Colorado sets provider and hospitals rates based on a specific formula if insurance plans aren’t able to lower peoples’ premiums to a certain level, while Montana and Oregon limited the amount hospitals and other providers can charge for their state employee health plan.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-10 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,What if the government gave you public money to spend at Disneyland?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/10/public-money-school-choice-disney/,"Column: Would you like some public funds to take your family on vacation to Disneyland? Under the logic of some politicians who support ""school choice,"" it's not out of the realm of possibility.","A new grassroots movement is developing that would allow public money to follow what we’ll call the “recreator,” or a person who participates in recreational activity.
It makes sense. Why should a person be forced to provide his or her hard-earned money to support local and state park systems if they are not using them?
Would you like to take your kids to Disneyland, but you’re worried about how much it will cost your family? That’s OK, the government can give you back some of the tax money you paid to keep your town’s public parks open and subsidize your trip. You don’t use those local parks much anyways, and you could argue you’d personally get more out of the Disney trip.
Or, instead of paying for the parks with your tax money, take it to help purchase a gym membership or in-home exercise equipment — maybe even a backyard swing set. Instead of paying for public libraries, your tax funds could be used to purchase the books you want to read.
These ideas, of course, should read as extremely unserious. As much as we may like to pay lower taxes or have the public subsidize our vacations and lifestyle habits, most would agree a family trip to Disneyland or these other expenses would be an egregious use of money intended to improve our communities.
But these exact ideas are being increasingly touted by state leaders as part of the argument used by those supporting vouchers or even tax credits to provide public funds to allow students to attend private schools.
They argue that the tax dollars intended to boost public school should instead be spent by the parents of the students and not the government. After all, it’s their money. The parents of students should be able to use those funds to educate their children anyway they see fit.
To go a step further, the “school choice supporters,” as they call themselves, also contend that there should be no accountability for the schools or other entities receiving those education dollars. Trust in the parents is apparently the only accountability that the government needs.
Never mind the wild possible scenarios that could play out. Let’s say parents get mad because their child’s grades are slipping. The parents with a voucher to a private school tell the administrators they are transferring little Johnnie unless little Johnnie makes certain grades. The easy solution for the school administrators could be to give little Johnnie that grade demanded by the parents so that the school can continue to collect the public education dollars.
This “parents know best” argument neglects the important fact that there are many taxpayers who are paying to support the public schools who have no children. Taking this argument to the extreme: perhaps people who do not have school-age children should be able to keep their funds rather than funding schools where they have no personal connection.
That counter argument, of course, is also ridiculous and ignores the premise that was established at our nation’s founding. Americans don’t pay taxes for individual purposes. They pay taxes for the common or societal good.
The primary goal of taxes is to ensure a better school system not just for one student, but for the general public.
The goal of taxes is not to provide a good park in your neighborhood or a smoothly paved road in front of your own house — though that does seem to be the goal of some Mississippi lawmakers recently — but to provide good, safe public spaces and an adequate transportation system for all of us.
Granted, those goals are not always achieved, especially in many communities across Mississippi. But if there is no tax money to pay for public schools, public parks, public libraries, public law enforcement, we all suffer. Better public schools in particular can only build a better community, a better economy and a better state.
People want to live in areas where there are good schools, good parks, good libraries, good transportation systems and other public services.
If we pull tax revenue out of the coffers they were intended to support, what are we left with? It’s worth considering what our public school system — and our communities in the present and future — would look like with even fewer public resources.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08103448/AP24108573586959.jpg,,,2025-08-10 07:56:12.200082

Listen to the full interview.
WATERBURY— Nick Deml, Vermont’s outgoing corrections commissioner, wants the public to know that more and more is being expected of Vermont’s prisons, both from federal immigration authorities and the state’s human services landscape. 
“Today, the expectation is that the corrections agency does everything,” he told VTDigger in a wide-ranging interview this week. “That’s a good thing for the most part, but we’re expected to provide education, we’re expected to provide substance use treatment, we’re expected to provide the community standard of health care.” 
Deml will will step down Aug. 15 after almost four years leading Vermont’s prison system

Former Burlington Police Department Chief Jon Murad will take the reins, overseeing the state’s six detention facilities, more than 900 employees and almost 1,600 incarcerated individuals.  
In an interview with VTDigger, Deml discussed the learning curve inherent in taking over the department as an outsider without previous prison experience. He detailed the challenges facing corrections, like improving working conditions in order to retain security staff and working with a population of incarcerated individuals in need of more care than they were prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Deml also addressed some of the more public struggles the Department of Corrections has faced, from replacing the state’s ailing women’s prison, Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, to the increasing burden of working with federal immigration authorities. 
After leaving the department, Deml said he plans to begin consulting on projects related to corrections as well as his past work in national security. He did not rule out a return to government work, but did swat away rumors of a run for office. 

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
VTDigger: Why did you take this job?
Nick Deml: It’s an interesting question, because when I took the job — before and even since — people say ‘this has got to be the hardest job in state government,’ or maybe the Department for Children and Families Commissioner, which I actually think is probably harder.
It can be kind of thankless. There’s a couple of things that motivated me to do the job. One, I wanted to work in Vermont. (Two), I wanted to stay in government and public service, and I think you’d be hard pressed to find another role in Vermont that can have the impact that you can have as the commissioner of Corrections. The number of lives you touch, either people in your custody, people in the community that you’re serving. 
VTD: What do you think you didn’t understand about the job going in? 
ND: I didn’t come from a corrections background, and so there was certainly a learning curve on the front end, as there would be with any job, particularly a job of this scope and scale. But I think I underappreciated the complexity of corrections. I think initially I didn’t understand the scale or scope of the workforce crisis, the staffing crisis that we were experiencing. 
And then I think we all were on a learning curve, but by myself chiefly among us, to understand how much we changed during the pandemic, and particularly looking at our incarcerated population. I think we expected health trends to rebound and we’d go back to kind of 2019 levels of everything. And that was not the case. In fact, coming out of the pandemic, the folks that were coming into our system in particular were much sicker than they were in 2019, and that hasn’t abated. 
VTD: Do you think being an outsider made it more challenging to deal with the rank and file and have some of those workforce conversations with the union?
ND: I don’t think it made it harder to talk to our folks on the line. What I heard when I went out, especially initially, for those first, you know, year, 18 months, every time I went to a facility and met with folks, they would say, ‘It’s been a long time since we’ve seen a commissioner. I’ve not met a commissioner before.’ 
That opportunity to connect with them at their worksite, where they’re working, where they’re doing the mission, I think that is what enabled me to connect with our workforce really closely. And I think that wouldn’t matter if I was a career corrections officer or somebody off the street. You need to find ways to connect to those folks, and they’re yearning for that. They’re the folks on the ground doing the work every day, and we drifted a little bit, I think, from them. And so our mission over the last four years was really to build back that trust with our workforce, show them that we care. And I think we did that.
As it relates to the union, I think it cuts both ways. On the one hand, I don’t think they really knew what to do with me, because I wasn’t the commissioner they were used to. And on the other hand, I think they didn’t give — I don’t know, ‘respect’ is too strong of a word — but I don’t think that they were willing to engage me the way they would have somebody they’d known for a long time.
VTD: The workforce crisis has gotten better but hasn’t completely abated. There’s still mandatory overtime. (Officers are sometimes required to work 16-hour shifts.) What has worked, and what hasn’t worked?
ND: Vermont has a workforce crisis writ large. We’re an aging state. We have a decreasing number of working-age adults, and so there’s just fewer and fewer people available to do the work. 
Then you bring that down to corrections. Corrections nationally is having this staffing crisis pretty much everywhere in the country. We were at a high vacancy rate in our security ranks of 32% vacant. Today, some of the corrections agencies around the country are over 50%. 
We’re down now to 15%, and that’s great, but there’s mandatory overtime. The work-life balance isn’t there yet. Folks are stressed, it’s a tough job on its best day, and then you add the extra hours in, and it becomes very, very difficult. 
So what’s worked? I mean, we took the opportunity early in my tenure, but I think about a year into my tenure, to really go out and do focus groups, do surveying, meet with staff in the facilities to talk about, what are the pain points for them? Why would you continue working here? Why would you consider leaving? Instead of trying to decipher what we thought the problems were, we got really salient, really fairly consistent results across the entire system. And that was, ‘I’m not getting enough time away from the facilities. Work life balance isn’t there. The facilities are hard places to work. I’m not getting the supervision I’m seeking.’ 
What we didn’t hear is, ‘I don’t get paid enough.’ So it’s really for me, when we started to diagnose the workforce challenges, it’s about the experience of staff working in the system, and if we can improve that experience, we’re more likely to keep folks. Now, we did increase pay. We put more than $30 million into additional compensation over the last three years for correctional staff. We’ve added other benefits. We have a great partnership with the Community College of Vermont providing free community college education to staff. Until we can materially change the experience of a correctional officer on a day-to-day basis, going to work and having work-life balance, we’re going to continue to suffer here. 
VTD: To change staff’s experience, I imagine you need to change the facilities themselves — what they look like. There’s been an ongoing struggle to build a new women’s prison. Are we as a state still capable of building a new human services property, of siting a new facility?
ND: I mean, I hope so. At the end of the day, one of the primary functions of a state government is to provide human services. If we are going to continue to face very difficult situations trying to build new human services facilities, then the state won’t be able to deliver on its mandate. 
But I do think there’s hope. I think that we will build a new women’s prison. I think it will be a significantly different experience at that facility than hopefully any facility in the country, but certainly any facility that Vermont has ever had. 
But we’re not going to replace all the men’s facilities, certainly not in the next short period of time. I think it’ll be decades before we do that. So what do we do with the facilities we have? And that’s where we’ve tried to focus in, to improve the staff experience, by creating spaces that are dedicated to staff so they can decompress, recoup, take breaks. We’ve tried to change paint schemes and things like that just to soften the facilities. And we advocated very strongly for HVAC systems for our correctional facilities. So we’re on a multi-year project to put air conditioning throughout the system. 
VTD: You’ve described the communication breakdown or a stalemate with the town of Essex in trying to build a new women’s prison. What can change in that process? Does the state need to throw its weight around more? How does this get done? 
ND: I think Vermont as a community really leans into collaboration and partnership, and so I think that’s the space where I hope we can make the most ground up.
I understand folks don’t want the concept of a prison in their backyard, and I appreciate that. And yet, I think if you talk to the neighbors around the Chittenden facility, the current women’s facility in Vermont, they would say, ‘We like having them as our neighbors.’ I know that because we’ve talked to them, and that’s what they say. The police chief, the fire chief, local businesses have appreciated that facility being there. We’ve been good neighbors to them. They’ve been good neighbors to us. And it is part of our community, whether people want to acknowledge that or not.
I think the situation in Essex will get better. We’re trying to build a complicated human services facility in a community that hasn’t had that in the past, and so, you know, they’re going through iterations too, and there’s going to be some growing pains. But I have confidence that the town leadership will continue to advance this project. We don’t want to get to a place where the state is trying to exert control, because that’s not going to get us the best outcomes. 
VTD: Compared to commissioners past, you’ve been a more ubiquitous face. People see you on the news. Your department has taken a different media strategy than others. What’s the thinking behind that approach? 
ND: I’m a firm believer in transparent government. We’re here to serve our communities, and to do that effectively, communities need to see us and what we’re doing.
I do think we’ve really benefited from transparency. It’s helped us to re-establish credibility where it was lost. It’s helped us to elevate the work. I mean, we have almost 1,000 staff in the Department of Corrections, and they’re public servants. They’re doing really hard work every day. And I think in general, people either don’t think about it or don’t respect the profession. And I wanted to change that as part of my work here.
VTD: Do you want to run for political office?
ND: I’ve been getting this question a lot lately. I have no interest in running for office. You know, the interesting thing about that, I mean, there’s nothing about running for office that is appealing to me. But doing these jobs, having the opportunity to serve the public and being able to do the work is what’s appealing. And so, you strip the politics away from it, the government work is, I think, the important part.
VTD: It seems like in the last couple of years, the governor and his team have pushed for what might be labeled ‘tougher on crime’ policies (like a public safety package in 2025 and new crimes targeting drugs and retail theft in 2024). Your department has pushed for more progressive approaches to problems like substance use. Do you feel like you’ve been working at cross purposes?
ND: I mean, I don’t think so. You’re right, the corrections agency doesn’t get to decide who comes to us. So our job, our mandate, is to receive whoever is sent there and take care of them as best we can. So that’s care, food service, health. And helping folks go back to the community to be successful. 
And while we’re doing that, certainly I think the communities that I’ve heard from are really struggling to adapt to the substance use crisis that’s been kind of plaguing Vermont over the last several years. These kind of low-level repeat crimes over and over again — what do you do with somebody like that? And so that public policy debate has been going on, but it’s really outside the scope of the department. Our job is to take care of the folks when they come to us, and I think we’ve done a good job with that. 
We see population changes over time. I think we’re on a bit of an upswing right now, and I don’t exactly know what the cause of that is, but our job is to try to figure out, how do we provide for these folks in our custody as best we can for the period they’re with us. 
VTD: At the beginning of your tenure, there was a string of deaths, particularly at Southern State, a rate of deaths that data would indicate outpaces the national average. With that, there’s been a lot of attention put on the health services provided in Vermont’s prisons and the various contractors that provide those services. Is prison health care broken, and what can make it better?
ND: Yeah, I think prison health care is definitely in a tough spot. I hope it’s not broken, because I do think that there are ways that it can improve. 
States are in a difficult place. There’s kind of three general models for this. You have a private, contracted health service, that’s what we do in Vermont. You have an in-state, in-government service that’s provided. That would be like if the Department of Corrections hired nurses, doctors, and they would be department staff. Vermont used that model about 20 years ago. And then a third, you have a partnership with a hospital system in your state. Often those are tied to universities, but not always. 
A state like Vermont, I think, suffers additionally from its size, in that we can’t create economies of scale in the way that a state like Texas can, for example. So Texas has its own hospital system within the correction system, massive multiple actual physical hospitals that they can utilize. They’re all corrections patients. I mean, we couldn’t afford something like that here. 
And that’s the model that we used 20 years ago. I wasn’t in the space 20 years ago, but talking to colleagues who were, including the defender general and others, they would say that wasn’t better than what we have now. 
VTD: Do you think an improved system would have prevented some of these deaths?
ND: I think it’s pretty difficult to say. 
We looked at each individual death that occurred in our system in the last four years. We did that. There’s also multiple other investigations that take place under state law. And then we also tried to look at trending analysis. 
Our numbers are pretty small, so it’s hard to extrapolate trends out of the small numbers. But there weren’t things that were immediately apparent that were major consistencies between the deaths. That’s tough for us, because we want to solve the issue, but if there isn’t a consistent issue to solve, it makes it more difficult.
I’ve been happy — happy may not the right word — but happy that the deaths by suicide numbers have definitely gone down. That’s a space where I do think there’s different ways for us to intervene and try to pick up on signs earlier, do everything that we can to prevent that outcome from happening. And I think we’ve taken steps to do that, and hopefully that continues.
That leaves us with folks who are dying of some type of medical issue or substance use, and those are more difficult to manage and intervene in. That’s, I think, where we want to focus.
VTD: What are the biggest challenges facing your successor?
ND: He’s going to continue to have to grapple with the workforce challenge. That’s the biggest existential threat to the success of corrections agencies across the country.
He’s going to have a population that is continuing to age, continuing to present with very complicated medical issues. And you know, in Vermont, we have a unified system, so we have the sentenced population and the detained population. That detained population is presenting to us much sicker than they ever have in our history. And that’s really challenging. 
If you get somebody on a Friday night brought in by law enforcement, and an hour later they’re overdosing and need to go to an emergency room, that puts a corrections system in a really complicated place.
VTD: Have you seen eye-to-eye with Gov. Phil Scott on the department’s work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and border patrol?
ND: That is a really complicated issue
Vermont’s always had a relationship with ICE, or at least for a long time. Historically, it was folks who were coming across the border allegedly without authorization to do so, and they were detained by border patrol, brought to us temporarily because there’s no other detention space in the state, and then they’d be moved on and adjudicated through whatever federal immigration process existed. 
That’s changed a little bit, as we testified to recently. There’s folks being brought from other states and other spaces. It’s not just those folks who are doing the illegal border crossings. We’re just at the beginning of unpacking what this means.
But certainly I see eye-to-eye with the governor on — our obligation is to help people that are coming to our system. And I can affirm to the governor that if somebody comes to our correctional system, they will have access to the courts, they will have access to health care, they will have access to food, and we will try to provide them with any of the needs that they have in our system. 
VTD: Did any of these challenges or frustrations about collaborating with federal immigration authorities influence your decision to leave the department?
ND: No. Certainly there’s been a lot more work with ICE in the last six months. But no, my decision predated that and I was pretty confident that this was roughly the timeline I was going to be on when I was going to leave.
VTD: Was it your decision to leave?
ND: Yeah.
VTD: What are you most proud of from these years?
ND: Philosophically, we reoriented this department. Our goal, and hopefully we’ve accomplished this, was to reorient this department to the people it’s supposed to be serving. So on the one side, that’s our staff. They deserve to have a department that’s invested in them, who care about them, who want them to have meaningful careers with lots of impact, mission focused, and we know that this job extends beyond the walls of our facilities, and we need to take care of them outside of there, too. These are really, really tough jobs, 
And we have people in our care and custody that are counting on us to keep them safe, keep them fed and healthy, and take care of medical issues for them. And we, I think, reoriented the department to that work as well. In particular on the health side. That was the greatest body of work where we could make a huge impact and continue to improve on that system. 
And so we redesigned our health system. We’re about to onboard our first ever manager over nutrition to really target, How do we improve people’s health by giving them good food? Can we locally source food? Can we grow our own food so that it is the best food available for the population? I mean, just a year or so ago, we went to fluid milk across our system in partnership with the Agriculture Agency here in Vermont, and we’re using local Vermont and upstate New York milk to provide to our population. 
It’s a basic premise, but if folks are healthier when they leave, they’re more likely to be successful when they go to the community. And so it’s good for public safety, it’s good for the state and it’s just simply the right thing to do. 
VTD: What do people not understand about the Department of Corrections? And what do people maybe even within the Vermont Agency of Human Services not understand about the Department of Corrections? 
ND: One thing that we’ve been trying to highlight to folks is — as other systems across the state, across the country aren’t able to serve folks, as we have a lack of available medical care for folks, or mental health care, substance use treatment — what happens is those folks all end up kind of at the end of the line. The end of the line is either they’re unhoused, they’re in an emergency department, or they’re in a correctional facility, and often they’re cycling between the three.
I think the other thing, though, particularly in Vermont, but other places too, more and more is expected of the corrections system. Thirty years ago, largely the expectation was that somebody would be incarcerated for a period of time. You’d keep them safe, you’d stop them from fighting, and then you’d provide health care and food service and those things. And then when they got out, they got out.
Today, the expectation is that the corrections agency does everything for that person. And I think that’s a good thing for the most part, but we’re expected to provide education, we’re expected to provide substance use treatment, we’re expected to provide the community standard of health care. And all of that is good, but more and more is layered on top of the corrections agency as the one-stop-shop that can do all of that work while we have a staffing crisis, while there’s pressure for us to close facilities and decarcerate, and new resources aren’t added in. 
Frankly, corrections agencies can’t be good at everything and shouldn’t be good at everything. Our approach to that was to turn to community partners and try to bring more folks into our facilities to help. But I do think that that is kind of an untenable position that corrections agencies are being put in, and particularly as other community support systems collapse or recede from their ability to provide services.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


–  Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

This wasn’t just a technical decision. This was a political decision — and a moral one.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Rebecca Holcombe: Why does Gov. Phil Scott want to give DOGE your grocery list?.","This commentary is by Rebecca Holcombe, of Norwich. She is a Vermont state representative for Windsor-Orange 2.


On March 20, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to break down “information silos” and gain “unfettered access” to data from every state program funded by the federal government. 
This includes a terrifying array of data: your psychiatric and health records, detailed financial data, photos, and more, all to be consolidated into a single massive federal surveillance database.
Then, last month, the Trump administration ordered states to turn over sensitive personal and financial data from Americans who have used SNAP, a food assistance program, in the past five years, including during the Covid-19 pandemic. In response, 21 states and Washington, D.C., sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture, seeking to block the order.
Vermont was not one of those states.
Instead of joining those leaders who are standing up for their residents, Gov. Phil Scott handed over the data — without the consent of affected Vermonters. No press release. No consultation. Just quiet compliance.
Let’s be clear: This is not abstract. 
According to Vermont Public, these records include “names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and home addresses of all members of any household in Vermont that received SNAP benefits in the past five years.” The Scott administration even plans to share your specific food purchases. 
At least 1 in 5 Vermont households is affected. Many of them are working families, children, U.S.-born children of immigrants and people who lost jobs during the pandemic. 
This wasn’t just a technical decision. This was a political decision — and a moral one.
Other leaders said no. 
Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky called the order what it is: unlawful. California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta called it “a bait-and-switch of the worst kind.” As he put it, “SNAP recipients provided this information to get help feeding their families — not to be entered into a government surveillance database or be used as targets in the president’s inhumane immigration agenda.”
Why didn’t Scott do the same? Why didn’t he stand with other states to fight back? Why didn’t he give Vermont’s own attorney general, Charity Clark, a chance to resist in court? As Clark told Vermont Public, “(The Scott administration is) approaching this in a way that prevents me from being able to join a lawsuit.”
This is not how Vermonters expect our government to behave. Data collected to ensure that Vermont children do not go hungry is now being used to fuel a federal surveillance regime. It is a betrayal of consent, a violation of trust, and a direct contradiction of Vermont’s proud tradition of protecting privacy and resisting federal overreach.
This isn’t about “waste, fraud and abuse.” In 2024, Vermont had the fifth-lowest SNAP payment error of any state — a level even the Trump administration deems acceptable. The federal government explicitly stated that Vermont does not need corrective action on SNAP. So if they are demanding our personal information, it’s not to solve a problem with SNAP. It’s to serve a different agenda.
And yes, there’s an obvious and immediate threat: immigration enforcement. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins, who requested the data from Vermont, has publicly called for “mass deportations” and “no amnesty under any circumstances.” The fear is not hypothetical. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is already using data-mined insurance claims as a “deportation tool.”
Now, thanks to Scott, ICE and other federal agencies may have access to the updated addresses and immigration statuses of tens of thousands of Vermont residents. Vermont did not send the National Guard to round people up, but we did tell the federal government where to find them.
Even federal technologists have warned against what’s happening. In a public resignation letter, 21 staffers from the Department of Government Efficiency wrote:
“We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.”
But that’s exactly what Scott enabled. Once this data has been handed over, it cannot be taken back.
The people of Vermont deserve answers. We deserve to know what was shared, with whom and why. We deserve to know why our state’s leadership broke ranks with other governors who chose to defend their residents. We deserve to know how the Scott administration will protect the people who are now at risk: neighbors, children and families whose only “crime” was asking for help to eat.
Vermonters do not believe in big government surveillance. We do not believe in handing ICE a search engine to find our friends. We certainly do not believe helping feed your kids should cost you your privacy.

(Jamie Kelter Davis for The Texas Tribune)ST. CHARLES, Illinois — If Gov. Greg Abbott is determined to pass a gerrymandered congressional map, Texas Democrats know he has the votes and the power to eventually get his way.
But for the dozens of Democrats who left the state this week in protest of the map, it’s not just about winning — it’s about fighting.
Away from their families and regular jobs, Texas Democrats, most of whom are hunkered down in a suburb about an hour west of Chicago, are facing $500-per-day fines, civil arrest warrants and threats from Republican state leaders to remove them from office.
Now six days into the walkout, they plan to stay away until at least the end of the special session on Aug. 19. When they return, they face the possibility of being stripped of their leadership positions and even further marginalized in a chamber where they are already outnumbered. And no matter how long they stay away, Abbott can just call another special session to pass the map.
But it will all be worth it, they say, if they can lay the groundwork for a national fight over redistricting and ensure enough voters across the country understand what they frame as an attempt by President Donald Trump to stack the deck in the midterm election next year.
“It takes an act of defiance like this to wake up the country and let them know that our democracy is being stolen right in front of our eyes,” said Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer of San Antonio in an interview. “If we’re going to be the spark that lights that fire, then we’re doing our jobs.”

When House Democrats last walked out in 2021 to stop new state voter restrictions, lawmakers were on the lam for over a month before the caucus fractured and enough members returned to restore quorum. Republicans quickly pushed the measure through, but Democrats say they were successful in drawing national and congressional attention to the topic and removing some of the worst parts of the bill.
This time around, they’re seeking to block a congressional map redrawn in the middle of the decade to create five new GOP seats next year, putting them at the front lines of an issue with national stakes: control of the U.S. House for the last two years of Trump’s term.
Those implications have elevated the Texas Democrats decamped in Illinois and elsewhere, stiffening their resolve and garnering them nationwide attention and support that they hope can help sustain their movement in a way that was missing four years ago.
“It’s not, Houston, we have a problem,” Martinez Fischer said. “It’s, America, we have a problem, and we need to rise up.”
The walkout, meant to deny Republicans the quorum needed to conduct legislative business and bring the House to a standstill, has also set off a possible national redistricting war. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has promised to draw more blue seats in his state if Texas approves its plan, and national Democratic leaders are looking to reshape maps in Illinois, New York and Maryland.
The effort reflects a push within the Democratic Party, particularly after last year’s disastrous election results, to re-establish itself to voters as a party of fighters willing to meet Republicans on their level.
“We are going to match Donald Trump’s energy when it comes to redistricting,” U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey of Fort Worth said Monday. “Democrats we have shown up to a gunfight with nothing but good intentions and dull knives, and that era is over. We are not going to unilaterally disarm, and that is what’s different this time around.”

The message was reiterated repeatedly this week, with top Democrats from Illinois, New York, California and Massachusetts all joining the Texas delegation in pledging to stand up to the Trump administration, which is also pressing other red states to redraw their congressional maps in favor of the GOP ahead of next year’s midterm election.
“The Trump-Abbott gerrymander is a test case for the rest of the country,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said Tuesday alongside Texas Democrats. “What Republicans are trying to do in Texas is a model for other red states to lie, cheat and steal their way to victory.”
Democrats began floating the possibility of a walkout as soon as Abbott put redistricting on the special session agenda in July at the behest of Trump.
But in discussions over Zoom and in person before the session began, they decided that the stakes of the issue hadn’t yet been communicated to the public in a way that would explain a nuclear act. Some also held out for a committee process that might allow them to temper any draft map, or for a GOP proposal less aggressive than Trump had demanded.
Then, the Republican-led redistricting committee unveiled a map last week that would dismantle several Democratic districts to squeeze out five new red seats. While Republican lawmakers said the map was drawn purely to maximize partisan advantage — which is legal, according to the U.S. Supreme Court — Democrats saw a plan that would achieve that edge by suppressing the vote of people of color in violation of the Voting Rights Act.
“The power grab by Trump and Abbott doesn’t just have the goal of getting five more seats in Congress,” Rep. Ramon Romero Jr. said Tuesday, the eve of the Voting Rights Act’s 60th anniversary. “It has another goal, a goal more sinister than that, and that is to make people believe that their vote doesn’t really matter. That’s why it’s all of our fight.”

With Republicans moving to approve the map at a quick clip, the determination to deny quorum solidified among Democrats in the 48 hours before they got on a chartered plane headed for Chicago. Others made their way to Albany to meet with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and to Boston for a state legislative conference.
Democrats say they’re buying valuable time by walking out, drawing attention to the issue among voters and getting other blue states involved — even while recognizing that Texas’ map is likely to get passed and will need to be fought in court.
“The spotlight has been turned on,” Rep. James Talarico of Austin said in an interview. “I’m hoping this courage that my colleagues and I have shown will be contagious, and it’ll inspire other legislators in blue states to respond with their own redistricting attempts.”
Using their hotel complex as a base camp, Democrats have done scores of media interviews out of their cramped rooms and a small park off the Fox River in Illinois; hosted news conferences with federal, state and party leaders at local union halls and blue state capitols; and met with Democratic governors and elected officials from across the country.
Talarico, who is mulling a run for U.S. Senate, said he did 25 interviews in the first 24 hours of the quorum break, ranging from TV and traditional platforms to podcasts with ranging ideological bents. His TV hits alone reached 9.8 million viewers across the country, he said, not including thousands of others on social media.

Republicans appear to have more paths toward maximizing their representation in Congress in a redistricting war with Democrats. Redrawing congressional maps in the middle of the decade will be harder for the handful of blue states that have clamped down on partisan gerrymandering by handing their redistricting authority to independent commissions.
Still, Texas Democrats see the support blue state and national Democratic leaders have expressed for retaliatory redistricting as a sign that their gambit is working.
“This, I think, is well on its way becoming a national fight, and that’s what’s going to be important if we’re going to counter” the GOP, said Rep. Chris Turner of Grand Prairie, who led the 2021 quorum break.
Republicans blasted the Democrats who left, arguing that they abandoned their office and were refusing to participate in the legislative process because they did not like the inevitable outcome. Critics also mocked the contingent for seeking refuge from Texas law enforcement in Illinois, which is heavily gerrymandered in favor of Democrats.
But Democrats said that by denying the House a quorum, they were doing the very job their constituents had elected them to do and were now demanding they follow through on.
While the 2021 walkout required Democrats to do a lot of explaining to their constituents about what a quorum break was and why they were doing it, Rep. Diego Bernal of San Antonio said, “this time around, they were telling us that their expectation was that we would use everything at our disposal to try and stop it.”

Democrats also said they don’t take the decision to leave lightly. Talarico noted that there’s an abundance of GOP legislation that Democrats stay and fight against in the chamber. They reserved the most drastic option for what he framed as “direct attacks on democracy.”
“We have to love democracy, even when we lose,” he said. “But we do that because we always have a chance to win the next election. And if this happens, we won’t — and so we have to take an extreme step to stand up for our constituents and for all Texans.”

BURLINGTON — In fall 2023, Colchester High School pitcher Zach Davis sat at a table in the cafeteria and signed a contract to pitch for his hometown Lake Monsters. 
The Vermont teen joined a growing list of baseball players from the Green Mountains to take the field for the Burlington baseball team. 
“It was around the winter or late fall of my senior year of high school. I reached out to my college coach and asked if it would be possible for me to play here this summer,” Davis said. “We gave (Lake Monsters head coach Matt Fincher) a call.”
It was a moment the right-hander had dreamed of just a few years earlier. 
“It sounds pretty cliché to say, ‘You can do what you put your mind to,’ but it is really true,” he said. “I remember coming to games — one in particular, my junior or sophomore year of high school — and I was just thinking, ‘Hey, I want to play here when I’m in college.’ So yeah, it’s a cliché, but there’s a lot of truth to it.”
He debuted for the team the summer after he graduated from Colchester High School, playing for a couple of months before heading to Bryant University, where he is now a rising sophomore.
For fellow pitcher Cole Tarrant, the story followed a similar script — minus the cafeteria. Tarrant, a southpaw also from Colchester, initially reached out to the Lake Monsters coaching staff, hoping to sign on for the summer after his first season at Hobart College in upstate New York. 
The rising junior has been coming to games since he was in Little League. 
“I remember when my grandparents brought me to a game — I was 6 or 7,” he said. “I thought, ‘Wow, this is really cool.’ It was always my dream to play baseball at a high level … It’s kind of a full-circle moment to be back out here.”
At the time, Fincher could only offer the lefty a temporary contract for the 2024 season. When injuries and departures inevitably created roster turnover, Tarrant had the chance to join the team for the full season.

After falling short of their championship aspirations last summer, both pitchers returned for the 2025 season. A couple of hours before facing the New Britain Bees last week, the pair reflected on their time with the team ahead of the Lake Monsters’ playoff start on Sunday.  
“I felt like it helped me a lot for my junior year, so I figured I’d do it again. I thought it could help me again this summer,” Tarrant said.
For Davis, the Monsters have represented the perfect place to hone his craft as a pitcher for Division I Bryant. 
“I have a lot of support, and I thank God for that,” Davis said. “I’m very grateful for my family, friends and the people that support me with what I do. Like, just for example — tonight, my whole family’s coming to the game. Family-friends are coming.”
Vermont is not necessarily known for producing top-end baseball talent. But both hurlers know that playing for the hometown team can be especially meaningful on the Little Leaguers who sit in the stands. 
“Even my parents have friends with little kids who tell me how awesome it is to come see me — ’cause they know me. I think that kind of inspires them, too,” Tarrant said. 
The Lake Monsters have not captured a championship since their run in summer 2021. For the guys in the dugout, the prospect of capturing the franchise’s second trophy in five years is, in Davis’s words, “really exciting.” 
“Some of us have been here since May, and guys have come in and out. But for a lot of us, this is the last little stretch,” he said. 
The Lake Monsters currently sit in second place in the Futures Collegiate Baseball League standings and boast a 38–19 record. 
“We have a chance to do something fun, something cool, and play baseball a little longer. No matter what happens, I love this team. I had a great time. I won’t regret anything we did this summer,” Davis said. 
Regardless of how this season ends, both pitchers feel their team is leaving a mark on baseball in Vermont. 
“They’ve been really successful here for four years now,” Davis said. “The organization’s done great on and off the field — they’ve created an environment that people want to come and watch. I only see it getting better.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-10 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Made in the shade: CT tobacco farmers roll with the times,Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/10/ct-shade-tobacco-farmers-cigars/,"The iconic Connecticut shade tobacco fields have been replaced by parking lots and warehouses as demand changed. Today, only one man grows it.","On a recent July morning, Dwight Arnold stood in front of one of his Connecticut shade tobacco fields, the plants shielded from the sun by a white shade cloth, barking orders to the mix of men and local high school kids lying on the ground trying to pluck the lowest leaves on rows of 8- to 10-foot-high plants. 
It was the first round of picking for the last man growing Connecticut shade tobacco on his family’s farm — even though the farm is just across the border in Massachusetts.

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
For over a century, cigars wrapped in light brown Connecticut shade tobacco have been considered among the best in the world and, as late as the mid-1980s, farmers from Suffield to Windsor were growing thousands of acres of it in what is known as the Upper Connecticut River Valley.
“Then the demand just kind of fell off, and one by one, they just kind of started to fall by the wayside and switched to something else,” Arnold said.
As demand dropped and the pressure to develop the land grew, many Connecticut farmers turned to an alternative: Connecticut Broadleaf.
Connecticut Broadleaf is easier to cultivate and is used as filler tobacco in many brand-name cigars. Experts say you can also grow more of it per acre, as much as 500 pounds more than shade.
But Arnold, whose great-grandfather purchased the Southwick farm in the 1870s, never stopped growing the iconic shade variety.

“There were years when we didn’t know who we’re going to sell it to, and I was only growing like 15 acres, and it was, well, let’s see if I can sell this stuff,” Arnold said.
This year, he planted 35 acres of shade tobacco because the General Cigar Co., which produces Macanudo brands, has agreed to buy it all for use in some of its premium cigars.
Connecticut shade actually comes from a Sumatran seed that was brought here around 1900, Arnold said. 
It is called shade tobacco because it grows with protection from the sun. The white cloth provides cover from the sun but also creates more humid conditions underneath it — similar to Sumatra.

Arnold and his crew of about 50 workers will do six pickings of the giant tobacco leaves; the very fine veins spreading from the stem separate shade tobacco leaves from other varieties, signaling potentially unmatched flavor. 
“Shade is so expensive to grow because it gets handled so many times. It has to be tied and wrapped as it grows up, picked by hand and then sewn together. It’s extremely labor intensive,” said Dr. James LaMondia, a soil scientist for The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, or CAES, who has been working with tobacco farmers since the 1980s.
But the intensive work that goes into growing and harvesting shade tobacco is one of the reasons many cigar companies shifted their operations away from the upper Connecticut River Valley to Ecuador and Nicaragua, which have similar soil and climates but decidedly cheaper labor.
“They’re paying somebody for a week, probably what workers here will be paid in a couple of hours,” LaMondia said.
The tobacco grown in South America uses Connecticut seed, but it is not the same.
“They’ll say it’s Connecticut shade tobacco, but that’s misleading, because it’s basically Connecticut seed but not Connecticut grown,’” LaMondia said, adding they “produce what I consider to be a lesser quality, but a better price.”

Arduous work
It’s 10 a.m. when Arnold yells for everyone to stop and take a 15-minute break. They started at about 7 a.m., when it was cooler out, but it’s hot now — even more so under the white shade cloth where the picking occurs. The mesh covering is made of polypropylene and is designed to replicate the humidity of Sumatra, Arnold said.
The mix of veteran pickers and younger local high school kids grab a drink from a water tank and wet their heads to cool off.
Arnold, a reed-thin 62-year-old, calls them all by name.

There’s Jackson, who has picked tobacco for 40 years. Henry, who is wearing a homemade contraption that looks like a large reverse fanny pack to protect himself as he slides along the ground, has been picking for over 30 years. Arnold makes sure to check on a teenage boy who just started picking a day earlier.
The work is arduous. They slide close to the ground so they can get the leaves at the bottom of the giant plants that are ready to be harvested. They then gently place the leaves into a 4-foot-long plastic bin, sliding halfway up each 400-foot row of plants and then down the next until the bin is full. The bins are placed on “sleds” custom-made by Arnold to exactly fit the bins inside. They pull the sleds by ropes at either end.
Full bins are left at the end of the row, covered with a cloth. If the tobacco wasn’t covered, Arnold said, the sun would start burning the tobacco within 20 minutes. However, a tractor usually comes along within minutes to grab the full bins and transport them back to the barn for stitching.

At every step, the tobacco must be handled gently, because the leaves must be pristine if they are going to be used to wrap a high-end cigar.
“They can’t have any blemishes. They can’t have any leaf spots,” LaMondia said. “It’s a high-risk crop, because before you ever get anything back, you’re putting out tens of thousands of dollars to produce the crop.”
The tobacco is transported back to a barn where another group of workers uses a machine, specifically designed for tobacco growers more than 70 years ago, that is a combination sewing machine and upside down conveyor belt to string the leaves together. 
Then, they are hung from the rafters inside the barn for up to six weeks at temperatures hovering around 100 degrees.

They first turn yellow and then ultimately a light brown that is similar to the color of beach sand.
Arnold said about 2,000 pounds of tobacco leaves can be hung in the barn. Once it’s dried, it will be shipped to the Dominican Republic, where Macanudo will finish the process, including drying it even more. 
It takes more than a year from when a tobacco leaf is picked to when it is ready to be used to wrap a cigar.

A different tobacco
The faded red barns on Arnold’s farm were once synonymous with the tobacco industry here in Connecticut. Hundreds of them dotted the country roads that cross the Upper Connecticut River Valley.
But as farmers stopped selling Connecticut shade, the barns slowly started to disappear. 
The starkest example of this can be found on the road leading to Bradley International Airport, where a row of tobacco barns that belonged to the O.J. Thrall Company — at one time perhaps the largest Connecticut shade tobacco producer in the state — were torn down and replaced with a giant Amazon warehouse.
Another long-time tobacco grower, H.F. Brown in Windsor, also stopped growing tobacco, switching instead to vegetables.
“My grandfather and father grew Connecticut shade tobacco and I do miss growing it, but it just didn’t make sense anymore,” said Kathleen Martin, current president of Brown’s Harvest. 
They now grow cucumbers, tomatoes and all sorts of berries.
But LaMondia said the idea that tobacco farming is dying in Connecticut is inaccurate.
“It’s still a major crop here. Depending on the year, tens of millions of dollars worth of tobacco are sold,” LaMondia said. “There’s probably about 3,000 acres of tobacco being grown in the valley, so it’s still going strong.”
USDA statistics back up that claim.
Connecticut’s tobacco yield increased significantly from 2017 to 2022, according the most recent data available from the USDA. In 2017, 46 farms covering 2,204 acres produced nearly 3.9 million pounds of tobacco. In 2022, 44 farms covering 3,056 acres produced more than 6 million pounds of tobacco.
But LaMondia said the new “pounds” are all broadleaf. He said at one time, shade tobacco grew on more than 1,000 acres in Connecticut. All of that is now gone, except for Arnold’s small operation.
With Broadleaf, the entire plant is cut at once from the bottom and hung to dry in a barn. It is a much easier crop to cultivate than Connecticut shade and quicker to get to market.
“It’s kind of shifted and moved from shade being king to broadleaf, which is most of the acreage now throughout the valley,” LaMondia said. 
Several farmers said they admire Arnold for sticking with tradition and still growing the shade tobacco that first brought notoriety to the area’s farmers.
Arnold does grow about 20 acres of Connecticut Broadleaf just to “hedge,” but as the last man growing Connecticut shade, Arnold thinks he’s fine.
“I realized there was still some market for it, and if I’m the only one growing it, well they’re going to have to buy it from me,” Arnold said. “As long as I can supply them with some quality leaves, they’ll keep coming back to me.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_0722_SR_TobaccoFarm_028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-10 05:56:18.769805

Purists might have said the cross should have been flaming, but at least there were the hoods and the white robes and the desperate oaths and the silly language rife with the letter “k.” […]","Ku Klux Klan members gather at a parade in Virginia in 1922. (Library of Congress)On the big hill west of town they met on hot summer nights beneath a wooden cross illuminated with electric bulbs. Purists might have said the cross should have been flaming, but at least there were the hoods and the white robes and the desperate oaths and the silly language rife with the letter “k.”
This wasn’t the original Ku Klux Klan, the secret society formed by a half-dozen former Confederate officers in 1865 to terrorize newly freed Black people and to fight Reconstruction. That first Klan had been dismantled by 1872 and its hooded leaders jailed.
No, this was a reimagined Klan, a movement that had been sweeping Main Street America in a wave of nostalgia and bigotry. What was happening at night on the big hill just outside Coffeyville was similar to other meetings held across the country, with Protestant religion and patriotic fervor masking the worst impulses of those beneath the hoods.
The meetings weren’t strictly social occasions.
The Klan was organizing, running candidates for office, and attempting to insinuate itself into every aspect of civic life, under the guise that it was doing good charitable and patriotic work.
One citizen who wasn’t buying it was A.J. Valentine.
Valentine was the 39-year-old editor of the Coffeyville Morning News who thought the Klan meetings were both absurd and dangerous. In October 1922, he announced that the News had an informant in the ranks of the local Klan.
“One of the indoor sports in Coffeyville for several months has been figuring out who are the members of the cow pasture parties, held around Coffeyville about once a week,” a Page One notice read. “These parties have created so much interest that The Morning News has undertaken to enlighten its readers about them. So beginning tomorrow morning the News will start a serial story, giving the license tag numbers of these cars that assemble in cow pastures, also the owners of the cars, as shown by the secretary of state’s records.”
It was a risky move for Valentine.
A rival editor would later note, in a 1943 local history, that what Valentine may have lacked in discretion he made up for in bravery.
“Mr. Valentine was a courageous editor,” remembered local newspaperman C.C. Drake, who had helmed the Daily Dawn — a Klan newspaper. “He opposed the invasion of the Ku Klux Klan here and created a good deal of discussion as to the identity of his Klan reporter, who ignored the secrecy of the order and boldly published many inner happenings.”
Valentine’s paper was an upstart not yet three years old, struggling against the well-established Coffeyville Journal and other publications, including by 1923 the Daily Dawn.
Valentine had been born in Louisiana, married his wife, Mary, in Missouri, and had worked there as a bank solicitor. He came to Coffeyville in 1912 to become advertising manager for the Journal and was later elected county clerk as a Democrat. The Morning News had leaned Democratic from the start, Drake noted in his local history, but Valentine was never tied to party dogma.
The summer of 1922 had burned like a torch as the resurrected Klan spread its hooded influence across Kansas, its kleagles organizing new chapters in towns big and small. It may have seemed an unusual turn for a state that had been admitted to the Union as free on the eve of the Civil War, but that had been 61 years ago, and Kansans, like just about everyone else in America, had been buffeted by change.
A world war, a pandemic, and the disorienting rush of the Jazz Age had frightened many into longing for an imagined earlier time, a fictional America where there was moral order and political stability. There was also a cancerous nostalgic yearning for a time before so many people had so many freedoms. Like the old Klan, the resurrected version targeted Black people, Jews, and Catholics.
Encouraged by the 1915 film “Birth of a Nation,” the first blockbuster, which portrayed the original Klansman as heroes and Black people and carpetbaggers as rapists and villains, Americans in the millions flocked to join the new “Invisible Empire.”
For them, the hood and robes and fiery crosses had become symbols for real Americans, an exclusive club of white Protestant men (although there was a women’s auxiliary). If old Nathan Bedford Forrest had lived to see the new Klan he would have been perplexed, because the organization claimed to revere the American flag, a symbol of union the original Kluxers reviled.
Most of the 1920s Klan members were described as solid middle class citizens, according to historian Tim Rives, who wrote a history of the Klan in Kansas City.
“The stimulus to this Klan’s creation is more mysterious” than the original Klan or the one that would resurface in the 1960s to oppose the civil rights movement, according to Rives. “Its program of Americanism, Protestantism, Law and Order, and White Supremacy (was) less definite than the simpler hates of other Klan eras. The amorphous character of the Klan of the 1920s gave it the flexibility to adjust to whatever local conditions it found.”
Coffeyville became a stronghold of Klan activity, with the local chapter of the Invisible Empire railing against the perceived lawlessness of South Coffeyville, a town a mile to the south, across the Oklahoma line. It was Prohibition, and the Klan said bootleggers from South Coffeyville were a corrupting influence. But then, it thought jazz music and teen necking parties were wicked, too.
Valentine’s Klan reporter, whoever he was, first appeared in the Oct. 11, 1922, edition of the Morning News. The writer took the tone of a society editor reporting a black tie affair.
“One of the most delightful cow pasture parties of the season was held on the big hill west of the city,” the piece began. “It was a masquerade affair, white robe and white mask completely concealing the identity of each guest. The decorations consisted of a large cross which was lit up with electric light bulbs — the cows having been removed before the fun started.”
In a ceremony called “naturalization,” an oath was administered to new members, requiring allegiance to the Invisible Empire. The initiates were required to swear they would die before divulging Klan secrets.
“The guests did not give their names to the News’ cow pasture society reporter but the following automobile tags were noticed attached to the cars that were assembled.” A list of 10 tag numbers and the names the secretary of state had registered for each vehicle followed.
“At a late hour refreshments were served,” the reporter noted.
Over the next few days, additional installments in the cow pasture saga identified more vehicles and their owners. Letters began appearing in the Morning News from citizens who claimed somebody else had borrowed their cars to attend the Klan meeting. In one case, the executive of a pipeline company said he was the owner of record for a number of company vehicles, but he couldn’t control the movements of every auto.
Some of the hoods, at least, were finally off.
Other Kansas journalists had squared off against the Klan, with Emporia’s William Allen White the most noted. But Valentine, a relatively obscure editor astride a powder keg of bigotry and popular influence, may have had the most to lose.
He certainly was among the most audacious.
But Klan influence continued to swell in southeast Kansas, culminating in the beating of a local mayor, Theodore Schierlmann. His offense? He was Catholic, had spoken out against the Klan, and had refused to rent a local hall for a Klan function.
“Reign of Terror is On,” a Morning News headline declared.
On Oct. 30, Gov. Henry J. Allen came to Coffeyville and during a speech at a local theater denounced the Klan. It was a secret order, he said, operating without benefit of a state charter as required of other social and fraternal organizations.
“We confront in Kansas an astonishing development of prejudice, racial and religious,” Allen said, as reported by the Associated Press. “It is seeking to establish the un-American idea that we can improve the conditions in the state by turning it over to a masked organization which arrogates to itself the right to regulate the individual.”
Allen, a Republican, said he had instructed the state attorney general to expel every Klan official from the state.
The organization, he said, “has taken the old Ku Klux Klan from its grave. It has set up the incredible philosophy that we require religious instruction from masked men whose characters and capacities are concealed by disguise.”
On Dec. 8, 1924, an explosion wrecked the publishing offices and plant of the Daily Dawn, the Klan newspaper. Nobody was hurt in the 1 a.m. blast, but damage was estimated at $75,000 — or about $1.4 million in today’s dollars.
“Nitroglycerine was used,” reported a Nevada, Missouri, newspaper. “Besides wrecking the newspaper plant the blast badly damaged an adjoining grocery store, a bicycle shop and a florist shop. Almost the entire roof of the Daily Dawn building was blown off and the front and rear walls were blown out. Windows for several blocks were shattered.”
The damage wasn’t covered by insurance, editor C.C. Drake said. The newspapers the Journal and the Morning News offered the use of their plants to Drake, who attributed the blast to bootleggers. Although there were various suspects over the years, there were no arrests. The paper ceased operations in 1925.
Also in 1925, the Klan was officially declared illegal in Kansas.
But the legacy of the Klan lived on, especially in places like Kansas City, where a former Klansman held office for 30 years, according to Rives. There were also at least 41 incidents of lynching of Black people across the state to 1927, and perhaps more.
Race relations in Coffeyville boiled over when a white mob of thousands stormed city hall in 1927 seeking to lynch three Black men. The men had been falsely accused of raping two white high school girls. Although the Klan was not involved in the riot, the incident had the potential to be a disaster similar to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, which left up to 300 Black people dead and destroyed the city’s prosperous African American neighborhood.
“The (Coffeyville) mob was driven back,” according to Geoffrey Newman in a 2013 master’s thesis, “first by Black deputies at the jail, then by armed African Americans who prevented their neighborhood from being torched. The National Guard occupied the city for five days.”
The incident was largely forgotten local history, Newman said, but deserved to be remembered.
“Coffeyville demands our attention because its activists won a victory against racism almost 25 years before the Montgomery Bus Boycott,” he argued. “Furthermore, the victory had its roots in a little-known court case that desegrated junior high schools statewide in Kansas 30 years before Brown. Yet these victories never created a national wave of change. Kansas … has remained remote from the centers of national discourse on race.”
In 1928, Valentine sold the Morning News. The paper was absorbed by the Journal the next year. In 1929, he took over as editor of a paper at Lincoln, Nebraska, and by 1940 was running a bookstore there.
Andrew Jackson Valentine died in 1966, aged 82.
His story — that of a small-town editor fighting a cultural torrent of hypocrisy and violence — is a just a minor part of the American saga. But it’s a story worth remembering, because all history is ultimately local history. What we do has meaning. Our individual acts of kindness and cruelty, our refusals to remember and our embrace of the past, imagined or actual, contribute to who we are as a nation.
Personally, I’d rather live in the America that A.J. Valentine thought was worth saving.

This week marks the 56th anniversary of the grand-daddy of all rock festivals… Woodstock. I was in my teens the summer of 1969, but couldn’t get off from my job to join the swarms of rock fans. But I did see most of them.
That summer I was as working as a “temp seasonal” toll collector on the Tappan Zee Bridge, joining Westchester and Rockland counties.  


Most days life as a toll collector on the Tappan Zee was a delight, as I was usually assigned to the far outside lane, also known as “the country club” because of its green vistas and views of the mighty Hudson River.
There were two things I learned in that job: how to roll quarters and how to listen to the radio. The tiny toll booths lacked air conditioning, but I could bring a fan or a radio. My portable FM entertained me eight hours a day as I listened to both the music and the FM DJ’s… a job I eventually earned at Long Island’s WLIR after college graduation.
New York’s FM stations were buzzing about Woodstock for weeks, and that Friday and much of Saturday, it seemed that every kid in the tri-state area was heading for Yasgur’s Farm. Most weekends were pretty crazy in my toll collecting job, because in those days tolls were collected in both directions… 50 cents north-bound and 50 cents coming home. (Today the toll is $6.75 roundtrip, if you have an E-Z Pass).
Busy as it was on summer weekends on that bridge, nobody expected a half-million people would show up heading to Woodstock, especially not the folks at the New York Thruway Authority. But after the rock fest was well underway, the Thruway brass realized the mobs would eventually be heading home, clogging the bridge. Because the music was expected to end late on Sunday, many of us temp-collectors worked overtime into the wee hours of Monday morning.
Late into the night we had five toll lanes open southbound, most of us enjoying some handsome overtime. However, traffic was so light, they sent us home by about 1 a.m.  But I was due back in the booth five hours later.
Of course, the music didn’t end until early that Monday morning, meaning that the usual morning rush hour carried as many burned-out hippies as it did regular business commuters. I remember one station wagon that pulled in to my toll lane, caked in mud up to the windows and stuffed with a dozen zonked-out kids.
“Hey man,” said the driver with bloodshot eyes that struggled to focus. “We don’t have any money” (to pay the 50 cent toll). “How about these instead?” That day, his Tappan Zee toll was an orange and a warm Coke.
Later that summer, after being reassigned to the New Rochelle toll barrier on the New England Thruway, I learned about the “exact change” lanes.  As folks threw their change into the basket, the coins went into a machine with rotating discs and holes the size of nickels, dimes and quarters. As the coins fell though the holes, their value was totaled and the driver could pull away.
What I didn’t know was the people threw more than coins into those baskets.
One day, while inside the booth removing change buckets, I heard a car stop in the lane outside followed by an ominous thump. Not the clinking of change, but a thump.
Imagine my horror as I watched an entire orange work its way down the change chute, hitting the rotating discs like a food processor, spewing orange juice and peel everywhere over the machinery, the buckets of coins and me.
Oh, for those days back in “the country club lane” back on the Tappan Zee!",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tappan_Zee_1973-1024x792.jpg,,,2025-08-10 04:56:37.897872

Andy Barr spoke at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic on Saturday, Aug 2. They also campaigned Saturday at the Republican Party of Kentucky's Lincoln Day Dinner. (Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)LEXINGTON — Republican candidates for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat set the tone for their campaigns ahead of next year’s primary during the state party’s Lincoln Day Dinner Saturday night. 
While the thorny primary was at the center of the evening, the influence of outgoing U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell on the party was clear. Speakers throughout the night sang McConnell’s praises, including West Virginia U.S. Sen. Jim Justice, who gave the keynote address. 
Chairman Robert Benvenuti said the party has $2.3 million on hand heading into 2026 elections. About 850 tickets were sold for the dinner, held at the Central Bank Center in downtown Lexington. Outside, dozens with Peaceful Bluegrass Resistance protested. 
Scott Jennings, a former McConnell staffer who has gained national notoriety as a commentator on CNN, was the emcee for the dinner. He opened the program with a promise to “roast Democrats” and touted wins by Republicans at the national level — particularly President Donald Trump’s second term in office. 
“They love it when we trash each other. They rejoice. It’s their only hope,” Jennings said of Democrats. “They can’t beat us, so they’re trying to will into existence a future where we beat ourselves through division and discord, but it’s not true. Whatever intra-party conversations we’re ever having, we all in this room know the true mission is to save our country.”
However, division is front and center in the GOP primary to replace McConnell. The primary is in May, a little over eight months away.
On Saturday night, the top contenders, former Attorney General Daniel Cameron, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, Lexington businessman Nate Morris and Elizabethtown businessman Michael Farris, all fresh from speeches at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic last weekend, largely restated their main campaign points.
Morris was the last of the top three candidates to speak, but he used his remarks to respond to a question McConnell had asked at a Republican breakfast before the picnic, why “one of the candidates running for my office wants to be different” than him as the longest-serving party leader in the U.S. Senate.
“First and foremost, I don’t want to be the longest-serving anything in U.S. history,” Morris said. “That’s one of the reasons why I’m running. I think that politics should not be a career, and we know that career politicians have run our country off a cliff.” 
He then asked the crowd to think of the “career politicians” who “who stabbed us in the back” when the president came under fire from members of his party, such as when McConnell criticized Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
“I’m seeking this seat with term limits in mind. I’m going to serve two terms, and I think that’s enough. I think that’s enough to get done what we need to get done in Washington,” Morris said, before adding that he strongly believes the U.S. needs a “full moratorium” on new immigration to the country after deporting all people in the U.S. without permanent legal status. 
Cameron opened his remarks to say he’s “not running against someone. I’m running for something.” He touted his record as the state’s attorney general and reiterated his opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and transgender women and girls playing in female sports. 
“We need an American built on merit, excellence and intelligence,” Cameron said. 
Barr cited the Democratic Party’s low approval nationwide and emphasized his record voting for Trump’s agenda in Congress, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year. The congressman highlighted last week’s news that Apple plans to expand glass production in Harrodsburg, which is in his Central Kentucky district, and attributed the decision to the president’s trade and domestic manufacturing policies. 
Barr also spoke about his recently filed legislation to codify a Trump executive order that prohibits transgender women and girls playing in women’s and girls’ sports. Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer who has vocally opposed including transgender women and girls in female sports, is supportive of the legislation, he noted. 
“As your next senator, I will keep males out of our daughters’ private spaces,” Barr said. 
Lifetime achievement award squabble 
McConnell only addressed the crowd to give a lifetime achievement award to Cathy Bell, a longtime Republican who is now the state party treasurer and has served in other roles for decades. 
McConnell presented Bell with the surprise award during the dinner. However, the Morris campaign had been convinced the award was going to go to McConnell, who Morris has repeatedly blasted as insufficiently loyal to Trump. Morris’ campaign had asked the Republican Party of Kentucky to deny McConnell the award. 
“I think they saw the writing on the wall, and they saw that we were contrasting why he shouldn’t get that award,” Morris told reporters after the dinner. A spokesperson for the state party declined further comment about the award
But speakers throughout the evening said McConnell has contributed to the party’s dominance over the past few decades. 
“We are blessed to stand on the shoulders of those who came before us and to have the opportunity to build on the momentum for the betterment of the commonwealth and for America. We are grateful for the leaders who have laid the groundwork for our Kentucky success, especially Leader McConnell,” Benvenuti said “And Leader McConnell — thanks for never forgetting the importance of a strong state party.” 
Justice told the crowd to give McConnell another round of applause before recalling how McConnell had convinced him to run for U.S. Senate.

Darryl Rouson speaking at WMNF Radio in Tampa on Aug. 8, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Tampa Bay-area Democratic state Sen. Darryl Rouson says he is open-minded about whether he’ll try to stay in the Florida Legislature next year by making a run for a Florida House seat.
Rouson, who turned 70 last month, has served in the Legislature since 2008 but is term-limited from running again for his District 16 state Senate seat in 2026. 
He says he is seriously considering filing to run for the House District 62 seat in Pinellas County, which will be open next year because Democratic incumbent Michele Rayner is departing to run for Rouson’s Senate seat.
“Well, it’s good to have to options, and I believe in experience plus relationship-building equals success. And I’ve been able to have great success, both in the House and the Senate, and things will take care of themselves,” he told this reporter while speaking on WMNF-88.5 FM radio in Tampa on Friday.
So does that mean he is running?
“Well, I’m weighing options, and it’s nice to have options,” he said. 
Although it’s more common for state representatives term-limited out of office to run for the more select state Senate (where there are just 40 members compared to 120 in the House), it’s not unprecedented by any means.
Last year, Melbourne Republican Debbie Mayfield won a seat in the House after being term-limited from her Senate seat (she ultimately won back that seat after it became open again when Randy Fine departed for Congress).
Brevard County Republican Thad Altman served in the House, the Senate, and then back in the House before being term-limited from office last year.
Pasco County Property Tax Collector Mike Fasano is another prominent legislator who couldn’t stay away from Tallahassee. The New Port Richey Republican served in the House from 1994 to 2002; in the Senate from 2002 to 2012; and returned to the House in 2012.
He departed from that seat a year later, when Gov. Rick Scott appointed him as tax collector, a job he’s held ever since.
Subverting term limits?
Florida voters approved eight-year term limits for members of the Florida Legislature in 1992. Some senators (like Rouson now) have been allowed to serve an additional two years due to a quirk in state law regarding redistricting.
In an apparent response to legislators who switch legislative chambers after completing their terms, now-Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia filed a resolution during the 2025 session (SJR 536) to clarify that the Constitution imposes a lifetime limit of 16 years in state legislative office — eight years max in the House, eight years max in the Senate.
There was a caveat for senators who serve reduced two-year terms due to redistricting. The measure would have gone to the voters as a proposed constitutional amendment in 2026, but stalled after being approved in one committee stop.
“Let’s stop the practice of people continually running for the same office and bouncing back and forth between chambers,” Ingoglia said on X. “Serving the people of Florida should be a privilege, and an honor, not a career.”
Redistricting issues
The configuration of Rouson’s Senate District 16 seat is being challenged in federal court by a group of voters living in both Pinellas and Hillsborough County who are represented by the ACLU of Florida and the Civil Rights & Racial Justice Clinic at New York University School of Law. They contend its design since 2022, including parts of St. Petersburg but moving across Tampa Bay into Hillsborough County, was the result of illegal racial gerrymandering.
During the trial, voters who live in Hillsborough County argued they weren’t being fairly represented because Rouson lives in St. Petersburg.
“I’ve done my level best to represent both sides of the Bay efficiently and effectively, and I think that I’ve done a pretty good job at that,” he said.
Three Democrats have already entered the race for House District 62: Kyandra Darling, Upton Fisher, and former state legislator Wengay Newton.
Darling addressed the rumors about Rouson’s potential entry into the race on Friday, issuing a statement on X saying, “I remain as committed to running and winning this race as I was on the day I declared my candidacy.” (That statement was first reported by Florida Politics).
Among the other topics Rouson discussed Friday were House Speaker Danny Perez’ memo to members calling for a select committee on redistricting congressional districts. Notably, Senate President Ben Albritton has yet to publicly comment about the idea.
“I think the Senate President is being very thoughtful and deliberate about his actions, and there’s no urgency to do this now,” Rouson said. 
“We’ve got a lifetime between now and November, when we get back for committee weeks, and we should study what’s happening in Texas and in California and the other states like New York that are intending to do some things. We shouldn’t be knee-jerk reactors to what other states are doing. We need to do what’s good for Florida.”
Published reports indicate Florida Republicans are considering a redrawing of the congressional map that could net them three additional congressional seats. Rouson is skeptical. They already control 20 of Florida’s 28 congressional districts.
“I think that the GOP should tread very carefully, because if they try to stretch their advantage too thin, it could backfire in ways that they don’t foresee right now,” Rouson said. 
“For example, if they diminish the margins for incumbent Republicans, thinking that they are safe, small shifts in the future could make districts competitive and give an advantage to the Democrats to gain more seats.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins came to the Iowa State Fair Saturday to compete in the Governor’s Charity Steer Show — and to announce $152 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture investments for Iowa rural development projects.
Before heading to the Livestock Pavillion to show the steer Snoop Dog, Rollins announced that 19 projects in Iowa would receive funding through USDA Rural Development grant and loan programs. The announcement was made at a news conference where she was joined by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and state Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig.
Approved projects include a $37 million loan for the Guthrie County Hospital in Guthrie Center to expand and renovate its facility, a $5 million grant and $39 million loan for the City of Emmetsburg to replace its wastewater treatment facility, and a $27.7 million loan to the Southern Sioux County Rural Water System for the building of new wells, a treatment plant and transmission lines in Plymouth and Sioux Counties.
“This unprecedented, coordinated rural development project will help boost the rural economies, develop rural infrastructure and encourage private investments,” Rollins said.
Reynolds celebrated the investment and thanked Rollins for working closely with Iowa, saying “during this time of uncertainty in the ag economy, I’m so grateful to have a partner that we can rely on.”

She said the new investments will make a difference in rural Iowa communities. Reynolds said when she visited the Guthrie County Hospital in May, where she signed a law aimed at expanding medical training opportunities and rural health care access, the hospital CEO had told her about how much of a difference the USDA funding would make in helping the facility continue to provide health care in their community.
Rollins said the investment is part of a larger effort from President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress aimed at “putting farmers first again,” which she said is also being done through new international trade agreements, investments in farm safety net programs and agriculture components of the budget reconciliation bill passed.
Though much of the focus on discussing the “big, beautiful bill” has surrounded the cuts and changes to public assistance programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Rollins said the bill “protected two million family farms from the death tax,” increased reference prices and extended clean fuel production tax credits.
“Most of the mainstream media focused on, ‘Oh, these horrible cuts that are going to cause death and destruction across the world’ — which, of course, none of that was true,” Rollins said. “In fact, we were investing more money, Congress was, into our agriculture sector and putting farmers first.”
Some agriculture policy advocates have said the budget reconciliation bill, which cuts SNAP funding while increasing spending on farm subsidies, will further consolidate the agriculture industry and benefit wealthy farmers.
It’s the second event Reynolds and Rollins have held together this week. On Monday, the Iowa governor was in Washington, D.C. for a news conference where Rollins signed six waivers approving restrictions on purchases of certain food items through the SNAP. Rollins approved Iowa’s waiver to limit unhealthy foods available to buy through SNAP in May.
USDA also approved an Iowa waiver to implement an summer eating program for kids, called Healthy Kids Iowa, earlier in the year. The demonstration project, providing a box of food valued at $40 each month for families in need through 264 access points across the state, is an alternative to the SUN Bucks program, also known as Summer EBT, that provides $120 per child each month during the summer to eligible families that can be used at retailers accepting SNAP.
Both of these efforts are aimed at reducing unhealthy eating habits, the governor said, though hunger advocates have argued these steps make it more difficult for Iowans to access food assistance.
Rollins also spoke on her announcement in July for the USDA to restructure and consolidate parts of the agency, in part by relocating some of USDA workforce outside of Washington, D.C. to five regional hubs in North Carolina, Missouri, Indiana, Colorado and Utah.
The list has “no Iowa, but there are more announcements coming,” Rollins said. She said Iowa is well represented at the USDA, with many agency employees in the state and several Iowans in USDA leadership positions.
“The bottom line is moving the power out of Washington, returning the government to the people, and having people that are better able to serve our constituents, who are closer to them,” Rollins said. “So that is the bigger (arch), but more news coming in the days to come.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rollins.steershow-scaled-e1754776297556-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-08-09 19:57:23.972697

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)ITHACA, Nebraska — President Donald Trump’s ag secretary visited Nebraska after a Saturday storm and faced questions from farmers about some dark skies facing agriculture, including a few clouds some said the administration stirred.
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins heard about tariffs and trade in a closed-press roundtable at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Eastern Nebraska Research, Extension and Education Center. 
Rollins got an inkling of the economic disruption of on-again, off-again, on-again tariffs with key trade partners for Nebraska agriculture, including Mexico and Canada, attendees said. 
She also heard some thanks from local producers for the Trump administration’s progress toward trade expansion into major markets, such as Japan, South Korea and Australia.
Nebraska delegation hosts Rollins

She was joined by Nebraska U.S. Reps. Don Bacon, a member of the House Ag Committee, Rep. Mike Flood, who leads the House Main Street Caucus, and Rep. Adrian Smith, from the Ways and Means Committee.
The four from Nebraska’s five-member, all-GOP delegation emphasized the help and benefits coming Nebraska’s way from the tax and spending cuts bill they recently passed. The fifth, U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., told Fischer he had a scheduling conflict. 
Fischer, whose family operates a cattle ranch near Valentine, talked about the importance of providing tax certainty for planning at a time of increasing costs for ag inputs.
National statistics indicate that Nebraska and neighboring Iowa lost more than 6% of their gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2025, the worst declines nationally, led by ag.
Growers voice concerns
Row-crop producers face the most difficult economic conditions after years of depressed pricing and now with tariffs added, producers told the secretary and delegation.
Rollins acknowledged that many growers may need federal help with price supports and affording fertilizer after many of them extended themselves to get through operations in another tough year.

The secretary said that’s why it was important — with the farm bill delayed in Congress — that some baseline protections for crop pricing were included in the GOP tax and spending bill Trump has labeled “big” and “beautiful.”
“Row croppers have been operating at a loss for a number of years,” Rollins said. ”That’s not sustainable.”
She and Fischer said Trump knows the issues facing farmers and ranchers and teased that his administration would act soon to offer some relief, including some help with farm labor.
“There’s a lot of risk involved in agriculture,” Fischer said. “You can’t control the weather. When you drove up today, you probably saw some corn that was stripped by the wind. 
“That’s why these safety nets are so important for crop producers, that they have that.”
Flood, who represents an eastern Nebraska district that includes Lincoln, said he has been talking with growers and bankers who say they need help to reduce the risk of defaulting on loans.
“Corn’s at $3.80 a bushel,” Flood said. “That doesn’t pay the bills.”
Boosting trade could help
Bacon, who represents the Omaha area, said that Nebraska needs to get more corn and soybeans “out the door” and that tariff uncertainty and a new jobs report concern him.
He argued that free trade is his preferred approach, and that it’s better for the economy, but he said he understands the president sometimes has to act to address trade imbalances.

Bacon said some producers tell him they will need help, and one of the best ways to help is by expanding the reach of biofuels into aviation fuel and higher ethanol blends in gasoline.
“It’s the only way you’re going to move enough corn and soybeans,” he said. “Otherwise you’re going to have a depression, and … we’re going to see it pretty squarely.”
Bacon, who is not running again for the 2nd Congressional District seat in 2026, said Trump had made enough progress slowing down border traffic that he could announce new visa efforts for ag workers.
The Trump crackdown on migrant workers has left some ag producers with a labor shortage, including in one of Nebraska ag’s good-news stories: an increasing number of dairies.
Defending Trump
Smith, who represents Nebraska’s sprawling, rural 3rd Congressional District, one of the country’s most conservative, defended Trump’s trying to get fairer deals from other countries. 
Feds say Nebraska GDP shrunk more than 6% in early 2025, led by ag

Smith has previously said he is no fan of tariffs, but that he considers them a tool in the president’s negotiating toolbox that he has used effectively to wring concessions.
Smith said Trump is dealing with the hand he was dealt. The congressman spent much of the past four years criticizing the Biden administration for letting ag trade languish as a back-burner issue.
People who served in the Biden administration U.S. Department of Agriculture have argued they prioritized trade. But Smith said more could and should have been done, as evidenced by a new deal with the United Kingdom.
He told Rollins he appreciated her “bringing attention to the challenges facing agriculture.” Bacon stressed that even in urban Omaha, one in three jobs are tied to agriculture. 
Research’s role
Fischer and Flood stressed the importance of the federal government and USDA continuing to invest in ag research at land-grant universities like UNL.

Flood said he is working with Fischer to secure the last $60 million needed to get the USDA research facility finished on Lincoln’s Nebraska Innovation Campus for 300 USDA researchers.
Rollins toured a UNL-managed feedlot in Saunders County with Derek McLean, dean of the Agricultural Research Division at UNL’s Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
It was the secretary’s second trip to Nebraska and the first leg of a two-stop trip sending her next to the Iowa State Fair to join Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds showing steer in Des Moines.
Said Fischer: “Our delegation understands the importance of agriculture. We are really, really fortunate to have a secretary like Secretary Rollins. She is easy to reach out to.”

Now is the moment to take careful stock of how we’ve spent federal funds and where we should invest going forward. 
The post In the face of federal cuts, Mass. must spend transportation dollars right appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","EVERY DAY, we hear of federally funded projects being terminated as part of a troubling pivot away from equity and logic. The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill is potentially estimated to rescind over $4.7 billion in competitive grants for transportation alone – including $327 million from a grant to the Allston Multimodal Project to rework a section of the Massachusetts Turnpike. Climate and transportation sector projects are distinctly vulnerable to these terminations and funding pauses, something that brings a worrisome outlook for the future.  
Transportation contributes to almost 40 percent of emissions in Massachusetts, which highlights its interconnectedness to the climate and, ultimately, to public health. To fulfill Massachusetts’s ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, we must ensure that we spend every federal dollar we do have to move the state in a cleaner, more equitable direction.  
A new, interactive tool and analysis shows Massachusetts, compared to other states, largely making progress in spending federal transportation dollars on the right things. Using data from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, this analysis demonstrates that Massachusetts is on track, compared to baseline emissions levels before the 2021 legislation, to reduce over 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions between 2022 and 2040. This is thanks to smart investments in public transit – buses and passenger rail, electrification, and active transportation modes like pedestrian, street, and bike safety infrastructure.  
This is terrific news. But in an era where the current federal government is working against climate action at every step, we need to take a deeper dive and see what more we can do.  
The analysis shows that Massachusetts could potentially reduce an additional 500,000 tonnes of emissions by 2040, and save $250 million, if roadway capacity expansion project funding is dedicated to mobility options that have emissions reducing co-benefits. 
Take Springfield, a city with among the highest rates of asthma in the country. A look at the kind of projects funded there by Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act money shows that the biggest funding – $30 million – went toward interstate highway maintenance, outpacing funding for active transportation 10 times over. 
Now is the moment to take careful stock of how we’ve spent federal funds and where we should invest going forward. The magnitude of the impact of clawed-back funds is unnerving, and, as a state, we need to look at more pragmatic ways of dealing with this imminent reality. Here are some areas where strategic thinking and decision-making could make a difference. 

The Infrastructure and Jobs Act is set for reauthorization next year, a process that will determine how much transportation money will be carved out for transportation, and how and where those monies are going to be spent. This is a real opportunity to influence priority-setting by making sure that there is emphasis on public transit, rural transportation, and multi-modal transportation systems that have clear health and climate co-benefits. 


The unmistakable correlation between transportation and climate should be reflected in how we plan and spend for our transportation networks. Measures like the Freedom to Move bill will do this by championing more public transit opportunities and providing multi-modal options for travel, rather than expanding and over-relying on traditional road infrastructure. It does so by making our dollars work better for our needs and our climate, offering a more thoughtful way of embedding climate and transportation justice considerations into the transportation project planning process. This ensures that transportation dollars are not spent on initiatives that degrade air quality and instead have emission-reduction benefits that ultimately help improve health outcomes and give us all more options for how to get around.  


Finally, we must ensure we have enough state revenue to go around to make any of this possible. Our Funding Our Future report offered concrete solutions for more sustainable funding sources, and yet only short-term measures have been taken. The MBTA is the only major transit agency in the country that does not have a designated source for capital expenditure, and Western and Central Massachusetts yearn for more direct connection to Boston. While Fair Share dollars from the new levy on income over $1 million have saved the day, its surplus is set to taper as collection estimates and expenditure caps become more accurate over the next couple of years. 

Although the federal funding landscape is far more uncertain than when the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was passed, the Commonwealth is equipped with ways to overcome these challenges – starting by taking a clear-eyed view of what we’ve spent so far where, and how we can invest in choices that bring us cleaner air, more equitable and reliable ways to get around, and a climate resilient future.

“With me in the White House,” he said in his March 14 address, “you once again have a president who will always have your back.”
Two weeks later, in one fell swoop, Trump’s Department of Justice slashed an estimated $500 million in federal funding to programs to help local and state justice initiatives, including policing, crime prevention, victim services and juvenile justice. The grants varied in size from $50,000 to nearly $30 million and included efforts ranging from a community policing program to work with teens in Houston to money for an extra investigator to help prosecutors in Oregon go after fentanyl dealers.
The cuts have emerged as one of the most glaring tensions between Trump’s rhetoric and his actions on law enforcement in the first six months of his second term. But it’s far from the only one. The result has been a complicated relationship with law enforcement groups, some of whom say the president’s actions have at times been contradictory.
Just this week, for example, the Trump administration protected the union contract for more than 4,000 Veterans Affairs police, firefighters and security guards, while canceling the contracts of almost all other workers’ unions in the agency. But on the same day, Trump threatened a federal takeover of Washington D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department.
“The consensus from people who have expressed their opinions to me is that he’s talking out of both sides of his mouth,” said Ashley Heiberger, a policing professor at Moravian University and a 22-year police veteran.

The disconnect began on Inauguration Day, when Trump pardoned more than 1,000 people convicted in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, including hundreds who were guilty of assaulting police, calling the rioters “hostages.” Many police unions and professional organizations criticized the move, saying Trump was putting police in danger by absolving people who had attacked officers. “Those convicted of [killing or assaulting] law enforcement officers should serve their full sentences,” said the national Fraternal Order of Police, along with the International Association of Police Chiefs, in a joint statement.
Since then, however, Trump and his Department of Justice have held themselves out as the protectors of state and local police, backing away from civil rights investigations involving at least a dozen police agencies. And police unions applauded an executive order Trump issued in April that promised, among other things, free legal representation for law enforcement agents accused of crimes in the line of duty and more local law enforcement access to military weapons and equipment.
More recently, Attorney General Pam Bondi’s office recommended a one-day sentence — with that time already served — for Brett Hankison, one of the officers involved in the 2020 shooting death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. Legal experts described the move as unprecedented because the recommendation was far below the sentencing guidelines. The judge in the case ultimately sentenced Hankison to 33 months in prison.
In June, leaders from the nation’s largest police union also praised the temporary tax cut on overtime pay in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, saying that it will help with police recruitment and retention, because overtime is an important part of compensation for many officers. The overtime tax cut lasts through 2028, according to the IRS.
But in other realms, Trump’s promises on cutting federal funding and his allegiance to his political allies has cut against the cozy relationship with police.
The administration and leaders of some of the nation’s 18,000 law enforcement agencies — particularly those in large, diverse cities — have clashed on issues like immigration enforcement and the Department of Justice’s stance against diversity initiatives.

Some local and state police officials are particularly concerned about the $500 million in cuts to their agencies and to organizations that support public safety efforts. Bondi has branded the cuts as a move to more directly invest in local and state police agencies. But some agencies are already feeling a budget crunch.
In June, a group of law enforcement leaders from around the country sent a letter to Bondi urging her to restore gun violence prevention grants, saying the money fueled initiatives that reduced homicides and other crimes, according to Reuters. So far, the Department of Justice has not changed course.
Some of the budget cuts targeted funding for police officer training and wellness, technical assistance for rural departments and other grants to law enforcement. But the biggest cuts affected other efforts — many run by other public agencies or non-profit groups — that augment and complement policing, like mental-health crisis responders, substance abuse programs, and community violence intervention.
In early July, a federal judge allowed the cuts to proceed, while calling them “shameful.” Judge Amit Mehta, in Washington D.C., concluded that the administration’s action “is likely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence,” but that it wasn’t within his power to stop it. “Displeasure and sympathy are not enough in a court of law,” Mehta wrote.
A staffer from the Department of Governmental Efficiency compiled the initial list of programs to be cut, according to reporting from Reuters. Justice Department officials said they were pivoting to putting the money towards programs that more directly supported law enforcement, but experts told The Marshall Project that the shift is not supported by the data.
“What’s so striking about these cuts, is that it really undermines the administration and [the Justice] Department’s stated claims to prioritize tackling violent crime, because many of the grants that we looked at were doing precisely that,” said Nicole Ndumele, a former Department of Justice deputy attorney general who now works as a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal-leaning, non-partisan, criminal justice think tank. Ndumele was part of a team that analyzed the cuts and concluded that they are likely to increase crime.
The cuts, she said, “really get to the heart of undermining everyone in America’s shared interest in living in a safe community.”

A number of the federal cuts targeted policing research, for example a $1 million grant to study whether officers who train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu might use less force or sustain fewer personal injuries on duty. The Marshall Project investigated this concept in 2021, as it was beginning to catch on in departments across the country, and found very little empirical data on the effort.
Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said that research like this is invaluable because police departments are often on their own in determining what kind of training to pursue.
“American policing needs to know what works, period. And there’s no central repository to get that information,” Wexler said. He noted that Justice Department-funded studies are often the closest thing the country has to a “Good Housekeeping Seal of approval that police departments can have in determining what training works.”
In rural Covington County in southern Alabama, another of the now-cancelled grants had been paying for a “Connect and Protect” program that paired sheriff’s deputies with mental health professionals in responding to certain calls and trained officers in crisis de-escalation. The program also set up a telehealth system so that people in crisis could be evaluated on the spot instead of hauled to jail or the emergency room.
The loss of funding has led to staff departures, and will force officers back to handling mental health calls alone, according to a spokesperson for the South Central Alabama Mental Health Center, which administers the program. “If funding is not restored, we risk reverting to a fragmented and reactive system, where law enforcement bears the burden of mental health crises, and individuals in need face unnecessary trauma, delays or incarceration,” the center said via email.
Other programs are somewhat more optimistic about weathering the loss of funding. The 30×30 Initiative, for example, is an effort by the Policing Project and New York University law school seeking to increase the proportion of women police officers in the U.S. to 30% by 2030. The effort is built on research that shows female officers use less force and less excessive force, face fewer lawsuits and are generally perceived as more trustworthy and compassionate by people affected by violent crime.
Maureen McGough, the program’s chief of strategic initiatives, said the funding cuts will limit the effort’s effectiveness, but she’s still bullish on their prospects. “I can’t overstate how much state and local [law enforcement agencies] have stayed with us,” McGough said, even as the federal government cuts funding and as federal agencies pull out of partnerships with 30×30. “I have so much faith in this current and next generation of law enforcement leaders to promote this work internally, which is where it matters most.”
Trump’s stance on policing-related issues at the start of his second term has surprised even some people who worked for the Justice Department the first time he was in office. Federal prosecutors tried to withdraw from most Obama-era investigations of police during Trump’s first term, but the Justice Department still investigated and found civil rights violations in the police department in Springfield, Massachusetts. Trump also pulled back federal grant money for policing in his first term, but people in the policing sector say this round of cuts is far more severe.
Even though many of the groups affected by the cuts are not directly embedded in local police agencies, sheriffs and police chiefs are bracing for the indirect impacts.
The Marshall Project reached out to dozens of police agencies for this story. Almost all declined to comment or did not return calls and emails.
Chief Mitchell Davis III at the Hazel Crest Police Department in a suburb of Chicago was an exception. He’s on the board of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and a past president of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police.
Davis said his department of 37 sworn officers has not experienced cuts yet. But most of his supplemental funding comes from federal grants handed out on the state level, so he thinks he will have to abandon his hopes to keep up with the latest advances in crime-fighting equipment.
“I don’t know anyone who’s got enough money,” Davis said of local police departments. “We all rely to some extent on federal funding, and when that is taken off the table, it’s going to hinder us.”

Aug. 8, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceTRAVERSE CITY – U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers was scheduled as one of the keynote speakers at a glitzy Republican dinner on Friday to honor the late state Sen. George McManus of Traverse City, but after an hour of shaking hands and greeting up north party fixtures, Rogers left early and never addressed the crowd.
His campaign for the U.S. Senate said Rogers was happy to be there but had another campaign event in Gaylord and that the dinner was running over time, prompting his exit. But the crowd at the dinner appeared to be visibly bewildered when it was announced midway through that Rogers was no longer there and they wouldn’t get to hear him speak, seeing as how he was one of the main draws of the evening.
Few people at the dinner were aware of any other Republican event featuring Rogers in the region that evening.
The campaign did not respond when asked about the nature of the event Rogers left to attend.
The McManus dinner, held in a sprawling conference center space at the Great Wolf Lodge in scenic Traverse City, however, started promptly at 6 p.m. as planned and concluded right around the stated 9 p.m. end time.
There was talk at the dinner that Rogers was upset because he was not speaking first – U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Watersmeet) was scheduled to speak first, and did.
Bergman told the Advance afterward that the rumor of Rogers demanding to speak first was inaccurate, and that last minute scheduling items often come up for candidates seeking important federal office.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The itinerary clearly showed that Bergman was first in the order, but Bergman made a comment at the beginning of his speech that he didn’t think he was supposed to be going first.
Still, Rogers never spoke to the crowd, first or otherwise. He and his campaign staff were present in the room for the opening prayer and pledge of allegiance, but were absent when the speaker portion began.
As the night wore on, some patrons, who were seated close to an area for the Advance and other local press, could be seen whispering to each other and repeatedly pointing to the itinerary of speakers.
Rogers and his wife created a social media video showing them at the Great Wolf Lodge on Friday, saying that the room was packed with Republicans who were fired up for the 2026 contest. It is unclear when the video was taken – before he entered the building or when he was on his way out the door.
His Facebook page, where the video was posted, did not feature a mention of another event later that evening.
Rogers did, however, post pictures from the Cops & Doughnuts location in Gaylord on Saturday morning, which indicated that he had visited the city at some point this weekend.
Dennis Lennox, a political consultant and one of the co-organizers of the event, spoke to the Advance on Saturday in his personal capacity and not as a representative of the group behind the dinner.
Lennox said that he also was unaware of any other event planned in Northern Michigan on Friday evening, nor was there an event that other attendees knew about.
Indeed, the affair on Friday was a venerable who’s who of up north Republicans, party folk from around the state and donors who attended the dinner in honor of McManus, a well-respected regional Republican senator who served in the upper chamber for a decade.
“It’s unfortunate because a lot of people came to the dinner looking forward to hearing the presumptive Republican nominee for United States Senate, and for whatever reason, did not get an opportunity to hear from him,” Lennox said. “Now, with that said, I would also, for the record, say that pretty much everybody in attendance last night is a political person, current or former, and understands that things come up and can, and things can and do happen.”
Lennox did note that the situation was odd, either way.
Still, the event continued on unabated, allowing other Republican candidates an opportunity to speak to donors and GOP faithful in Michigan’s north country.
That included gubernatorial candidate Tom Leonard and attorney general candidate Doug Lloyd, who many at the event said were the stars of the show.
Leonard says Michigan Republicans should focus more on mental health care
Leonard needed no introduction as the former Speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, the former 2018 nominee for attorney general and a candidate for the same office in 2022.
Yet the dinner, which featured no other candidates for governor on the speaking schedule, used the address as a case for why Republicans should nominate him in the 2026 primary.
“When you look at the state of this state right now, did you know the only state that Michigan beat for population growth the first two decades of this century was West Virginia? We are currently 49 out of 50 in unemployment. We are bottom 10 for income total, and if we don’t change it, the next few years, we’re going to be 49 out of 50,” Leonard warned. “The last thing I want, the last thing anybody in this room wants, is for their child or their grandchild to come to them and say, ‘Dad, Grandma, Mom, grandpa, I’ve got to leave the state for better opportunity.’”
Although Leonard said trips to Florida for family time doesn’t sound half bad, he can’t rationalize giving up the fight and letting nearby states like Ohio steal Michigan’s future.

“We’ve got to turn this around,” Leonard said, and made a case for how he would do it.
The candidate mentioned state occupational licensure reform, which has bipartisan support in the state Legislature, to help reduce hoops for licensed professionals seeking to practice in Michigan.
On education, Leonard made another pitch for Republicans to stand steadfast behind school choice, particularly home schooling, which he said has been under attack for years.
Another issue that Leonard championed on Friday evening was expanded access to mental health care. 
That push may very well resonate with people in Traverse City following the recent tragic multiple stabbing event at an area Walmart. The alleged perpetrator reportedly had severe mental health issues that went unaddressed, and many have said that better access to care might have prevented the stabbing.
“Why should Republicans ever shy away from mental health reform? … This is something that’s been near and dear to my heart for nearly 20 years,” Leonard said. “I always ask this question, ‘why is it that we should wait for somebody to hurt themselves or hurt somebody else before we get them the help that they need?’ Republicans ought to be running on this issue.”
Leonard also said Republicans in the next cycle need to run on positivity and solutions and not on old grievances against Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or any of the candidates seeking to succeed her.
“I talk to police officers that are overwhelmed because of this mental health crisis that is facing our state, and frankly, they don’t want a candidate for governor, they don’t want any politician, that’s going to go out there every single day dividing us, dividing others, and poking others,” Leonard said. They want somebody that’s going to listen to them, and they want something that’s going to bring real solutions to the table and solve their problems.”
Leonard concluded by saying that’s what Republicans are going to see with his campaign over the next several months.
Lloyd touts prosecutor work in Eaton County as pathway to AG’s office
The fight to elect a Republican to the attorney general’s office after eight years of Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel is also of high priority for the GOP faithful across the state.
Lloyd, the current Eaton County prosecutor, said his experience in the office will translate well into the state’s top law enforcement position. He said that the attorney general is also tasked with protecting constitutional rights, not just prosecuting crimes, adding that it takes experience to be able to counsel the Legislature against making bad laws that could harm citizens, and to have the restraint to focus on state issues, a knock on Nessel’s push to repeatedly sue the administration of President Donald Trump on a multitude of federal policies in the opening months of his second term.

“We see local sheriffs and prosecutors who are understaffed and overwhelmed every single day as they battle to fight and continue on with the large case loads that they must carry,” Lloyd said. “But instead of the attorney general using her resources in a way that is beneficial to the state, she decides to play political games, filing suits against the Trump administration, instead of actually being a leader.”
Lloyd asked Republicans in the room to help nominate an attorney general candidate who could actually win the general election, a subtle knock against candidates in the past who lost to Nessel, which includes Leonard and former 2022 nominee Matt DePerno. 
To Leonard’s credit, his race against Nessel was incredibly close, with the Republican candidate losing by less than 3 percentage points. DePerno, however, lost to Nessel by nearly 10 percentage points.
“In 2026 what you need to understand is that Republicans must win,” Lloyd said. “We need to nominate candidates who can actually rally the party and the votes. We will need winners, not distractions.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8084391-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-09 15:57:11.675456

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)In agreeing to deploy the Nevada National Guard to help carry out the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda, Gov. Joe Lombardo is “turning Nevadans against Nevadans,” said Democratic U.S. Rep. Dina Titus.
Titus was among several Nevadans who expressed harsh reactions to Lombardo’s decision.
Lombardo’s office told the Nevada Independent Friday that about two dozen Nevada National Guard personnel will be providing “administrative” assistance to U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The Defense Department late last month authorized several states, all with Republican governors, to deploy National Guard assistance with mass deportation efforts. The DOD statement said National Guard personnel would provide “case management, transportation and logistical support, and clerical support for the in- and out-processing” of undocumented people at ICE detention facilities. 
The DOD statement noted the federal government would pay for National Guard assistance.
Lombardo is the latest Republican governor to agree to the Trump administration’s overture seeking National Guard support for ICE activities.
Several states (including Florida, Louisiana, South Dakota, Tennesee, Idaho, South Carolina, and Wyoming) have so far announced or confirmed National Guard personnel will be accordingly called up, with several others poised to join them.
ICE’s tactics, which have included masked men apprehending people off the streets in unmarked cars, and detaining people with no criminal records and U.S. citizens, have been met with a barrage of criticism and scrutiny.
Immigration has consistently been Trump’s strongest issue in polling over the years. But a Gallup poll last month found 35% of respondents approving of Trump’s handling of immigration, while 62% disapproved.
At least one Republican governor has declined to authorize the National Guard.
A spokesperson for Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said due to “concern for the tactics, and disruption that some of those tactics are causing, in workplaces and communities,” the Vermont National Guard would not be called up to help ICE.
Concern about tactics and disruption were similarly cited by Nevadans who blasted Lombardo’s decision.
“The Nevada National Guard’s mission is to protect us, not sow more fear in our communities by doing Trump’s dirty work,” Titus said Friday on X.
The Nevada Latino Legislative Caucus issued a statement Friday evening saying Lombardo “has chosen Trump over Nevada.”
“He is not protecting our communities, he is helping to tear them apart,” said Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Gonzalez, NLLC caucus chair.
“Mass deportations,” the NLCC statement continued, “will devastate Nevada’s families, our economy, and our reputation. Tourists will be scared away, small businesses will lose workers, and neighborhoods will be militarized. Children will fear going to school. Families will live in constant terror.”
The state “deserves leaders who will stand up to Washington when it threatens our values, not roll over and hand them the keys to our state,” the NLCC statement added.
Saying Nevada Republicans “have moved so far right they’re unrecognizable,” Democratic state Sen. Fabian Doñate noted that Lombardo’s most recent Republican predecessor, Gov. Brian Sandoval, ruled out calling the National Guard to help round up undocumented people when Trump made a similar request during his first administration.
The “Trump-Lombardo agenda has fractured families and already negatively impacted Nevada’s tourism-dependent economy,” said the Nevada Immigration Coalition in a statement responding to Lombardo’s decision to deploy the National Guard.
“It’s shameful that Lombardo has bent the knee to Trump,” the statement added.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lombardo-DSC01395-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-09 13:58:46.357555

(Lynn Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Flint Hills Trail State Park, a 93-mile path that carves through grasslands and prairie, earned an induction in the national Rails to Trails Conservancy’s hall of fame.
The trail beat out two others in Florida and Utah by a landslide, with 80% of the vote, according to an announcement from the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks.
“The Flint Hills Trail isn’t just a path across Kansas,” said Jeffrey Bender, a region supervisor for the department. “It’s a journey through the essence of Kansas — through the land, the cultures and the endeavors of the communities.”
The trail is one of the longest rail-trails in the United States, and the longest in Kansas. It will eventually stretch 118 miles from Osawatomie to Herington. Rail-trails are multi-use paths converted from unused railway corridors.
It is the second Kansas stretch to be inducted into the Rails to Trails hall of fame. The Prairie Spirit Trail was the first major rail-to-trail in Kansas and was added to the hall of fame in 2011 during its 15th anniversary month. The 51-mile trail connects to the Flint Hills Trail, running from Ottawa to Iola.

The Kansas Legislature designated the Flint Hills Trail as a state park in 2018. In 2020, the U.S. Department of the Interior recognized it as a National Recreation Trail. In 2022, Kansas received nearly $25 million in federal grant funds to improve more than 40 miles of trail.
Ryan Chao, president of the conservancy, said in a news release that the Flint Hills Trail “has catalyzed the state’s trail economy.” 
“This trail stands out as a prime example of how trails bring joy, provide cultural and historic connection, and deliver economic opportunity — all critical to quality of life across America,” Chao said.

The conservancy advocates for the creation of rail-trails across the United States. One of its major projects includes the Great American Rail Trail, a still-in-progress path that will eventually span the country from Washington, D.C., to Washington state.
Flint Hills Trail users can walk, bike, hike and horseback ride on the trail. Portions are accessible by wheelchair.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said the induction was an honor and “testament to the natural beauty of our state and the commitment of Kansans who have worked to preserve it.” 
“In addition to promoting healthier lifestyles, Kansas state parks contribute millions to the economy annually,” she said. “The importance of these parks to our state’s economic well-being, as well as to the quality of life of Kansans, cannot be overstated.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250804_195212-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-09 12:57:32.259425

When there’s a maternal health emergency, Jessica Wheat springs into action.
Alongside a group of specialized health providers at Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Wheat works fast to make sure patients are able to have their babies delivered safely or their children given critical treatment at the Level III neonatal intensive care unit on site.
“We have just an abundance of resources, and people that know what they’re doing,” the labor and delivery nurse said.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

That abundance is coming to an end. Last month, HCA Midwest Health, which owns Research Medical Center, announced it was closing its obstetrics program and NICU. The umbrella company that runs HCA Midwest Health, which oversees multiple hospitals and related sites of care in nearly two dozen states, cited declining births at the hospital as part of its reasons for the closure.
Wheat is worried about the implications for local patients who often struggle to find transportation even across Kansas City. But she’s also concerned about the rural patients outside of the metro area.
“We tend to get smaller hospitals that will Life Flight bleeding moms or moms who are breech or moms who are having a hypertensive crisis,” she said. “We can do the emergency C-section — a lot of smaller hospitals do not have those capabilities. The farther they have to go, the more at risk they’re going to be for complications, even death.”
The availability of obstetrics care in America has been dwindling for years. That could accelerate now, as hospital leaders across the country warn that President Donald Trump’s massive cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income Americans, could leave pregnant people in rural communities with vanishingly few options for medical care.
Obstetrics is one of the most expensive services provided by hospitals, especially in rural areas, which often see a larger portion of Medicaid patients. Nationwide, the program pays for about 40% of all births. With financial hits looming, hospitals are primed to close maternity wards first, and rural areas are particularly vulnerable.
“This is going to have an enormous impact,” said Dr. John Cullen, a family physician in Valdez, Alaska, a remote city of about 4,000 people. “Already we’re seeing OB deserts that are increasing in size, and after the passage of this bill those are going to be markedly worse — where people are going to have to drive hundreds of miles before they can get prenatal care, much less delivery.”
For years, hospitals facing financial pressure have shuttered maternity wards. Between 2010 and 2022, more than 500 hospitals across the country dropped obstetrics, per a recent study that also shows more than half of rural counties now have no hospital-based obstetric services. A report from the advocacy group March of Dimes found that 1 in 3 U.S. counties had no OBGYN at all.

There are numerous reasons for the recent closures, ranging from declining births to difficulties hiring local providers. But the biggest issue is financial: Hospitals typically don’t earn enough from labor and delivery to cover the cost. Now, cuts to Medicaid — which will further cut hospital revenues and increase their share of uncompensated care — threaten to strain finances further.
“I do have a lot of concern that we’ll continue to see labor and delivery units close in rural hospitals and potentially even at an accelerated rate, as hospitals feel greater strain due to cuts in the bill,” said Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association.
The National Rural Health Association and Manatt Health, a consulting firm, estimated in June that the proposed Medicaid cuts over 10 years could reach almost $70 billion just for rural hospitals. Nearly half of all children and 1 in 5 adults in rural communities are enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program. The health insurance plan also pays hospitals less for the same services than private insurance does.
“When rural hospitals say, ‘We have these big Medicaid cuts, how do we deal with that shortfall?’ the OB units are going to be first on the chopping block,” said Jamie Daw, an associate professor of health policy at Columbia University.
One analysis from the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonpartisan organization that supports policies such as equal pay and access to health care, suggests that the new cuts to Medicaid put almost 150 rural hospitals with maternity services at risk of serious downsizing or closing altogether.
The changes to Medicaid — including cumbersome new paperwork requirements for people insured through the program, and cuts to some of the taxes used to finance state Medicaid programs — largely won’t take effect until after the 2026 midterm elections. But already, hospitals are preparing for huge reductions in services, and pointing to labor and delivery as one of their most vulnerable offerings.
Michigan-based Trinity Health operates five hospitals that include maternity services. Hospital leaders are deeply concerned about service cuts that would make it harder for pregnant patients to get appropriate medical care, said Dr. Sharon O’Leary, an OBGYN and the organization’s chief data analytics and chief equity officer.
When patients have to travel further for prenatal care, they are more likely to cut the number of doctors’ visits or to receive no prenatal care at all. Studies over the past several years have shown that obstetrics unit closures — and increased travel time for pregnant patients — result in higher rates of pregnancy-related complications, including premature birth and low birth weight.
“Our biggest fear is that as women lose coverage that they will not seek prenatal care,” O’Leary said.
The consequences are likely to be heightened in areas that are already underserved, and where birth outcomes are worse: rural parts of the country, and, in particular, large swaths of the South.
Got Medicaid? You’ll soon have access to doula services under a new Louisiana law

“While we are concerned about the impact the bill will have on all hospital services, we are particularly concerned about its impact on labor and delivery services,” said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
Already, rural areas have seen access to reproductive care dwindling, particularly in the past three years, since the fall of Roe v. Wade allowed states to outlaw abortion. Preliminary data shows that medical residents for OBGYN are applying in smaller numbers to states with abortion bans and a recent study in the medical journal JAMA, the first to assess the relationship between abortion bans and provider availability, found that in Idaho, the number of OBGYNs fell by 35 percent between August 2022 — when the state implemented its near-total ban — and December 2024.
Abortion ban states, which are largely in the South, also have higher rural populations, worse birth outcomes and larger shares of hospitals at risk of closure.
“It’s an additional trend — on top of this piece of the general financial pressure  — that’s going to also affect predominantly rural Southern communities,” Daw said. “It seems like a perfect storm of these concurrent trends really really affecting access to care.”
If hospitals reduce their pregnancy-related offerings, few alternatives will be able to fill in the gap. Earlier this year, the Trump administration began withholding millions of dollars in family planning grants through Title X, the federal program that supports family planning services for low-income people. Planned Parenthood, a major provider of services that include cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and contraception, is also one of the largest Title X providers. Most Planned Parenthood clinics are in rural or otherwise medically underserved areas. The federal budget and tax law also includes a provision that would cut federal Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, though that policy has since been blocked by a federal court ruling. In recent weeks, several clinics have announced their plans to close.
“You have to think of them as related,” Daw said. “It’s definitely not helpful to have all of these changes happening at the same time and really undermining the safety net for reproductive-aged women.”
Cochran-McClain said when a provider with a background in obstetrics care leaves a rural town or city, that impacts health services more broadly: Often, that provider was also providing contraception, general gynecological care and routine screenings.
“It’s so interconnected. While we’re talking specifically about labor, delivery and pregnancy, it can have an impact more broadly on access to women’s health in rural communities,” she said. “It’s been a rough couple of years before all of this, so it just feels like it’s a worsening trend in terms of overall access.”
The closure at Research Medical Center in Kansas City — where its obstetrics program is scheduled to close down in early September — also shows that even when a person in a rural area is forced to travel greater distances into a city setting for specialized care, those services aren’t guaranteed.
Wheat and other affected nurses at Research Medical Center, where they are represented by National Nurses United, said HCA Midwest Health has not provided enough information about the logistics of winding down services. Will the rest of the hospital, including its ICU unit, take emergency patients who need labor and delivery services? Or will the remaining staff in other areas of the hospital get specialized training?
HCA Midwest Health, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The 19th, said in a statement to a media outlet that it is working with area health providers to ensure patients have other delivery options.
Wheat has lined up another nursing job in labor and delivery with a different hospital system. In her text group chats with other impacted staff, there is a sense of sadness. She believes the obstetrics-related health providers will find other work, even if it means even more gas mileage to get to a new job. But Wheat keeps thinking about what’s to come for the patients.
“I’m emotionally exhausted. It is hard,” she said. “We’re just grieving for the community at this point, because we know they’re going to have a lot of issues after we’re gone.”

If the party chooses him at its nominating convention next year, Terrence Davis could face Republican Secretary of State Monae Johnson in the general election.
Johnson was elected in 2022, and has announced her intention to seek reelection.
Secretary of state apologizes for sharing list labeling thousands as public assistance applicants

In South Dakota, the secretary of state oversees elections, maintains voter registration records, and catalogs and manages campaign finance reporting for state office-seekers and political action committees. It also catalogs businesses and corporate filings, among other duties.
Davis, a Sioux Falls resident and Tennessee native, sent an announcement on his candidacy this week. The married father of one spent a year working for the South Dakota Highway Patrol, from 2021-2022, and another five working as a state trooper in Tennessee. He currently works for East River Legal Services in Sioux Falls, and is pursuing a doctoral degree in law and public policy through Liberty University.
He pledged to bring “transparency” and “accountability” to the office, and to deliver “more efficient, accessible services with the respect South Dakotans deserve.” Davis’ announcement also said he would make voting “both secure and accessible, especially for rural communities.”
“When people deny elections, fail to protect your privacy, they silence your voice. Incompetence is just as dangerous — it threatens our democracy and the future of South Dakota,” Davis said in his news release.
The quote does not name Johnson, but references criticisms of her work in office and statements made prior to taking it.
During the 2022 election, Johnson declined to say if the results of the 2020 presidential election, won by Joe Biden, were fair and legitimate.
Last month, Johnson’s office publicly released a list of registered voters that included confidential information on how they registered, including during applications for public assistance programs. The voter rolls were made available at no cost to the public pursuant to a state law that took effect July 1, but Johnson, after reporting by Searchlight and other media, apologized for including the confidential information and retracted it from the database.
Johnson did not immediately return emails requesting comment on Davis’ criticisms.

Mike Dunleavy has named Janelle Earls, the official in charge of the Alaska Department of Revenue’s operating budget, as the acting head of the department.
Earls will replace — at least temporarily — Adam Crum, who announced his resignation last week. Crum was scheduled to end his state service at the end of the day Friday.
As acting commissioner, Earls will also take Crum’s seat on the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. Board of Trustees.
Earls declined a request for an interview on Friday and did not answer a list of emailed questions. 
According to information released by the governor’s office, Earls has worked for the state of Alaska for more than 20 years, mostly with the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, which has since been split into two separate agencies.
She joined the Department of Revenue in May 2024 and lives in Juneau with her husband, three daughters and two grandchildren, according to the announcement.
In a brief written statement, she thanked Dunleavy “for placing his trust in me to manage the department and its numerous responsibilities during this important transition period.”
Earls will serve as acting commissioner until the governor picks a permanent replacement.
Dunleavy is term-limited and not eligible to run for re-election, meaning that his pick will serve only until December 2026, when the new governor picks commissioners.
That new governor may keep existing commissioners, but governors traditionally install new agency heads.

Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, joined demonstrators outside the U.S. Supreme Court on May 15 to protest the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, as justices heard a challenge to the order. (Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A federal judge in Maryland ordered a nationwide halt — again — to a Trump administration order that would have denied citizenship to any baby born in the U.S. after February unless at least one of the parents is a citizen.
The ruling late Thursday by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman is the fourth to  block President Donald Trump’s executive order since June, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges around the country had exceeded their authority by issuing nationwide stays.
But the justices said lower courts could issue nationwide injunctions if the lawsuits were class-action suits on behalf of all newborns in the U.S. who might be affected by the executive order. Which is what Boardman did Thursday
Boardman rejected a request to include parents in the class-action suit. But she identified a nationwide class of children born on U.S. soil who “unquestionably would be citizens but for the Executive Order,” an order the judge said is “almost certainly unconstitutional.”
She wrote that the plaintiffs — eight undocumented mothers who are pregnant or have children who were born in the U.S. — “are likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional claim because the Executive Order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth amendment,” which says that “all persons” born the U.S. are citizens of the country and of the state in which they were born.
While the immigrants would be harmed in the absence of an injunction, Boardman wrote, there would be little harm to the government to temporarily extending the practice of birthright citizenship that has been recognized in the U.S. for well over a century.

Boardman rejected the government’s argument that she should restrict her injunction just to Maryland.
“That relief must include every child in the United States who is subject to the Executive Order. After all, the Executive Order does not target only children born in Maryland; it seeks to deny citizenship to ‘persons born in the United States,’” she wrote.
A government attorney declined to comment Friday on the order, and emails seeking comment from the White House were not immediately returned. But immigrant advocates welcomed Boardman’s order.
“This is a national issue that affects every single one of us in this country,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA, which filed suit with the immigrant women.
The Maryland suit was one of several around the country that were filed soon after Trump’s order on “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” which he issued on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that birthright citizenship was never meant to be a universal right, and it said that anyone born after Feb.19 — a month after the order was signed — would be denied citizenship unless one parent was a citizen or permanent legal resident.
The order was swiftly challenges and three judges, including Boardman, issued nationwide injunctions to halt the order. When those were upheld on appeal, the government took the case to the Supreme Court, which said a national injunction could only be issued in class-action suit with a legitimate nationwide class of plaintiffs.
Within hours of that ruling, attorneys for CASA were back in court, filing paperwork to turn their case into a class-action suit, adding women from North and South Carolina, among other states as plaintiffs.
Boardman’s approval of a class-action suit, and a national preliminary injunction, comes almost a month after a U.S. District judge in New Hampshire did the same thing.
Frimpong called Trump’s order “just a part of the usual fear tactics to make people afraid of what they believe the federal government will do — even though it will never happen because it is blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional.”
She said she anticipates that the Trump administration will again appeal the decision, but predicts that the case will go through the ordinary course of litigation.
“What we are looking forward to is, once and for all. putting the issue to bed and our courts making absolutely clear that the 14th Amendment is not up for debate, and it’s not up for subjective interpretation,” Frimpong said. “It is the law and it is going to remain the law.”

(Photo courtesy of Friends of the Everglades/Ralph Awrood)Further construction at the Everglades deportation facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz” must be halted for at least two weeks, a federal judge ruled Thursday.
The center, located on an old airport runway surrounded by the Big Cypress National Preserve, will continue to operate and process immigrants, however.
“We’re pleased that the judge saw the urgent need to put a pause on additional construction, and we look forward to advancing our ultimate goal of protecting the unique and imperiled Everglades ecosystem from further damage caused by this mass detention facility,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, in a news release.
The two-week restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams comes as the court considers a preliminary injunction against the facility.
“Today’s ruling by an activist judge will have no impact on immigration enforcement in Florida. Alligator Alcatraz will remain operational, continuing to serve as a force multiplier to enhance deportation efforts,” Alex Lanfranconi, a Gov. Ron DeSantis spokesperson, posted to social media Thursday afternoon.
The injunction stops filling, paving, new lights, and new infrastructure.
DeSantis previously claimed construction at the facility was temporary and all operations would be carried out using portable units.
Environmental advocacy groups and the Miccosukee Tribe joined together to oppose construction, including pavement laid despite DeSantis’ claims.
“This facility is not only a threat to one of the most environmentally sensitive regions in the country,” Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani said in a news release.
“It is also a glaring example of how far the State of Florida will go to criminalize immigrants and ignore the long-term health of our natural resources. Constructed in direct conflict with the Everglades restoration efforts supported by taxpayers for decades, this project represents both environmental negligence and human rights violations.”
There was a hearing Wednesday about the restraining order.
Plaintiffs including Friends of the Everglades argued the facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.
Williams took over the case after Judge Jose Martinez recused himself.
The center has been controversial, sparking this and other lawsuits with Democratic lawmakers strongly speaking out against it.
“It’s a relief that the court stepped in to protect the Everglades’ sensitive waters, starry skies, and vulnerable creatures from further harm while we continue our case,” said Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. “We’re ready to press forward and put a stop to this despicable plan for good.”
The center has generated national headlines. President Donald Trump visited the facility last month and the Republican Party of Florida is using the center’s moniker on merchandise while immigrant advocacy groups speak out against conditions inside the facility.
“The detention facility threatens land that is not only environmentally sensitive but sacred to our people,” Talbert Cypress, Cchairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida said in the news release.
“While this order is temporary, it is an important step in asserting our rights and protecting our homeland. The Miccosukee Tribe will continue to stand for our culture, our sovereignty, and the Everglades.”

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Residents of historically redlined communities experience slower response times from emergency medical services, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to Black and Hispanic residents. The practice deemed neighborhoods with higher proportions of nonwhite residents to be undesirable and financially risky for mortgage lending.
Researchers mapped locations of EMS centers across 236 cities and analyzed maps produced in the 1930s by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. The government agency, created as part of the New Deal, consistently ranked majority-Black areas as “hazardous” for lending. Redlining has been illegal since enactment of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968.
The research team calculated average EMS response times using the location of ambulance, fire and rescue services and historical traffic data. “Rapid” response was defined as five minutes or less, the benchmark set by the National Fire Protection Association for high-priority patients with life-threatening conditions.
The team found that more than 2.2 million people lack rapid EMS access. Areas historically graded “D” — financially “hazardous” for mortgage lending — had a significantly higher proportion of residents (roughly 7%) without rapid EMS access, compared with about 4% of residents in historically “most desirable” A-graded neighborhoods. D-graded neighborhoods had higher proportions of Black residents, whereas A-graded neighborhoods had more white residents.
Disparities were particularly acute in the Great Lakes region, the authors note. The odds of lacking rapid access to EMS were nearly three times higher for residents in historically D-graded neighborhoods, compared with A-graded neighborhoods in that region.
The findings add to the evidence linking policies rooted in structural racism to health disparities.
Research has shown redlined neighborhoods still disproportionately grapple with a multitude of health disparities, lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution.
The study found a racial disparity in where EMS stations are located, with fewer EMS stations in urban communities of color. Better tracking and accountability of EMS response times in communities could help address the issue, the researchers wrote.
Delays in emergency care are associated with higher mortality rates. For traumatic injuries, timely care is critical during what EMS professionals call the “golden hour,” or the first 60 minutes after an injury.
Other research has pointed to disparities in emergency response times. EMS response times for patients with cardiac arrest, for example, were 10% longer for low-income ZIP codes than high-income ZIP codes, according to a national study published in JAMA Network Open in 2018.
The study received funding support from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

(Photo courtesy of Washington Department of Ecology)With groundwater in parts of eastern Washington declining at an alarming rate, a new study confirms which areas are most vulnerable to the problem and could help set clearer goals for recovery efforts.
The Washington State University study evaluated groundwater levels throughout the Washington portion of the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer System, which spans areas of Washington, Oregon and Idaho, and supplies up to a third of the region’s irrigation water.
Researchers found that the Odessa region and the Yakima Basin in eastern Washington are seeing groundwater levels drop by at least 2 to 3 feet per year. The declines in those areas are primarily attributed to a combination of groundwater overuse and climate variability. 
“This gives a quantitative target of how much water needs to be either put back into the ground or needs to be managed around to bring us back to some sort of steady condition,” said Sasha McLarty, study author and associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Washington State University. 
The Washington state Department of Ecology estimates that groundwater supplies drinking water to over 60% of Washington residents. 
Most municipalities have groundwater wells, and rural residents typically have wells on their properties, according to Jaime Short, section manager for the department’s Eastern Regional Office. 
In eastern Washington, Short said, groundwater is primarily used for irrigated agriculture. 
The Odessa region showed the most significant groundwater level decreases over the largest geographic area in Washington. 
The study notes that groundwater is the main water supply for the Odessa area. 
If groundwater levels continue to decrease at their current rate, the Odessa region will likely lose 10% of accessible groundwater by 2040 and 50% within the next 70 years, according to the study. 
The Yakima Basin showed steep declines in the deepest aquifer layer, making it more difficult to address the groundwater loss, McLarty said. 
The study confirms what the Department of Ecology and local stakeholders have known for decades, said Department of Ecology hydrogeologist Chris Beard.  
“Where it’s declining, it’s been declining for a long time,” Beard said. 
In general, communities in areas where groundwater levels are dropping have already initiated efforts to mitigate and reverse the decline, Beard said. 
The Department of Ecology and communities that depend on the Odessa Subarea Aquifer have been aware of declining groundwater levels since the 1960s, according to Smith. 
A consortium of state, local and federal partners has been working since 2013 on a project to swap groundwater with surface water supplies from the Columbia River for agricultural users, so they can eventually stop using their wells. 
The Odessa Groundwater Replacement Program secured nearly $45 million in this year’s capital budget to build a new irrigation system.
The project has so far eliminated the use of 16 wells and conserved 5.3 billion gallons of water annually in the Odessa Subarea Aquifer. 
In the Yakima Basin, state, federal, tribal, business, and community organizations partnered in 2009 to develop the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan, which established a 30-year resource management strategy for the basin. 
Of the 15 subareas in Washington included in the study, 12 showed groundwater levels dropping every year, while three — Spokane, the Lower Snake River and Klickitat — were found to be gaining water. 
The positive trends in those areas are primarily due to active management and monitoring efforts, according to McLarty.
While communities that know they’re losing groundwater have taken action to mitigate that loss, there are significant gaps in groundwater level data around the state. 
“Our groundwater data measurements are actually pretty clustered in certain areas, so there are large parts of the state where we simply don’t have data,” Short said. 
Most of those data gaps are in areas that are not heavily populated, according to Short. 
Filling in those data gaps so researchers can track groundwater trends statewide over time is a goal for the Department of Ecology, Short said. The Washington State University study was part of the ongoing effort to do so.
It emerged from a legislatively-mandated project established in 2006, which calls for an estimate of current and future water supply and demand to be collected every five years. 
This year’s study was the first to incorporate an observation-based analysis across the whole Columbia Basin Aquifer, McLarty said. 
That strategy allowed researchers to document trends in different geographic areas of Washington, as well as trends within different layers of the aquifer, to better pinpoint where water is available and where it’s declining. 
The study was also the first to take well infrastructure into account when determining what areas are vulnerable to groundwater loss.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/irrigation-equipment-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-09 07:57:47.159450

Progressives and voting rights advocates are divided on whether California and New York should fight the Texas power grab by gerrymandering their own states, creating more safe Democratic seats, even if that means undermining fair maps and the authority of those states’ nonpartisan redistricting commissions.
In Wisconsin, which just got out from under one of the worst partisan gerrymanders in the U.S., and the impenetrable, outsized Republican majorities in the state Legislature it protected for a decade and a half, this issue hits particularly close to home.
It’s head-spinning to hear arguments for Democratic counter-gerrymandering in other states from the same people in Wisconsin who were recently crying out for fair maps. 
If Democrats are going to mount a serious challenge to the fascist takeover of our country by Trump and his minions, it’s hard to see how ceding the moral high ground and running roughshod over the principle that the will of the majority of voters should prevail is going to help. 










If we want democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, we need to champion, well, democracy, fairness and the rule of law. 


I get that it’s more satisfying to imagine a quick fix to the fascist takeover of every branch of government than to listen to a lot of vague talk about long-term plans to rebuild democracy. After all, election deniers and the architects of the Jan. 6 attack are now running the federal government, demanding access to voter lists across the country and deploying the FBI to arrest political opponents, including the Texas Democrats who’ve fled their state to stall the gerrymandering scheme there. 
But here in Wisconsin, where we’ve just finally beaten back the most gerrymandered map in the country, it’s depressing to imagine Democrats abandoning the high ground and scrambling to do exactly what Republicans did when they controlled all three branches of government, attempting to lock in permanent political control against the will of the people.
If we want democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, we need to champion, well, democracy, fairness and the rule of law. 
In this most extreme political moment, with every public institution and the continued existence of U.S. democracy in doubt, I understand why the long view frustrates people. The emergency is now. I understand that many voters want to see Democrats “fight fire with fire,” as Newsom put it.
But consider this: Republicans control more state legislatures (28 Republican versus 18 controlled by Democrats) and have trifecta control of all branches of government in more states (23 all-GOP states versus 15 all-Democratic). JD Vance just launched a tour of Republican states to encourage more mid-decade gerrymandering. And Trump wants to hold a new census for the purpose of redefining who can vote. Even if Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom and Kathy Hochul succeed in gerrymandering California and New York, Democrats are not likely to win the nationwide redistricting war.
Meanwhile, democracy will be the first casualty of that war. California and New York would have to suspend the work of their nonpartisan redistricting commissions — the gold standard for fair, nonpartisan map-drawing — and take back partisan control of the process in order to carry out their threats. If they succeed, it is beyond unlikely that the politicians who pull off that short-term victory will ever cede back their power over the voting maps to the nonpartisan commissions again.
On a deeper level, the Democratic gerrymandering fantasy takes the whole movement to oppose Trump in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of building grassroots support to counter an unpopular, authoritarian leader, it rigs the system to benefit a party whose whole problem is that it has lost the broad, popular support it needs to win elections and create a better, more enlightened government. 
Instead of trying to rig the maps to ensure a Democratic House majority in the next election, Democrats need to focus on winning elections and flipping seats in areas of the rural and industrial Midwest that were once reliably blue but have turned deep red.
To do that they need to make the case that health care, education and an adequate social safety net are bedrock rights in the richest nation on earth, and that we should not be giving tax breaks to billionaires by taking food out of the mouths of hungry children. 
They need to offer something to the farmers and factory workers and disaffected voters in rural and urban areas alike that is clearly different and better than the hate, corruption, and a determination to run roughshod over democracy that Republicans offer.
In Wisconsin, voting rights groups have been working on a campaign to push through a constitutional amendment modeled on one in our neighboring state of Michigan, to make sure that our voting maps are never again drawn up by partisan legislators.
That’s the kind of grassroots fight that helped Wisconsin finally overcome Republican gerrymandering. One important aspect of the fair maps movement is the way it engaged citizens to feel like participants, not spectators, in democracy, and to find their common interests instead of focusing on the politics of division. This, not more politicians in safe seats who don’t have to listen to voters, is what we need right now. 
The battle to beat back fascism does not turn on a handful of Democrats in protected districts. It turns on an organized uprising by the majority of people in the U.S. who are willing to join together despite their differences because they are sick and tired of having their democracy stolen from them, along with their health, safety, opportunity and hope. There’s no short cut to leading that fight.

(Arielle Zionts/KFF Health News)EKALAKA, Mont. — There was no doctor on-site when a patient arrived in early June at the emergency room in the small hospital at the intersection of two dirt roads in this town of 400 residents.
There never is.
Dahl Memorial’s three-bed emergency department — a two-hour drive from the closest hospital with more advanced services — instead depends on physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
Physician assistant Carla Dowdy realized the patient needed treatment beyond what the ER could provide, even if it had had a doctor. So, she made a call for a medical plane to fly the patient to treatment at Montana’s most advanced hospital. Dowdy also called out medications and doses needed to stabilize the patient as a paramedic and nurses administered the drugs, inserted IV lines, and measured vital signs.
Emergency medicine researchers and providers believe ERs, especially in rural areas, increasingly operate with few or no physicians amid a nationwide shortage of doctors.
A recent study found that in 2022, at least 7.4% of emergency departments across the U.S. did not have an attending physician on-site 24/7. Like Dahl Memorial, more than 90% were in low-volume or critical access hospitals — a federal designation for small, rural hospitals.

The results come from the 82% of hospitals that responded to a survey sent to all emergency departments in the country, except those operated by the federal government. The study is the first of its kind so there isn’t proof that such staffing arrangements are increasing, said Carlos Camargo, the lead author and a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. But Camargo and other experts suspect ERs running without doctors present are becoming more common.
Placing ERs in the hands of nondoctors isn’t without controversy. Some doctors and their professional associations say physicians’ extensive training leads to better care, and that some hospitals are just trying to save money by not employing them.
The American Medical Association, open to all medical students and physicians, and the American College of Emergency Physicians both support state and federal laws or regulations that would require ERs to staff a doctor around the clock. Indiana, Virginia, and South Carolina recently passed such legislation.
Rural ERs may see fewer patients, but they still treat serious cases, said Alison Haddock, president of ACEP.
“It’s important that folks in those areas have equal access to high-quality emergency care to the greatest extent possible,” Haddock said.
Other health care providers and organizations say advanced-practice providers with the right experience and support are capable of overseeing ERs. And they say mandating that a physician be on site could drive some rural hospitals to close because they can’t afford or recruit enough — or any — doctors.
“In an environment, especially a rural environment, if you have an experienced PA who knows what they know, and knows the boundaries of their knowledge and when to involve consultants, it works well,” said Paul Amiott, a board member of the Society of Emergency Medicine PAs.
“I’m not practicing independently” despite working 12-hour night shifts without physicians on-site at critical access hospitals in three states, he said.

Amiott said he calls specialists for consultation often and about once a month asks the physician covering the day shift at his hospital to come help him with more challenging cases such as emergency childbirth and complicated trauma. Amiott said this isn’t unique to PAs — ER doctors seek similar consultations and backup.
The proportion of ERs without an attending physician always on site varies wildly by state. The 2022 survey found that 15 states — including substantially rural ones, such as New Mexico, Nevada, and West Virginia — had no such emergency departments.
But in the Dakotas, more than half of emergency departments were running without 24/7 attending physician staffing. In Montana it was 46%, the third-highest rate.
None of those three states have a program to train physicians as ER specialists. Neither does Wyoming or Idaho.
But Sanford Health, which bills itself as “the largest rural health system in the United States,” is launching an emergency medicine residency in the region. The Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based program is intended to boost the ranks of rural emergency doctors in those states, the residency director said in a news release.
Leon Adelman is an emergency medicine physician in Gillette, Wyoming, which, at around 33,800 residents, is the largest city in the state’s northeast. Working in such a rural area has given him nuanced views on whether states should require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs.
Adelman said he supports such laws only where it’s feasible, like in Virginia. He said the state’s emergency physicians’ organization pushed for the law only after doing research that made it confident that the requirement wouldn’t shutter any rural hospitals.
Camargo said some doctors say that if lawmakers are going to require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs, they need to pay to help hospitals implement it.
Adelman said when instituting staffing requirements isn’t possible, states should create other regulations. For example, he said, lawmakers should make sure hospitals not hiring physicians aren’t refraining just to save money.
He pointed to Vermont, where a report recommended that several of the state’s hospitals cut physicians from their ERs. The report was part of a mandated process to improve the state’s troubled health care system.
Adelman said states should also require PAs and NPs without on-site physician supervision to have extensive emergency experience and the ability to consult with remote physicians.
Some doctors have pointed to a case in which a 19-year-old woman died after being misdiagnosed by an NP who was certified in family medicine, not emergency care, and working alone at an Oklahoma ER. Few NPs have emergency certification, an analysis found.
Planned Parenthood to close Louisiana clinics; Landry, Murrill applaud news

The Society of Emergency Medicine PAs outlines training and experience PAs should have before practicing in rural areas or without on-site doctors.
Haddock said emergency physicians have seen cases of hospitals hiring inexperienced advanced-practice providers. She said ACEP is asking the federal government to require critical access and rural emergency hospitals to have physicians on-site or on call day and night.
Haddock said ACEP wouldn’t want such a requirement to close any hospital and noted that the organization has various efforts to keep rural hospitals staffed and funded.
Dahl Memorial Hospital has strict hiring requirements and robust oversight, said Dowdy, who previously worked for 14 years in high-volume, urban emergency rooms.
She said ER staffers can call physicians when they have questions and that a doctor who lives on the other side of Montana reviews all their patient treatment notes. The ER is working on getting virtual reality glasses that will let remote physicians help by seeing what the providers in Ekalaka see, Dowdy said.
She said patient numbers in the Ekalaka ER vary but average one or two a day, which isn’t enough for staff to maintain their knowledge and skills. To supplement those real-life cases, providers visit simulation labs, do monthly mock scenarios, and review advanced skills, such as using an ultrasound to help guide breathing tubes into patient airways.
Dowdy said Dahl Memorial hasn’t had a physician in at least 30 years, but CEO Darrell Messersmith said he would hire one if a doctor lived in the area. Messersmith said there’s a benefit to having advanced-practice providers with connections to the region and who stay at the hospital for several years. Other rural hospitals, he noted, may have physicians either as permanent staff who leave after a few years or contract workers who fly in for a few weeks at a time.
People eating at Ekalaka’s sole breakfast spot and attending appointments at the hospital’s clinic all told KFF Health News that they’ve been happy with the care they have received from Dowdy and her co-workers.
Ben Bruski had to visit the ER after a cow on his family ranch kicked a gate, smashing it against his hand. And he knows other people who’ve been treated for more serious problems.
“We’ve got to have this facility here because this facility saves a lot of lives,” Bruski said.

(Douglas Rissing/Getty Images)As dissatisfaction with the two-party system grows in the United States, the idea of an alternative, however unlikely, gains traction. Elon Musk’s recent call for an America Party may be unserious, but it speaks to something real.
Surveys consistently show that millions of American voters feel they lack real choices. They believe the two major parties don’t reflect their values, and they are exhausted by the constant polarization.
The bigger question isn’t whether Musk succeeds. As a public policy scholar, I think it’s why the U.S. political system is so hostile to new voices and ideas in the first place.
 
Why third parties rarely succeed
If he follows through on his idea, can Musk’s America Party actually take off? Probably not. History isn’t on his side.
That’s because the U.S. political system is structurally rigged against third parties, with deeply entrenched legal and procedural barriers that make it nearly impossible for new parties to gain traction.
In most states, getting a new party on the ballot is a formidable task. It involves gathering thousands of signatures, meeting stringent deadlines and complying with obscure filing requirements.
Even if a party gets on the ballot in one state, replicating that effort nationally is extremely difficult. Each state has different laws, deadlines, signature requirements and legal demands.
Ballot access, campaign finance, news media coverage and election rules overwhelmingly favor the existing Republican and Democratic parties. Even the Federal Election Commission is designed for partisan deadlock, with an even number of members from each of the two major parties.
In a 2025 article on election administration in America, my colleagues and I analyzed all 50 state election codes. We found widespread legal and administrative barriers that systematically exclude independents and minor parties.
In 45 states, only major party members can serve on election boards, local or state bodies responsible for overseeing the administration of elections. In 27 states, judges must be registered with a major party. Campaign finance laws, access to voter data and registration rules also tilt the field to the major parties.
These structural barriers exist in both red and blue states. We found no statistical correlation between partisan leanings and these restrictions. That’s telling. It suggests that both parties, regardless of their ideological differences, are united in protecting their duopoly.
 
The founders’ warning
This entrenched two-party control runs contrary to the vision of the U.S. Constitution’s framers, who intentionally excluded political parties from the founding document.
This was no accident. The founders viewed parties as “factions” that had no legitimate place in the republic.
George Washington in 1796 warned that parties would inflame animosity and that the nation could not do enough to protect itself from this. John Adams worried that “a division of the republic into two great parties … is to be dreaded as the great political evil.” Likewise, Alexander Hamilton feared parties as “the most fatal disease” of government and hoped America could dispense of such groups.
 
An appetite for alternatives
Enter Elon Musk. His suggestion to create the America Party taps directly into a growing national frustration with the two-party entrenchment.
Public trust in major political parties is at historic lows, particularly among young voters and independents, who do not identify with any major party and may register as “no party preference,” “unaffiliated” or “independent” depending on state laws.
Despite Musk being widely unpopular, prone to conspiracy theories and exhibiting erratic and unpredictable politics, his proposal resonates with many Americans. An October 2024 poll found that 58% of U.S. adults say a third party is needed.
Additionally, the number of American voters identifying as politically independent continues to exceed each of the major political parties.
 
What do Americans really want?
Even if Musk never follows through, the idea of a new party highlights how undemocratic U.S. elections have become. It opens the door to conversations about reforms that give independents and third parties a fair shot and reflects the growing demand for alternatives to the two-party system.
Voters are frustrated by limited choices that fail to capture their full range of political views.
There are models to learn from. Most democracies use a nonpartisan election administration and don’t let political parties control the rules.
In the U.S., partisans referee contests in which members of their party directly compete. That conflict of interest would be unacceptable in business or sports. So why is it tolerated in elections?
Structural reforms and designs have been implemented to varying degrees in the U.S. with a goal of making democracy more responsive, fair, transparent and representative.
Reforms such as open primaries, which allow voters of any party affiliation to participate in any party’s primary election, proportional representation in places such as Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Portland, Oregon, where political parties gain seats in proportion to the number of votes they receive, and independent redistricting commissions have helped create more competitive electoral districts by reducing partisan gerrymandering.
So, too, have ranked-choice voting and fusion voting. In ranked-choice voting, voters rank candidates by preference. If no one gets a majority, the lowest-ranked candidates are eliminated and votes are redistributed until someone wins. In fusion voting, multiple political parties can endorse the same candidate, who then appears on the ballot under each endorsing party’s line.
However, implementation of such reforms has been limited. Opposition to these reforms by the Democratic and Republican parties has, in many cases, been fierce.
 
It’s the system
The two-party system has insulated itself from competition.
The consequence is that today America has an impenetrable two-party system, the very scenario the framers and reformers feared most. Rather than focusing solely on Musk’s ambitions, the more pressing question is how to build an electoral system that reflects a modern, diverse democracy.
If Americans want more choices, and polling suggests they do, then they may want to examine the legal and procedural barriers that lock in the current system, which fails to address and accommodate their political preferences.

Fortunately, she has drawn up a list to help get us started.","The U.S. population is aging, and Maryland's is aging at a slightly faster pace, and state officials need to take steps now to be prepared, writes Allison Ciborowski. (Photo by Getty Images)The recent article, “Maryland aging slightly faster than U.S. as a whole,” underscores a reality that those of us working in aging services have long anticipated. As the CEO of LeadingAge Maryland, a not-for-profit association representing over 150 organizations who provide housing, care, and services to more than 20,000 older Marylanders every year, I see the challenges — and opportunities — daily.
While Maryland has made meaningful strides to prepare for this demographic shift, more is needed, particularly as federal funding cuts threaten critical support like housing, nutrition, and community services. Gov. Wes Moore’s Longevity Ready Maryland Initiative offers a promising blueprint by promoting a whole-of-government, cross sector approach to aging policy.
We must reframe aging policy as cross-generational. When we invest in safe housing, accessible transportation, resilient communities, and better care systems we’re not just helping older adults, we’re building a more livable state for everyone. To be proactive, we must act with urgency and vision to ensure older Marylanders — and all Marylanders — can age well with health, dignity and purpose.
As the proportion of Marylanders 65 and older continues to grow, we urge policymakers, community leaders, and residents to focus on these critical priorities:

Recognize the economic power of aging: Older adults are not a burden — they are contributors to Maryland’s economy as workers, volunteers, caregivers and consumers. With smart policy, we can grow Maryland’s “longevity economy.”

Fully implement and fund the Longevity Ready Maryland recommendations: Ensure every state agency coordinates efforts to support Marylanders across the lifespan, and not just at certain points in time.
Accelerate the development of affordable, accessible senior housing, particularly in rural and underserved areas: The newly released Maryland Housing Needs Assessment highlights the growing number of older adults in Maryland as well as the challenges facing low-income older adult renters. An estimated 55% of this population is housing-cost burdened, compared to only 12% of older adult homeowners. Maryland’s Department of Housing and Community Development could designate part of the state’s Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program funds for age-restricted developments that would provide more affordable rental options and offer coordinated on-site services. Outcomes for older adults vary widely by race, income and geography. Rural and underserved communities lack access to housing, care and transportation. A true longevity strategy must emphasize rural and underserved areas.
Support family caregivers: They are the invisible backbone of the long-term care system, and would benefit from respite, education and financial resources.
Address the direct care workforce crisis: Remove barriers to accessing education and licensure, ensuring sufficient state Medicaid rate increases to support increased wages and benefits, and strengthening transportation, child care and housing support for caregivers.
Expand home- and community-based services, like PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly): Such programs reduce reliance on institutional care. PACE provides comprehensive health care services to eligible seniors in the comfort of their own home, versus living in a nursing home. Lifting arbitrary caps (like the 200-person limit per site) and opening more opportunities for community-based aging innovations further reduces reliance on institutional care.
Bridge the digital divide: Many older Marylanders remain excluded from telehealth, benefit enrollment and even basic internet access. A comprehensive aging strategy must include digital literacy and broadband access as core components.
Leverage Maryland’s innovation ecosystem: Our state is home to world-class research universities, tech hubs and health systems. Maryland should lead in developing and testing new models of care, workforce development, and aging-in-place technology.
Include older adults in climate resilience planning: Aging Marylanders face rising risks from extreme weather and natural disasters. Emergency management, housing, and public health planning must explicitly account for the vulnerabilities of older populations.

Maryland has the infrastructure, talent, and political will to become a national model for aging well. What we need now is coordinated action, sustainable funding and a shared vision that embraces aging and longevity as an opportunity — not a liability.
We can rise to meet this moment with tenacity and collaboration. Together, we can show the nation what it means to truly embrace longevity — and what it means to lead.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1397344056-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-09 04:57:07.533409

“I know they’re aware of this,” Ames said of state officials. “They’re trying to work toward certain solutions, but we’re at that impasse where it’s just not happening quickly enough and people are being harmed.”
Ames and other advocates suspect that there are probably many more cases across Maryland, and her organization is considering legal action if those administrative delays continue.
The Department of Health did not respond to several requests for interview, though said in a written statement that agency is “working in partnership with stakeholders and providers to enhance and improve the process for these complex Medicaid eligibility reviews.”

“People with developmental disabilities and the families and providers that care for them deserve accessible services and supports,” the department statement said. “It is a top priority of the Maryland Department of Health to continually improve the systems and processes for Medicaid waiver programs that provide services and supports to applicants, participants, and community providers.”
At issue are Medicaid waivers that allow people with developmental disabilities to get a wide variety of services, from live-in caregiver support to transportation, respite care, employment services and more.
Those waivers are jointly funded by state and federal governments, with each responsible for roughly 50% of the funding. The state is responsible for administering the program.
Each year, waiver recipients must prove to state health officials they are still financially eligible and still need coverage for their disability, in a process known as “redetermination.”
Over the last few years, the Department of Health and the Developmental Disabilities Administration have been struggling to pull out of several controversies while undergoing leadership changes and attempting to fill vacancies within those departments.
The Department of Health was also stung during the 2025 legislative session, as lawmakers made budget cuts to help close a $3 billion deficit. Those cuts included $164 million in fiscal 2026 from the Developmental Disabilities Administration, an agency that was experiencing unsustainable growth in enrollment and spending.
Despite the agency’s financial challenges, Ames believes that the backlog of application determinations is not “budget motivated.”
“Unfortunately, I think prior to the pandemic, the system was not great — but it was kind of functioning,” she said. Ames believes that the problems were exacerbated after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the state had to determine whether 1.8 million Maryland Medicaid recipients, many added to the rolls during the pandemic, were still eligible in 2023, in a process known as the “Medicaid unwinding.”
She noted that during this time, the department lost experienced staff and added newer employees who had to learn the complex Medicaid determination process.

“When you don’t have the appropriate staff, if you have staff that is not knowledgeable or trained, it all starts to build up and cause this backlog,” Ames said.
Meanwhile, the health department’s top Medicaid and health care financing officer Ryan Moran is leaving the position this month for a top health care job in Washington state.
Providers taking on ‘uncompensated care’
The sudden loss of coverage is also taking a toll on providers of developmental disability services, many of whom have clients who have been receiving Medicaid care for years. Many providers have been pulling from reserves to continue that critical care for clients while they wait for coverage issues to be resolved.
The providers, many of them nonprofits, have been dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars into what may end up as “uncompensated care” while they work to get clients reinstated.
“The deficits, the uncompensated care, ranges from, maybe the lowest being $100,000 to the highest being around $7 million,” said Ande Kolp, executive director of The Arc Maryland. She noted that most, if not all, of the nine Arc facilities across the state have struggled with clients falling off Medicaid.
“It just kind of speaks to the continued chaos,” Kolp said.
David Erving, CEO of Makom, a nonprofit that provides residential options for people with disabilities, said that he’s noticed “a different level of responsiveness” from the state over the last two years when trying to resolve eligibility issues with his clients.
“Resolving these issues has historically always been very, very expeditious and very, very collaborative with our partners at the state, and we’ve seen some changes to that dynamic,” Erving said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Erving said that some of his clients over the past year and a half were disenrolled from Medicaid due to a variety of “procedural terminations,” meaning that for one reason or another, the application for coverage renewal did not get processed — or people whose “Medicaid redeterminations did not go smoothly,” in Erving’s words.
Erving said his agency has provided more than $1 million in services for a handful of clients who lost Medicaid waivers over the past 16 months.
His most significant case was that of a 65-year-old man with Down syndrome and Alzheimer’s who lost his waiver status in February 2024. Makom continued providing care for the man as the facility worked to reinstate his Medicaid eligibility, until he died last month.
Erving said that, because of the man’s age, disability and significant health needs, Makom provided more than $650,000 in unreimbursed services during the man’s gap in coverage. He believes the department owes Makom for the services provided that would have been covered if the man was still on the Medicaid waiver.
The reasons people “fall off” of Medicaid vary.
Some providers reported issues with the health department’s mail notifications for annual renewals, meaning that families of the Medicaid recipient don’t know when to send over the application for redetermination.
Another common problem is when a recipient’s income appears “above the asset limit,” meaning they have a higher balance in their accounts than is allowed, even if it’s just by a couple dollars at the end of the month. They have to spend those extra dollars down to maintain coverage.
For these reasons and more, waiver recipients can be disenrolled from Medicaid, even if their financial situation and their needs have not changed. Those who would otherwise still qualify are supposed to have 120 days to appeal the termination and get reinstated.
Audit: DDA failed to collect nearly $119 million after shift to new payment system

It’s not unusual for there to be a lapse in coverage while these issues are worked out. Providers continue services and expect to be reimbursed when the client’s Medicaid is restored. But as Erving and other providers note, it’s taking longer to correct those issues.
Daria Cervantes, CEO for The Arc Montgomery County, says that about 50 out of 100 Medicaid waiver recipients in their community living program are in similar situations.
“The number continues to grow as people continue to go through the process and fall out of the waiver for our community living or residential program,” Cervantes said. “The fact that half the people in our community living program are out of the waiver, that’s extremely significant for us.”
Other administrative hurdles occur with new applicants. Ames described a client of hers who received disability services from the state school system, but had to apply for a Medicaid waiver as he aged out of school. His family had submitted an application, she said, but it’s “taking months and months to get that transition over.”
She said another client applied for a Medicaid waiver but never heard whether it was accepted. After Ames reached out to the department, she learned that the agency had not started the approval process at all until she called for an update.
Laura Howell, CEO for the Maryland Association of Community Services, says it’s hard to judge the scale of how many waiver recipients are stuck in this administrative limbo.
That said, Howell believes that officials within the health department seem interested addressing some of the concerns identified in the “complex” Medicaid redetermination process, though it is not clear what the path to fixing it will look like.
“We appreciate that the department is engaging in discussions with us,” Howell said. “But we continue to have a lot of questions about how this will be addressed and how we’ll make sure that people don’t have gaps in services and that community providers are paid as appropriate for these lifeline services that they provide.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_nov19_selfdirected_disabilityrally2_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-09 02:56:34.130399

Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, joined demonstrators outside the U.S. Supreme Court on May 15 to protest the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, as justices heard a challenge to the order. (Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A federal judge in Greenbelt ordered a nationwide halt — again — to a Trump administration order that would have denied citizenship to any baby born in the U.S. after February unless at least one of the parents is a citizen.
The ruling late Thursday by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman is the fourth to  block President Donald Trump’s executive order since June, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges around the country had exceeded their authority by issuing nationwide stays.
But the justices said lower courts could issue nationwide injunctions if the lawsuits were class-action suits on behalf of all newborns in the U.S. who might be affected by the executive order. Which is what Boardman did Thursday
Boardman rejected a request to include parents in the class-action suit. But she identified a nationwide class of children born on U.S. soil who “unquestionably would be citizens but for the Executive Order,” an order the judge said is “almost certainly unconstitutional.”
She wrote that the plaintiffs — eight undocumented mothers who are pregnant or have children who were born in the U.S. — “are likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional claim because the Executive Order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth amendment,” which says that “all persons” born the U.S. are citizens of the country and of the state in which they were born.
While the immigrants would be harmed in the absence of an injunction, Boardman wrote, there would be little harm to the government to temporarily extending the practice of birthright citizenship that has been recognized in the U.S. for well over a century.

Boardman rejected the government’s argument that she should restrict her injunction just to Maryland.
“That relief must include every child in the United States who is subject to the Executive Order. After all, the Executive Order does not target only children born in Maryland; it seeks to deny citizenship to ‘persons born in the United States,’” she wrote.
A government attorney declined to comment Friday on the order, and emails seeking comment from the White House were not immediately returned. But immigrant advocates welcomed Boardman’s order.
“This is a national issue that affects every single one of us in this country,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA, which filed suit with the immigrant women.
The Maryland suit was one of several around the country that were filed soon after Trump’s order on “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” which he issued on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that birthright citizenship was never meant to be a universal right, and it said that anyone born after Feb.19 — a month after the order was signed — would be denied citizenship unless one parent was a citizen or permanent legal resident.
The order was swiftly challenges and three judges, including Boardman, issued nationwide injunctions to halt the order. When those were upheld on appeal, the government took the case to the Supreme Court, which said a national injunction could only be issued in class-action suit with a legitimate nationwide class of plaintiffs.
Within hours of that ruling, attorneys for CASA were back in court, filing paperwork to turn their case into a class-action suit, adding women from North and South Carolina, among other states as plaintiffs.
Boardman’s approval of a class-action suit, and a national preliminary injunction, comes almost a month after a U.S. District judge in New Hampshire did the same thing.
Frimpong called Trump’s order “just a part of the usual fear tactics to make people afraid of what they believe the federal government will do — even though it will never happen because it is blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional.”
She said she anticipates that the Trump administration will again appeal the decision, but predicts that the case will go through the ordinary course of litigation.
“What we are looking forward to is, once and for all. putting the issue to bed and our courts making absolutely clear that the 14th Amendment is not up for debate, and it’s not up for subjective interpretation,” Frimpong said. “It is the law and it is going to remain the law.”

Brown/Maryland Matters)Editor’s note: Yesterday and today, Maryland Matters is offering a preview of the newest edition of the Almanac of American Politics, the classic political reference book for political junkies.
For more than five decades, the Almanac of American Politics has set the standard for political reference books. In September, the Almanac will be publishing its 2026 edition, with more than 2,000 pages offering fully updated chapters on all 435 House members and their districts, all 100 senators, all 50 states and governors, and much more.
Below are excerpts from the new chapters in the 2026 Almanac on the state of Maryland, written by Louis Jacobson — a senior correspondent for PolitiFact, a contributor to eight editions of the Almanac and, this year, its chief author — and Lou Peck, a co-founder of Maryland Matters and a senior author of the Almanac.
More than a year before the 2022 primary election, Democrat Wes Moore launched his campaign for Maryland governor as a political outsider who hadn’t sought elected office. Early polls put him in the low single digits, but Moore presented a compelling résumé — Rhodes scholar, Afghanistan War veteran, bestselling author and CEO of a large antipoverty foundation — with a charismatic personality and a stump style to match. He became only the third Black person to win a U.S. gubernatorial election since the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era, and the first in Maryland.
Westley Watende Omari Moore was born in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Takoma Park. Moore was just 3 when his father, a news anchor for a Washington radio station, died in front of him because of a misdiagnosed case of acute epiglottitis, a rare virus that causes the air passages to the lungs to shut down. Moore’s mother, an immigrant from Jamaica, moved him and his two sisters to live with her parents in the Bronx, New York. The neighborhood in which they resided suffered from crime and drug use; Joy Moore worked several jobs so her son could enroll at Riverdale Country School, a private school in an upscale Bronx neighborhood.
At the school, Moore was a C student and had behavior problems, prompting his mother to enroll him in Pennsylvania’s Valley Forge Military Academy when he was 12; her parents mortgaged their house to help pay the tuition. At first, Moore was miserable, but his seven years at the academy put him on a successful trajectory. He became first captain in command of 800 cadets and graduated with an associate degree. He then earned his bachelor’s degree at Johns Hopkins University, won a Rhodes scholarship, and earned a master’s in international relations from Oxford University.

Moore was commissioned as a second lieutenant upon graduation from Valley Forge and remained a U.S. Army Reservist until 2014. In 2005, he was called to active duty, serving with the 82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan and rising to captain.
Moore became a White House fellow at the State Department, then spent five years in New York as an investment banker with Citibank. During this period, he wrote and published a book entitled “The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates,” which told his own story and that of a man with the same name and similar age from Baltimore who is serving a life sentence for killing a police officer.
The future governor also started his own production company to generate programming for several TV networks, including the Oprah Winfrey Network, on which he hosted a show. Winfrey, a former local TV news anchor in Baltimore, helped to push “The Other Wes Moore” onto bestseller lists in 2010 and, more than a decade later, delivered an influential endorsement of Moore in the gubernatorial primary’s closing weeks.
From 2017 to 2021, Moore served as CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization addressing poverty in New York City. He also appeared frequently as a commentator on cable news. He announced his candidacy for Maryland governor after rejecting entreaties to run for Congress or Baltimore mayor when openings arose. Early polling in the gubernatorial race showed two initial frontrunners: four-term state Comptroller Peter Franchot and former Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker, who had run for governor four years earlier, largely because of name identification.
Leveraging his extensive and varied background, Moore scored a major political breakthrough in early 2022, when the first campaign disclosure reports were filed. He reported an eye-popping haul of $4.8 million, far outdistancing two former members of President Barack Obama’s Cabinet: ex-Labor Secretary Tom Perez, also a former Democratic National Committee chair,with $2.7 million, and former Education Secretary John King, with $2.5 million.
This helped Moore secure a March 2022 endorsement from Baker’s successor as Prince George’s executive, Angela Alsobrooks. (Moore returned the favor a year and a half later, helping get Alsobrooks elected as Maryland’s first Black U.S. senator.) Alsobrooks’ backing in the primary was crucial in majority-Black Prince George’s County, the state’s second most populous county. Moore added momentum with endorsements from establishment figures in the state Democratic Party, including then-U.S. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and key legislative leaders.
Baker dropped out before the July primary, citing a lack of money, and King, the third Black candidate in the primary, struggled, finishing sixth in the 10-candidate field. Ultimately, Moore edged out the heavily union-backed Perez, 32%-30%, or about 15,000 votes. Franchot finished third with 21 percent.
It was the third straight gubernatorial election in which Democrats had put forward a Black nominee in Maryland — a state one-third Black — but Moore was the first one to succeed. Moore downplayed the precedent-setting prospect of his election, choosing instead to emphasize a series of lofty policy goals. “We’re not running to make history,” he said repeatedly. “We have a unique opportunity to make child poverty history. We have a unique opportunity to make the racial wealth gap history.”
As Democrats united around Moore, the Trump-backed candidate, hard-right delegate Dan Cox, won the Republican primary, defeating Kelly Schulz, a candidate endorsed by term-limited Gov. Larry Hogan as more electable, 52%-43%. After the primary, Hogan publicly dismissed Cox as a “QAnon whack job” and refused to support him. On Election Day, Moore overwhelmed Cox, 64.5%-32% — the biggest landslide in a Maryland gubernatorial election in more than three decades.

Beginning in the campaign and stretching afterward, Moore faced charges he’d embellished his résumé and failed to correct the record. One involved reports that Moore, on at least two occasions, had not recanted statements during television appearances that he had received the Army’s Bronze Star, for meritorious service in combat zones, His commanding officer had approved the medal but, partly because of paperwork glitches, he had never received it. During his governorship, in August 2024, the New York Times uncovered evidence that Moore had claimed to have received the Bronze Star while applying for a White House fellowship in 2006.
Moore told the Times he had “made an honest mistake by including something because my commanding officer thought it was a good idea.” Moore finally received the award in December 2024 at a private ceremony at the governor’s mansion.
In office, Moore pursued several progressive initiatives. He signed one executive order issuing pardons for more than 175,000 marijuana convictions, and another declaring the state a sanctuary for individuals seeking, receiving or providing gender-affirming care without being prosecuted under another state’s laws. Inspired by his military background, Moore won legislative approval of an increased tax break for veterans, albeit in watered-down form. Another priority for Moore, a “Service Year Option” for recent high school graduates, won enactment, but at a level well below what he had proposed as a candidate — 200 slots in the first year, rising to 2,000 in 2026.
On the economy, Moore was cautious about using tax increases to close deficits. Slower economic growth in Maryland had left Moore with a nearly $3 billion budget deficit for fiscal 2026, with projections for a $6.2 billion hole by fiscal 2030. This posed obstacles both for the state’s existing commitments and Moore’s expansive agenda, which include moving to 100% carbon emissions-free energy over the next decade. In the 2024 legislative session, Moore aligned himself with Senate Democrats to oppose several aggressive tax increases pushed by House Democrats.
In March 2024, Moore entered the national spotlight when a huge cargo ship rammed into and toppled Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge. Moore grappled with the economic and human recovery, including the idling of 15,000 port workers for nearly three months.
“This is not a Baltimore catastrophe, not a Maryland catastrophe. This is a national economic catastrophe,” Moore said. He lobbied more than 150 members of Congress for recovery funding. After lobbying from Maryland’s congressional delegation, Congress included full federal funding for a new Key Bridge, at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion. Those costs are currently pegged at $2 billion, but are subject to change.

Moore has sought to diversify Maryland’s economy into such sectors as artificial intelligence and offshore wind. He aimed to move away from relying on the federal government, which accounts for about 6% of the jobs in Maryland, plus another 10% when federal contractors are counted. Donald Trump’s election in 2024 threatened to reduce those numbers, and also scuttle the FBI’s 2023 announced move to Maryland — with FBI leadership announcing in July that it was abandoning a Maryland site for new headquarters in downtown Washington.
Heading toward fiscal 2026, Moore proposed to close two-thirds of the $3 billion budget gap he was facing with spending cuts, with the rest coming from tax and fee increases. His plan targeted the 18% of Marylanders earning more than $500,000 annually, while proposing to give two-thirds of taxpayers some relief. His positioning on tax policy spoke to political concerns: Republican Larry Hogan, who preceded Moore, won two terms in a blue state by capitalizing on voter fatigue over tax hikes instituted by Gov. Martin O’Malley, Hogan’s Democratic predecessor. Hogan, despite a loss to Alsobrooks in the 2024 Senate race, has worked to remain visible politically and speculation arose that he could vie for his old job by challenging Moore in 2026.
Moore, who is in his mid-40s, attracted chatter as a future presidential contender. He’s been coy, vowing during the 2022 gubernatorial race to serve all eight years he’d be allowed in Annapolis. Nevertheless, his frequent out-of-state travels, including as a surrogate for Joe Biden and later Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign, fueled speculation about a 2028 presidential bid, which would come during a potential second gubernatorial term.

(File photo courtesy of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)A police officer is dead after a gunman opened fire in Atlanta as the work day wrapped up Friday, apparently targeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention main campus.
Bullet damage was seen in the walls and windows of buildings on the CDC campus. A suspect is dead, according to Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum.
“We at CDC are heartbroken by today’s attack on our Roybal Campus, which remains on lockdown as authorities investigate the shooting,” CDC’s director Susan Monarez said in a statement late Friday night. “A courageous local law enforcement officer gave their life, and another was injured, after a gunman opened fire on at least four CDC buildings.”
Police said the suspect opened fire shortly before 5 p.m. Friday from a building in Emory Point, a mixed-use development near Emory University and the CDC. The officer who died was shot while responding to the scene and died of his injuries at a hospital.
Nearby residents reported fear and chaos as businesses went into lockdown and residents sheltered in place. More than 90 young children were in a day care center on the CDC campus during the attack. Police said no children were harmed and teachers were working to reunite the kids with anxious parents at a nearby school into Friday night.
Friday’s attack comes on the heels of a Wednesday shooting at Fort Stewart near Savannah, where an Army sergeant opened fire, injuring five fellow soldiers. Other high-profile shootings have rocked Georgia in recent years, including last year’s attack at Apalachee High School in Winder, which claimed four lives.
State Rep. Jasmine Clark, a Lilburn Democrat and microbiology professor at Emory, said she wasn’t on campus at the time of the attack but learned about it through a text message sent to students and faculty notifying them of the active shooter situation and advising them to “Run. Hide. Fight.”
“As a professor at Emory University, and a parent, I am horrified that this took place in a place where I recently stood with CDC protesters, next to a day care center full of small children, and just weeks before thousands of students are set to return for the first day of classes,” said Clark, who is also running for Congress in Georgia’s 13th District.
Clark called on her colleagues to support legislation aimed at improving gun safety.
“The Legislature could do so much with the political courage and political will to fight gun violence,” she said. “While we don’t know much about the shooter and about the motives, what we do know is ‘guns everywhere’ policies do not make our communities safer, and also put the lives of law enforcement at risk.”
In the wake of Apalachee and other high-profile shootings, Georgia Democrats have called for tightening regulations, including by requiring gun owners to safely secure firearms. In recent years,  Georgia’s GOP-dominated Legislature has moved toward loosening gun laws, including ending a state permit requirement to carry concealed handguns in 2022.
Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who is running for governor next year, recently signed on in support of a lawsuit against Savannah Mayor Van Johnson over a law penalizing gun owners from leaving firearms in unlocked cars.
State Sen. Elena Parent, an Atlanta Democrat whose district includes Emory and the CDC, indicated Democrats in the Legislature will resume pushing for tighter gun regulations when lawmakers reconvene in January.
“The availability of guns has endangered the lives of thousands of people at the CDC and Emory, which is exactly why I have fought so hard for gun reform,” she said in a statement. “Unfortunately, Republicans have been an obstacle as they endanger our communities by passing laws to make guns more prevalent and deadly in the state of Georgia.”
“This is yet another stark reminder of why we must continue to fight for gun safety legislation,” she added.
In public statements, the state’s top Republican lawmakers focused on honoring the bravery of the first responders who stopped the shooters in the two recent attacks.
“Twice this week, deranged criminals have targeted innocent Georgians,” Gov. Brian Kemp said in a social media post shortly after Friday’s attack. “Each time, brave first responders rushed toward the danger to subdue the shooter and save lives, reminding us of just how crucial they are. Marty, the girls, and I are thankful for all those who answer the call to serve and who protect their fellow Georgians. We ask that you join us in holding them in our prayers, along with those harmed this evening near the CDC Center.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent notices to states and other recipients of grants through the Solar for All program, which Democrats created in their massive 2022 taxes, energy and domestic policy law, that the agency was canceling all unspent funds from the initiative.
The EPA said Republicans eliminated the federal fund that distributed the program’s money in the “one big, beautiful” law President Donald Trump signed on July 4.
“Thousands of Maine people stood to benefit from lower energy bills delivered by the Solar for All program,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office. “Terminating this funding doesn’t help Maine people, it only hurts them.”
In April 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded Maine $62 million through the federal Solar for All program that supports the state’s clean energy workforce, in addition to expanding solar to low-income households. Just last month, the EPA approved the state’s plan to implement the program so benefits could reach Mainers by 2026, according to a Friday news release from the Governor’s Energy Office. 
However, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on social media  that the new law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.
“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”
Solar for All was projected to help over 20,000 low-income Maine households save between $380 and $1,400 annually on their energy bills through incentives for rooftop solar and a new community solar and storage program. 
Solar can lower costs and improve reliability by reducing demand on the electrical grid, lowering wholesale energy prices and circumventing the need for costly transmission and distribution investments, the state energy office noted. It also lessens the reliance on fossil fuels, which come with volatile price tags while exacerbating climate change.
Part of the funding was also earmarked to support workforce training for over 700 Maine residents in essential building trades including electrical work, construction, maintenance and repair. 
“Canceling the program deprives Maine of access to affordable solar, energy storage, and the skilled electricians, installers, and construction workers needed to meet our energy and economic needs now and in the future,” Burgess said. 
He added that the state remains committed to the program and will explore options to preserve it. His office is consulting with the Office of the Maine Attorney General on next steps. 
When Maine received its Solar for All grant in 2024, the state had 977 megawatts of solar energy installed, an increase from the 62 megawatts that were in place five years earlier. The majority of solar arrays in Maine are small-scale, less than 5 megawatts.
Democrats created the Solar for All fund as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the law they passed without any GOP support in either chamber and President Joe Biden signed in August 2022.
The Solar for All fund was meant to bring the benefits of solar power to 900,000 households in low-income communities, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Asked about the program’s termination, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins told the Portland Press Herald it “would be unfortunate news,” but that underscored the risk of including such a grant program in a “completely partisan bill.”
“Not one Republican voted for the Inflation Reduction Act that included this grant program,” Collins reportedly said. “While it is no surprise now that control of the White House has changed that the new administration would consider terminating this IRA program, my staff has asked the EPA for additional information.”
According to a list on the EPA website, the awardees included the Executive Office of the State of New Hampshire; Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources; the Maine Governor’s Energy Office; the Alaska Energy Authority; the Oregon Department of Energy; Washington State Department of Commerce; Bonneville Environmental Foundation in Idaho; Tanana Chiefs Conference in Alaska; New Jersey Board of Public Utilities; Maryland Clean Energy Center; Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority; Virginia Department of Energy; West Virginia Office of Energy; Department of Environment and Conservation Tennessee; Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet; North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality; South Carolina Office of Resilience; the Solar and Energy Loan Fund of St. Lucie County, Inc., in Florida; the Capital Good Fund in Georgia; Minnesota Department of Commerce; the State of Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; the State of Ohio Office of Budget and Management State Accounting; Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation; Indiana Community Action Association Inc.; New Mexico Energy, Minerals, & Natural Resources Department; State of Louisiana Department of Natural Resources; Hope Enterprise Corporation in Arkansas; the Missouri Environmental Improvement and Energy Resources Authority; the Center for Rural Affairs in Nebraska; Colorado Energy Office; Utah Office of Energy Development; Bonneville Environmental Foundation in Montana; Coalition for Green Capital in North Dakota; Coalition for Green Capital in South Dakota; Executive Office of the State of Arizona; Nevada Clean Energy Fund; Hopi Utilities Corporation in Arizona; and other programs that covered multiple states and tribes.

U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate issued his order in response to an emergency request from Mayor John Horhn. Wingate said it was a “temporary humanitarian measure.”

“Judge Wingate’s decision to turn the water back on gives us the critical time we need to help our neighbors get to a safe place,” Horhn said in a statement.
In the days before taps ran dry at Blossom, the city’s privately operated water utility company, JXN Water, had indicated water shutoffs were possible but not imminent at Blossom and other complexes with large overdue bills.
Many of Blossom’s low-income residents receive housing vouchers. Their water service is included as part of the rent they pay.
The apartments’ owner, Tony Little of Monroe, Louisiana, told Mississippi Today that he has a longstanding dispute with JXN Water over the amount the utility company says he owes.
Wingate wrote Friday that his ruling does not reduce or forgive the unpaid bills at Blossom.
“This Court recognizes that the property’s owners are in arrears on water bills and that condemnation proceedings may be ongoing,” Wingate wrote. “This Court further recognizes that to reactivate water for Blossom Apartments despite the Court’s warnings of a potential shutoff and Blossom Apartments’ continued nonpayment would be windfall to Blossom Apartments if it is allowed to receive free water under these circumstances.”
Wingate wrote that the absence of potable water “creates immediate and significant public health risks, depriving residents of the ability to meet their basic needs for drinking, cooking, sanitation, and hygiene.”
Horhn’s statement said the mayor, who took office July 1, has been communicating with Mississippi Home Corp., which has agreed to provide financial help for people to move out of Blossom. That includes down payments for new apartments, the first month’s rent and relocation expenses. The money will be delivered through Stewpot Community Services, which is coordinating relocation and support services.

Region 6 Housing Authority is speeding up the availability of vouchers to help Blossom residents find different housing, and Jackson Housing Authority is providing caseworker support and housing placement, the mayor said.
Stewpot CEO Jill Buckley has organized a relocation assistance meeting for Blossom residents at 5 p.m. Tuesday at Stewpot headquarters.
Blossom Apartments is a 72-unit property initially built in 2004 through low-income housing tax credits administered by the state to offer affordable rents to Jackson residents.
Earlier this year, JXN Water released a list of multi-family accounts that had more than $100,000 in unpaid water fees. Blossom was on the list.
JXN Water said it has tried to work with Little on Blossom’s overdue bills. The utility company said he has leaks on the property and it has offered a bill adjustment if those leaks are repaired.

Terry Rice (R) listen to Arkansas Board of Election Commissioner Director Chris Madison discuss a new voter registration rule during a legislative committee meeting on May 2, 2024. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A co-chair of the Joint Performance Review Committee said it would hold a hearing to allow the public to speak on the proposed Franklin County prison, in response to a request for an investigation into the site selection.
However, Rep. Bruce Cozart, R-Hot Springs, said he and his fellow co-chair Sen. Terry Rice, R-Waldron, had ruled out actually conducting an investigation.
The plans for the still-unscheduled hearing come after more than 1,200 people signed an online petition in support of an investigation.
“We do not do investigations. That would have to be the AG [Attorney General] or somebody like that,” Cozart said. “We’ll let them come in and talk as long as they stay in the parameters, don’t get too far out. We’ll hear what they’ve got to say.”
The petition says the “highly secretive” prison project “threatens to upend the lives of no less that 605 Arkansan families” living near the site, and “represents government overreach at the highest levels and pays no respect to either local control or the most basic levels of human respect.”

JPR – Citizen Complaint – Franklin County Prison 
The request, dated July 23, asked the committee to investigate the process for selecting the Franklin County site. Opponents of the prison argue the 815-acre site near Charleston is unable to support the 3,000-bed prison envisioned by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
The state unveiled its plans for the prison site late last year, taking the local community, elected officials and members of the state Board of Corrections by surprise.
The lack of engagement from state officials prior to and after the site selection has frustrated locals. The nearby town of Ozark passed a resolution in February opposing the prison, noting that it would “put a great and severe strain” on the city’s budget, as well as its infrastructure.
Meanwhile, Board of Corrections member Lee Watson wrote to legislators that while he was “acutely aware” of the state’s need for a new prison, he’s seen no evidence that such a large facility is needed to alleviate overcrowding.

The prison divided Republicans in the Senate during this year’s legislative session; a group of senators blocked a $750 million appropriations bill for the prison’s construction five times. The bill died on the Senate floor when the Legislature adjourned in May.
“We kept hearing that, you know, President Pro Tem [Bart Hester] didn’t want to do hearings before session started, because there’d be ample opportunity to investigate and ask questions and testify during session. And that didn’t happen,” said Adam Watson, one of the petition drafters and an outspoken critic of the prison. “We were shut out of every conversation, of every vote. … Joint Budget refused to take comments before they voted.”
Prison appropriation bill remains stuck in Arkansas Senate

When told by the Advocate that Cozart said the Joint Performance Review Committee would have a hearing, but wouldn’t investigate, Watson expressed both frustration and gratitude.
“I’m still trying to walk a fine line of being appreciative for the opportunity to speak with them — I think that’s that’s super helpful — but I’m disappointed that they’re saying that they’re, for whatever reason, not able to go further than that,” Watson said. He said it was a step in the right direction after not being heard at all.
Still, he pointed out that the description of the committee on the Bureau of Legislative Research’s site explicitly says it can conduct investigations. “I would think this is within their scope,” he said.
“This committee makes random and periodic performance reviews of specific governmental programs and agencies” and “conducts investigations into specific problem areas of the administration of state government as may be brought to the attention of the committee,” the website says.
The website also says the committee “serves as a forum for citizens to air their complaints and suggestions regarding the operation of state government” and that it “conducts hearings on citizen complaints and views regarding the operation of state government.”
The petition asks the committee to investigate:

The prison site selection process;
If any standards, rules or best practices were ignored when selecting the site
Whether any legal or ethical guidelines were violated during the selection processes for the contractors working the project
Whether the state is or was violating state spending laws by starting work on the prison project “without sufficient funding”

The request criticizes Department of Corrections staff for allowing “inexperienced state employees” to lead the site selection process instead of relying on Vanir Construction Management’s “expert analysis.”
“As a result, critical due diligence was skipped, key infrastructure and environmental concerns were overlooked, and a deeply flawed site was chosen,” according to the petition, driving up projected costs by “hundreds of millions of dollars.”
The prison is currently expected to cost taxpayers around $850 million. The number is a preliminary estimate, so the price could ultimately change.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In a major departure from decades of state and federal policy, Oklahoma’s top education official said Friday his administration doesn’t plan to administer statewide reading and math tests this school year. 
Instead, state Superintendent Ryan Walters suggested Oklahoma should collect data from benchmark assessments that individual school districts select and purchase from private vendors. Oklahoma would be the first in the nation to replace its statewide exams with a patchwork of district-chosen tests.
The plan requires permission from the U.S. Department of Education, and Walters said he expects a “very, very quick” approval from the Trump administration. The Oklahoma State Department of Education is accepting public comment until Sept. 8 on the idea before submitting its final request to the federal government.
“I was elected to make changes, serious changes,” Walters told Oklahoma Voice. “I have done all that I can to bring the changes into place that the voters demanded. And so, that’s where you’ve seen an overhaul of an education system that was failing our kids.”
If the Trump administration agrees to the plan, Oklahoma could “open the floodgates” for other states to do the same, said Dale Chu, a school policy expert and senior visiting fellow at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a national education think tank. 
State leaders in Texas, for example, also are considering replacing their state testing system.
Federal law requires every state to test their public school students in reading and math from grades 3-8 and once more in high school. These tests are intended to hold schools accountable to providing a quality, equitable education to every student, and they inform families of their children’s academic results.
Oklahoma law similarly mandates that the state Board of Education adopts a statewide system of assessments that complies with federal regulations.

Walters, though, said he doesn’t intend to bring his idea to the state Board of Education for a vote. He said making this change falls within the Education Department’s authority to choose testing vendors and assessment schedules.
“We don’t need a vote from the state board,” Walters said. “We’ve already done everything we need to, so we’re moving forward.”
For several years, Oklahoma’s state tests have found a majority of students performing below their grade level. This was the case last year even after the state lowered the standard for students to meet grade-level targets in reading and math. Test scores are expected to have another downturn this year after state officials again raised expectations for student performance.
Walters said he’s not trying to avoid accountability for state test results. Eliminating these tests could remove a barrier that parents and teachers want out of the way, he said, and benchmark assessments could provide more helpful and timely data instead.
Many Oklahoma districts already use benchmark assessments in addition to the annual state tests. Students take benchmark assessments multiple times a year for more up-to-date information on their academic progress, and their scores are comparable to the millions of children in other states whose schools administer the same exams. 
There is a trade-off, though, Chu said. These benchmark assessments aren’t deliberately aligned with the Oklahoma Academic Standards, which dictate what topics local public schools must teach to students in each subject area.
“This is why I always say all the time there’s no single assessment that can do everything,” Chu said. 
Each state develops its own set of academic standards to dictate what its public schools must teach to students. Their statewide assessments then test students’ knowledge of those standards. 
They also ensure the test scores of every public school and district in Oklahoma are directly comparable.
Chu said he’s not yet seen a statewide assessment system where each individual district, rather than the state, decides which test to take.
“To ensure consistency and comparability and move (the decision) to the district level, I’m not saying it’s impossible, but I haven’t seen a reliable and valid method to do what I’m talking about,” Chu said.
The benchmark system is possible, but implementing it is more complicated than one end-of-year test, said Maria D’Brot, who formerly oversaw state testing and school accountability at Oklahoma’s Education Department. 
Using multiple testing vendors could undermine comparability between districts, she said. Fairness issues could emerge if students don’t have equal access to testing formats, or if students with disabilities don’t get the same accommodations or accessibility tools.
“The success of Oklahoma’s transition will depend on embedding strong psychometric infrastructure, disciplined operations, and fairness safeguards from the outset,” D’Brot said. “Without these, the accountability system risks losing its credibility, jeopardizing federal and state compliance, and failing to deliver fair and actionable information to students, families, and educators.”
Walters said his administration already has the proper infrastructure in place to make the change this year. He said the Education Department will make sure scores from different benchmark tests are evenly compared.
His proposal has faced skepticism from both sides of the political aisle. 
“While we can all agree that the status quo isn’t working, tossing out the tests without thinking through next steps can be short sighted,” said Nellie Tayloe Sanders, education secretary for Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt.

Sanders leads the Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability, a small state board that shares authority over state testing with the Education Department. She said she looks forward to working with the Education Department to “find a path forward to ensure our kids have the skills they need for their futures.”
State lawmakers indicated they want input, too.
“We look forward to continued collaboration with Superintendent Walters and school districts so that any proposed changes to student testing align with state law and provides clear, actionable information on student college and career readiness,” said Rep. Dell Kerbs, R-Shawnee, who leads the House Education Oversight Committee.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said legislative Democrats are open to moving on from state testing, but the timing of Walters’ announcement is “reckless.” 
Many districts are only days away from the first day of school, and some already have welcomed students back to class.
“Absolutely we should have a conversation about what testing is appropriate and when, and we’ve been bringing up that conversation up for years,” Kirt said. “But him doing it this way, I don’t think complies with state law, and it makes us all have to do a bunch of scrambling to figure out what’s happening.”

Gavin Newsom and Texas Democrats jointly promoted California’s plan to redraw congressional lines and offset a redistricting scheme in Texas. The proposed map is expected to be made public next week.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom and Texas Democrats jointly promoted California’s plan to redraw congressional lines and offset a redistricting scheme in Texas. The proposed map is expected to be made public next week.


As pressure mounts for their return, half a dozen Democratic lawmakers who fled Texas to stop a Republican-led redistricting scheme traveled to Sacramento on Friday to urge on California’s retaliatory response.
The Texas delegation appeared at the historic governor’s mansion alongside Gov. Gavin Newsom, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top legislative leaders, who publicly endorsed for the first time Newsom’s plan to redraw California congressional lines in the state to favor Democrats. They expect to make the proposed map available next week.
“We are here because we do know that courage is contagious,” Texas state Rep. Ann Johnson said, “and we are here to give hope to others to stand up and be courageous in this moment.”
Nearly the entire Democratic caucus of the Texas Legislature left the state earlier this week to deny Republicans a quorum and prevent them from taking up their redistricting proposal. At the request of President Donald Trump, who is seeking to protect a narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Texas Republicans are advancing a plan that could flip five seats currently held by Democrats.
It’s unclear how long the Democrats will be able to hold out as GOP leaders demand their return. The House has issued civil arrest warrants for the missing lawmakers, who also face $500 fines for each day they are absent, while the FBI is getting involved in tracking them down. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Friday sued to expel 13 of them from office. 
“We take this fight one day at a time. We fight to win today and tomorrow we assess,” said Texas state Rep. Gina Hinojosa, one of the legislators Paxton is seeking to have removed.
This is the second time in two weeks that Newsom has hosted Democratic legislators from Texas at the governor’s mansion as he seeks to drum up public enthusiasm for his redistricting plan. He wants to call a special election on Nov. 4 and ask California voters to replace congressional district lines drawn by the state’s independent commission with a new map crafted to benefit Democrats.
Initial internal polling, shared with state lawmakers in private meetings on Sunday, showed a feeble majority of 52% of California voters in support — enough to win in November, but perhaps not enough to withstand a combative fall campaign that will almost certainly draw national attention and resources.

“I think the voters will approve it. I think the voters understand what’s at stake,” Newsom said Friday. “We live in the most un-Trump state in America.”
Legislature will quickly take up redistricting
With time running short to meet an Aug. 22 statutory deadline for the November special election, California can no longer wait to see if Texas acts. Democratic leaders in California are still finalizing the language and district lines for their proposal, which the Legislature is expected to take up as soon as it returns from summer recess on Aug. 18.
Newsom has said the California redistricting measure will also include trigger language, with the new map only taking effect if Texas or other states redraw district lines before the 2026 midterms.
Sources who were not authorized to speak publicly have told CalMatters the redrawn map broadly aims to shore up Democrats in several swing seats while flipping five Republican-leaning districts to solidly Democratic, offsetting the potential gains in Texas.
It could spell the end for Reps. Doug LaMalfa of Chico, who represents California’s northeastern corner; Kevin Kiley of Rocklin, whose sprawling district runs down the eastern border of the state; Darrell Issa of Escondido, who straddles southern Riverside and eastern San Diego counties; and David Valadao of Hanford and Ken Calvert of Corona, perpetual Democratic targets in the Central Valley and Riverside County, respectively.
Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas on Friday dismissed criticism from Republicans that the new map has been drawn in secret without input from voters.
“Once these maps are released, voters will have the opportunity to digest these maps, review them for weeks and months leading to this election,” Rivas said. “If there is another state with a more transparent process, where voters will get the ultimate say in these new maps, please let me know what it is.”
As California and Texas accelerate their efforts, other states are still weighing whether to join a national arms race for control of the House. After a visit this week by Vice President J.D. Vance, Indiana’s Republican Gov. Mike Braun was noncommittal about redistricting the state, where Democrats hold two of nine congressional seats.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren of San Jose, who chairs California’s 43-member Democratic House delegation, said Friday that every single one of them supports the redistricting plan.
That includes Pelosi, who accused Trump and congressional Republicans of trying to rig the next election because they cannot defend their agenda and have no winning ideas to present to the American people. She said California was right to fight back to protect democracy.
“We have a responsibility to prove through the night of this Trump administration, the darkness of it all, that our flag is still there, with liberty and justice for all,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080825-Texas-Democrats-Presser-FG-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-08 20:56:11.969191

The last few weeks of summer, heading into Labor Day weekend, can sometimes mean vacations and driving more miles on the road for all people, including teens.
Traffic crashes are the No. 1 cause of death for teens, and the crash rate for teen drivers is disproportionately higher than the share of licensed teen drivers.
In addition to this grim statistic, summer is the riskiest time for teen drivers. The 100 deadliest days represent the period from Memorial Day to Labor Day when the number of fatal crashes involving teen drivers dramatically increases. A third of each year’s teen driver crashes occur during the summer.
We are scholars who research transportation safety and teen driver behavior. Our expertise helps us understand that these 100 days are not just a statistical fluke – they reflect a dangerous intersection of factors such as inexperience and a propensity to take risks.
What makes summer different?
Regardless of the season, some teen drivers engage in risky behaviors that increase their likelihood of a fatal crash, such as getting distracted, driving with friends in the vehicle, driving under the influence, not wearing seat belts and a lack of hazard awareness.
Teens also have more free time in the summer, since most aren’t in school. Combined with the longer days and better weather, teens drive more over the summer. More time on the road means more risk, especially for inexperienced drivers.
Teens may also be more likely to drive after dark during the summer, in comparison to more experienced drivers. But nighttime driving is also when visibility is reduced and crash risks are higher, particularly for teens who haven’t fully developed the skills necessary for night driving. This increased exposure, in addition to teens’ general risky driving tendencies, contributes to the 100 deadliest days for teen drivers.
The increased crash risk for teens over the summer isn’t equally distributed either. Crashes with teen drivers that lead to serious injuries are more likely to occur with male drivers, in rural areas, for those of lower socioeconomic status and for those with disorders, such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.
Teaching young drivers
Driver’s education programs are the formal method to teach teen drivers the rules of the road.
In driver’s education programs, teens receive information about driver and road safety though classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction in preparation for the licensing exam. Some states require teens to complete a driver’s education course if they want to receive a license under the age of 18. Of teens who have a license, nearly 80% of them have gone through some form of driver’s education.
Though driver’s education programs can be helpful, their effects are not equally felt. In some states, teens and their guardians must pay out of pocket for driver’s education courses to obtain a license. This makes driver’s education and, as a consequence, obtaining a driver’s license inequitable.
There are also driving school deserts – areas where the poverty rate is 20% or above and there are no behind-the-wheel driver education courses within a 10- to 15-minute drive. This makes driver education courses inaccessible. Many of these driving school deserts happen to be in areas with high populations of minorities.
Over 20 years ago, graduated driver licensing was introduced to reduce teen crash rates. This is a phased licensing system wherein teen drivers are restricted in terms of when, where and with whom they can drive until they turn 18. Such a system allows teens to gradually learn and gain experience with driving over time.
Graduated driver licensing has been implemented in all 50 states, and it has been shown to reduce teen driver crash rates. However, its effectiveness is limited to those who participate in the system. A large number of teens are unlicensed and are of low socioeconomic status. Many of these unlicensed teens forgo the entire process and remain unlicensed but still drive, well into their 20s when the graduated driver licensing restrictions are lifted.
Making summer safer
There are two things people can do to turn the 100 deadliest days into the 100 safest days.
First, it is important that communities offer free supplementary training programs for teen drivers, because becoming a safe and responsible teen driver shouldn’t be limited to those with resources. As one example, in collaboration with industry partners, we have developed a program called Risk-ATTEND. It is a free, online, evidence-based program that teaches teen drivers how to anticipate risks while driving. Our research has shown that programs such as these can improve teen driving skills and may be especially effective for teen drivers in high-poverty areas.
Second, our research has shown that parents and guardians still play an important role in influencing teen driver behavior. Studies show that teens mirror the behaviors they observe: If they see adults text and drive, they’re more likely to do the same.
Once teenagers become old enough to drive, it is also important to establish rules and guidelines about expectations to establish clarity and accountability. Written agreements or checklists can address high-risk conditions such as nighttime driving, driving with other young passengers, phone use and adherence to speed limits.
Systems to help monitor and enforce rules have been shown to be effective in improving teen driver behavior. One such program is Checkpoints, which is a Connecticut-based program in which families agree to limit teen driving during high-risk conditions. Teens face consequences for violating these limits, such as a temporary loss of driving privileges. However, the limits are gradually lifted as they gain driving experience.
More than rules matter
Ultimately, preventing crashes in the summer and beyond extends beyond mere adherence to regulations. Avoiding them fundamentally hinges on cultivating a robust safety culture that emphasizes a collective commitment to risk reduction and continuous improvement in driving practices.
For teens, the summer months present unique challenges and opportunities.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska State Board of Education signed off on steering $80 million in federal and private funding over the next five years to boost literacy for K-12 students.
The eight-member education board Friday unanimously awarded the first two years of a $55 million federal grant to 46 recipients and accepted $25 million in new private funding for a similar purpose from the Sherwood Foundation. Both buckets of funds will be doled out over the next five years. Board members will consider how to spend the private dollars at a future meeting.

Board member Lisa Schonhoff of Bennington called the $80 million “a huge, huge, huge deal, and it is very clear and evident that we are all taking it very seriously.”
She said, “I think that we need to continue, now that we’ve got this money in front of us, to continue asking the tough questions, not going along to get along, but having these really tough conversations with each other and holding each other accountable.”
Focus on accountability
This February, board members voted 7-1 to approve the Nebraska Literacy Project Plan, which includes a goal to boost third grade reading proficiency to 75% by 2030. State reading tests deemed about 59% of third graders proficient in the 2023-24 school year, according to test data released last fall.
“If there’s not accountability, and our kids aren’t reading by 2030, then we need to have some serious conversations with each other,” Schonhoff continued.
In addition to the federal and private dollars, the Legislature, led by former State Sens. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area and Lynne Walz of Fremont, secured $6 million over three years for educational service units to employ regional coaches who will mentor teachers teaching reading to children between 4 years old and third grade — a key time in child development.

Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher confirmed that resources aren’t an issue. He said his department is focused on ensuring students are reading better tomorrow than they are today.
Schnohoff, a classroom teacher for more than 20 years before joining the state board in January, was the lone vote against the Nebraska Literacy Project Plan in February. She had voiced concerns about a focus on “high-quality instructional materials” and worried those materials could get in the way of students reading real books or writing.
The Nebraska Literacy Project Plan also has two other goals: to increase the percentage of K-3 students who meet Nebraska Reading Improvement Act standards and ensure all Nebraska teacher preparation programs implement evidence-based instruction for teachers grounded in the “science of reading.”
‘Everything that we need’
Board Vice President Deb Neary of Omaha called the federal Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grant a “gold standard project” as the Nebraska Department of Education has a vision, plan, science, research, data and professionals.
“We have everything that we need to be successful,” Neary said.
The federal dollars are designed to advance literacy skills for all children from birth to grade 12, and at least 95% of the grant funds must be distributed to eligible entities. Awardees can receive more funds if they serve more students.
  State Board of Education member Sherry Jones. Aug. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Funding must be allocated at different ages or grade levels as follows:

15% to entities serving birth to kindergarten ($8.26 million).
40% to entities serving grades K-5 ($22.02 million).
40% to entities serving grades 6-12 ($22.02 million).


Board member Sherry Jones said she was disappointed with those funding distributions because there was more demand for the K-5 age bracket than funding. Meanwhile, applicants seeking funds to help students in the other age brackets were fully funded. Jones said the K-5 age group is a critical time to teach reading.
“This is, I believe, an example where state and local decision making would have been better, in my opinion, than the federal government dictating to us how we should use this $55 million,” Jones said.
Nebraska Department of Education staff, responding to a question from Board President Elizabeth Tegtmeier of North Platte, said it’s possible that schools denied funding can reapply in the future. It’s also possible that some allocated dollars won’t be spent, with an expectation that some funds might be redistributed to new applicants or previous applicants who succeeded.
Public-private partnership
The Sherwood Foundation funds, which Neary praised as an “extraordinary” investment, will create the “Nebraska Literacy Leadership Network.” The network plans to convene up to 75 instructional leaders and higher education partners so they can better coach classroom teachers on how to teach literacy.

State Education Department staff pursued the public-private partnership with the Sherwood nonprofit after identifying a potential gap in school leader training and support.
“This isn’t a small project or amount,” Neary said. “This is a really big deal, and it is going to be transformational.”
Schonhoff said the professional development is critical, highlighting “no strings attached” compared to the federal dollars that she initially opposed but ultimately supported.
‘Thank you’
When Tegtmeier was elected president in 2024, she pledged to make literacy a focus, and on Friday, she credited state lawmakers, department staff, teachers and more for joining the efforts.

She credited early work done in 2017 and 2018 by former State Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks of Lincoln and Linehan. The two lawmakers studied literacy and dyslexia, including tours of multiple school districts, which led to new support for reading and dyslexia, including the Nebraska Reading Improvement Act, which allows students to be placed on reading improvement plans for focused interventions and support.
Tegtmeier said the state Education Department also hired a literacy director as well as a new deputy commissioner in the last year. She said many teachers spent parts of the summer attending related trainings and workshops.
Another supporter, Tegtimer said, is Gov. Jim Pillen, whose office reached out Thursday to express Pillen’s support for the Sherwood dollars ahead of Friday’s meeting.
Said Tegtmeier: “To everyone who has picked up their oar and chosen to row with us, I say, ‘Thank you.’”

Article Summary

A judge has denied former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan’s motion to remain free as the legal appeal process plays out for both his corruption conviction and prison sentence.
Madigan is due to report to a yet-to-be-named federal prison in mid-October after his February convictions on 10 corruption charges, including bribery.
The former Democratic power player has hired a well-known team of appellate attorneys to handle his appeal, while those convicted of bribing him are also preparing to argue their case to higher court.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

CHICAGO — A federal judge on Friday denied former Illinois Speaker Michael Madigan’s legal arguments that he should remain out of prison while his appeal of both his corruption convictions and 7 ½ year sentence play out.
Madigan is scheduled to report to prison on Oct. 13, though the federal Bureau of Prisons has not yet assigned him a facility. The former speaker, whose 36-year reign in Springfield made him the longest-serving legislative leader in U.S. history, has already begun the appellate process, though his full arguments aren’t due for another few weeks.
U.S. District Judge John Blakey, who presided over Madigan’s lengthy trial this past fall and winter and sentenced Madigan to his lengthy prison term in June, wrote in a 44-page order Friday that the ex-speaker’s “entire motion rides on routine, and meritless” objections.
“As such, he clings to false hope,” Blakey wrote.
In February, a jury delivered a split verdict for Madigan, convicting him on 10 of 23 corruption-related charges, including bribery and wire fraud. The jury acquitted Madigan on seven counts and deadlocked on another six, but the 10 on which he was convicted involved electric utility Commonwealth Edison and dealings with Chicago alderman-turned-FBI mole Danny Solis, who introduced Madigan to high-powered real estate developers as potential clients for the speaker’s property tax appeals firm.

Blakey wrote that Madigan’s arguments to remain free during his appeal don’t meet the high bar of raising “a substantial question of law or fact.”
The ex-speaker recently hired a team of attorneys who have years of experience arguing at the U.S. Supreme Court. Madigan’s legal strategy centers around the definition of “bribery,” which the high court last summer examined in a case that delayed the former speaker’s case.
Some of those convicted of bribing Madigan, including former ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore and longtime Springfield lobbyist and Madigan confidant Mike McClain, are also planning appeals on the same grounds.
Earlier this summer, Pramaggiore, McClain and the two other members of theso-called “ComEd Four” were sentenced to prison terms ranging from a year and a day to two years for their roles in orchestrating the bribery scheme.

The post Wyoming newspaper owners, staffers race to rescue community news appeared first on WyoFile .","Hope arrived in the form of a caravan winding its way down the dirt road to Marie Hamilton’s home out on the eastern Wyoming prairie where her family’s ranching and farming roots run generations deep. Spotting the unusual amount of traffic from the washroom, the Platte County Record-Times managing editor and reporter went out to the patio.
“I’m confused,” she said, seeing community members and neighbors gathered at her door. The day before Hamilton had suddenly lost her “dream job” reporting on her hometown of Chugwater.
But the mood on the porch didn’t match that news.
“They all have these weird, funny faces,” she recalled, and appeared “super excited.” 
Asking to remain anonymous, they told her that they trusted their local newspapers, so they were collecting donations to make sure Hamilton and two other now unemployed reporters got paid until things got sorted out. 
They told her, “we did this for you girls. Whatever work you do, we want you to get paid,” she said. “I was just bawling.”
The community has rallied behind her and other reporters who are well known for consistently showing up to cover local government meetings and community events. 

Efforts to rescue The Platte County Record-Times and other legacy papers are underway after their Illinois-based parent company closed eight Wyoming newspapers.
The outpouring comes after News Media Corporation announced Wednesday that it was closing its doors immediately and “permanently” — abruptly shuttering the Record-Times in Wheatland and other papers in Torrington, Evanston, Pinedale, Kemmerer, Lusk, Lyman and Guersney. However, efforts are now underway to revive many of the publications that had been owned by the Illinois-based company and to keep the company’s employees.
“We’ve been scrambling the last two days to figure out ways to help,” said Darcie Hoffland, executive director of the state’s newspaper trade group, the Wyoming Press Association, “and that’s not going to stop.”
Hoffland said Friday that other Wyoming newspaper owners are exploring ways to get the papers back up and running.
“I genuinely believe that it will happen,” she said, adding, “There’s a lot of people who care about these communities [and] are working really, really hard to get the job, to get these papers open as quickly as possible.”
‘Tragic timing’
For Chugwater resident Keith Miller, the stakes couldn’t be higher for his community right now, making the loss of the county’s newspaper of record, the Platte County Record-Times, all the more devastating. 
“We are in a battle of possibly transitioning our agricultural lands and heritage to industrial operations,” Miller said in an email to WyoFile. “To some of us, we will die of broken spirits if that happens.”
The Platte County Record-Times has been closely following NextEra Energy’s pursuit of local approval for the Chugwater Wind, Solar and Battery Storage Project. But Wednesday’s abrupt closure left Hamilton without a job or place to publish her ongoing reporting. 
Instead of filing for unemployment, she joined fellow eastern Wyoming newspaper staffers in searching for a solution to keep their longstanding papers of record in production. 
“We’ve got big city issues in small towns. So this is really very tragic timing.”Marie Hamilton
“We’ve got big city issues in small towns,” Hamilton said. “Platte County, Goshen County, is at a crucial point. So this is really very tragic timing.”
A group has stepped up to figure out how to get the Platte County Record-Times, Torrington Telegram and Lusk Herald back into production. With a deal still in the works, Hamilton said she could not yet disclose potential backers aiming to save the legacy papers. Hamilton and Cali O’Hare, the managing editor of The Pinedale Roundup, said the impacted newspapers on the western side of the state are working separately to salvage their publications.
In the meantime, Hamilton has been able to update the Record-Times’ website with this week’s e-edition and hopes to see a barebones edition printed on schedule next week “to maintain our status” as a newspaper of record.
State law says newspapers must publish an edition at least once a week to be deemed an “official” newspaper and eligible to print legal notices — a coveted source of revenue that’s helped keep Wyoming newspapers afloat.

The Pinedale Roundup is at-risk of breaking its streak. O’Hare was instructed to cancel the Roundup’s Aug. 7 print edition, which had already been reported, edited and designed. She then broke the news of the closures on the paper’s Facebook page and website.
On Friday morning, Hamilton and reporter Lisa Phelps were back at the Wheatland office collecting legal notices and selling hard copies, still in demand among readers of all ages who avoid social media or prefer paging through a physical paper. 
Hamilton had not received her last paycheck, which she had planned to spend on her three sons, ages 11, 13 and 15.
“We were all planning to go back-to-school shopping with our checks,” Hamilton said of herself and fellow employees. “I don’t know how I’m going to pay for back-to-school pants, but I’m still going to push on and figure out how to still protect my community.”
In a Wednesday memo to employees, News Media Corporation CEO J.J. Tompkins said the company would “make all reasonable efforts” to issue final paychecks, while health insurance coverage was terminated immediately.
Hamilton had to call off health appointments for her sons and pay a $25 penalty for canceling within seven days of the appointment.
WyoFile reached out to Tompkins but did not get a response by the time this article was published. Phone calls to the corporate office phone number went to voicemail, which was full.
Swift closures
Eight Wyoming newspapers, with 30 employees, were among about two dozen newspapers across five states suddenly shuttered. In the memo to employees, Tompkins cited “financial challenges, a significant economic downturn impacting our industry, revenue losses and increasing expenses, and the recent failure of an attempt to sell the company…” 
He said the company had explored “every possible avenue” to continue operating, but “reached a point where continuing business is no longer feasible.”
Rob Mortimore, who oversaw News Media Corporation’s publications in Wyoming and Nebraska, had informed staff in late July that a potential plan to sell the company to the Alabama-based Carpenter Media Group was no longer in play. However, Mortimore said Wednesday’s sudden shutdown came as a “shock” to him alongside the other employees.
News Media Corporation owned a significant chunk of Wyoming’s legal newspapers — eight of 39. After the news of the closures broke, Hoffland said the Wyoming Press Association immediately heard from other papers asking how they could help.
“They care, and they’re working hard” on a solution, she said.
On Friday morning, Hamilton announced to readers on social media that they could come by and pick up or purchase copies of The Guernsey Gazette and Platte County Record-Times at the Wheatland office. 
“Thank you for the growing commitment and support to your PCRT,” the post read. “Good things are coming. Stay tuned.” 
The newspaper’s landlord, a longtime subscriber, saw the post and came by Friday afternoon to check on the staff and pick up his copy of the Platte County Record-Times.

The council held a make-up meeting in Jackson late Friday afternoon after a virtual session was derailed by hackers last week. Many committee members, including council chair Attorney General Lynn Fitch, were not in attendance.
One of Fitch’s special assistants, Caleb Pracht, and her Chief of Staff Michelle Williams provided the council members draft versions of committee rules, funding priorities and materials for applicants before the meeting started.
The new draft documents included some changes the members suggested from the last completed meeting, such as a scoring rubric and definitions for qualified applications. The grants would be available to organizations interested in addressing opioid addiction.
The members made a series of amendments to the procedures, such as adding language to encourage applications from underserved and under-resourced communities, encouraging applicants to submit matching funds and emphasizing that these dollars go toward helping Mississippians.
Pracht told council members he will spend the weekend making approved changes and hopes to make the application live on Monday. Williams said the grant materials will be accessible on Fitch’s website.
While the state Legislature has tasked the council with soliciting applications, reviewing them and making funding recommendations by early December, council members worried about whether they could meet that deadline and mused about asking lawmakers to push it back. Committee member Joseph Sclafani, an attorney for Gov. Tate Reeves, asked his peers if they thought all those tasks were doable in four months.
“If it’s not, perhaps we could beg some grace from our legislative members,” he told the council.
Although the council is tasked with developing the grant process quickly, Mississippi is behind most states in distributing its opioid settlement dollars. Every state that borders it has started allocating money.
Williams said Fitch’s office would be reluctant to request more time. But she said the Attorney General and the council are committed to making sure their work would be completed by the 2026 regular legislative session, when the Legislature is expected to approve or deny applications.
“We’re going to do everything we can to make sure they get the recommendations when they’ve asked for them,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/09155555/3X0A7470.jpg,,,2025-08-08 19:56:16.192854

Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed an agreement Wednesday between the state’s economic development commission and Israel’s National Technological Innovation Authority, her office announced Friday.
The memorandum of understanding “recogniz[es] the longstanding friendship and shared values between the State of Arkansas and the State of Israel” and expresses the two entities’ mutual goal of “fostering research, development, [and] technological innovation,” according to Friday’s news release.
The agreement “is non-binding and does not create legal or financial obligations” for either party and will be valid for 10 years. Sanders signed the memorandum in Israel’s capital of Jerusalem as part of her trade mission to the Middle Eastern country this week.
Under the agreement, Arkansas and Israel will “support and promote exchanges and visits by delegations and businesses between both entities” and facilitate the exchange of information, attendance of economic development events and cooperative research and development projects.
Such projects would create “technologically innovative products or processes based on new innovative technologies to be commercialized in the global market,” according to the agreement.
“Implementation may include the organization of delegations, technical workshops, joint research initiatives, and investment forums,” the memorandum states.
Sanders has repeatedly expressed support for strengthening the relationship between Arkansas’ defense industry and Israel. In October 2023, Raytheon Technologies and Israel-based Rafael Advanced Defense System partnered to build a $33 million missile plant in East Camden.

South Arkansas is a hub of defense contracting, and American technology company L3Harris invested in a rocket motor production campus in Camden after Sanders met with company leaders in June. The meeting was part of a trade mission to France and Switzerland, and Sanders’ trip this week is her fifth international trade mission since taking office in January 2023.
Sanders has visited Israel several times throughout her life. Her father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, is the current U.S. ambassador to Israel.
Sanders also visited the United Arab Emirates this week. She met with UAE aerospace companies with the goal of bringing “more foreign investment and jobs to Arkansas,” she announced in July.
The governor will make an economic development announcement at 2 p.m. Monday at the state Capitol, her office announced Friday. The notice did not mention whether the announcement pertains to Sanders’ Middle East trip.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/075dd813-3494-1aa4-fb3c-1bc6c2d1d11f-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 18:56:30.096488

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-08 22:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,This New Haven haunt has attracted legendary musical acts for 50 years,Dave Collins | The Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/08/toads-new-haven-bar/,"Toad's Place has featured artists ranging from The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen to Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Cardi B.","NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) — Nestled on a narrow, one-way street among Yale University buildings, a pizza joint and an ice cream shop, Toad’s Place looks like a typical haunt for college kids.

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
But inside the modest, two-story building is a veritable museum of paintings and signed photos depicting the head-turning array of artists who’ve played the nightclub over the years:
The Rolling Stones. Bob Dylan. Billy Joel. Bruce Springsteen. U2. The Ramones and Johnny Cash. Rap stars Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Kanye West, Cardi B, Run-D.M.C., Snoop Dogg and Public Enemy. Blues legends B.B. King, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and John Lee Hooker. And jazz greats Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie and Herbie Hancock.
This year, the New Haven institution is celebrating 50 years in business. And the people who made it happen are reflecting on Toad’s success in attracting so many top acts to a venue with a standing-only capacity of about 1,000.
“You know, I thought it would be good for a few years and then I’d be out doing something else,” said owner Brian Phelps, 71, who started as the club’s manager in 1976. “And then the thing started to happen when some of the big bands started to come here.”
Music and cheap beer fuel success
Original owner Mike Spoerndle initially opened Toad’s Place in January 1975 as a French restaurant with two friends he later bought out. Before that, the building had been a burger and sandwich joint.
But when the restaurant got off to a slow start, Spoerndle had an idea for bringing in more customers, especially students: music, dancing and beer. A Tuesday night promotion with bands and 25-cent brews helped turn the tide.
Among the acts who performed was New Haven-born Michael Bolotin, who would change his name to Michael Bolton and go on to become a Grammy-winning ballad writer and singer.
The gregarious and charismatic Spoerndle, who died in 2011, endeared himself to bands and customers. A local musician he tapped as Toad’s booking agent used his connections to bring in area bands and, later, major blues acts.
Then, in 1977, came a crucial moment. Spoerndle met and befriended concert promoter Jim Koplik, who would bring in many big names to Toad’s over the years, and still does today.
“Mike knew how to make a really great room and Brian knew how to really run a great room,” said Koplik, now president of Live Nation for Connecticut and upstate New York.
A year later, Springsteen stopped by Toad’s to play with the Rhode Island band Beaver Brown after he finished a three-hour show at the nearby New Haven Coliseum.
In 1980, Billy Joel stunned Toad’s by picking it — and several other venues — to record songs for his first live album, “Songs in the Attic.”
That same year, a little-known band from Ireland would play at Toad’s as an opening act. It was among the first shows U2 played in North America. The band played the club two more times in 1981 before hitting it big.
An unforgettable show for $3.01
On a Saturday night in August 1989, Toad’s advertised a performance by a local band, The Sons of Bob, and a celebration of Koplik’s 40th birthday, followed by a dance party.
The admission price: $3.01.
After The Sons of Bob did a half-hour set, Spoerndle and Koplik took the stage.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Spoerndle said.
Koplik followed with, “Please welcome the Rolling Stones!”

The stunned crowd of around 700 erupted as the Stones kicked off an hourlong show with “Start Me Up.”
“Thank you. Good, good, good. We’ve been playing for ourselves the last six weeks,” Mick Jagger told the crowd.
The Stones had been practicing at a former school in Washington, Connecticut, for their upcoming “Steel Wheels” tour — their first in seven years — and had wanted to play a small club as a warmup. The band’s promoter called Koplik, who recommended Toad’s. The band agreed, but insisted on secrecy.
Those at Toad’s kept a lid on it for the most part, but swirling rumors helped pack the club.
Doug Steinschneider, a local musician, was one of those at the venue that night after a friend told him the Stones would be playing. He wasn’t able to get in, but managed to get near a side door where he could see Jagger singing.
“It was amazing!” said Steinschneider. “For being a place where major bands show up, it’s a tiny venue. So you get to see the band in their real element. In other words, you’re not watching a screen.”
A few months later, Bob Dylan’s manager reached out looking for a club where he could warm up for an upcoming tour.
Dylan’s 1990 show at Toad’s sold out in 18 minutes. He played four-plus hours — believed to be his longest performance — beginning with a cover of Joe South’s 1970 song “Walk a Mile in My Shoes” and ending with his own “All Along the Watchtower.”
“That was a good one,” Phelps recalled.
Variety is the key to longevity
Phelps — who bought out Spoerndle’s stake in Toad’s in 1998 — believes the secret to the venue’s longevity has been bringing in acts from different genres, along with events such as dance nights and “battle of the bands”. Rap shows especially draw big crowds, he said.
Naughty by Nature and Public Enemy played Toad’s in 1992. After releasing his first album, Kanye West played there in 2004 with John Legend on keyboards. Drake played Toad’s in 2009, early in his music career. And Snoop Dogg stopped by to perform in 2012 and 2014.
“When you have all these things, all ages, all different styles of music, and you have some dance parties to fill in where you need them, especially during a slow year, it brings enough capital in so that you can stay in business and keep moving forward,” Phelps said.

On a recent night, as local groups took the stage for a battle of the bands contest, many were in awe of playing in the same space where so many legends have performed.
Rook Bazinet, the 22-year-old singer of the Hartford-based emo group Nor Fork, said the band members’ parents told them of all the big acts they’d seen at the New Haven hot spot over the years. Bazinet’s mom had seen Phish there in the ’90s.
“Me, the Stones and Bob Dylan,” Bazinet added. “I’m glad to be on that list.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25130590863338-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 18:56:30.096488

(Courtesy of the South Dakota NewsMedia Association)More and more often, people in the journalism business talk about “news deserts,” those places that have no newspapers or other local news coverage. I always felt sorry for those places. Now I live in one. 
Journalists and people who care about the news were stunned Wednesday when News Media Corp. announced it was closing its newspapers, including four in South Dakota: the Huron Daily Plainsman, The Brookings Register, The Redfield Press and the Moody County Enterprise in Flandreau. 
The sudden closing of those newspapers will make life tougher for subscribers and advertisers, not to mention the employees who are out of work. It’s tough news for me because I have a connection to all four papers. 
Company’s sudden shutdown closes four newspapers in eastern South Dakota

I was raised in Huron. The Plainsman was my hometown paper, not that I paid much attention to it. My love of newspapers was developed later in life. The Huronite, as old-timers have been known to call it, didn’t really get on my radar until my mother-in-law started working there as the secretary to the publisher. At the time, I was the editor of the Milbank Herald Advance. As a rookie editor, it was heady stuff for me when she would slip one of my editorials onto the publisher’s desk to show off what her son-in-law was up to. Bless her heart, sometimes those editorials would be reprinted in the Plainsman. 
My newspaper career started at The Brookings Register where I spent five years selling advertising. It was there that I fell in love with newspapering. I made three attempts to move from the sales department to the newsroom. The third time seemed like the charm. It tells you something about the way people are valued at newspapers in that I had to agree to take a cut in pay to become a reporter. At the time, the paper was owned by Stauffer Communications. Some bean counter at the home office cut the position. 
While I thought my dreams of being a journalist had been crushed, the editor at the Register had other ideas. She had come to Brookings from The Redfield Press and knew that the owners there were having a tough time keeping editors. Their plan was to hire an editor and get that editor coached up on how to sell advertising. Once the editor was adept with a rate card, the owners would move on to another weekly newspaper and complete the process again. Their goal was to own a chain of weekly newspapers. However, they were stuck in Redfield because the news/editorial graduates they were getting from South Dakota State University had no interest in learning how to sell ads. 
I was hired as editor and general manager of The Redfield Press because I already knew how to sell advertising and I had a keen interest in learning about writing and presenting the news. The lessons I learned in Redfield stuck with me my entire professional life. 
From Redfield I went to Milbank and then on to the Capital Journal in Pierre. After stops as a writer for Game, Fish and Parks and University Relations at SDSU, my wife and I retired in Brookings. In retirement, one of the first freelance jobs I had was filling in as the editor at the Enterprise in Flandreau. I’ve been back to Flandreau a few times, filling in again just this past June. 
I’d hate to think that I’m the common denominator as to why these four newspapers closed. It’s more likely that the cause is some sort of corporate mismanagement as anyone could look at the Register or the Enterprise and see that they have plenty of advertising to support their woefully small staffs. 
The evening of Aug. 6, when the internet was roiling with news of the closures, I heard from a Brookings businessman who was incensed at the turn of events. He was an occasional subscriber to the Register. He spends his advertising dollars in the competing shopper. Yet he was angry, as we all should be, at the notion that there is no one in our community chasing and reporting the news.

These closures bring home the fact that the vital job of journalism has to be sustained by the communities that are served by newspapers. Certainly you should subscribe, but there’s more that you can do. Invest your advertising dollars in the publication that’s watching out for your best interests by reporting the news. Frequent the advertisers in the newspaper, telling them that you saw their ad in the local newspaper. 
The template for bringing news back to these four communities has already been created. When the Gannett newspapers in Sioux Falls, Aberdeen and Watertown turned into ghosts of their former selves with shrunken staffs and little or no local news, startup weekly newspapers stepped in to fill the news void. There’s no reason to believe that the same formula won’t work in Brookings, Huron, Redfield or Flandreau. The Dakota Scout of Sioux Falls has already announced plans to expand into Brookings and Flandreau.
We can only hope that someone with more money than sense will try to fill the news voids in Huron and Redfield. For everyone who still has a newspaper in their community, take the time and spend the money to nurture it and help it grow. Do otherwise and you’ll wake up one day to find yourself living in a news desert.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Brookings-Register.jpg,,,2025-08-08 18:56:30.096488

ICE has stepped up arrests of migrants in Vermont recently, but advocates say the raid marks a new tactic.

Following a monthslong investigation, federal immigration officers performed a targeted raid at Lamell Lumber in Essex on Saturday, arresting several migrant workers.
While U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has accelerated its arrests of migrants in Vermont in recent months, advocates say the raid marks a new tactic. 
“ICE arrests at the workplace are still not the norm,” said Will Lambek with Migrant Justice, a group that advocates for immigrant workers. “Most arrests are conducted in public places, so this is something of a departure from what we are usually seeing.”
According to Lambek, the officers arrested three men. The raid follows an investigation of Lamell Lumber’s employment practices, during which the federal Homeland Security Investigations unit in Burlington allegedly discovered counterfeit documents that led to the arrests.
Federal court records show that two men from Mexico — Alejandro Monfil Carballo, 40, and Artemio Cordova Mendez, 36 — have been accused of reentering the country illegally after being deported. They are currently being held at Northwest State Correctional Facility. 
A judge decided that the men must remain detained at Northwest while they wait for their trials.
The third man who was arrested has not been criminally charged, according to Lambek. He was originally detained in Northwest like the others, but Migrant Justice only became aware of his detention on Tuesday, Lambek said. By then, the man had already been transferred and is currently being held at Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts. 
According to Lambek, the man was unable to make a phone call in Vermont and could only alert his family when he was granted a phone call in Massachusetts.The Vermont Department of Corrections didn’t respond to an inquiry about whether the man was allowed to make an initial phone call. As of Thursday afternoon, the man had not been able to contact a lawyer yet, Lambek said.
The investigation and arrests come after lingering strife at the business related to workers’ rights.
On Feb. 7, migrant workers at Lamell Lumber staged a protest claiming the company fired them for demanding higher wages. When they asked to have their jobs back, the company allegedly  offered to rehire them at $14.50 per hour instead of the $16 they were paid before. According to Lambek, the workers involved in the protest took severance pay and left Lamell Lumber.
Monfil Carballo was hired by the company shortly after the protest, Lambek said, whereas Cordova Mendez had been working there longer but was not involved in the February protest.
The investigation began in February when the Homeland Security Investigations unit in Burlington received information indicating that Lamell Lumber employs and provides housing to their workforce through Agri-Placement Services, an employee placement company, according to affidavits submitted by border patrol agent John McGarghan.
In March, HSI submitted a notice of I-9 inspection and subpoena, requiring Lamell Lumber to submit original I-9 forms, which are used to verify identity and employment eligibility. Federal officials also asked for payrolls from January onward, lists of current and terminated employees from December 2024 onward and other personal information on the workers.
As a result of the investigation, HSI said it found fake documents that led to the arrest of the two men.
“This is the first, to our knowledge, set of arrests that followed an I-9 audit,” Lambek said. “In that sense, it is unique.”
Brett Stokes, director of the Center for Justice Reform Clinic at Vermont Law and Graduate School, agreed with Lambek.
“Is it possible that ICE could have been doing this before? Yes, absolutely. But the fact of the matter is they haven’t been,” Stokes said. “I certainly have never heard about it happening in Vermont.”
During the Biden administration, a Deferred Action for Labor Enforcement program allowed people to report workplace violations and abuse without fear of retaliation. Immigrants could request to defer removal and be legally present in the U.S. for limited periods while investigations into the companies moved forward. Many workers benefited from the program, but it was terminated after Trump’s inauguration, Lambek said.

“The threat of retaliation from ICE is something that can create a chilling effect for immigrant workers and prevent them from advocating for their rights and denouncing labor abuses,” Lambek said.
Neither Immigration and Customs Enforcement nor Lamell Lumber responded to requests for comment.
The next court hearing for Monfil Carballo and Cordova Mendez is scheduled for Aug. 18 in Burlington. Since they are facing criminal charges, the two were assigned a public defender.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa PBS)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a multistate letter Friday questioning whether a new net-zero carbon emissions standard for businesses is illegal under state and federal law.
Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador also signed the letter, which was was sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard. This standard is meant to aid financial institutions “in addressing their most significant climate impact through alignment and sector-specific targets,” according to the document, through actions like stopping or limiting investments in new projects related to fossil fuel expansion and addressing deforestation risks in existing investments.
This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter.
According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there are 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of 2023. For instance, in 2023, the Idaho Legislature passed, and Gov. Brad Little signed, House Bill 191, which restricts the state from using environmental, social and governance criteria in evaluating contract bids.
“Contract awards, including for public works projects, must be based on competitive pricing, contract requirements and contractor qualifications,” the law’s statement of purpose states. “The state cannot consider unrelated, subjective ethical or sustainability criteria when determining whether a contractor is qualified or a bid is awarded.”
 State attorneys general say ESG hurts competition

Bird also wrote SBTi and the businesses that commit to following the standard may be in violation of state consumer protection laws and federal and state antitrust laws, constituting an illegal boycott by deliberately cutting off investment and insurance for certain industries through their standard on oil, gas, and coal expansion.
“Some economic arrangements are illegal because they are unfair or unreasonably harmful to competition; the ‘good intentions’ behind them are irrelevant,” Bird wrote.
The letter was co-signed by attorneys general from 23 states — Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.
In a news release Friday, Bird called the standard from SBTi, which partners with the United Nations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other organizations in providing advisory information, “the next attempt by radical environmentalists to coordinate companies to squeeze important American industries into eliminating carbon dioxide production by some future date.”
“SBTi is trying to redo President Biden’s radical green scheme,” Bird said in a statement. “If successful, they’ll hurt farmers, energy producers, and Iowans. Its program limits output of goods or services, and these unrealistic net-zero programs harm both American agriculture and industry. Making net-zero a goal actively harms Americans, creates risk for energy independence, and increases the cost of safe, healthy, nutritious food.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also took steps to investigate SBTi last week, announcing he would issue subpoenas to the advisory group and the CDP, an international nonprofit focused on environmental impact reporting. The investigation will look into whether these organizations violated state consumer protection and antitrust laws “by coercing companies into disclosing proprietary data and paying for access under the guise of environmental transparency,” according to a news release.
“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift. We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers.”

(Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife)A coalition of outdoor sporting groups intend to appeal the decision of a federal judge in Montana made earlier this week that directed the federal government to reconsider whether gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains require additional protections under the Endangered Species Act.
The Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, Safari Club International and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation on Wednesday submitted their notice to appeal the decision of U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy of Montana to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
“This ruling is the latest string of nonstop litigation by environmental groups seeking to frustrate the original intent of the ESA, which is to recover endangered species and return them to state-based management, not keep them perpetually listed and under the authority of the federal government,” Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation President and CEO Kyle Weaver said in a press release. “Whether it’s the wolf or the grizzly bear, once an animal receives ESA protections, it becomes nearly impossible to remove them, even if populations meet recovery criteria over an extended period of time. The ESA needs an adjustment to renew its focus on real species recovery.” 
In Tuesday’s ruling, Molloy vacated a 2024 determination made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that gray wolves in the western United States do not need increased federal protections.
Currently, gray wolves are listed as an endangered species in the contiguous 48 states, except in the Northern Rockies — Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of Oregon and Washington — after management of the species in those regions was given over to the states following Congressional action in 2011.
A coalition of more than 70 environmental and conservation organizations submitted a petition to the federal government in 2021, asking FWS to relist gray wolves in the Northern Rockies, or create a western Distinct Population Segment, or DPS, for the species with added protections.
The coalition argued in its petition, and subsequent lawsuit following FWS’s determination against added protections, that due to concerns that states are using inadequate scientific methods to assess population statistics, harsh political rhetoric and increased mandates in Montana and Idaho to reduce wolf populations, and because wolves do not inhabit the full extent of their historic range — which once broadly comprised the entire western U.S — the species meets the criteria for reconsideration under the ESA.
“Management of Canis lupus must not be by a political yo-yo process,” Molloy wrote, adding that the federal government had “failed to use the best available science” in its species analysis.
Molloy’s ruling requires FWS to reevaluate whether gray wolves should receive increased federal protections.
While members of the conservation coalition praised Tuesday’s decision, officials in Montana, which joined the lawsuit as an intervenor-defendant, and Idaho, which filed an amicus brief on behalf of the federal government, disagreed with the ruling by an “activist judge.”
“Montana has a healthy, sustainable population of wolves. While we are reviewing the decision, it will not implicate our state’s management efforts or our wolf season,” said Kaitlin Price, a spokesperson for Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office. “Unfortunately, we’re not surprised to see another activist decision in favor of environmental extremists.”
Price said that if FWS appeals the decision, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks “will be there to support them.”
Price could not be reached before publication about whether the state and FWP would sign on to the current notice of appeal.
“We’re extremely disappointed with the decision considering Idaho has managed a wolf population above federal recovery goals for decades and sustained more-than-adequate wolf populations since Congress removed them from Endangered Species Act protection in 2011,” Idaho Fish and Game Director Jim Fredericks told the Idaho Capital Sun in a written statement.
Molloy’s ruling does not currently change the status of gray wolves, which are managed by each state’s respective wildlife agency.
In Montana, where gray wolves number approximately 1,100, FWP has proposed new hunting and trapping regulations for the upcoming wolf season that would set a statewide quota of 500 animals — up from 334 in 2024 — and would significantly increase bag limits allowing hunters and trappers to kill up to 15 wolves on a single hunting or trapping license, for up to 30 total wolves.
Arguments from the coalition in support of its appeal are expected to be filed soon, according to Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation staff.
“We had to appeal this decision,” Michael Jean, litigation counsel for Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, said in a press statement. “This decision seems to hold that unless a species is not recovered across its entire historical range, then it has to stay listed — regardless of thriving populations. It’s difficult to see how the wolf, or other listed species, will ever be deemed recovered under that standard.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gray-wolf-1536x1229-1-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-08-08 18:56:30.096488

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Two prominent New Mexico conservation groups took advantage of the New Mexico congressional delegation’s visit home this week to honor members for their help beating back an effort to sell off public lands. 
Leaders of the environmental groups Conservation Voters of New Mexico and New Mexico Wild presented U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, both Democrats, with framed photographs of picturesque New Mexico public lands during a Friday event at Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge. 
Amid all of the other environmental threats that President Donald Trump’s administration poses, from increasing energy extraction, rolling back environmental reviews, or repealing the “roadless rule,” cause for celebration exists due to the removal of a provision in a recent spending bill that mandated the sale of millions of acres of public lands, said Demis Foster, executive director of Conservation Voters of New Mexico. 
“The list just goes on and on and on,” Foster said of the Trump administration’s environmental degradation. “But there really is some light cracking through this unprecedented darkness.”
Stansbury and Heinrich both briefly recounted how a diverse coalition defeated the provision from U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that would have mandated the “disposal” of between .5% and .75% of all United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land across the West, which means up to 3.2 million acres or 5,000 square miles.
Both mentioned a deluge of calls from the public as playing vital roles in convincing Republicans to vote against the provision. Heinrich said a coalition from “birdwatchers to bowhunters” mobilized across party lines to oppose the measure, which he said demonstrated to his Republican colleagues in the Senate that touching public lands was deeply unpopular.

“They knew that their voters, their hunters, their fishermen, their hikers, the people that choose to live in their states because of those public lands, wanted nothing to do with this,” Heinrich said. “And so quietly, when the final bill was filed on the floor, there was a big black Sharpie marker through all of those pages.”
Lee said he wanted to sell the public lands to housing developers, citing a nationwide housing shortage. In a brief interview with Source New Mexico after his speech, Heinrich dismissed that explanation as a “pretext” and said the coalition that emerged to save public lands will stay intact.
“It doesn’t matter what the pretext is” going forward, he said. “What a lot of my colleagues learned is that the policy was deeply out of step with the American people, and it didn’t matter where you were on the political spectrum.”

He hopes the same coalition rears its head to fight the Trump administration’s effort to divert funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which purchases land and easements.
 “I hope we can just use this coalition for other things that are deeply popular with the American people, like predicting the Land and Water Conservation Fund,” he said. 
Stansbury told attendees to celebrate themselves for the pressure they put on Congress, and she called for a round of applause for the United States Fish and Wildlife Services employees who were in attendance. Fish and Wildlife manages the Valle de Oro refuge and also has employees across the state, including some who were fired earlier this year. 
“Our federal workforce is under attack,” she said. “That includes the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, countless New Mexicans and Americans all across the country to get up every day and put their uniform on and go to work on behalf of the American people, including right here in this wildlife refuge.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0523-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-08-08 18:56:30.096488

Gretchen Whitmer addressed questions from reporters on the state's lagging budget negotiations following the signing of an executive order on health care in Traverse City, Mich. Aug. 8 2025 | Photo By Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceTRAVERSE CITY – Republican Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall’s reported budget alliance with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer might not be so cozy after all.
Whitmer on Friday spoke to reporters in Traverse City following the signing of an executive directive to raise awareness on health care impacts from Republicans’ latest federal budget, giving the governor an opportunity to talk shop on Michigan’s own budget woes.
The Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-led state Senate have yet to come to terms on a budget plan funding the state, its agencies and its K-12 schools. The two chambers blew past the statutory – albeit toothless – deadline to have an agreement reached by July 1, and there is no clear path to reaching a deal in sight.
Hall for months has said that he and Whitmer were aligned on a vision to fund roads and that the issue was the main holdup in the budget fight with Senate Democrats, who at present have a loose plan, at best. But the House has yet to deliver a full budget funding the entire state, giving the Senate little to work with at the negotiating table.
Although Whitmer has been more on the offensive in her approach to get the two chambers together on a roads plan, the executive office has said little about which side it supports in the talks.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Advance asked Whitmer if there was any truth to that, and if she was truly as aligned with House Republicans as Hall has said.
Whitmer brushed the narrative off as political posturing.
“Listen, this is the budget process. I’ve done 20 some budgets in my time as a legislator and now as governor, and they always go this way,” Whitmer said. “This is going a little later than I think any of us want it to, but there’s going to be all sorts of posturing. I am not going to get distracted by posturing.”
Whitmer said she was proud of the work the state has done in its past budgets under her watch, and she was committed to getting a balanced budget done soon that protects people, health care systems, funds roads and ensures competitiveness for good paying jobs.
“Those are my north stars,” Whitmer told the Advance. “I’m not going to play … the games they like to play in Lansing. I just want to get it done.”
Whitmer has been playing harder ball on the roads issue, however.
On Thursday, the governor called on the Michigan Department of Transportation and the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity to compile and release data on the impact of the state’s looming road funding cliff, including info on federal funding rollbacks and policies that could have an effect on Michigan’s economy and employment.
The funding cliff is being complicated by the international tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump, which Whitmer said were slowing business growth and raising unemployment – as well as economic uncertainty around the nation.
Whitmer said in a statement issued Thursday that a bipartisan roads plan would improve the outlook given that uncertainty.
“With just weeks left to go until our state budget deadline, expiring federal and state resources to fix our infrastructure, and massive national economic uncertainty, Michiganders deserve to know what’s at stake if the legislature does not get a bipartisan roads deal across the finish line,” Whitmer said. “If Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature do not come together to get a roads deal done, we could lose thousands of good-paying jobs and stall dozens of infrastructure projects statewide, creating unsafe driving conditions for families, further straining already crumbling local roads, and jacking up the cost of future fixes.”
On Friday, Whitmer told the Advance that the budget won’t be complete with a clear and unified roads plan.
“It all goes together,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8084307-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-08 18:56:30.096488

President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs on countries across the globe took effect this week — a move experts have said will further disrupt trading patterns and increase prices for U.S. consumers on goods from clothes to food to appliances.
The impacts are somewhat complicated for goods imported to the U.S. from Canada, which data shows is by far Vermont’s largest trading partner. Here’s the latest:
Canadian imports to the U.S. now face, broadly, a 35% duty. That’s an increase from the 25% tariffs that had been in effect since March. (The new rate for Canadian goods took effect Aug. 1, while revised duties on other countries took effect Thursday.)

Trump increased levies on Canadian imports after failing to reach an updated trade agreement with the country’s leaders by the start of August. The president has tied the tariffs, in part, to what he maintains is Canada’s failure to reduce the cross-border flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. — though Canadian leaders have disputed that claim. 
It’s not clear when a deal between the two countries might be reached.
The latest tariffs have a critical exception, though: the 35% duties don’t apply to goods covered by an existing deal called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump signed in 2018, during his first term. That agreement allows many products to be traded duty-free if they largely originate from within North America.
Vermont State Treasurer Mike Pieciak said between 85% and 90% of Canadian exports likely fall under that agreement. Meanwhile, he said, all of the energy that Vermont imports from Canada appears to also be covered by the agreement.
The latter is particularly important since Vermont gets about a quarter of its electricity from Hydro-Quebec, based in the province of the same name, while about a third of the fuel used to heat homes and businesses in the state comes from Canadian dealers.
The tariff situation is further complicated by the fact some products have been facing separate levies for months, Pieciak said. Imports of Canadian steel and aluminum have faced 50% tariffs since June, he said, and aren’t exempted under the 2018 deal.
Meanwhile, 25% tariffs on foreign imports of automobiles and auto parts have been in effect since earlier this year, though there are certain exemptions to those levies. 
Pieciak said the tariffs on metals have already affected some businesses in Vermont this summer. He recalled conversations with housing and business developers who are concerned that future projects could be plagued by higher material costs. 
“A lot of the projects that are up and running had to source their steel well before they started construction. And they largely have missed the recent imposition of the tariffs,” he said. “But I do worry about what it means for projects that are on the drawing board — projects that will come to fruition in the months and years ahead.”
Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made cars have not yet been reflected in the prices consumers see at dealerships around Vermont, said Matt Cota, who represents auto dealers in the state. That’s because there is often a long gap between when a new car leaves a factory and when someone buys it at a dealership, he said.
But “unless things change,” Cota said, higher vehicle prices are on the horizon.
Pieciak also noted Vermonters can still expect new expenses in the coming months, across the board, due to Trump’s tariffs. The Yale Budget Lab estimated this week that some of the sharpest immediate impacts will be to apparel costs — with near-term price increases expected at 39% for shoes and 37% for clothing. 
Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, said at a press conference Thursday that the new slate of tariffs would only further strain the U.S.-Canada relationship. He predicted further detrimental effects on tourism in Vermont as a result.
“I think it’s going to be a while before they start trusting us again,” Scott said.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa PBS)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a multistate letter Friday questioning whether a new net-zero carbon emissions standard for businesses is illegal under state and federal law.
The letter was sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard. This standard is meant to aid financial institutions “in addressing their most significant climate impact through alignment and sector-specific targets,” according to the document, through actions like stopping or limiting investments in new projects related to fossil fuel expansion and addressing deforestation risks in existing investments.
This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter. According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there are 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of 2023.

Bird also wrote SBTi and the businesses that commit to following the standard may be in violation of state consumer protection laws and federal and state antitrust laws, constituting an illegal boycott by deliberately cutting off investment and insurance for certain industries through their standard on oil, gas, and coal expansion.
“Some economic arrangements are illegal because they are unfair or unreasonably harmful to competition; the ‘good intentions’ behind them are irrelevant,” Bird wrote.
The letter was co-signed by attorneys general from 22 other states — Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.
In a news release Friday, Bird called the standard from SBTi, which partners with the United Nations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other organizations in providing advisory information, “the next attempt by radical environmentalists to coordinate companies to squeeze important American industries into eliminating carbon dioxide production by some future date.”
“SBTi is trying to redo President Biden’s radical green scheme,” Bird said in a statement. “If successful, they’ll hurt farmers, energy producers, and Iowans. Its program limits output of goods or services, and these unrealistic net-zero programs harm both American agriculture and industry. Making net-zero a goal actively harms Americans, creates risk for energy independence, and increases the cost of safe, healthy, nutritious food.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also took steps to investigate SBTi last week, announcing he would issue subpoenas to the advisory group and the CDP, an international nonprofit focused on environmental impact reporting. The investigation will look into whether these organizations violated state consumer protection and antitrust laws “by coercing companies into disclosing proprietary data and paying for access under the guise of environmental transparency,” according to a news release.
“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift. We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers.”

Dias Goncalves was arrested by federal immigration authorities shortly thereafter. (Screenshot from Mesa County Sheriff's Officer YouTube)Mesa County is suing top Colorado officials over a state law that limits the type of information local law enforcement can share with federal immigration authorities, continuing fallout from a June traffic stop in the county that led to a Utah college student’s 15-day detention.
The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Denver, alleges that the Colorado law, known as Article 74, is vague to the point of being unconstitutional and interferes with the federal government’s constitutional discretion over immigration.
“The vagueness and lack of clarity surrounding the operation and scope of Article 74, coupled with the severe penalties and hardships for noncompliance, has caused confusion among law enforcement agencies, systemically chilled Plaintiffs’ interactions with federal law enforcement, and caused the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office to pull back from cooperation with federal law enforcement agencies,” the lawsuit says.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Article 74, created through bills passed in 2021 and this year, prohibits local law enforcement and government officials from sharing certain information with federal agents for the purpose of immigration enforcement. There are exceptions for active criminal investigations.
Earlier this summer, Mesa County Sheriff’s Deputy Alexander Zwinck pulled over a 19-year old college student from Utah, Caroline Dias Goncalves, for trailing a semitrailer too closely. Zwinck let Goncalves go with a warning, but told immigration officials about her presence in the county through a Signal group chat meant for drug enforcement operations. Goncalves, who is from Brazil and has applied for asylum, was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for nearly two weeks.
Afterwards, Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell placed Zwinck on a three-week unpaid leave and Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against the deputy.
Rowell is a plaintiff in the county’s lawsuit against the state.










We will not stand by while our employees are targeted for doing their jobs.


– Mesa County Attorney Todd Starr


“The statute’s lack of clarity creates a significant risk, as we’ve already seen, of arbitrary enforcement, which could lead to substantial fines and legal challenges against our employees,” Mesa County Attorney Todd Starr said during a county commissioner meeting on Tuesday. “This action sends a clear message: We will not stand by while our employees are targeted for doing their jobs. This step is not just lawful, it’s necessary. It protects those who protect our community and ensures they can continue to work without fear of politically motivated litigation.”
The lawsuit alleges that Article 74 has compromised criminal investigations in Mesa County related to drug smuggling, child exploitation and sex crimes because it limits collaboration with local and federal law enforcement.
The county wants a federal judge to clarify that law enforcement and government employees violate Article 74 only if they disclose personal information for the “sole” purpose of helping with immigration enforcement, and that local law enforcement can inquire about someone’s immigration status for “reasonable and legitimate law enforcement purposes.”
Weiser and Gov. Jared Polis are named as defendants.
In a statement, Weiser spokesperson Lawrence Pacheco wrote that Colorado’s law is clear that state law enforcement does not do federal civil immigration enforcement.
“It’s unfortunate that Mesa County filed this lawsuit. The Department of Law has a responsibility to follow facts and defend and enforce state law. We’ll continue to take this duty seriously,” he wrote.

Lewis and Clark County Sheriff Leo Dutton confirmed the news that 45-year old Michael Brown was apprehended to several news agencies on Friday afternoon.
Shortly after, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced the news in a social media post.
“The Anaconda shooter Michael Brown has been apprehended,” the governor posted on X. “Incredible response from law enforcement officers across Montana. Thank you to all partners for your commitment to the search. May God continue to be with the families of the four victims still grieving their loss.”
U.S. Senator Steve Daines also responded to the news on social media.

Our thoughts continue to be with the victims and their families.”
Local, state and federal law enforcement agencies had been looking for Brown for a week.
At around 10:30 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 1, Brown walked into the Owl Bar at 819 E. 3rd St. in Anaconda and began firing.
According to the Montana Standard, the suspect was a U.S. military veteran, serving in the Army from 2001 to 2005. He was then in the National Guard from 2006 to 2009, reaching sergeant in the force, the newspaper reported.

Free.,Trump EPA claws back $7B in solar funding already promised to states,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-epa-claws-back-7b-solar-funding-already-promised-states,,"Several congressional Democrats on Friday slammed the Trump administration’s announcement it will cancel nearly $7 billion in grants to fund solar energy projects for low-income households, saying the move was illegal and would raise families’ energy prices if allowed to proceed.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent notices to states and other recipients of grants through the Solar for All program, which Democrats created in their massive 2022 taxes, energy and domestic policy law, that the agency was canceling all unspent funds from the initiative.The EPA said Republicans eliminated the federal fund that distributed the program’s money in the “one big, beautiful” law President Donald Trump signed on July 4.On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on social media the law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”The move sparked a backlash from Democrats in Congress and the states, who said that rescinding the already-obligated funding violated the law.“We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program,” the five Democratic members of Oregon’s congressional delegation wrote in a Friday letter to Zeldin and White House Budget Director Russell Vought.“Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution.”Letters to 60 states, organizationsThe 60 recipients of the grant awards, mostly state governments but also tribes and some multistate projects, received letters from the EPA on Thursday informing them the grants were being cancelled.The letter sent to Oregon’s Department of Energy said the reconciliation bill Trump signed on July 4 rescinded the authorization and appropriations for the fund.“Any attempt to continue the program’s administration, in the absence of any authorizing legislation or appropriated funds for that purpose, is no longer legally permissible,” the letter said.“The EPA has been weighing options for the future of the Solar for All program and has made the decision to terminate the SFA program and existing grants because the EPA no longer has a statutory basis or dedicated funding to continue administering and overseeing the nearly $7 billion outlay to approximately 60 grant recipients.”The letter said the EPA realized that recipients “may have begun to rely” on the program for preliminary budgeting and staffing decisions. But it said that “due to the early nature of such expenditures, we expect any harms to interests suffered to be remedied and remediable.”In a statement Friday, the Oregon Department of Energy said it had already spent “significant administrative funds” to launch the program later this year, and hinted a legal challenge may come soon.“The federal funding has already been obligated to Oregon, and the Oregon Solar for All Coalition,” the department statement read. “We are surprised and disappointed to hear the U.S. EPA is moving to rescind these already-obligated funds. ODOE will work with our partners, the Governor’s Office, and Oregon’s Attorney General to consider next steps to ensure these funds continue to serve Oregonians as intended.”‘A betrayal’Like the Oregon Democrats, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, the ranking member on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the move was illegal and predicted it would raise energy prices.“The Trump Administration is stealing from working families in broad daylight,” Pallone said in an early Friday statement. “This money was intended for our constituents and communities to help lower energy bills. Clawing these funds back isn’t just brazenly illegal – it’s a betrayal by this Administration of working families who will now pay higher energy bills just so Republicans can grind their axe against clean energy.”Other Democrats, including Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, also focused on the economic impact.“President Trump ran on lowering costs and creating jobs,” Hobbs wrote on X. “Gutting Solar for All will do the exact opposite.

The firefighters, 14 of whom still work for the city, allege that over a period of several years, the city misclassified them as exempt from the federal Fair Labor Standards Act’s provisions on overtime pay due to their status as lieutenants or captains.

The FLSA provides that some employees with managerial duties are exempt from overtime pay due to their role as salaried personnel — but also says first responders generally do not meet the requirements for that particular exemption.

According to the lawsuit, the city “was put on notice” of the misclassification sometime prior to September 2023 — after which it implemented a 14-day work period for some firefighters. The firefighters allegedly worked more than 106 hours during those 14-day work periods and, according to the lawsuit, the city failed to compensate them for those additional hours at the legally required rate of overtime pay.

The lawsuit does not specify the total number of uncompensated hours, or the total dollar cost associated with the work.
The plaintiffs include West Des Moines residents Neil Weglarz, Joshua Schut, Jacob Shapansky, Paul O’Connell and Robert Monson; Ryan Gordon and Derrik Bingham of Grimes; Timothy Hostetter, Kristopher Ruszkowski and Vince De Boer of Urbandale; Corry Dolbeer of Ankeny; John Carlson of Indianola; James Kirkman of Clive; Jeremy Nelson of Jefferson Township, and Michael Staiert of Norwalk.
All of the plaintiffs are currently employed by the fire department except for Bingham, who was employed by the city from January 2006 through March 2024.
Each of the plaintiffs are seeking compensation for unpaid overtime, plus interest and attorneys’ fees.
The City of West Des Moines has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was initially filed in Polk County District Court before being transferred to federal court. City Attorney Greta Truman did not return a call seeking comment Friday.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/08/federal-cutbacks-could-cost-ct-food-stamp-program-180m/,The memorandum issued Friday did not project added costs tied to Medicaid that will pump nearly $7 billion in federal funds into CT this year.,"Connecticut could face close to $180 million in annual extra costs to its supplementary nutrition and food stamps program within the next five years, according to a very preliminary analysis of recent federal budget cuts by Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration.
But the memorandum Lamont’s budget office issued Friday did not project added costs tied to the biggest area that President Donald Trump and Congress targeted for cutbacks: the Medicaid program, which will pump nearly $7 billion in federal funds this year into Connecticut nursing homes, hospitals, health clinics, social service programs and into health coverage for low-income adults and children.
Some policy changes in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” enacted in July to finance huge federal tax cuts, took effect immediately. But many don’t kick in until after the November 2026 elections, and others have no financial impact on Connecticut until 2028 or later.
The Connecticut legislature directed the Lamont administration to provide lawmakers with an update in early August, once all federal budget levels had been set.
Lamont’s budget director, Jeffrey Beckham, noted that despite the bill’s passage in July, it doesn’t represent final congressional action, and federal officials won’t fix many spending levels until this fall or later.
“We anticipate additional federal actions will be adopted in the coming months for which the state will also need to consider what response, if any, is appropriate,” Beckham wrote in his memo to the General Assembly. “Finally, we note that many provisions in the act have future effective dates, and even those that were effective on passage require additional clarity and guidance from the federal government before we have a full understanding of all of the impacts, both primary and secondary.”
In other words, Connecticut officials likely will be making program adjustments and spending decisions related to this for years to come.
The General Assembly is expected to meet in special session in late September or early October, and leaders have left open the possibility of making some adjustments to state spending to response to the federal cutbacks.
Leaders of the legislature’s Democratic majority have said for months they expect that Connecticut may want to invest hundreds of millions more of its own dollars annually — starting in the near future — to blunt the pain of federal cutbacks.
And while most of that pain is expected to come in the Medicaid program, Beckham wrote that there are issues already identified in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a joint effort by federal and state governments to provide food stamps and other aid to low-income adults and children.
Connecticut serves more than 391,000 residents yearly through this program, providing $894 million in benefits.
The Lamont administration estimates Connecticut could lose up to $130 million annually, by 2029 or 2030, because Congress has tightened rules for states with high “error rates.” This refers to how often they issue food stamp benefits to ineligible households, or how frequently they issue the incorrect amount.
Washington also has indicated it will cover a small share of the SNAP program administrative costs, which should add $43 million per year to Connecticut’s expenses by 2027.
Congress and Trump also are ending a national obesity prevent grant offered through the SNAP program. That’s another $4.6 million Connecticut must do without.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CT-state-capitol-1024x855.jpg,,,2025-08-08 17:56:39.250059

SNAP and Food Stamps provide nutrition benefits to supplement the budgets of disadvantaged families. (Getty Images)A group of West Virginia advocacy and food assistance organizations is calling on Gov. Patrick Morrisey not to comply with a request from the federal government for personal information belonging to recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps. 
The 22 organizations — which include the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, the ACLU of West Virginia, Facing Hunger Foodbank and the West Virginia Food and Farm Coalition — called the request an “outrageous act of federal overreach” without clear parameters for how the federal government intends to use the personal data. 
“West Virginia SNAP recipients share their personal information with the state SNAP agency because they trust it will be used only to help them access food assistance,” the letter says. “That trust is grounded in longstanding state and federal laws and standards that strictly limit how this data can be used. Now, the USDA is attempting to bypass those protections — pressuring states to hand over sensitive data for unrelated and undisclosed purposes.”
Earlier this year, the federal Department of Agriculture asked states to turn over SNAP recipients’ sensitive information to comply with an executive from President Donald Trump called “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos.”
The request included recipients’ names, dates of birth, personal addresses and Social Security numbers along with records to calculate the amount of SNAP benefits they got over time. 
“President Trump is rightfully requiring the federal government to have access to all programs it funds, and SNAP is no exception,”  USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement at the time. “For years, this program has been on autopilot, with no USDA insight into real-time data. The Department is focused on appropriate and lawful participation in SNAP, and today’s request is one of many steps to ensure SNAP is preserved for only those eligible.”
The federal agency later broadened the request to other data points including recipients’ immigration status and household members. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service said it would use the data to “ensure program integrity,” including verifying recipients’ eligibility and would follow up with states as necessary regarding next steps. 
Late last month, a coalition of 21 states and Washington D.C. led by Democrat attorneys general in California and New York sued the federal government over privacy concerns with the data request. They asked a judge to stop the government from making the demand or stop it from withholding funding from states that don’t comply. 
In their letter, the West Virginia organizations write that complying with the request would compromise SNAP recipients’ personal data and cause fewer people to feel comfortable participating, undermining Morrisey’s efforts to improve health in the state through his “Four Pillars of a Healthy West Virginia” plan.
In West Virginia last year, SNAP provided food assistance to 277,400, or one in six people, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It fed more than 41 million Americans that year. 
A spokesman for Morrisey did not respond by deadline to a request for comment.

The South Burlington School District is expected to hire an investigator to look into a complaint about a mysterious notebook pillorying the former superintendent that was reportedly circulated at some teachers’ social gatherings.
The investigation comes after a July 23 formal complaint filed with the school board by Kristin Romick, the district’s executive director of educational support services who just this week assumed the temporary role of acting superintendent. The district’s former superintendent, Violet Nichols, resigned the position effective Aug. 1.
According to the complaint, Romick was made aware by some district employees about an after-graduation celebration held at the Saint John’s Club, a bar in Burlington, on June 13, where an elusive book, dubbed by the complainant as the “black book,” was being circulated among staff. The book, Romick alleges, was handmade and included questions written down for teachers and staff to answer.
The party was advertised in an email to all high school staff, and according to an email, began at noon on the day of graduation.
The employees who reported the incident to Romick stated that they were asked to answer the question for that day and sign their name. One of the questions, according to the complaint, read, “What is the next lie the superintendent will tell us?”
The employees told Romick the book is mostly circulated during social gatherings after teachers’ paydays on Fridays and is usually kept in teachers’ cars. According to the complaint, it contains ongoing commentary relating to district leadership, often in a negative tone.
Romick alleged that, according to reports from staffers, the book was being circulated at this post-graduation party by Beth Adreon, co-president of the teachers’ union.
Romick, apart from allegations of the book, also claims that separate conversations held at the party suggested a “premeditated” and “coordinated” effort to remove district leaders, including Nichols.
While a public records request sent by The Other Paper to the district to see the book was denied by Adreon, it has been described by some district staff as a sort of “burn book,” a term used to refer to a collection of negative comments or opinions about a certain group or person. The term gained popularity in 2004 after the movie “Mean Girls” used the term.
Adreon, in an emailed reply to the public records request, said the union is a private institution and is not subject to public records requests.
“Further, the South Burlington Education Association is not in possession of a ‘black book,’” she wrote.
In a phone call, the other South Burlington Educators’ Association Co-President, Noah Everitt, also asserted that he was not aware of any “Mean Girls-style burn book existing at any level, SBEA-wise or non-SBEA-wise.”
He did say, however, that he was aware that a book does exist, primarily as a way for teachers to annotate their thoughts.
“It’s not a burn book, and it also has absolutely nothing to do with the SBEA,” he said, adding that the book is mostly associated with teachers’ social gatherings every “Payday Friday.”
Meanwhile, the Vermont NEA has filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Vermont Labor Relations Board, alleging Romick’s investigation is intended to “harass, threaten and intimidate the union president for the work that she did on behalf of her 400 union members.”
The filing calls on the Vermont Labor Relations Board to rule that the investigation is unlawful and find that Romick has “interfered with, restrained, and coerced” the union’s leadership team and members.
But Romick, in her complaint, says these reports from employees have only amplified her growing concern about “fear for my own position and well-being” from retaliation by the South Burlington Educators Association.
“I believe my fears are justified,” Romick wrote. “It is now evident that there may be a coordinated and targeted plan, orchestrated in part by members of the SBEA and co-president Beth Adreon, to undermine and remove certain employees, including myself, due to internal political alignment or professional associations.”
That professional association, Romick said, is her open support of Nichols.
Nichols’ resignation came amid simmering tension between the South Burlington Educators’ Association and Central Office leadership. The turmoil bubbled over in April when some union members began publicly voicing their grievances about Nichols, citing toxic working conditions, fear of retaliation and questionable decision-making. The call for a new superintendent came after the union engaged in a “listening tour,” which surveyed nearly 300 of its members.
Romick, among other district staffers, has stood firm in her support of the former superintendent, even sending another email to the board in June that outlined a growing concern that she may be targeted next.
In a statement to The Other Paper, Everitt and Adreon said the complaint can only be described “as retaliation for protected union work,” asserting that they expect a speedy conclusion to this “distraction.”
“As a union, we will vigorously defend our right to organize,” the co-presidents wrote. “To that end, we will actively support our members and protect them from this type of retaliation intended to punish and intimidate those who advocate for our students, schools, and profession.”

Romick’s complaint asks the board to launch a formal investigation into the use and distribution of the book during school-affiliated social gatherings and the possible orchestration of leadership changes.
School board Chair Seamus Abshere said that while he is unable to comment on the investigation as it remains open, he did confirm that the board is tapping a third party to investigate the complaint.
“If the facts turn out to be as represented in the complaint, it would be a matter of significant concern,” he said. “However, I believe we should not draw conclusions until the facts are understood through a prompt and thorough investigation.”

Gretchen Whitmer took executive action on Friday to help Michiganders maintain affordable access to health insurance following congressional Republican’s moves to make it harder for people to get and keep their federal marketplace health plans.
Whitmer signed an executive directive for the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services to raise awareness and educate residents on their options to keep or get insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplace plans when enrollment opens in November.
“We wanted to make [this effort] formalized because it’s crucial that we maximize our ACA enrollment,” Whitmer said. “It’s crucial that people across Michigan know that they have the tools and the ability to get answers to their questions.”
Whitmer added that she can’t unilaterally shield Michigan from all the impacts of the Republican “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” now that President Donald Trump has signed the bill into law, nor can she reverse the impact of the majority Republican Michigan congressional delegation’s votes to push it through.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“What I can do is whatever it takes to help make life a little easier for Michiganders, and the work we can do in state government to ensure that people have a little help in these challenges,” Whitmer said. “No Michigander should have to choose between paying their bills and getting to the doctor or buying groceries.”
The federal program’s enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year, which were key aspects of former President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act and extended via the Inflation Reduction Act. The subsidies worked to lower health insurance premiums in the wake of the COVID pandemic.
Trump’s signature budget bill includes potentially significant changes to the Affordable Care Act and steep cuts to Medicaid, which Democrats have warned would affect scores of Americans and Michigan residents, especially in rural areas represented by Republicans.
As it relates to the Affordable Care Act, the Republican budget bill did not extend enhanced premium tax credits for marketplace plans, according to the Center for American Progress, an independent nonpartisan policy institute. That could mean 20 million federal marketplace insurance enrollees could see their premium costs spike when open enrollment opens in November.

Whitmer’s office on Friday elaborated on the impact of those credits ending, noting that residents on marketplace plans would see the cost of health care rise by $700 per person, or roughly $2,400 for a family of four people.
Michigan families will also have a shorter window to enroll due to changes made in the budget bill.
Whitmer’s executive order signed Friday would direct the Department of Insurance and Financial Services to increase awareness on the changes spearheaded by Trump and Republicans in Washington, D.C.
“[Trump’s budget bill] threatens to really devastate health care writ large, but especially in rural areas,” Whitmer said. “This is why it matters not just to one community or another, whether or not you get your health care through Medicaid or through your workplace or another method. Everyone pays a price if these systems are not supported and maintained. When you need care, you need it close and you need quality.”
DIFS Director Anita Fox said access to affordable quality care wasn’t just a cornerstone of good medical health, but also economic and financial security.
“We are proud that Michigan currently has the lowest uninsured rate in history, but new federal changes will raise out-of-pocket costs and make it more difficult to apply for and stay enrolled in health insurance, jeopardizing Michiganders’ health,” Fox said.
The governor added that she hoped the executive order would help people hold on to their health care or find another plan that works for them – and one they can afford – and without mounting debt from being uninsured or underinsured.
“This is one way we’re seeking to mitigate the harm that’s coming from the bill that passed in Congress recently,” Whitmer said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8084332-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-08 16:56:26.671611

(Martina Nolte, Creative Commons CC-by-sa-3.0)Montana’s U.S. senators submitted a letter this week urging Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to “identify a path forward” to maintain sufficient water levels in Flathead Lake in future years facing drought conditions.
The Aug. 5 letter signed by Republican Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy asks the secretary to collaborate with local and regional stakeholder groups to find a solution that balances the myriad uses of the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River.
“I request that you … identify a solution that maintains hydropower production and economic development, abides by statutory requirements and other legal obligations, including President Trump’s recent Executive Order 141554-Unleashing American Energy, respects property rights, promotes outdoor recreation, has the support of the local communities, and minimizes future conflict,” the letter states.
While above-normal precipitation in July has kept Flathead Lake closer to normal levels than was anticipated earlier this year, the senators wrote a holistic approach to lake levels should be considered in the long term, as opposed to requiring one-off fixes every time there are drought conditions and potential low-water years.
Montana’s elected federal and state officials have mounted political pressure on dam operators and federal officials to maintain water levels on Flathead Lake for several years, following drought conditions in 2023 that led to record-low lake levels more than two feet lower than the lake’s full-pool elevation of 2,893 feet by summer’s end.
The primary ask from the state has been for the federal government to approve water releases from Hungry Horse Reservoir upstream, while Energy Keepers Inc., the tribal corporation that operates Se̓liš Ksanka Qĺispe̓ (SKQ) Dam at the lake’s southern end, decrease outflows to the lower Flathead River.
As lake levels dropped in late June of 2023, economic concerns in the region grew as boat launches and docks were largely unusable, farmers in the region dealt with decreased abilities to irrigate crops, and power generation from the SKQ Dam, which controls the lake’s output, slowed.
In early 2025, Energy Keepers stated that streamflow conditions in the Flathead Basin were “similar to 2023 and 2024” and the dam was being operated to increase the likelihood of filling to full pool. To that end, dam operators requested, and received, approval from the federal government to make temporary modifications to outflows from the dam to maximize the chance of refilling under drought conditions, including reducing outflows in June and July.
However, by June, dam operators announced they did not expect the lake to reach its full pool, with forecasts showing the lake dropping more than a foot by July.

Low levels of snowpack and warm weather throughout the spring led to the Flathead River basin sitting around 59% of its average snow water equivalent — the amount of water is contained within the snowpack — which Energy Keepers said was not enough to fill the lake, despite plans to reduce outflows through mid-July.
But precipitation in the region in July was nearly 300% of normal, according to the latest Energy Keepers update last week, which altered the lake’s late-summer fate. Recent streamflow forecasts estimated “the lake will remain in the top 12 inches through most of August,” according to Energy Keepers, a full half-foot higher than originally anticipated.
Despite the better-than-expected conditions, the letter submitted to Secretary Burgum, which praised his agency’s actions granting the temporary modifications to SKQ operations, focused on an expected future of droughts in the region.
“Over the last several years, we have seen unseasonably warm conditions that have resulted in accelerated runoff in the northern reaches of the Flathead basin. Decreased inflows into the lake have precipitated lower lake levels, adversely affecting environmental and economic conditions for residents and visitors alike,” the letter states. “I urge you to identify a path forward that does not depend on granting annual emergency authorities to maintain sufficient lake levels for the local communities that call Flathead Lake home.”
During the 2023 drought, which ultimately saw Flathead Lake’s surface level at 31 inches below full pool by the end of August, tensions around who gets a say in the lake’s management ratcheted up.
Some groups in the region, led by members of the Flathead County Republicans and local property owners, blamed the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, who operate SKQ Dam through the tribally-owned corporation Energy Keepers Inc. Those groups challenged the scientific consensus that the low lake levels were due to historic warm and dry conditions that saw a rapid melt off of the area’s snowpack.
Complaints filed against Energy Keepers with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission led to FERC issuing an analysis that found the dam operators did not violate their operating license by allowing the lake level to drop.
Under the FERC license, Energy Keepers is able to regulate the top 10 feet of the dam-controlled lake, amounting to 1.2 million acre-feet of water storage.
Under normal operating procedures, the dam-controlled lake drops to its lowest point by April 15 to provide flood control across the region, then rises to 3 feet from full pool by Memorial Day, hitting a full pool elevation of roughly 2,893 feet by June 12. The goal is to then operate in the full-pool range through Labor Day, according to Energy Keepers CEO Brian Lipscomb, before lowering the levels in October to mitigate erosion from fall storms. However, there is no legal obligation to maintain a full pool in the license.
SKQ Dam is part of the greater Columbia River Basin network of hydroelectric dam projects that regulate waterways for hydropower generation, flood control, navigation, fish and wildlife preservation, irrigation and recreation. A key part of the operating considerations for the region’s dams are to protect and preserve threatened and endangered fish species including salmon and bull trout, the latter which are found throughout the Flathead River basin.
However many businesses in the region rely heavily on Flathead Lake’s recreational opportunities, with studies from the University of Montana shoring that roughly $600 million is spent in Flathead County from anglers, boater and other tourists visiting the lake.
Montana politicians at the county, state, and federal level have voiced that concern, including in a resolution brought to the 2025 Legislature by Senate President Matt Regier, a Flathead Republican, which sought increased prioritization of recreation in management decisions.
Changes to outflows from any one project can have a ripple effect downstream. The Columbia River Basin Technical Management Team (TMT), comprising of representatives from four states, the Bureau of Reclamation (BoR), Army Corps of Engineers, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bonneville Power Administration and six tribal nations, manages the regions federally-operated dams as a whole system.
During the 2023 drought, in subsequent legislation introduced in Congress by Montana U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, and in a 2025 letter from Zinke to Burgum, requests were made to authorize the release of water from Hungry Horse Dam into Flathead Lake. However, due to the size discrepancy between the two reservoirs, it would take roughly 15 feet of water from Hungry Horse to add eight inches to Flathead Lake.
“I humbly ask you to authorize the release (of) more water from the Hungry Horse Reservoir … to ensure viable lake levels for recreation on Flathead Lake this summer,” Zinke wrote. “I understand the lake will not get to full pool using these measures, however if we can prevent it from dropping to catastrophic levels, it will save small businesses and local tax revenue that is sorely needed.”
Studies published by the U.S. Geological Survey have indicated that releasing vast amounts of water from Hungry Horse dam would be detrimental to endangered bull trout in the Flathead River by decreasing habitat space and impacting the life cycle of aquatic insects, a primary food source for native fish.
“A big release would lead to cascading impacts to the entire aquatic ecosystem,” Clint Muhlfeld, the researcher who authored several studies, told the Flathead Beacon in 2023.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SQK_Dam_DSC_3657-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-08 16:56:26.671611

Jonathan McElderry)On Tuesday, southcentral Alaskans may have noticed an unusual sight in the sky: a large white and silver balloon, carrying an unidentified payload.
It wasn’t a repeat of 2023, when an unmanned Chinese balloon flew across much of the United States. This week’s balloon was part of an U.S. military exercise taking place in Alaska.
The exercise is being organized by U.S. Northern Command, which covers North America, and NORAD — the North American Aerospace Defense Command, a unified Canadian-American group.
Maj. Jhanelle Haag, director of public affairs for the Alaskan Command and the Alaskan NORAD region, said the balloon was part of Arctic Edge 2025, taking place this month at sites across the state.
The exercise, pointed toward Russia, includes activities in Nome, Kotzebue, Cold Bay and other sites near the U.S.-Russian maritime border.
Some of the training includes practice in how to track and intercept incoming cruise missiles, according to information published by U.S. Northern Command, which covers North America.

This week’s balloon launch was from a South Dakota firm called Aerostar.
Russ Van Der Werff, vice president of stratospheric solutions for Aerostar, said in an interview his firm has been in the Alaska area several times, both for commercial flights and testing, “but you know, it never fails — we’re down here in South Dakota, and we fly lots of these every year, and we still get, about every two years, a news story from the local folks going, what is this? It catches the attention.”
Van Der Werff said Aerostar makes a variety of products, including high altitude balloons like the one tested this week in Alaska.
The company’s balloons are designed for missions that require eyes in the sky, but ones that can fly longer and higher than drones or manned aircraft.
Launching a satellite can be expensive and take time, he said, but a balloon can be brought into place quickly.
Balloons move at the orders of the wind, but Aerostar’s balloons are designed to change altitude, using outside air as ballast, which can change its altitude and stability. If the wind isn’t blowing the right way at a certain altitude, the balloon can rise or fall to a place where the wind is blowing the correct direction.
This spring, Aerostar tested a balloon that flew for 336 consecutive days over South Dakota, the longest flight ever by a controlled vehicle.
“We build a variety of different products, but within the high-altitude balloon space, we do equipment for commercial use, whether that’s disaster response, communication, environmental monitoring, scientific work, a lot of stuff with NASA, and then also the defense-related work, like we’re talking about here,” he said.
Neither Van Der Werff or military officials were willing to discuss details about what this week’s balloon was carrying, but typically, the company’s balloons are used for communication and “remote sensing,” putting cameras or other sensors above a particular target.
“It’s not all defense and those kinds of things,” he said, explaining that some balloons have been used to provide long-term aerial coverage of wildfires, and that the same balloon can track the spread of flames and provide a cellphone signal in remote areas.
“That’s a good example of how … a communications and sensing platform regionally positioned and persistently stationed in one location over multiple months can really connect, protect and save lives,” he said.

The order and opinion was issued by U.S. District Judge Joseph R. Goodwin in response to a lawsuit filed by the West Virginia Rivers Coalition last year over continued and excessive pollution from Chemours’ Washington Works plant.
“This case is simple and all too familiar. For years, Defendant Chemours Company has discharged pollutants into the Ohio River. The level of discharge far exceeds the legal limits that bind Chemours,” Goodwin wrote in his opinion and order. “Those pollutants endanger the environment, aquatic life and human health. Today, that unlawful, unpermitted discharge stops.”
A representative for Chemours told Mountain State Spotlight reporter Sarah Elbeshbishi that the company was “disappointed” in the ruling and “strongly disagree[d]” with the court’s characterizations. Chemours plans to appeal the decision.
The Ohio River supplies drinking water to 5 million people across several states, though not all of them are downstream from the Chemours facility.
The Rivers Coalition filed its initial suit in December 2024. A preliminary injunction hearing for the case was held in May. Goodwin said on Thursday Chemours continues to “boldly violate” discharge limits set in its state-issued permit and, in that hearing, “admitted as much.”
In a statement Thursday, members of the West Virginia Rivers Coalition celebrated the court’s order.
“This is a victory for public health and the Ohio River,” said Autumn Crowe, deputy director of West Virginia Rivers. “The court recognized what communities have known for years: Chemours has been polluting our water and ignoring its legal obligations.”
Representatives for Chemours previously told the court that it would take more than two years for the company to come into compliance with discharge limits. Attorney Dave Yaussy said in May that the court shouldn’t issue a preliminary injunction to stop the facility from operating because even that “won’t stop necessarily exceedances from occurring.”
In Thursday’s order, Goodwin didn’t much care for this argument. He said the company should “take any measures necessary to achieve and maintain compliance.”
“[Chemours] could shut down its plant, modify its manufacturing processes, reduce production or send process wastewater off-site to achieve compliance,” Goodwin wrote. “Compliance may be expensive and burdensome, but it is possible.”
Goodwin said the preliminary injunction to order Chemours to stop exceeding discharge limits is in the public interest due to the environmental and health harms known to be associated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.
PFAS, called “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down in bodies or the environment, are known carcinogens, and exposure to them has been linked to reproductive health issues, fetal development complications, thyroid diseases, various cancers and more. They also can endanger aquatic life and alter ecosystems where they are present.
States and the federal Environmental Protection Agency set certain standards for how much of specific pollutants companies are allowed to discharge into waterways. Those standards are based on research showing what exceedances could pose a threat to human and environmental health and are often enforced through the federal Clean Water Act as well as in permits issued to companies by states for operation.
According to documents provided to the court, Chemours’ Washington Works plant has been accused of at least 199 violations of its state permit, and therefore the Clean Water Act, for discharge exceedances.
“[Chemours’] permit is not a suggestion; rather, its permit protects public health and environmental life while balancing the needs of manufacturing,” Goodwin wrote. “But I cannot weigh the scales of that balance to inflict further harm on the communities that rely on clean water for life and livelihood. The Clean Water Act protects the public, and I will enforce it.”
Attorneys for Chemours previously argued to the court that the harms of these exceedances are too difficult to quantify and, therefore, impossible to prove to a degree appropriate for court action or to render relief for.
Goodwin said the harm of PFAS exposure is clear. To argue that relief can’t be sought due to difficulty in quantifying the actual harm, he wrote, is “dangerous.”
“[Chemours’] argument posits a dangerous premise: exposure to a harmful pollutant like [PFAS] is acceptable on some average, despite many permit violations, and the purpose of the Clean Water Act. Under this theory, a plaintiff exposed to concentrations of [PFAS] has no recourse until she develops a serious illness. This theory of irreparable harm cannot be,” Goodwin wrote. “Instead … all those who use the Ohio River suffer irreparable harm with each incremental exposure to [PFAS]. Incremental exposure, resulting in incremental harm, is irreparable harm. It need not be calculable.”
The order issued Thursday is not the end of this case; a trial is set for Sept. 16. Jennie Smith, the executive director of the West Virginia Rivers Coalition, said the organization is “looking ahead” to the trial in hopes it will “resolve remaining issues, namely civil penalties, and to a full and fair process that reflects the public’s interest in clean, safe water.”

Roger Marshall takes flight for appeal on improving air ambulance reimbursement,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/08/08/u-s-sen-roger-marshall-takes-flight-for-appeal-on-improving-air-ambulance-reimbursement/,Air ambulance personnel meet with Sen. Roger Marshall to make a case for improving Medicare reimbursement system to guarantee access to rural Kansans.,"U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, takes part in a briefing by an air ambulance crew before a flight from Newman Regional Health in Emporia. He was told Medicare reimbursement rates should be increased to better support aviation resources used to care for rural Kansans. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)EMPORIA — U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall squeezed into the back seat of the helicopter, adjusted a headset so he could communicate with the pilot and nurse, and lifted off on a 10-minute flight to quickly expose him to sounds and sights of an emergency medical flight.
Marshall, a Republican senator by election and a physician by profession, was no novice to the value of air transportation when caring for people in life-or-death circumstances.
“I practiced medicine in Great Bend for 25 years. I delivered a baby every day and would use helicopter services once a month. Every minute counts,” Marshall said. “Obviously, if you’re in Wichita and you need transportation, it’s going to be quicker to go by ground. If you’re in Atwood, Kansas, you need the helicopter. That’s just life in rural America.”
Marshall was on the Newman Regional Health helipad Friday to learn more about financial obstacles faced by air medical carriers.
He was a guest of LifeSave Kansas, a subsidiary of the Air Methods company that operates from more than 300 bases in 48 states. LifeSave has the helicopter based in Emporia and fixed-wing aircraft stationed in Liberal and Wichita. The company’s goal has been to sustain a network of aviation resources to transport patients at more than 100 mph from place to place, especially Kansans who live the greatest distance from major hospitals.
Carolyn Mayle, a vice president at Air Methods, said 40% of the company’s flights involved Medicare patients and 25% of flights were for Medicaid patients. She said state and federal government programs didn’t pay the full cost of emergency flight services.
Congress has an opportunity to work toward a more equitable compensation system for air carriers, she said.
“Medicare is used as a benchmark,” Mayle said. “Which is fine if Medicare pays their costs. For most providers, they pay 80% to 90% of costs. For air ambulance, it’s about 50%. Our reimbursement has not been updated by the government in over 20 years.”
She touted a bill cosponsored by U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kansas, that would update Medicare reimbursement rates for emergency air services by requiring compensation to be linked to data on actual costs. The bill has been reintroduced in the House and Senate.
“The bipartisan bill … is a common sense way to ensure all Americans have emergency access to hospitals and specialized providers regardless of their location,” Estes said in a statement. “When seconds matter, air ambulances have proven to be the best way to care for patients in need, and under this legislation, the work of the pilots and medical professionals on board will continue to save lives.”
Brittany Cox, area manager of the LifeSave, said the legislation would be an important step in solidifying emergency air transport operations.
“Being part of the emergency medical system gives me an up-close look at the challenges facing rural Americans when it comes to accessing critical trauma care,” said Cox, a nurse who had worked in western Kansas. “Timely access to emergency care can mean the difference between life and death.”
Marshall made no commitment on the pending legislation but said he was interested in creating savings in the Medicare Advantage program by deterring the practice of service providers reporting diagnosis codes to made patients appear sicker than they were.
He estimated the epidemic of upcoding Medicare patients cost the federal government a couple of hundred billion dollars each year.
“I would like to take some of that savings and then figure out an increase reimbursement for Medicare for this type of thing. There’s plenty of money being spent in Medicare, but it’s not always being spent the most efficient way,” the senator said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Marshall-air-ambulance-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-08 16:56:26.671611

Federal judges Thursday ordered the state to retain a congressional map drawn by a special master in 2023 through the 2030 U.S. Census. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)A three-judge panel Thursday denied a request from plaintiffs in Alabama’s redistricting case to put the state back under “preclearance,” which would subject any future congressional maps to approval by the court.
In a separate order, the three-judge panel — U.S. Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, and U.S. District Judges Anna M. Manasco and Terry F. Moorer, both appointees of President Donald Trump — barred Alabama from using a map the Legislature passed in 2023 to conduct elections.
The judges also ordered the state to administer future congressional elections under the current congressional map, drawn by a special master in 2023, until the state enacts new congressional maps based on the 2030 U.S. Census. The map resulted in the election of U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, in the 2nd Congressional District last November. That election marked the first time in history that Alabama elected two Black U.S. Representatives at the same time.
“We have no doubt that the remedial rulings we have entered fully redress the constitutional and statutory violations we have found. We do no more than enter a remedy designed to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of such conduct. Accordingly, we decline at this time and on these facts to bail Alabama back into federal preclearance,” the judges wrote.

The court ordered the state to draw a new congressional map in 2023 after nearly two years of litigation with two appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. The panel ruled that the Legislature-approved map did not give Black voters the ability to choose their preferred leaders, and ordered a majority-minority congressional district and a district with a near-majority of Black voters to be drawn. 
After a trial earlier this year, the court ruled in May that Alabama had intentionally discriminated against Black voters by approving a map in 2023 that initially only had one majority-Black district.
Plaintiffs’ attorney Deuel Ross with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund expressed both disappointment and gratitude regarding the decision.
“We, as in the parties, the plaintiffs and the defendants, all asked the court to move quickly and not wait on issuing an order,” Ross said in an interview Friday. “Just as I said, disappointed that the court did not impose preclearance, but grateful for the court’s ruling that will keep in place, a fair remedy through 2030.”
Ross said that the ruling provides a “specific remedy that is fair to all voters” and that he is “excited because this is a hard fought one.”
The Alabama Attorney General’s office stated it was pleased with the ruling.
“We are pleased that the Court accepted our arguments and rejected the plaintiffs’ far-reaching request,” said William Califf, a spokesperson for the office in an email.
The state of Alabama has a brief due on September 4th, asking the Supreme Court to hear the case a third time, with the plaintiffs’ response due a month later. Ross also mentioned that the court’s decision provides clarity as the case is currently on appeal to the Supreme Court.

Olmscheid/Senate Media Services.Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, pledged to introduce legislation next year closing a “loophole” in Minnesota’s regulation of so-called ghost guns — untraceable firearms without serial numbers.
The declaration comes after the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that state law doesn’t clearly restrict Minnesotans from possessing guns without serial numbers. The high court stated in its ruling that Minnesotans can possess a gun without a serial number as long as it complies with federal law.
The case originates from a 2022 car crash in Fridley. A state trooper responding to the crash found a Glock pistol without a serial number in the car, and the driver — Logan Vagle — was charged with felony possession of a self-assembled gun without a serial number.
The Minnesota Supreme Court on Wednesday reversed an appeals court decision that upheld the felony charge and sent the case back down to the district court for further review. 
“Minnesota has not established an independent firearm serial number regime, and federal law does not require that Vagle’s pistol have a serial number,” Associate Justice Paul Thissen wrote in the majority opinion, joined by justices Anne McKeig, Gordon Moore and Sarah Hennesy.
Chief Justice Natalie Hudson wrote the dissent, which was joined by Associate Justice Karl Procaccini. 
In a statement, the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus praised the court’s ruling and said, in particular, it will impact lawful gun owners who manufacture firearms for personal use or own firearms manufactured before 1968 — the year the feds mandated gun manufacturers to include serial numbers on their firearms.
“Minnesotans who lawfully build personally manufactured firearms and possess pre-1968 firearms have always acted within the law. The court’s decision … confirmed that fact,” said Gun Owners Caucus Chair Bryan Strawser in a statement. 
“In the end, the final decision on whether and how to regulate ghost guns rests with the Legislature,” Thissen wrote in his opinion.
Latz, who serves as chair of the Senate’s Public Safety Committee, interpreted the Supreme Court opinion as a call to action. 
“No one could’ve foreseen a world where you could print the parts to make a gun at home, but that’s the world we live in today,” Latz said in a statement. “This decision makes it clear that our state gun laws need to reflect this new reality and the increasing prevalence of ghost guns.”
It’s unclear whether this Latz’s proposal will gain bipartisan support, which will be required to pass the Minnesota House and also the Senate, depending on the results of two special elections. The House is expected to return to a tie between Republicans and Democrats after a special election.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250303_AO_1482.jpg_1741201019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 16:56:26.671611

Long’s sudden departure was first reported by the New York Times.Long wrote on social media that Trump will now appoint him to be U.S. ambassador to Iceland. The White House confirmed Long’s statement.“It is a honor to serve my friend  President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!” Long wrote.The former lawmaker’s ouster comes as the IRS must begin to implement changes to the tax code championed by Senate Republicans and signed into law by Trump just last month. Those include temporary tax relief for some tipped and overtime workers, as well as permanent changes to the child tax credit and several clean energy tax credits.The agency, which collects the lion’s share of the country’s revenue from individual taxpayers, lost more than 11,000 employees, or 11% of its workforce, either through deferred resignations or mass firings of probationary workers since Trump began his second term, according to a May 2 report from the agency’s inspector general.Confirmed in JuneLong, who represented Missouri in the U.S. House from 2011 to 2023 and then worked many years as a talk radio host, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in a 53-44 vote on June 12.The former lawmaker and media personality faced scrutiny during his confirmation process from Senate Democrats who demanded an investigation into Long’s work with two companies, Capital Edge Strategies and White River, where he allegedly peddled fake tax credits.Senate Democrats also scrutinized donations Long received to his defunct Senate campaign after Trump announced in December he intended to install the former congressman at the helm of the IRS.Long denied any wrongdoing, and received the support of all Senate Republicans, including Senate Committee on Finance Chair Mike Crapo, of Idaho, who praised Long’s promise to “implement a top-down culture change at the agency.”‘One corruption bombshell after another’Sen.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Butler Hospital announced Thursday it will close its addiction treatment unit next week, leaving the Providence psychiatric facility at about half its full capacity of 197 beds.
The addiction unit comprises 29 beds and serves patients with substance use disorders who want detox treatment. The hospital noted in a news release that emergency departments statewide are able to care for these patients while the unit is closed. Two other units totalling about 70 beds were closed in July, making this the third unit Butler has closed since the strike began.  
The Providence psychiatric hospital has cited the ongoing SEIU 1199NE strike, now in its 12th week, as the impetus for the closures. The unionized workforce of nurses, mental health workers, and dietary, clerical and support staff — about 724 workers in all — have been on strike since May 15.
“Because of their unrelenting labor strike, we have had to close another 29 beds and shutter our addiction unit, reducing capacity for people struggling the most,” Mary Marran, the hospital’s president and COO said in a statement Thursday. “If SEIU’s political leaders truly cared about the vulnerable patients who rely on Butler Hospital, they would stop moving the goal posts and work in good faith to end this strike.”
Rhode Island Current reached out to SEIU 1199NE for comment but had not heard back by press time.
On Wednesday, the union and hospital negotiated formally, with a federal mediator present, for the first time in about six weeks. But in an email obtained by Rhode Island Current, Michael Wagner, the CEO of Butler’s owner Care New England, wrote that the talks were not much more productive this time around, despite a promising beginning. 
“Early in the session, the union restructured its health plan proposal to remain within our proposed financial framework,” Wagner wrote. “While the new structure was not our preferred approach, we acknowledged it was a step forward. Unfortunately, as the day and night progressed, the union introduced additional proposals — both economic and non-economic — that would significantly increase the cost of the contract.”

The negotiating session lasted 15 hours overall, and ended after 3 a.m. Wagner wrote that the union “shift[ed] the goal posts” and “introduced complexities,” including larger wage increases, that he argued the hospital and Care New England could not sustain. 
“There were several moments yesterday and into the night when an agreement could have been reached — moments when the union could have claimed real progress for their members,” Wagner wrote. “Instead, they pushed for more.” 
A video posted on Aug. 5 to the strikers’ new website counters the hospital’s leadership narrative, and claims that the union’s bargaining committee is made up entirely of frontline Butler workers and that it crafts counterproposals and contract priorities based on its membership’s input.
“No one tells us what to fight for,” Catherine Maynard, a registered nurse, says in the video.
“We decide together as a union,” adds John Cabral, an occupational therapy assistant, speaking after Maynard.
Union members have previously criticized Butler’s offer as inadequate, citing what it calls “poverty wages” of a little over $18 for housekeeping and food service staff as unsustainable given Rhode Island’s cost of living. That wage works out to about $37,500 a year, but the hospital claims that, with all benefits included, the total compensation for these workers is closer to $75,000.
A full breakdown of the hospital’s July 11 proposal, which it has repeatedly called its “last, best, and final” offer, remains available on Butler’s website.

Article Summary

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made her second visit to Illinois Friday to call on the state to end “sanctuary” immigration laws.
Barbara Hernandez filed a bill in Springfield to ban federal law enforcement from covering their faces while in the field.
Noem said federal agents have seen a massive increase in assaults against them, and supervisors decide what situations require officers to conceal their identity.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made her second visit of the year to Illinois on Friday to condemn the state’s immigration laws and defend the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts.
At a news conference in west suburban Lombard, Noem highlighted four individuals arrested in Illinois and deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement while arguing Illinois has given safe harbor to violent criminals. She also defended controversial tactics federal officers have used to arrest people.
“These individuals would still be out on our streets today, committing crimes and attacking people and harming them and hurting our children, if Gov. (JB) Pritzker and (Chicago) Mayor (Brandon) Johnson had their way,” Noem said of the four deported people pictured behind her while standing in front of a table filled with confiscated guns, drugs and cash.
Noem said people in Illinois – a state with 1.8 million foreign-born residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau – should focus on the needs of “American citizens” and “make them the priority, because they’re the ones who invested in this country.”
While Noem touted the thousands of people who have been deported since President Donald Trump took office in January, ICE’s methods for detaining people have generated controversy. Videos have gone viral on social media showing masked federal agents without uniforms surprising people as the agents jumped out of unmarked cars.
Noem defended agents using masks, claiming federal agents have seen a 1,000% increase in assaults against them in recent months. She also said agents do identify themselves with either something they are wearing or verbally.
“ICE is always wearing something that identifies them, who they are and what operation they’re out on,” Noem said. “I would say that they wear masks at times to protect their identities from dangerous situations. With the leadership teams, we leave that up to them to discern what’s necessary in certain situations.”
Illinois lawmaker seeks regulations on ICE’s attire
Some Illinois Democrats are seeking to ban federal agents from wearing masks in many cases. Rep. Barbara Hernandez, D-Aurora, filed House Bill 4086 in July that would prohibit law enforcement officers operating in Illinois from wearing masks while interacting with the public with exceptions for surgical masks for medical reasons and masks to protect police from smoke or gas.
It would also require officers to wear something identifying their name or badge number as well as the police agency they work for. The bill makes an exception for undercover officers.

“What the federal government’s doing is not in a line of duty where chemicals are going to be around or anything,” Hernandez said in an interview. “To my knowledge, it’s just people getting arrested at homes, at stores, at parking lots, so why should they hide who they are?”
She acknowledged Noem’s concerns about officers’ safety but argued that police officers have a public-facing job and should identify themselves when they’re working with the public.
“I want to be supportive of officers overall, however, these are officers that have been told to deport families, to spread fear, to do a lot of illegals actions – in a way they’re law enforcement and they’re not following certain laws either by not having a search warrant,” Hernandez said.
But Hernandez acknowledged the Illinois Attorney General’s Office has shared with her that her bill is likely unconstitutional as state laws cannot regulate the federal government.
“I know that this is something that my community wants to see and even though if (federal regulation) gets removed from the bill itself, we want to make sure people are aware of this; we want people to be sure that we are fighting for this,” Hernandez said.
Sanctuary policies 
Noem’s first visit earlier this year to Springfield was met with protests as she visited a Homeland Security detention facility and invoked the death of local activist Emma Shafer, despite objection from Shafer’s parents.

During her Springfield visit, Noem, alongside Republican state legislators, called on Pritzker to end the state’s “sanctuary” policies. She repeated her demands Friday.
“Kristi Noem is trying to make an example out of us because we refuse to join her in kissing the dirt under Trump’s shoes,” Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said during a news conference Friday. “And I’m sure it only infuriates her more that the law is simply on our side.”
State law does not protect people in Illinois from deportation. Federal officers under Noem’s leadership can still make arrests and deport people in Illinois. Under the 2017 TRUST Act signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, Illinois law enforcement is prohibited from arresting a person based solely on their immigration status and in most cases, cannot assist immigration officials with detaining people based on immigration status, according to the Illinois Attorney General’s office.
Noem said ICE has issued more than 1,600 detainers – a request to hold someone in local custody for ICE to pick up and process for deportation – in recent months, but only 8% have been fulfilled.
“Anybody who serves in law enforcement would say they’re used to partners,” Noem said. “They’re used to being able to call up a local law enforcement officer, a sheriff, a highway patrol officer, and say, ‘Hey, do you have any information on this individual that is a murderer that’s been cited in your city?’ That’s not happening in Illinois.”

Act 73 creates new provisions around school construction aid, giving some districts hope that the state could soon help fund school building renovations.

The Woodstock Union High School and Middle School building is in bad shape. Its HVAC, electrical and sewage systems — products of the mid-1960s — are now well past their useful life, according to school officials.
Sherry Sousa, superintendent of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union that operates the school, said the district “can’t guarantee, based on where our systems are now, that our sewage system is going to work.” 
For those familiar with Vermont’s public education system, this sort of story is hardly new. Districts throughout the state routinely deal with general disrepair and disruption caused by aging school buildings.

Over the years, education officials have pleaded with the state to restart a long-dormant state aid fund for school construction, which previously supported up to 30% of construction costs. But Act 73, the new education reform bill Gov. Phil Scott signed into law last month, is creating optimism among education officials that state aid could begin again.
Mountain Views Supervisory Union officials are banking on that. Last week, members of the school board and central administration announced they would press ahead with a new working committee to oversee plans for a new high school and middle school building under the terms of Act 73.
“We’ve decided that we can’t wait. We have to move forward. We need a new school,” Keri Bristow, the Mountain Views Supervisory Union’s board chair, said in an interview. “We have to do something before we have a catastrophic failure.”

‘Cart before the horse’
Vermont’s new education law seeks to address the state’s “languishing” school infrastructure through implementation of a new state aid for school construction fund. Act 73 provides preliminary rules around what schools could be eligible for state aid, and which projects should be prioritized.
The newly created State Aid for School Construction Advisory Board, set to first meet on or before Sept. 1, according to state Board of Education Chair Jennifer Samuelson, will work with the Agency of Education to further develop and finalize those parameters before the School Construction Aid Special Fund is officially created July 1 next year.
The advisory board is one of the first facets of the new law to get off the ground. The School Redistricting Task Force has already started work to consolidate Vermont’s 118 school districts, contained within 51 supervisory districts or supervisory unions, into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts. The school construction advisory board will work concurrently with that task force.

David Epstein with the Burlington architecture firm TruexCullins has worked with a number of Vermont’s school districts’ on facilities needs. He called the new framework in Act 73 a “positive sign.”
But he and others have cautioned that while the law sets up a framework for a revived school construction fund, the law does not directly address where funding will come from.
“Until a funding source is identified and the scale of that funding source is understood, it’s hard for me to be too optimistic,” Epstein said.
In a press conference Thursday, Scott said school construction is “going to be very important” once new school district maps are drawn and plans for consolidation are considered by the Legislature.
“That’s an appropriate time to talk about school construction,” he said. “We should be prepared for that, I realize that, but I think we’d be putting the cart before the horse in terms of school construction.”

To bond or not to bond
Vermont’s schools are the second oldest in the country and have continued to depreciate since state lawmakers paused construction aid nearly 20 years ago.
The Agency of Education has previously estimated schools will need upward of $6 billion in infrastructure investment over the next two decades.
“The level of investment has not been keeping up with the needs, and so there’s a tremendous amount of need,” Epstein said.
The disrepair in school facilities has forced districts to try and finance fixes through voter-approved bonds. Last year, the Colchester School District put forward a $115 million bond to modernize its aging schools — which, similar to the Woodstock High School, were built in the mid-20th century.
Colchester residents narrowly approved the bond proposal in November, but other districts that have floated bonds have not had such luck.
In March 2024, residents of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union’s seven member towns voted down a $99 million bond measure — throwing in flux plans to replace the Woodstock High School building.

And in 2021, voters in the member towns of the Harwood Unified Union School District sunk a $59.5 million construction bond. Without voter approval, the district is now stuck using general fund dollars to complete patch work repairs.
“We’re spending a lot of money on capital needs for things that really require wholesale renovation, new construction,” said Michael Leichliter, Harwood supervisory union’s superintendent.
Leichliter said the Harwood school district hired TruexCullins to conduct a review of its buildings, which he said should be completed by the end of August.
The Orleans Central Supervisory Union also hired TruexCullins to conduct a facilities assessment of school buildings. Dan Roock, the chair of the facilities committee there, said the district has $108 million in deferred maintenance across its eight school buildings.
Officials there are hoping to begin a community outreach campaign to gauge willingness for any new renovation projects.
Uncertainty over taxpayers’ appetite for million-dollar bond investments has created a tricky calculation for districts that fear catastrophic failure in their school buildings.
The more they wait, the more expensive repairs will cost, Roock said.
“We know we’ve got to do something,” he said. “We know it’s going to cost a lot of money — even if it’s no new construction, just fixing what we have.”

‘We’ve been patient’
For districts with construction plans in the works, like Orleans Central Supervisory Union, the decision whether to proceed with bond votes has been further complicated by the redistricting process underway.
“Some districts are waiting to see what the new districts are like,” Epstein said. “Some districts want to move forward with projects while they still can, while they still have control of their destiny, so to speak.”
Uncertainty around whether state lawmakers will even fund the new state aid construction fund only complicates that decision.

Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, chair of the Senate Education Committee, said there is “a general recognition that we have to figure out a way to help with school construction funding.”
“But there’s also a recognition that, right now with what’s happening nationally, we’re in uncharted waters, and we’re really going to have to see where we are come January and see what kinds of immediate crises we may be facing, or not,” he said.
In the Mountain Views Supervisory Union, officials say they can’t afford to wait any longer.
“I think we’ve been patient, and the board has been really responsible,” Sousa said. “Now, we really have to fill in the gray spaces of Act 73. We want to work with the Agency of Education to fill in that gray space and acknowledge, how does this school district move forward?”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) State utility regulators have filed a complaint with a federal agency, saying a regional electrical grid planning group’s system for assessing power line needs is misguided and will cost North Dakota ratepayers money. 
The North Dakota Public Service Commission on July 30 filed the complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The complaint is against the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which manages a regional electric grid that serves 15 states, including part of North Dakota, and parts of Manitoba, Canada. 
In December, MISO revealed a plan for 24 transmission upgrade projects with an estimated combined cost of $22 billion.
But the PSC says the group has changed the way it evaluates the costs and benefits of transmission projects to the detriment of North Dakota.

During a meeting Thursday, Commissioner Jill Kringstad said the 24 MISO projects would help some states achieve renewable energy goals but pass some of the cost on to North Dakota ratepayers.
She called the costs “unjust and unreasonable” for North Dakota. 
Commissioners estimated North Dakota’s share of the projects at $5 per month for an average customer, which the customer would pay for decades. 
Of the 22 projects, two reach into the eastern edge of North Dakota. The rest of the projects are in the northern tier of MISO states, from eastern South Dakota to western Ohio. 
Christmann said his objections aren’t over individual projects, but about how MISO changed its method to justify the projects. 
“There is nothing to justify the kind of costs imposed on our people,” Christmann said in an interview. 
North Dakota received support in its complaint from Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana. 
The southern states are not being asked to help pay for the project in the northern MISO area but Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis objects to the cost-benefit analysis that was used. 
The cost-benefit allocations used in MISO-North might some day come down to MISO-South, Lewis said.
MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris confirmed the cost allocation for the plan is on a subregional basis across the North and Central regions and does not include MISO South. 
“MISO is reviewing the filing submitted to FERC,” Morris said. “The (proposed) portfolio was developed through a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement, including more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits. The portfolio supports reliability and the future needs of the system.”
While it’s not uncommon for state regulators to bring objections to MISO’s governing board, it is rare for states to join forces for a federal complaint on an issue that doesn’t apply to all members, Lewis said.
In a news release, the North Dakota PSC said its concerns were brought up to MISO during the stakeholder process but were not addressed.
MISO has 20 days from the date of the filing to file a response or request an extension with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


–  Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

Tom Hartnett Jr. of Charleston. (Photo by Ed Wray/provided by The Citadel)With more than 1,100 miles to think while driving from Charleston to Galveston, Texas, three years ago, state Rep. Tom Hartnett Jr. found himself asking the same question again and again.
Why doesn’t South Carolina have its own maritime academy?
Hartnett was taking his son, Rhett, to the Texas A&M maritime academy — one of just seven such schools nationwide — for his freshman year.

Months later, the Charleston Republican won his first election to the Statehouse. Rhett, who plans to become a merchant mariner, will graduate later this year.
Since that trip, the elder Hartnett — a former stevedore turned real estate appraiser — has been taking steps to bring a new maritime academy to Charleston. Palmetto State residents interested in jobs on commercial vessels or along the waterfront shouldn’t have to face long distances — and expensive out-of-state tuition — to reach their goals, he said.
Earlier this week, Hartnett met with Brig. Gen. Sally Seldon, provost and dean of The Citadel, to discuss the potential creation of the South Carolina Maritime Academy at South Carolina’s military college.
“She was very receptive,” Hartnett told the SC Daily Gazette, adding he hopes a working group of education and maritime industry leaders will be formed in the coming months to discuss the next steps.
The academy would integrate with The Citadel’s existing infrastructure, reducing startup costs and accelerating the academy’s launch timeline. Hartnett said he hopes the academy will be up and running within two years.
A spokesperson for The Citadel did not respond to a request for comment, but the idea already has strong backing.
“The maritime industry faces significant challenges in meeting the growing demand for a skilled workforce,” Bradley Kerr, director of sales and marketing at Detyens Shipyards, said in a written statement.
“To ensure the future security and resilience of our nation’s maritime infrastructure, we must establish accessible and robust pathways for local and state students to pursue careers in critical fields such as marine engineering, naval architecture, marine mechanics and logistics, thereby fortifying our shipyards and logistical framework,” Kerr said.
John Cameron, executive director of the Charleston Harbor Pilots, said merchant marine officers who go on to leadership roles with shipping companies, insurers, admiralty law firms and port administration are more likely to be from a state with a maritime academy.
“South Carolina ought to be one of them,” Cameron said in a written statement.
Hartnett said the Port of Charleston and the area’s well-established maritime industry offer ready-made training opportunities.
“Our back yard is nothing but a classroom — a training area for mariners,” he said.
A spokesperson for the S.C. State Ports Authority, which owns and operates Charleston’s port, said in an email that the state agency is “thankful for Hartnett’s continued support of the maritime industry and expects to participate in conversations with him to support his efforts.”
A handful of private and public maritime training programs already exist in the Charleston region, including at Trident Technical College which offers an associate’s degree in marine engineering technology.
But existing programs aren’t on the scale of what an academy recognized by the U.S. Maritime Administration would offer. Such academies must provide all of the instruction and at-sea training needed to become a commissioned officer and U.S. Coast Guard-licensed Merchant Mariner. The proposed Citadel program would also offer four-year degrees in marine engineering, logistics and transportation.
The federal Maritime Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Labor, provides training vessels and some funding, although the S.C. Legislature would likely need to kick in additional state money for a South Carolina academy.
It’s still too early to know how much that might take, Hartnett said.
“By leveraging Charleston’s port infrastructure and The Citadel’s military structure, the academy would provide immediate access to real-world maritime experience through partnerships with local shipyards, port operators, and federal Ready Reserve Force vessels” owned by the Maritime Administration, according to a release from Hartnett announcing his proposal.
The seven maritime academies nationwide graduate fewer than 1,500 licensed officers annually – far below the yearly estimated need for 2,200 licensed officers and 9,700 water transportation workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than half of current merchant marine officers are expected to retire over the coming 15 to 20 years.
The median pay — meaning half earn more and half less — for such workers is $66,490 per year, according to the bureau.
“How can we continue to deny our citizens the ability to open the doors to career paths like that?” Hartnett said. “We owe it to South Carolina. We owe it to our citizens, the students and our waterfront industry. It’s just something that has to be done.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)HOBBS, NM — His voice steady, Marcos Carranza, an immigrant and retired oil and gas worker, recounted that he saw coworkers die on the job during his 15 years in the industry.
“The most vulnerable workers need the most support since they are affected the most,” Carranza said in Spanish.

U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.), who represents border communities in New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District, says he’s hoping to help provide that support.
After a day of triple-digit heat across much of the Southwestern corner of the state, Vasquez on Aug. 7 announced the reintroduction of legislation mandating oil and gas companies to pay for oil and gas workers’ health care costs.
“You are the ones sacrificing your bodies, your health,” Vasquez said to the crowd of about two dozen people, including oil workers and their families, gathered under the awning in Heizer Park for the announcement. Most wore yellow shirts emblazoned with the sunburst logo of immigrant rights group Somos Un Pueblo Unido.
Earlier this year, Somos Un Pueblo Unido released a report with researchers from the University of New Mexico that documents conditions for workers in the oil-and-gas producing Permian Basin, including: work days exceeding 12 hours; dangerous driving conditions; hazardous workplaces; and a lack of access to health care or unemployment benefits during injuries or downturns.
New Mexico’s Permian counties — including Eddy and Lea counties — consistently rank poorly on national surveys of air quality and Southeastern counties have reported high rates of asthma hospitalizations, particularly in Chaves County.

Vasquez’s legislation, introduced on Tuesday, requires oil and gas companies making more than $50 million a year in revenues to pay into a trust fund to reimburse oil and gas workers for medical costs related to low air quality and prolonged heat exposure. Vasquez introduced a similar measure in 2023.
The fund, which requires contributions equal to the total paid to each company’s 10 top-compensated employees, would allow reimbursement for out-of-pocket medical costs to oil and gas workers,  their spouses and children for certain health conditions, including asthma; illnesses due to heat exposure; and cardiovascular diseases linked to methane exposure.
In the new version of the bill, Vasquez is also calling for a federal study of long-term health outcomes in oil and gas producing states: New Mexico, Texas, North Dakota, Colorado, Louisiana and Alaska.
Vasquez noted that Latino and Hispanic workers, many of them immigrants, represent a significant portion of New Mexico’s oil and gas workforce. The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics estimates Latino and Hispanic workers accounted for one-third of the national workforce in 2024.
“It’s really important to me that the Hispanic community in the Southeast part of New Mexico feels that they are represented, that they are taken care of, for their contributions in this country,” he said.
Vasquez said that people who are undocumented or hired by contractors or subcontractors are vulnerable to losing out on unemployment and health care, and this fund would address some of the gaps.
“We cannot accept that these folks don’t deserve the same level of health care that other workers deserve,” Vasquez told Source NM. “When it comes to respiratory diseases — not just for them, but for their families as well —  they must be taken care of. Because if we’re going to generate billions of dollars for the oil gas companies, we should also be able to spare enough to take care of the people who actually make those profits.”
Vasquez said Republicans in the administration are using harmful rhetoric and immigration enforcement to threaten U.S. oil and gas security, saying he hopes to offer “a reality shock” to members in Congress.
“They have to also come to accord with the fact that the majority of the Hispanic population here that is now being targeted for deportation from ICE is going to detract from those economic goals of the Republican Party,” he said.

Shows like “Sesame Street” and “Maya & Miguel” were a key part of his early education.

“My younger group, they love it,” he said. “They love it because they know we’re coming with something fresh, something new.”
But because of federal budget cuts pushed by President Donald Trump, Johnson and other Mississippians will lose access to these shows by next summer.
Mississippi Public Broadcasting will lose up to 15% of its annual budget, which is between $2 million and $2.5 million, according to Anna Neel, MPB’s chief operating officer.
She said that by July 1, MPB plans to eliminate programming from PBS, NPR, the Create television channel, the PBS Kids television channel, PBS Kids app and the streaming service Passport.
MPB will still air emergency weather alerts and local programming like “The Gestalt Gardener” on the radio and “Mississippi Roads” on TV, and it will continue to produce all local news, including “Mississippi Edition,” Neel said.
Nationally syndicated TV shows like “Daniel Tiger,” “Sesame Street,” “Frontline,” “Finding Your Roots” and “Antiques Roadshow” and radio shows like “Morning Edition” and “All Things Considered” won’t be available under MPB’s planned changes.
The Republican-led Congress last month approved and Trump signed cuts to federal spending, including a $1.1 billion reduction to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  Trump said in an executive order in May that he believes PBS and NPR have “biased and partisan news coverage.”

CPB helps fund PBS and NPR, and it sends money to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations nationwide, including Mississippi Public Broadcasting. CPB announced on Aug. 1 that it is starting the process of shutting down.
Neel said despite the cuts, Mississippi is in a better position than other rural states because most of its budget comes from state funding. She said CPB’s shutdown was expected and won’t impact the changes already planned.
“At the end of the day, it didn’t go our way,” Neel said. “So, defunded but not defeated, right?”
Republican state Sen. Angela Burks Hill of Picayune said she supports the funding cuts. She said the government should prioritize public safety, corrections and the national debt, and that MPB should replace missing funds with donations.
“We can’t just keep funding everything that we’ve been funding all these years if we’re ever going to hope to keep our fiscal house in order,” Hill said.

Mississippi Public Broadcasting multi-media producer Joseph Hall, left, on set with MPB Chief Operating Officer Anna Neel at MPB headquarters, Friday, Aug. 1, 2025, in Jackson.
MPB started a donor campaign, Won’t You Be Our Neighbor, to try to make up for some of the losses. Neel said many donors reached out to show support and said they’d be increasing their contributions. 
“That donor pie is not enough to make up the $2.5 million deficit that we will see with these cuts,” Neel said.
For the fiscal year that began last month, Mississippi lawmakers put $8.3 million of state money into public broadcasting, listed in budget documents as the Educational Television Authority. That is a decrease of $2.1 million, or about 20%, in state support from the previous year. 
Johnson said he has seen how PBS Kids helps students with academics and social and emotional development. 
“Nothing will be able to replace PBS Kids, simply because it’s a network designed specifically for kids to educate them about how the world is ever-changing,” Johnson said.

Neel said it would be difficult and expensive for MPB to produce children’s educational programming locally. She said she has spoken to teachers in underserved communities who rely on PBS Kids.
“They depend on this free educational content … to help children not just learn to read, learn their colors, to learn their shapes, but they depend on this content to teach children how to regulate their emotions,” Neel said.
PBS says its children’s programming helps improve literacy and STEM skills, and its accessibility helps fill educational gaps: 60% of PBS’ audience lives in rural areas, and 56% of low-income households watch it.
For Johnson, the alternative to PBS Kids is YouTube. Instead of having prepared lessons, staff will have to build their own curriculum.
“I will stand on the highest mountain to say that there isn’t any platform, any network, or any broadcasting service that will replace PBS Kids,” Johnson said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/01163944/Mississippi-Public-Broadcasting-4.jpg,,,2025-08-08 16:56:26.671611

Residents of historically redlined communities experience slower response times from emergency medical services, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to Black and Hispanic residents. The practice deemed neighborhoods with higher proportions of nonwhite residents to be undesirable and financially risky for mortgage lending.
Researchers mapped locations of EMS centers across 236 cities and analyzed maps produced in the 1930s by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. The government agency, created as part of the New Deal, consistently ranked majority-Black areas as “hazardous” for lending. Redlining has been illegal since enactment of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968.

The research team calculated average EMS response times using the location of ambulance, fire and rescue services and historical traffic data. “Rapid” response was defined as five minutes or less, the benchmark set by the National Fire Protection Association for high-priority patients with life-threatening conditions.
The team found that more than 2.2 million people lack rapid EMS access. Areas historically graded “D” — financially “hazardous” for mortgage lending — had a significantly higher proportion of residents (roughly 7%) without rapid EMS access, compared with about 4% of residents in historically “most desirable” A-graded neighborhoods. D-graded neighborhoods had higher proportions of Black residents, whereas A-graded neighborhoods had more white residents.

Disparities were particularly acute in the Great Lakes region, the authors note. The odds of lacking rapid access to EMS were nearly three times higher for residents in historically D-graded neighborhoods, compared with A-graded neighborhoods in that region.
The findings add to the evidence linking policies rooted in structural racism to health disparities.
Research has shown redlined neighborhoods still disproportionately grapple with a multitude of health disparities, lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution.
The study found a racial disparity in where EMS stations are located, with fewer EMS stations in urban communities of color. Better tracking and accountability of EMS response times in communities could help address the issue, the researchers wrote.
Delays in emergency care are associated with higher mortality rates. For traumatic injuries, timely care is critical during what EMS professionals call the “golden hour,” or the first 60 minutes after an injury.
Other research has pointed to disparities in emergency response times. EMS response times for patients with cardiac arrest, for example, were 10% longer for low-income ZIP codes than high-income ZIP codes, according to a national study published in JAMA Network Open in 2018.
The study received funding support from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

BURLINGTON — With shovels in the ground and hard hats on, officials chucked soil, throwing up clouds of dust at a construction site off North Avenue Thursday afternoon.
The event celebrated the groundbreaking of 100 Cambrian Way. Come next year, there will be 40 new, permanently affordable apartments in the mixed housing development at Cambrian Rise, in Burlington’s North End, built in partnership with Champlain Housing Trust and nonprofit developer Evernorth. 
The building will run mainly on solar and geothermal power and will not rely on energy generated from fossil fuels, according to Eric Schmitt, CEO of Evernorth.

“But we’re not only delivering on climate solutions,” he said. “100 Cambrian will be a long-term asset to the city. It means that these homes will give families the stability to raise their children here and know that this housing will still be affordable for their children and their grandchildren.”
The new building will be the third to offer affordable housing at the site. Ten apartments have been set aside for families with vouchers from the Burlington Housing Authority, which could help lift recipients out of homelessness. 
The trust and Evernorth completed the 72-unit Laurentide building there in 2019, and Cathedral Square’s Juniper House with 70 apartments for adults 55 and older opened in 2021. 
A fourth building planned — Shale Beach Condominiums — will add 30 permanently affordable condos through the Champlain Housing Trust’s shared equity program, offering homeownership at a fraction of current prices, Michael Monte, CEO of the housing trust, announced at the event.
“These 40 apartments will help people feel safe and secure in a home,” Monte said.

State Treasurer Mike Pieciak said housing is Vermont’s number one economic issue. He has heard from employers who fail to attract or retain talent because it is too expensive for people to rent or buy a home in Vermont, he said. It’s also a social issue, he added.
“The lack of housing is one of the leading drivers for homelessness,” Pieciak said, underscoring the importance of building more homes, particularly affordable ones, statewide. 
Apartment sizes at 100 Cambrian will vary and, on average, cost $1,325 for a one-bedroom, $1,530 for a two-bedroom and $1,840 for a three-bedroom apartment, according to a Champlain Housing Trust press release.

The $23.8 million project has been funded by 14 sources. A third of it came from federal and state tax credits through the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, $8.8 million came from state and federal funds committed by the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, $3 million came from the City of Burlington, and $1 million came from a donor that wanted to help the homelessness situation in the city, according to the release.
It is designed by Duncan Wisniewski Architecture. Wright and Morrissey are the general contractors. Eric Farrell is the master developer of the neighborhood, the release stated.
The new development is part of Burlington’s effort to build 7,200 new homes in 25 years, particularly affordable housing.
The event drew more than 50 partners, politicians and stakeholders to the site on a hot afternoon. 
“Ensuring our community has ample safe and affordable housing is a top priority for my administration,” Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said in the release.

Speakers also noted the opening of Fox Run — a similar climate-friendly 30-unit complex in Berlin on Wednesday. Built in partnership between Downstreet Housing and Development and Evernorth, it is the first new affordable development built in Berlin in a decade, MyNBC5 reported.
As the federal government pursues massive tax cuts, Vermont may receive more federal tax credits to support housing development, said Maura Collins, executive director of the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, which administers the federal tax credits.
Collins quoted a song from Hamilton which goes, “What is a legacy? It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.”
“Not all of us are going to be able to be here at the ribbon cutting, and not all of us are going to be able to see the dozens and dozens and dozens of families who live in this building to come,” she said. “But this is a legacy of the good work that is done by all of these organizations.”

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Board of Ethics voted unanimously Friday to make a job offer to its acting ethics administrator eight months after legislators took unprecedented steps to block his hiring. 
The ethics board made David Bordelon its top staff member on a temporary basis in December in order to appease state lawmakers. Legislators filed an unsuccessful lawsuit last fall to try to stop the board from picking a new administrator at that time, and Bordelon’s interim status was considered a compromise. 
Legislators were not objecting to Bordelon personally. The lawsuit was aimed at delaying any hiring until several board positions turned over to new appointees at the beginning of 2025.

When the ethics board hired Bordelon for the temporary position at the end of 2024, it was made up of appointees picked by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and members of the Louisiana Legislature in their previous terms of office. 

Legislators wanted the board to wait to select a permanent ethics administrator until appointees from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry and current-term lawmakers had been seated. 
A 2024 law change Landry pushed gave governors and lawmakers more influence over the new people seated on the ethics board.

Previously, governors and legislators’ ethics board appointees were required to be selected from a list provided by leaders of Louisiana’s private colleges and universities. Starting this year, Landry and legislators can now put who they want on the board without outside input.

The board that hired Bordelon this week includes members picked by Edwards and previous lawmakers as well as Landry and current legislators. 

Board chairman Jason Amato, appointed by Landry, has been impressed by Bordelon’s leadership. State government leaders and legislators have enjoyed working with Bordelon, he said. 
As the permanent ethics administrator, Bordelon will have to help the board navigate dozens of ethics and campaign finance law changes approved this year that loosen restrictions on government officials.
Criticism and scrutiny of the ethics board has skyrocketed since Landry took over as governor in 2024.
Landry has had a fraught relationship with the board for years after being reprimanded multiple times for ethical and campaign finance problems. Presently, the governor is negotiating with the board for charges he faces for not disclosing flights he took to Hawaii on a political donor’s private plane while attorney general. 
The ethics board investigates local and state government officials – everyone from the governor to small town employees – for allegations of corruption, conflicts of interest and campaign finance violations. It can fine and charge public servants with violating the state ethics code, though its ability to fully enforce those laws remains relatively weak.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

Gov. Tony Venhuizen. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden announced a potential $17 million deal Friday to acquire land for a new men’s prison in northeast Sioux Falls and trade away state-owned land 15 miles south of the city that was formerly chosen as a prison site.
The plan is subject to approval by the Legislature, which is scheduled to convene for a special session Sept. 23.
“South Dakota needs a new prison to keep our people safe, and we are moving forward with delivering a proposal that prioritizes safety and conservative fiscal stewardship,” Rhoden said in a news release.
If approved, the transaction could resolve a controversy over plans to replace the oldest parts of the antiquated and crowded state penitentiary in Sioux Falls.

The controversy dates to 2023 when the administration of then-Gov. Kristi Noem announced the selection of state-owned land in rural Lincoln County, sparking opposition and a lawsuit from neighboring landowners. The fight culminated last winter in the Legislature’s rejection of funding for a prison project at the Lincoln County site. That spurred the new governor, Rhoden, to appoint a Project Prison Reset task force.
The task force, led by Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, worked through the spring and summer considering prison plans and locations, ultimately endorsing a $650 million budget — including land acquisition — for a 1,500-bed facility on one of two large parcels of undeveloped land in the same area of northeast Sioux Falls. The area is bordered by Interstate 229, Benson Road and the Big Sioux River. Neither of the two site finalists encountered opposition similar to the backlash against the rural Lincoln County location.
Rhoden’s chosen site is along Benson Road, south of the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society and a National Guard facility, and north of Gage Brothers Concrete Products. Great Bear Ski Valley is across the Big Sioux River to the southeast. Venhuizen said in a Friday interview that the site is “a little bit better deal” and “a more regularly shaped parcel” that will better accommodate the state’s plans.
The property is owned by TCB LLC, which is registered to Patty Nohr of Sioux Falls. Under the terms of a purchase agreement, the state would pay TCB $12.5 million for its 148 acres of Sioux Falls land. The state would also transfer ownership of its 320 acres in rural Lincoln County — worth an estimated $4.5 million — to TCB, raising the total value of the deal to $17 million.
A fact sheet published by the Rhoden administration says the owner of land neighboring the Sioux Falls site has indicated a willingness to sell an additional 28.98 acres. Venhuizen said the state hasn’t decided whether to make an offer for that property.
“As the design progresses, we’ll ascertain whether that’s necessary or not,” he said.

When the state was planning to build on the rural Lincoln County site, the state was not required to follow county zoning, which was a point of contention in a lawsuit filed by neighboring landowners. Rhoden’s news release said the Lincoln County land will be privately owned and subject to county zoning if his plan is approved.
Prior to the Legislature’s rejection of the Lincoln County site, lawmakers had been budgeting money for several years in anticipation of a prison construction project. Rhoden anticipates having enough state funds to build the project without taking on any debt. The cost of land acquisition is $10 million less than the task force had conservatively estimated, Venhuizen added.
Questions remain, however, about how much of the money spent by the state on plans, site work and infrastructure agreements at the Lincoln County site is recoverable or transferable to the Sioux Falls location. The total amount of those expenditures is more than $50 million.
Venhuizen said the state will “put out a more specific breakdown about that in the next couple of weeks.”
“Quite a bit of it is transferable,” he said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/EM8A0469-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

ICE arrests and detentions rise steeply in Idaho

In the announcement, Little said he was activating up to 14 Idaho National Guard personnel to support ICE. Little said Idaho is providing clerical and administrative resources so that ICE can focus on law enforcement.
“As Commander in Chief, I am proud that the Idaho National Guard always stands ready to support our federal partners in any capacity that strengthens public safety and national security,” Little said in a written statement. “Our guardsmen are trained, disciplined, and committed to serving the people of Idaho and the nation.”
 Idaho governor shows support for Trump’s immigration policies

Friday’s announcement marks the latest effort by Little to support and align himself with the immigration policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.
In June, Little announced that the Idaho State Police was partnering with ICE to transport immigrants who are convicted of a crime and who do not have the legal authorization to be in the United States to ICE detention facilities for deportation. 
The first ICE transports under the new Idaho State Police partnership took place Thursday, Little announced.
On Thursday, the Idaho Statesman reported that Idaho State Police is partnering with ICE under the more aggressive “Task Force Model,” not the “Jail Enforcement Model” that Little’s office originally announced in June. The Task Force Model allows Idaho State Police to question people on the street about their immigration status and interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant, the Statesman reported. 
 ICE arrests have spiked in Idaho

There has been a significant increase in the number of ICE arrests in Idaho this year, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Compared to the same time period a year ago, ICE arrests in Idaho are up by 797% this year. That’s up from 41 arrests during the first half of 2024 to 368 arrests during the first half of this year, the Sun reported.

Idaho National Guard personnel are authorized to support ICE through Nov. 15, according to Little’s announcement. The Idaho National Guard personnel will be federally funded and remain under Little’s control while they work directly with local ICE offices, Little said.

(Mesa County Sheriff's Office)Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires have burned more than 100,000 acres in Colorado so far in 2025.
It’s already Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” currently extend across the majority of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least mid-August.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Three Colorado fires have burned at least 10,000 acres in 2025:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 58,714 acres with 0% containment as of Aug. 8. It’s believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, is also believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It has burned an estimated 14,518 as of Aug. 8, and is 0% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 49% contained and has burned an estimated 27,477 acres since it was started by lightning on July 10.

Parts of Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park also remained closed due to the South Rim Fire, which has burned over 4,000 acres in and around the park in Montrose County.
Gov. Jared Polis has issued disaster declarations for fires in Delta, Mesa, Montrose and Rio Blanco counties. On Aug. 6, he mobilized the Colorado National Guard to support firefighting efforts on the Lee and Elk fires.
Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm


















High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

By: Sara Wilson - Wednesday July 16, 2025 3:27 pm


















The Turner Gulch wildfire near Unaweep Canyon northeast of Gateway is burning about 14,000 acres as of Wednesday afternoon.
“This fire remains active and continues to make significant advances to the east as winds become aligned with the terrain. Fire officials are developing a strategy to protect values while providing for safety of firefighters and the public,” said a Wednesday afternoon update from the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1.
The fire was caused by lightning on July 10. Winds have stoked the blaze in recent days.

Andre Bauer suspended his challenge to U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham just one month after launching it.
Bauer announced his decision Friday on social media.
“This decision does not come lightly. I entered this race with a servant’s heart — believing that our nation needs leaders who are grounded in truth, integrity, and faith,” he wrote on X. “But I believe now, more than ever, that in order for us to truly move forward, we must stop tearing one another down with lies and division.”
He did not immediately return a call or text from the SC Daily Gazette.
When he announced his bid July 2, Bauer called South Carolina’s senior senator a “war monger and globalist.” He said he intended to campaign as the “real Trump guy,” saying it didn’t matter that President Donald Trump had already endorsed Graham.
On Friday, Graham responded by again pointing out that Trump “proudly endorsed” him.
“I wish Andre and his family well and appreciate his service to our state for many years,” he said in a statement that followed a link to Trump’s post in March on his social media platform Truth Social.
Bauer’s political career included terms as a state House member, state senator and two-term lieutenant governor. But he hasn’t held elected office since 2011, after losing a bid for governor, making him an unknown to many new voters in the state.
His decision not to challenge Graham leaves two Republicans in the race: Greenville businessman Mark Lynch and Paul Dans of Charleston, an author of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Graham’s campaign spokesperson said Bauer’s departure from the race means “it’s abundantly clear that the people of South Carolina and President Trump are united in their commitment to re-elect” Graham.

(Photo: David Davis, County Extension Director, N.C. Cooperative Extension)Multiple Hurricane Helene aid programs in North Carolina are clearing key bureaucratic hurdles, state officials said Friday, as thousands in the mountains await help for their homes and farms nearly one year after the storm.
A new state fund created to reimburse farmers for lost crops has received more than 7,000 applications. And Renew NC, the state’s home building and repair program, is one step closer to funding after a key agreement with federal officials this week.
State lawmakers created the crop reimbursement program as part of a March aid bill. It sets out $300 million to pay farmers for crops that were washed away or destroyed last year. Two-thirds of that money is for Helene-impacted farms, and the rest is for other storms in 2024.
Applications for the program closed in May. The Department of Agriculture received around 7,500 applications total when accounting for incomplete or duplicate ones, assistant commissioner Kaleb Rathbone told the governor’s committee on western recovery.
In the months since, officials have sought to verify all of those applications. Farms will be reimbursed for their losses based on a formula outlined in state law. Payment is expected “mid-summer,” according to the department’s website.
“We can’t send money out for a category until we’ve reviewed and calculated the payments, so that nobody gets left behind,” Rathbone said.
The vast majority of applications — around 6,400 — are for farms affected by storms other than Helene. Of the roughly 1,100 Helene-impacted applicants, 500 of them involve farm infrastructure damage.
Applications remain open through the end of the year, meanwhile, for the state’s primary homebuilding and repair program, Renew NC.
Many home repairs out west have already begun — paid for by a combination of homeowners’ own capital, FEMA’s individual assistance payments and philanthropic groups. But Renew NC will be the state’s biggest effort at restoring damaged homes, primarily for low-income families.
Thus far, only single-family housing is open to applications. The state has received 920 applications so far, said Matt Calabria, director of the governor’s recovery office. Around 350 of those have been deemed eligible and will now move into scheduled inspections.
State officials do not yet have access to the $1.4 billion in federal grant funds that will fuel the program. But they signed an agreement with federal officials this week, Calabria said, a key step toward unlocking the money. Other requirements remain, like environmental reviews, before the money is made available.
“We are on the precipice of a lot of work getting done,” Calabria said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-extension-helene.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Michigan’s U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar introduced legislation Thursday that would strip federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents of their qualified immunity protections, allowing individuals to sue agents who violate constitutional rights.
The Detroit Democrat’s bill, “Ending Qualified Immunity for ICE Agents Act,” comes amid growing concerns over what advocates describe as aggressive enforcement tactics by ICE, particularly in the wake of $170 billion being allocated to the agency with passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a sweeping GOP tax and spending measure endorsed by President Donald Trump. 
“Trump’s ICE is following a ‘deport now, ask questions later’ policy,” Thanedar said in a press release. “They are more interested in hitting quotas and racial profiling than they are in treating people with basic respect and dignity. We’ve seen ICE detain Americans with impunity and commit gross civil rights violations. Qualified Immunity protects them from being held accountable. No more. No one should be above the law, especially those entrusted with enforcing it.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects government officials from civil liability unless a plaintiff can prove that a “clearly established” statutory or constitutional right was violated.
Thanedar’s proposal would remove this defense specifically for ICE agents, regardless of whether they believed their actions were legal at the time.
“If an ICE agent violates the law, it only makes sense they are held accountable just like civilians,” Thanedar said. “With Trump allocating an additional $75 billion to ICE, it’s more important than ever that we demand strict oversight and accountability.”
The legislation arrives as reports continue to surface of ICE agents detaining individuals at locations including courthouses, schools, and places of worship, often while masked and without providing clear identification. 
While critics argue that the increased funding of the agency provided under the new law will embolden such tactics and prevent meaningful oversight, the measure is unlikely to gain much traction in the Republican-controlled U.S. House.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

The League’s ballot question committee, Save AR Democracy, will host a launch party for its petition drive from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. Aug. 26 at Southern Tail Brewing in Little Rock, according to the release.
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Arkansas attorney general certifies League of Women Voters ballot title 


In May, Attorney General Tim Griffin certified the ballot title for the League’s proposed constitutional amendment. The measure would prohibit state lawmakers from changing the Arkansas Constitution themselves and require that any new law affecting the initiative and referendum process must be approved by voters at the next general election.
Additionally, the amendment would permit only voters, not state lawmakers, to propose changes to Article 5, Section 1 of the state Constitution, the section that outlines the initiative and referendum process.
The Legislature would determine the name and title of referendums, and votes on a bill with an emergency clause (a provision that allows laws to become effective immediately) would have to occur at least 24 hours after the bill passes.

Griffin rejected the proposed amendment three times before certifying it. In his third rejection, he cited a new state law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level as his reason for denying certification. This was one of several policies related to direct democracy that drew public opposition during the 2025 legislative session before becoming law.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed a federal lawsuit in April alleging that eight such laws are unconstitutional. In July, a judge granted two ballot question committees, Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, permission to intervene in the case.  
Judge allows groups to intervene in lawsuit challenging Arkansas direct democracy laws

The committees sought to challenge additional laws not included in the original suit, including Act 602 of 2025, the law that prohibits initiative petitions from being written above an eighth-grade reading level according to the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula.
Protect AR Rights is a coalition of civic groups behind the Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment, which Griffin certified in July after previously rejecting it under Act 602. The group also filed its own complaint in the lawsuit against the slate of direct democracy laws, many of which put additional requirements on petition canvassers and signers.
Supporters of the new laws have said the requirements will help protect the integrity of the state’s initiative and referendum process.
Proposed constitutional amendments require 90,704 signatures from 50 counties to qualify for the ballot.

It’s the latest development in several years of litigation and back-and-forth over the Sevier Playa Potash Project, which would give Peak Minerals 124,000-acres of mineral rights. The proposal was originally approved by the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, in 2019. 
Potash is a trade name for minerals with potassium used in fertilizer, but also used to manufacture other products like soap, glass and synthetic rubber. It’s often found in the brines of terminal basin lakes, like the Sevier Lake, a mostly dry lakebed in Millard County. 
The project was initially approved under the first Trump administration in 2019, but in 2023 the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance sued to stop it, arguing the BLM did not analyze all the environmental impacts and failed to consider alternatives that would be less environmentally disruptive. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The BLM and SUWA then moved to jointly dismiss the lawsuit, after Peak Minerals submitted a revised mining plan. But the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning SUWA could re-file its complaint. 
In June, the BLM approved Peak Minerals’ new plan — and on Thursday, SUWA filed a lawsuit in federal court, arguing the approval did not consider all environmental harms, including impacts to groundwater, migratory birds, air quality and dark night skies. The group is also alleging the BLM violated federal law when it authorized the project through a Determination of NEPA Adequacy, which relies on existing environmental reviews rather than conducting a new, more lengthy analysis. 
“By failing to conduct the required environmental analysis for a project of this magnitude, BLM has rubber-stamped a decision to irreversibly alter the extremely wild and remote nature of Utah’s West Desert,” said Hanna Larsen, a staff attorney for SUWA, in a statement. “The impacts of turning Sevier Lake into an industrial zone will destroy important habitat for migratory birds, ruin incredibly dark night skies, and imperil groundwater resources for decades to come.”

The lawsuit asks the court to declare the project in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Peak Minerals said the project will bring economic benefits to the area, aligns with President Donald Trump’s executive order to ramp up mineral production, and offers a sustainable supply of domestically-produced potash. 
“Once up and running, it will help supply North America with much-needed potash while replacing imports that have large carbon footprints, doing so at the absolute lowest cost,” said Peak Minerals CEO Dean Pekeski, in a statement after the project was approved in June. 
Peak Minerals would dig trenches to expose the brine and collect water from precipitation and the Sevier River. The brine extracted from the Sevier Playa sediments would then be concentrated by solar evaporation, according to BLM documents, then sent to a processing facility to be refined.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-483904424-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

The RNC and the state GOP sued the state Board last year after it voted along party lines to allow UNC-Chapel Hill students to use their mobile UNC One cards as photo ID. 
University student and facility IDs, if the state Board approves them, are among the acceptable forms of photo identification voters can use at the polls. Many campuses have replaced physical cards with multipurpose digital IDs. UNC’s was the first digital university ID the state Board approved. 
A trial court last year sided with the state Board, but the state Appeals Court blocked use of the mobile IDs. Students weren’t allowed to use them for the 2024 election. 
As part of the agreement dismissing the lawsuit, the state Board agreed to not approve any more digital IDs unless the legislature passes a law allowing them. 
Democrats held a 3-2 majority on the elections board last year. Republicans now have a majority. 
Two Democrats who voted with the majority last year to allow the mobile IDs are still on the elections board. 
On Friday, they defended their 2024 votes.
“I think that the previous Board made the correct decision to allow that ID, but the Court of Appeals order disagrees and we are bound to obey that,” said Board member Siobhan Millen. “I think with the way technology is changing with digital IDs that this will not be the last word on this subject.”
Democrat Jeff Carmon agreed with Millen.”I know this is something we will see again as we move toward digital driver’s licenses and things of that nature,” he said.

supporting tribal sovereignty, equitable homeownership and generational wealth-building on Indian trust lands,"" the organization says. (Courtesy photo by Tammie Billey / Largo Photography)In tribal communities in the Southwestern United States, the path to owning a home can present obstacles, including a cultural taboo against selling a home; a lack of awareness that doing so is even an option; and the absence of guardrails in the event a real estate transaction goes sideways, says Christopher Billey, executive director of the Tribal Homeownership Coalition of the Southwest.
Billey and his organization’s Program Manager Melinda Williams are scheduled to meet with the interim legislative Indian Affairs Committee at its meeting in Taos on Aug. 14 to discuss removing barriers to tribal homeownership.
Their discussion, Billey told Source NM in an interview on Friday, will include a case study of the first-ever public sale of a home on land owned by the Navajo Nation, which happened in January in LeChee, Arizona and set a precedent for future real estate market development in reservation communities.
An estimated 30,000 homes need to be built on the Navajo Nation, according to the case study, and thousands of Navajo families are on waiting lists for homes. The nation spans New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.

Billey said most tribal leaders don’t understand homeownership because people living within the U.S. reservation system were historically not allowed to buy, trade or sell lands. Even though these transactions do happen today, they often rub up against a core traditional belief among Navajo, Pueblo and Apache tribal members that a home is the center of a family and shouldn’t be sold.
“You have the modern idea of homeownership, and then you’ve got the traditional side, which has been allowed to grow, and when these two ideas come together, people get upset,” he said. “I had a conversation with a Zuni council member who said: ‘We don’t normally do this, we don’t normally sell our homes. We give them to our kids and our grandkids.’”
Another topic Billey said he expects to discuss with the committee is building new homes. Jemez Pueblo and San Felipe Pueblo provide good examples of New Mexico tribes that are expanding housing availability, Billey said, by training their own workers to build housing.
“They’re doing new housing developments in their communities and are able to keep costs down,” he said.
Billey, a licensed realtor and citizen of the Navajo Nation, said in the next 10 years, as more tribal members learn they can sell their homes, he hopes state and tribal governments will enact reforms to protect buyers, sellers and contractors who build homes on reservations whenever the parties disagree.
For example, legislation is needed to allow a real estate transaction dispute to be resolved in either state or tribal court, because most tribal courts have no policies around real estate.
“Building on the reservation is very complicated and there’s a lot of risk involved, so it’s the time right now to start moving that needle,” he said. “This is the moment of change.”

Bob Hall, former director of the nonpartisan watchdog group Democracy North Carolina and a longtime campaign finance watchdog, filed a formal complaint Friday asking the State Board of Elections to rule that a $6,800 donation from lobbyist Harold Brubaker to Rep. Sarah Stevens’ judicial campaign violates state law.  
The complaint, submitted Friday, followed an NC Newsline story that highlighted a contribution from Brubaker, a longtime lobbyist and former House speaker. The story reported that Brubaker contributed to Stevens’ newly formed judicial campaign committee, “Stevens for Justice,” on June 23 while the General Assembly was still in session.

Hall is asking the Board to declare the contribution illegal and require Stevens to forfeit the money to the state’s Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund, which supports public education.  
“This statute applies whether or not the General Assembly is in regular session,” Hall wrote. “It was also upheld by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals as a reasonable restriction to address possible corruption.”  
North Carolina law prohibits registered lobbyists from contributing to sitting legislators’ campaign regardless of the office the legislator is seeking, and also bars lawmakers from soliciting or accepting such donations. 
“Rather than focus on the office being sought, the statute focuses on the person’s status when the contribution is made — is that person a legislator or not?” Hall wrote. “Put simply, it prohibits any state-regulated contribution from a lobbyist to any candidate campaign committee when the candidate is a member of the General Assembly.”  
Stevens, a Republican from Surry County who chairs the House Election Law and Campaign Finance Reform Committee, converted her legislative committee into a Supreme Court campaign earlier this year. Her race is expected to be among the most closely watched in 2026.

Neither Stevens nor Brubaker have disputed that the contribution occurred. In comments to NC Newsline prior to the complaint, both maintained the donation was legal because it was designated for a judicial campaign, not a legislative one.  
But Hall’s complaint argues that interpretation misreads the law. It also cites a separate $1,500 contribution made in June by lobbyist Andy Munn to Stevens’ judicial campaign, calling for similar forfeiture.  
Hall acknowledged in his letter that both Stevens and Brubaker likely believed the contribution was allowed. “They did not intend to break state law,” he wrote. “However, I believe the contribution should be declared illegal and forfeited, as well as any others from registered lobbyists from early May into August.” 
The complaint underscores confusion that may stem from a wave of lobbyist donations made to then Speaker Tim Moore’s congressional campaign last year. Those contributions were not subject to state restrictions because they went to a federal race. Brubaker, for example, donated the federal maximum of $6,600 to Moore’s 2024 campaign.  
The State Board of Elections has not yet announced whether it will investigate Hall’s complaint. All campaign finance investigations are confidential, according to the Board of Election’s website.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4651-2048x1031-1-1024x516.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

Gavin Newsom when he is termed out next year.,"In summary
Kounalakis was trailing in polling and fundraising in a crowded field of Democrats seeking to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom when he is termed out next year.


Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, the first boldfaced name to jump into the 2026 governor’s race more than two years ago, has dropped out and will run for state treasurer instead.
“At this moment, I believe I can make the greatest impact by focusing on California’s financial future,” she said in a statement Friday. “As State Treasurer, I will bring a deep commitment to fiscal responsibility, economic opportunity, and strategic investment in our state’s priorities — from affordable housing and clean energy to infrastructure and education.”
Her decision comes at an odd moment in the campaign for California’s top office. Just last week, former Vice President Kamala Harris announced that she would not run for governor next year, seemingly cracking the unsettled race wide open ahead of the June primary. That same day, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unofficially endorsed Kounalakis in a television interview.
But Kounalakis, who has served as lieutenant governor since 2019, had been sputtering in a crowded field of prominent but low-wattage Democrats. They also include former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former state Controller Betty Yee, former state Senate leader Toni Atkins, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and timeshare magnate Stephen Cloobeck.
A poll released Friday by Emerson College found Kounalakis running sixth, with only 3% support — behind the Los Angeles billionaire developer Rick Caruso, who has not even entered the race.
And despite significant personal wealth from her background as a real estate developer, Kounalakis struggled to fundraise for a campaign that could ultimately cost tens of millions of dollars to win. She recently reported raising only about $100,000 in the first six months of the year.
In her announcement, Kounalakis emphasized her experience developing housing and said addressing affordability would be a focus for her if she wins the treasurer’s office.
“I will ensure that we efficiently leverage every dollar at our disposal to increase housing production,” she said in a statement. “This work is critical and I am prepared for the challenge.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/091922-ELENI-KOUNALAKIS-MHN-06-CM-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

Dialogue but no decision
Lawmakers considered but didn’t pass a major package, SB 7030, this session to address school choice scholarships, including how and when payments should be distributed to schools and families.
In the early days of the 105-day session, school administrators voiced concerns that state money meant to follow students to their schools of choice was at times getting lost, and the state was losing track of where students were enrolled.
At the time of the bill’s presentation, sponsor Sen. Don Gaetz said that at any given time the state cannot locate 23,000 students.
Hendry County Superintendent Mike Swindle told a legislative committee that if the state maintained a universal system to track students’ locations at any snapshot in time, that would “cut out a lot of the forecasting, cut out a lot of voodoo math, if you will, that really creates quite a conundrum for all of us.”
Polk County Superintendent Frederick Heid during the same meeting said, citing a district analysis, that 750 students claiming a school choice scholarship were also taking at least one class at Polk County public schools, resulting in $1.3 million, or 30 teachers’ salaries worth, of funding that is not reaching the school. 
“Fluctuation in funding can affect the continuity of our programs and services offered to students,” Heid said.

Many emergency service providers, in Vermont and across the U.S., work on a volunteer basis or are severely undercompensated, especially those that serve rural areas. “Rescue squads rescue people. We descend from New England Minutemen and town militia, taking pride in public service,” writes Aiken.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Author Aiken’s novels ech[...]","Vermont Author I.M. Aiken can’t stop writing about Vermont and Vermonters. The Little Ambulance War of Winchester County (Flare Books, 2024) stars enigmatic EMT/Paramedic Alex Flynn and explores the psychological toll of responding to 911 calls. In Stolen Mountain (forthcoming 2025, Flare Books), Alex’s mentee Brighid Doran takes over the narrative, turning sleuth to fight crooked ski lodge developers, while continuing to respond to rescue calls. In the ongoing Trowbridge Dispatch series of short stories that focus on the characters’ emotional journeys, set in the fictional town of Trowbridge, Vermont, members of the rescue team take turns narrating their experiences, with results that veer from the tragic (“The Joker”; Flare Books, 2025) to the absurd (“The Curious”; Flare Books, 2025) to the hilarious (“First Corn”; Flare Books, 2025).
Since her main characters are EMS personnel, Aiken’s novels focus on our present health care crisis. The fictional rescue team follows the tiny dramas of emergency calls. While the plights of those in need of medical care are exposed, the focus is on the struggles of these unsung heroes who brave poor conditions, outdated equipment, and bureaucracy to answer their community’s calls for help, in the process putting their own physical and mental health at risk. 
Many emergency service providers, in Vermont and across the US, work on a volunteer basis or are severely undercompensated, especially those that serve rural areas, as noted in a recent video from Vox. Others face disjointed, fractured workplace cultures. This lack of compensation and lack of supportive culture only adds to the trauma, as rescue workers must sometimes leave paid work to serve their communities, only to be demoralized on the job, which makes it all the more difficult to perform their service and maintain their own physical and mental health. 
Thanks to the efforts of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, and others, these issues are front and center today. For instance, the Emergency Service Provider (ESP) Wellness Commission, a 25-person commission, was established in May 2021 “support/aid to all of Vermont’s emergency service providers.” In their 2024 report, the Commission prioritizes ESP wellness conferences and mental health and well-being training; increases awareness of and participation in peer support groups; and has expanded the Worker’s Compensation PTSD presumption laws to include all emergency support personnel sectors. 
While much still needs to be done, and we still need to draw national attention to the crisis in rural health care that we have experienced for years and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future, we can be grateful for the tireless efforts of volunteer EMS and politicians who are working to draw attention to the problem.
We asked Aiken for some background about her work with a couple of candid questions:
Q: Most of your characters take on the role of rescuer. What can you tell us about the theme of rescue in your book?
A: My novels explore my own life. I spent a lot of it as an EMT, firefighter, medic, and crisis manager. I hopped on an inner city ambulance at 20, flew to Baghdad for a year when I was 40, and, after crossing 50, I recognized the impact my decisions had made on me. I have faced sleep troubles, social issues, anxiety, a zealous startle response, and other symptoms that I carry through my days and nights. Laying down at night, I feel underappreciated as I tend to remember the hostilities and trauma of my daily work. In The Little Ambulance War of Winchester County, I asked, “What happens if you are not the hero of your own story?” You spend your life in public service. You’ve saved lives and made a few terrible situations slightly less terrible. You/me/rescuer steps into the spaces most run from. It changes us, sharpens us, tunes us for trouble. It then becomes difficult to turn that off—ever. To this day, I carry a tourniquet, medical gloves, and a trauma dressing everywhere I go. I think I’d like to put that down now. I can’t figure out how to let go.
If rescuers and public servants feel heard, seen, or represented in my books, then I’ve done my job. I am asking readers to understand the sacrifices that we, rescuers, choose to make, the actions we completed, and how this costs us as we age.
Q: The image of a fireman frozen on a ladder in your short story “The Fireman’s Statue” (Flare Books, 2025) is stunning. Where did this image come from? What do you hope readers come away with from this story? 
A: I was there. In this story, a volunteer firefighter climbed a ladder just after midnight on a freezing New Year’s Eve. He anchored himself outside the second story, holding a hose that he used to dowse the upstairs’ rooms. He froze in place and never yielded his duty. I respected him that night while recognizing that this fellow was hated by many and loved by few. Our communities depend on these people and many of us fail to recognize the dedication of people like him.
Recently, one of the kids we raised is still working on ambulances as a medic and volunteers on a rural fire company. Every day, our public service agencies struggle to keep volunteers. The agencies also struggle with unhealthy human dynamics: members hating on each other, meanness, jealousy, pettiness. In a way, the work culture around emergency services destroys these same teams that communities ask to respond to 911 calls.

(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone is criticizing Republican colleague Rep. Jeff Van Drew over a congressional plan to gut federal funding for beach replenishment, with Pallone saying Van Drew is not doing enough to save the funds from being cut.
“This is coming from the Trump administration, it’s coming from the Republicans in Congress, and now you see somebody like Jeff Van Drew saying, ‘Oh, it’s not really a problem,” said Pallone in an interview Thursday. “Well, of course it’s a problem.” 
Asked to respond, Rep. Van Drew said he’ll “always” protect the Jersey Shore, and pointed to millions included in the current federal budget for dredging and resiliency projects along the coastline.
“I’ve been working closely with our towns, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the administration to ensure that beach replenishment projects along our coast are fully funded … and we fully expect that to happen,” Van Drew said in a statement to the New Jersey Monitor.
At the center of this battle is a GOP-backed appropriations measure in Congress that would slash funding for the U.S. Army Corps’ beach replenishment projects from the typical $200 million down to $60 million in the new federal fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The proposed cuts would jeopardize projects in Avalon, Beach Haven, and Stone Harbor.
While the Army Corps typically funds projects with some help from local and state money, small Jersey Shore towns can’t foot the bill alone, Pallone said. He noted that towns have to abide by strict requirements and show a cost-benefit analysis to be approved for the projects that, ultimately, save towns money when storms hit. 
“It’s going to cost you more money, because these are only done when you can show that, in fact, it saves money,” he said. “So if you said, ‘No, we’re not going to do it,’ and there’s no resiliency, it’s going to cost more.”
Pallone said the measure, which was voted out of committee but hasn’t received a full House vote yet, would be the first time in nearly three decades that there isn’t enough federal funding to pay for beach replenishment.
Pallone and Van Drew both represent Jersey Shore towns, Pallone in Central Jersey and Van Drew in South Jersey.
Van Drew cited past federal funds he’s brought to his 2nd District for seawalls, living shorelines, beach replenishments, and coastal resilience projects. 
“For five years running, we have been number one when it comes to delivering grants and funding. That hasn’t changed — regardless of whether we’ve had a blue or red administration or whether we’ve been in the majority or the minority in the House,” he said. “Hard work has always gotten the job done. Our record speaks for itself.”
Pallone suggested the cuts are politically motivated to hurt New Jersey because it is run by Democrats. 
“There’s never been this phenomenon where it’s essentially down to zero, and we’re going to continue to fight it,” said Pallone. “I just am disappointed with Van Drew because he suggested that this isn’t happening, and in fact, it is happening. It’s very clear.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Heminghaus_Deal-Beach-Replenishment_20220106_0001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

April 23, 2025. (Courtesy of the University of Nebraska at Kearney)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska will offer a buyout program for eligible tenured faculty this fall as the NU system and individual campuses seek to shore up multi-million-dollar budget gaps.
NU President Jeffrey Gold, announcing the “Voluntary Separation Incentive Program,” or VSIP, on Friday, said it is part of ongoing efforts to position NU “for long-term strength and financial sustainability.” Tenured faculty who are at least 62 years old and have at least 10 years of service with NU by the time of separation in 2026 will be eligible. 
Eligible faculty could receive a lump sum payment of 70% of one year of the annual base salary they are paid as of Oct. 1.
Applications open Sept. 1 and will be accepted by 5 p.m. on Sept. 30. NU intends to allow as many eligible faculty to participate as possible, but campus chancellors, who will review the applications, reserve the right to limit participation. 
Faculty who accept the payment would be ineligible to be rehired at NU during the payout year. Awardees will be notified by Nov. 3. Payments would be made next summer.
“While the VSIP is available only to qualifying faculty members, the program reflects a broader commitment to thoughtful planning and stewardship — work that benefits from the talent and contributions of our entire university community,” Gold said in a statement.
This is the fourth buyout program NU has offered since 2010, the others in 2014 and 2019.
NU is working to close a $20 million budget gap by the end of this fiscal year. Campus leaders will contribute while also trying to close separate campus-specific shortfalls.
  UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett. Sept. 5, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
For instance, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett this week announced that UNL will implement a plan to cut $27.5 million from its budget by the end of this calendar year. He hopes to have a plan finalized by late October to present to Gold. Bennett had said revenue growth has not kept up with costs and had said a buyout program would likely be offered.
The most recent shortfalls follow a series of recent budget cuts for NU and have been made more difficult partly by the slowing of state funding support under Gov. Jim Pillen, who served as an NU regent for 10 years before becoming governor in 2023, and as NU and its campuses face inflation and cuts to federal funding.
Pillen initially suggested cutting NU’s state-aided budget by 2% when deliberations began in January for the state’s 2025-27 budget. The Legislature’s budget-writing Appropriations Committee initially approved the cuts. However, federal reductions, in part, led lawmakers to reconsider and accept the result of negotiations between Pillen and Gold.
In the end, state lawmakers approved sending 0.625% more state dollars to NU this fiscal year, up to roughly $700 million, and another 0.625% more state dollars over the new baseline to NU the following fiscal year.
The NU Board of Regents voted 6-2 in June to approve NU’s $1.1 billion operating budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year, which included a 5% tuition increase. The budget-balancing was complicated due to negotiations for faculty and staff salaries. Many staff will not receive pay increases this year, Gold has announced.
Bennett said Monday that the UNL process will include an “intentional review” of academic programs for elimination or mergers to “capitalize on UNL’s existing strengths.” His executive leadership team has proposed teaching and research metrics to evaluate such programs.
Bennett, in a statement, said, “Our goal is for UNL to emerge from this current process a more streamlined, efficient university that retains the profile and impact of a comprehensive, Big Ten, land-grant, research university, continue its significant return of investment for the state of Nebraska and its taxpayers and position us to move forward toward aspirational goals, including being considered for readmission to the AAU [Association of American Universities].”
Gold said he knows some faculty might be considering retirement and that the buyout plan offers a “meaningful pathway” for some of the senior-most faculty, many of whom he said have played a “significant role” in advancing NU’s mission.
“Thank you for your continued service to the University of Nebraska and for your commitment to our mission,” Gold said Friday. “Together, we are building a stronger, more resilient university — one prepared to meet the challenges of today and create an extraordinary future for Nebraska.”

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Democrats in North Carolina’s congressional delegation criticized the Environmental Protection Agency’s decision on Thursday to cut a grant program that would take away more than $156 million from solar projects in the state.
Solar for All, a Biden-era initiative, awarded $7 billion in grants nationally to 60 recipients including states, tribes, and regions. The funds contributed to solar projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.
It’s part of the Trump administration’s push away from cleaner energy, following additional cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Democratic Reps. Don Davis (NC-01), Deborah Ross (NC-02), Valerie Foushee (NC-04), and Alma Adams (NC-12) wrote a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin asking him to reconsider and ultimately reverse the termination.
“At a time when energy costs and demand are both rapidly increasing, it is concerning that your agency is considering an action that may violate federal law — Congress has already appropriated the funding — and would increase household energy costs for millions of Americans while jeopardizing thousands of jobs across a wide cross section of states,” the members wrote.
The four representatives also wrote that the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality and its coalition partners — the NC Clean Energy Fund, the NC Clean Energy Technology Center, and Advanced Energy — have an award agreement with the EPA to assist with designing and implementing the state’s Solar for All program.
Zeldin posted a video online denouncing the program and saying the cuts would benefit American taxpayers.
“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” he said.
A federal judge ruled in April that the EPA cannot freeze contracts awarded to nonprofits under the Biden administration, States Newsroom previously reported.
That decision could set an example for potential lawsuits due to stare decisis — the legal principle of following precedent in court.
Michelle “Meech” Carter, clean energy campaigns director at the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, said the program supported at least 12,000 North Carolina households through solar installations and enabled upgrades like repairs and replacements.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, some individuals and households in western North Carolina were without power for days, weeks, and even months.
“Folks in the west desperately need to be more independent with their energy sources,” Carter said. “Installing solar on our most vulnerable homes is what’s going to help us achieve energy independence and support our communities that were affected by disasters.”
Carter described the termination as a “consistent removal of any backstops” for people trying to lower their energy bills or protect themselves from disasters.
David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the program created jobs and lowered residential power bills for families.
“It’s making North Carolina more resilient as it recovers from Hurricane Helene, which emphasized the importance for families to have the choice to power their own homes,” Neal wrote in a statement. “The entire state has a lot to lose if Solar for All is stripped away.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/solarwind2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

Eight years ago, an H-2A farmworker died after experiencing headaches on the job at Sarbanand. (Finn Wendt/Cascadia Daily News)This article was first published by Cascadia Daily News.
Amid the largest mass deportation in U.S. history, the Trump administration is looking for ways to maintain an agricultural workforce. One option is expanding the H-2A visa program, which is supposed to give farmers another legal way to hire workers in the face of a labor shortage — something the agricultural industry has reportedly faced for years.
However, it isn’t a popular option in Whatcom and Skagit counties. Here, the number of H-2A workers has decreased in the past decade, not increased, as most of the state has seen.
The reduction of H-2A workers in the two counties began after a fatality eight years ago at a blueberry farm in Sumas. This is likely due to strong union presence in the area, where farmworker activists have long claimed the H-2A program lacks wage, health and safety protections. Others in the farming community also attribute the drop-off to union activism, but claim that activism has demonized farms in the area that employ H-2A workers.
Rosalinda Guillén, a longtime farmworker and activist, has fought to protect farmworkers for decades. Federal actions since January have been “more intense than we thought,” Guillén said.
“I mean, the first three months of this year were horrible, with the detentions and deportations of farmworkers,” she said, “but what we need to do is look forward at structural change.”
 A death strikes change 

In August 2017, wildfires tore through the Cascades and turned the skies hazy with smoke. At Sarbanand Farms in Sumas, as temperatures rose and air quality worsened, hundreds of H-2A workers still pressed on picking blueberries.
Honesto Silva Ibarra, a 28-year-old father and H-2A worker from Mexico, started getting headaches on the job. There are conflicting reports of what happened next: One of Ibarra’s colleagues said that Ibarra was made to keep working after complaining of his headaches and eventually collapsed. Sarbanand said Ibarra simply returned to his living quarters.
On Aug. 6, Ibarra died at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. Ibarra was a diabetic, and in a subsequent investigation, the Washington Department of Labor & Industries ruled he died of natural causes. Sarbanand was not deemed responsible.
L&I did fine Sarbanand $73,000 after finding that employees were frequently denied work breaks or fed meals later than promised. In June that year, the fine was cut in half.
More than 70 Sarbanand workers went on strike in protest of Ibarra’s treatment. After learning of his death, those workers and many supporters marched in protest of their employer. The protesting workers were all fired.
The number of H-2A workers, who are given a visa to work for a specific U.S. farm for a designated amount of time, more than doubled between 2017 and 2022 across Washington. Whatcom County saw the opposite trend, dramatically dropping from 690 to 78 in the same time span.
Dillon Honcoop, communications director of Whatcom Family Farmers, said that drop was a result of the fallout after Ibarra’s death. Sarbanand, which employed 519 H-2A workers in 2017, mechanized its operations after that year “because that farm had been so targeted by local activist groups despite the fact that they were not to blame,” Honcoop said.
Honcoop said that H-2A workers remain less common in western Washington than in other parts of the state, in large part because the farm work is less labor-intensive.
 Farmworkers unions 

Whatcom and Skagit counties are unique compared to other agricultural areas in Washington because of a strong local farmworker union: Familias Unidas por la Justicia, which has more than 500 members.
Familias Unidas formed in 2013 to fight for worker protection at Sakuma Brothers Berry Farms in Burlington and came to a collective bargaining agreement after four years. United Farm Workers, a longstanding union that spans multiple states, has chapters in other areas of Washington. But Familias Unidas is the only independent union led by local farmworkers.
Familias Unidas helped organize H-2A workers who protested against Sarbanand in the wake of Ibarra’s death. Along with Community to Community, the union has been speaking out against the H-2A program since.
H-2A farmworkers do not have collective bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act, and employers do not need to “recognize labor organizations” or “engage in any collective bargaining activities.” That makes H-2A workers more vulnerable to wage theft or other abuses, such as inadequate housing or hour violations.
“These are contracted workers imported from Mexico and other South American countries that are brought in here with a visa specifically to work under one specific employer,” Guillén explained.
“So they’re in company housing, no transportation, with a visa for just that farm. And if there’s no rules for safety that can be enforced or monitored, the employer can do whatever they want. It’s like a quasi-slave labor force,” she continued.
C2C and Familias Unidas have successfully advocated for L&I to enforce heat protections for farmworkers, create oversight for workers with H-2A visas and ensure that H-2A workers are being paid competitive wages.
Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, who was detained by ICE in March and chose to voluntarily depart to Mexico on July 14, was a central voice in fighting for those protections. Guillén has repeatedly spoken out about believing that ICE intentionally targeted Lelo for doing such advocacy work.
In 2024, under the Biden administration, the Department of Labor passed a rule to improve protections for H-2A farmworkers. Included in the rule was protection from retaliation by their employers when attempting to unionize. But this June, the DOL suspended enforcement of that rule due to several federal injunctions, it said.
Now, Guillén worries that protections for all farmworkers could be stripped away, while the number of H-2A workers in the counties could grow.
 The future of farmwork 

Though the Trump administration has loudly proclaimed it wants a 100% American workforce, that’s something that Guillén said is unlikely, if not impossible.
“The reality is that there are no local people that can go out and harvest berries right now that are not Latino and Indigenous workers. They just won’t do it. And you know what? They won’t do it because it doesn’t pay enough,” she said.
“And I’ll tell you, the farmers don’t even want to hire them, because they don’t have the skills to pick the berries at the speed of [current] workers,” she continued.
In May, Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse reintroduced a bipartisan bill meant to “stabilize the agricultural workforce”: the Farm Workforce Modernization Act.
The Act aims to streamline the H-2A visa process to expand the number of H-2A workers who are hired, and cap wage fluctuations for up to nine years, meaning H-2A wages could stay low. At the same time, the Act would also require all farmers to enroll in a program to E-Verify the citizenship status of their hired workers, pushing growers not to employ undocumented residents.
The Act also would create a new “Certified Agricultural Worker” status for some undocumented workers, allowing them to legally stay in the U.S. for five and a half years as long as they continue working in agriculture. Certified Agricultural Workers could also eventually qualify for permanent residency, upon good recommendations from their employers.
United Farm Workers has publicly supported the bill, though they opposed capping H-2A wages. But Guillén opposes the bill entirely, saying that giving employers a say in their workers’ qualifications for citizenship makes workers less able to speak out against their employers or seek protections.
Instead of temporary protections, Guillén hopes to see more pathways to permanent residency and citizenship that aren’t tied to a person’s labor.
“We have to survive, yeah, but you can’t just do that. There’s gotta be a strategy for taking advantage of opportunities for the long haul, like, what is our future?” Guillén said.
“We’re not going to be victims. We have to do more than survive.”

More than 60% of Idaho is federal public land. (Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)A Republican state senator from Nampa said he will introduce a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution that would prevent the state of Idaho from selling any future public lands granted or obtained from the federal government. 
Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, said he will introduce the proposed constitutional amendment at the beginning of the 2026 session of the Idaho Legislature, which begins in January.
He hopes the amendment will go before voters in the November 2026 general election. 
“The idea of selling public land really didn’t sit well with me,” Adams said in a phone interview Friday morning. “I have young kids and we like to hike and we like to fish, and our public lands here in Idaho have so many amazing places to do all of those things. Selling it off is just not an option in my mind.”

Access to public lands became a flashpoint this year after U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced an unsuccessful proposal in Congress that would have allowed millions of acres of public land, including in Idaho, to be sold off to the highest bidder. 
Lee ultimately removed his public lands sell off proposal from an earlier version of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” following a public backlash that included opposition from within the Republican Party by U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch and U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, all R-Idaho.
 How would the proposed public lands amendment in Idaho work?

If the amendment passes, it would create a new land trust and all future new public lands granted by or acquired from the federal government would be placed into that trust, Adams said.

The amendment would not change anything for the roughly 2.5 million acres of state endowment land Idaho already has, Adams said. Under the Idaho Constitution, existing state endowment lands are managed to secure the “maximum long term financial return” to the state and beneficiaries, which means the land can be sold. That’s not changing. 
Instead, the new amendment would apply to all new and future public lands that would be placed into a new trust created by the amendment. That land could not be sold. 
“In this new land trust, there is no provision for maximum financial return,” Adams said. 
Instead, those new lands would be managed to allow for multiple uses, including recreation, timber harvest and grazing. Adams said revenue raised by grazing and timber harvest would support rural schools in communities that are surrounded by public lands and have a smaller property tax base. 
As for the specifics of the amendment, Adams said he will unveil the text of the proposed constitutional amendment during a free, public kickoff event at noon on Aug. 15 at the Pine Cafe in the small mountain town of Pine, which is located in Elmore County and situated along the South Fork of the Boise River. 
Adams picked the spot because he enjoys fishing in the area and Pine is surrounded by public lands, which guests will drive through and experience on their way to the kickoff event.
Adams, a retired U.S. Marine Corps sergeant who saw two combat tours in Afghanistan, said Idahoans have many different reasons for enjoying public lands.
“It’s where I healed when I came back from deploying overseas,” Adams said. “It’s wide-open and you can be all alone. On public lands every man is a king, and it is the only place in the world you can do that. It’s because it belongs to you, and it belongs to all of us.”
 What is the process for amending Idaho’s constitution?

To pass, the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution must receive at least a two-thirds supermajority of support from both the Idaho Senate and the Idaho House of Representatives.

If that happens, the amendment would go before voters in the November 2026 general election, where it would require a simple majority vote to pass. 
Although there is a high bar for amending the Idaho Constitution, Adams said support for public land crosses political lines and he is confident the amendment will receive the two-thirds support in both chambers of the Idaho Legislature.
“It’s a huge issue given the times we are living in, and it’s good to fight for something we all agree on,” Adams said. 
 Public lands have near universal public support in Idaho

More than 60% of all land in Idaho is public land of some form, including U.S. Forest Service land and Bureau of Land Management land.
Public land, where Idahoans and visitors enjoy hunting, hiking, fishing, camping, snowmobiling, bird and wildlife watching, climbing, skiing and more, is extremely popular with Idaho voters. 
In the wake of this year’s proposed public lands sell off, a poll sponsored by Conservation Voters for Idaho found that 96% of all registered voters in Idaho believe public lands should stay in public hands, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Adams told the Sun he began working on his proposed amendment at the end of this year’s legislative session. 
“At that point this idea had legs, but once Sen. Lee proposed selling off millions of acres of public lands, it gave this idea wings and I knew this was the right time to put it out,” Adams said.

(Photo by Lauren Bishop/U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Rhode Island’s second case of West Nile Virus this year was found in a mosquito sample collected in Bristol, state health and environment officials said Thursday.  
A mosquito sample collected on July 28 by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management later tested positive for West Nile Virus at the state laboratory in Providence. 
The first mosquito sample to test positive this year was found on July 21 in East Providence.
A spokesperson with Environmental Management confirmed in an email Friday that the positive sample came from a testing group of 50 Culex pipiens, also known as the common house mosquito. This is the first mosquito sample to test positive this year for West Nile in Bristol, where over nine weeks of sampling the department has collected 1,785 adult female mosquitoes 
The mosquitos in the sample did not test positive for other diseases like Eastern Equine Encephalitis or Jamestown Canyon Virus. So far, West Nile Virus is the only mosquito-associated illness to appear in Rhode Island this year.
West Nile Virus is the most common mosquito-borne illness in the U.S. Most people who contract the virus are asymptomatic, but about 1 in 5 people develop West Nile fever, which can cause headaches, body aches, and other flu-like symptoms.
A minority of West Nile Virus cases can lead to serious neuroinvasive illnesses like encephalitis or meningitis. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 10% of those severe cases are fatal, usually in people over age 60 or those with weakened immune systems.
Preliminary CDC data for 2025 has recorded 140 West Nile Virus cases nationwide as of Aug. 5, with 82 of those cases involving neuroinvasive illness. The CDC notes that because the national database uses data reported by counties, West Nile cases are often undercounted. People who don’t develop neuroinvasive illness are less likely to be reported, which can skew the data toward more severe cases.
CDC recorded 60,992 West Nile Virus cases in humans, with 3,134 deaths, between 1999 and 2024. 
Rhode Island health officials remind residents to protect themselves against bites by wearing insect repellent, long sleeves, and pants, especially when mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk. Removing stagnant water from yards and outdoor areas reduces the number of places where mosquitoes can breed, and repairing holes in window or door screens can stop mosquitoes from entering the home.
Weekly mosquito testing data is posted to the Rhode Island Department of Health’s website. Additional prevention tips and resources are available at health.ri.gov/mosquito and dem.ri.gov/mosquito.

(Stock photo via Getty Images)A convicted child-killer serving a life sentence in an Iowa prison is suing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, insisting that he be deported to Mexico for having come to the United States illegally in the 1990s.
The lawsuit, filed Thursday by prison inmate Juan Ledesma, seeks a court order that will force Homeland Security agents “to come to Anamosa State Penitentiary and take custody” of Ledesma and send him back to Mexico, his country of origin.
In August 1997, Ledesma was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Karen Jasmen Orozco, an infant who lived with her mother, Mirta Medina, and Ledesma in their western Iowa home. Court testimony indicated Ledesma was home alone with the child on Jan. 28, 1997, while Medina was out looking for a job. When Medina arrived home, she found the child vomiting and having seizures in her crib.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ledesma, who worked a night shift at a meatpacking plant, allegedly told authorities he didn’t intend to hurt the child, but she kept waking him as he tried to sleep.
Iowa’s state medical examiner at the time, Thomas Bennett, attributed the child’s subsequent death to shaken baby syndrome, although the defense’s medical expert, Dr. John Plunkett, testified at Ledesma’s criminal trial that the death could have been caused by a 3-foot fall that may have occurred several days prior to the child’s death.
Ledesma was convicted of first-degree murder, child endangerment, neglect of a dependent individual and assault causing serious and willful injury. He was later sentenced to life in prison.
Court records indicate that over the past 28 years, Ledesma has filed at least five applications for post-conviction relief, most recently in 2023, and that all of the applications have been denied.
Lawsuit cites Trump’s executive order 
Ledesma, 52, is now suing the U.S. Department of Justice, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit argues that ICE and Homeland Security have a “duty” to deport him in compliance with directives from President Donald Trump to deport all “illegal aliens.”
In his lawsuit, Ledesma claims he is a “national of the country of Mexico and is an illegal alien,” having come to the United States illegally in 1994. He claims that sometime after being convicted of murder, he was sent to the Anamosa State Penitentiary, where he was visited by ICE agents and signed voluntary deportation documents that remain on file with ICE.
The lawsuit notes that on Jan. 20, 2025, Trump took office and signed an executive order directing Homeland Security and other agencies to pursue the “efficient and expedited removal of aliens from the United States.” The order, the lawsuit argues, requires the removal of “all criminal aliens located in the United States.”










I am not excusing my terrible behavior just because of my youth. No! I take complete responsibility for my own actions.


– Juan Ledesma in a 2019 letter to a prosecutor


Ledesma also argues that he has been declared a “burden to the American taxpayers by the Trump administration,” and that his ongoing health problems are only going to increase the financial burden associated with his continued incarceration.
“By returning the petitioner back to his country of origin, costs to American taxpayers can be focused on lawful citizens,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that Ledesma “has the right to be deported from the United States under federal law and not be further detained without due process.”
Ledesma is representing himself in the case. The federal government has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
Ledesma expressed regret in 2019 
Court records show that in January 2019, Ledesma wrote to the Woodbury County prosecutor who handled his case, asking for her assistance, including a letter of recommendation, in his efforts to obtain a commutation of his life sentence.
In his letter, Ledesma wrote: “I want you to know from the bottom of my heart the great sorrow that I feel for the innocent life that I took due to my terrible actions. Sadly, when I was young and stupid, I let my bad temper and emotions take control over me.”
In his letter, Ledesma said that during his 23 years in prison, he had completed his GED, taken computer classes and was transcribing books to braille for the blind.
“I am not excusing my terrible behavior just because of my youth,” he wrote. “No! I take complete responsibility for my own actions. Now that I am older, I can reflect back into  my own life and I can see clearly all the terrible decisions, mistakes and errors that I made back in my youth.”

This story was originally reported by Candice Norwood of The 19th.  Meet Candice and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A group of incarcerated transgender women and men have sued Georgia corrections officials, challenging a new law that prevents them from receiving gender-affirming medical care. The lawsuit, filed Friday morning, accuses the state of violating the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.
Five transgender plaintiffs — two men and three women — brought the class action lawsuit on behalf of nearly 300 other people in Georgia state prisons, who argue that the state’s law will have “catastrophic consequences.” In some cases it is forcing trans people who have already received hormone replacement therapy and other services for years to detransition without their consent.
“We are very much in the thick of seeing policies like this be adopted,” said Chinyere Ezie, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which brought the lawsuit with co-counsel Bondurant Mixson & Elmore LLP. “It’s really unfortunate, I think that it has and will cost people’s lives. I think that the plan is to really just eradicate trans people from public life, to really — contrary to medicine — make the treatment of gender dysphoria a culture war, as opposed to a serious medical need that requires treatment.”
In May, Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed SB 185, a bill passed by the state’s majority conservative legislature that prohibits the use of state funds or resources for surgery, hormone replacement therapy, cosmetic procedures and other treatments used to address gender dysphoria. The law states explicitly that incarcerated people may still receive treatments like hormone replacement therapy if they are medically necessary for conditions other than gender dysphoria.
Ezie told The 19th that the bill’s sponsors indicated during hearings that incarcerated trans people would not be allowed to pay for treatment themselves, either. Her team has also heard this from their clients, she said. The 19th reached out to the Georgia Department of Corrections to confirm whether incarcerated trans people can pay for these procedures themselves.
“Senate Bill 185 prohibits the use of state funds or resources for the following treatments for state inmates: A. Sex reassignment surgeries or any other surgical procedures that are performed for the purpose of altering primary or secondary sexual characteristics; B. Hormone replacement therapies; and C. Cosmetic procedures or prosthetics intended to alter the appearance of primary or secondary sexual characteristics,” wrote Joan Heath, the department’s director of communications.
“Thus, the GDC cannot use state resources to transport an offender to be seen by a provider paid for at their own expense, nor allow a provider being paid by an offender to treat such offender at a GDC facility,” she continued.
The legal complaint filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights includes details about the plaintiffs who described the effects of being cut off from their gender-affirming medical care. One trans woman named Fantasia Horton, incarcerated in Phillips State Prison, had been receiving hormone therapy since 2019 but was completely cut off following the law, despite being told that her dosages would gradually decrease before ending, according to the Center for Constitutional Rights.
“Due to Defendants’ policies and actions in terminating her treatment, Ms. Horton is now at grave risk of physical and psychological harm,” the complaint stated. “Three years ago, after losing access to hormone therapy for just one week after her prison’s supply of hormone therapy was temporarily depleted, Ms. Horton’s mental health plummeted and her depressive symptoms returned.”
Gender dysphoria is a condition recognized by medical journals and professionals. It is defined as the sense of discomfort or anxiety a person feels when their physical gender feels out of sync with their gender identity. This can lead to long-term mental health effects, including periods of depression, thoughts or acts of self-harm. Forced detransition due to anti-trans legislation, coupled with the poor conditions and discrimination that incarcerated trans people often experience, can worsen these mental health consequences. From a physical standpoint, doctors recommend that any termination of hormone replacement therapy takes place gradually over three to six months, rather than cold turkey.
“Taking away individuals’ access to gender-affirming therapies while in prison constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and increases the likelihood of abuse and detrimental health consequences,” Jan T. Mooney, an Atlanta-based psychologist, and Mark Spencer, an Atlanta-area internal medicine physician, wrote in an April column about the Georgia bill.
“Abrupt cessation or forced weaning of medically necessary, ongoing treatment is a health risk. Physical effects of hormone withdrawal are accompanied by psychological distress, which may manifest as anxiety, depression, and suicidality,” they continued.
The class action lawsuit comes 10 years after Ezie first sued over another ban on gender-affirming care in Georgia prisons. In that case Ashley Diamond, a Black transgender woman, sued the Georgia Department of Corrections in 2015 after being held in men’s prisons and denied hormone treatments.
The case drew attention from the U.S. Department of Justice, which said at the time that blanket policies barring hormone therapy violate the Eighth Amendment “because they do not provide for individualized assessment and treatment.” Diamond won an undisclosed settlement in 2016, and her case prompted policy changes in Georgia meant to facilitate better treatment of incarcerated transgender people. But six years later, Diamond sued again, asserting that the state failed to provide her adequate health care or protect her from sexual assault after a second incarceration. Ultimately, Diamond dropped that lawsuit to protect her mental health, according to her lawyers.
To see the same issues come up again in 2025 feels like being “in a time machine going back in time,” said Ezie, who represented Diamond 10 years ago.
“I think that is a feeling that’s shared by many trans rights activists,” Ezie said. “It feels like, rather than seeing a forward march of progress when it comes to securing basic rights and basic dignity for transgender people, we are now fighting to hold on to very basic legal wins that you know we achieved, at times, decades ago.”
Ezie and the legal team at the Center for Constitutional Rights are hopeful that the courts will overturn Georgia’s law, as they have in other similar cases. For example, Wisconsin enacted a law in 2005 that barred prison doctors from providing hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgery to incarcerated transgender people in state custody. But a federal court ruled that denying this medical care constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Another state-level class action lawsuit in Colorado resulted in a negotiated settlement agreement between the state and the Department of Corrections requiring an overhaul of how it houses incarcerated transgender women and provides medical care to all trans people behind bars.
If the Center for Constitutional Rights is successful in Georgia, Ezie anticipates that there will still be a long road ahead in the effort to challenge anti-trans legislation and policies.
“We’re going to continue to use the courts, we’re going to continue to organize, we’re going to continue to — as we did prior to the passage of this bill — lobby against bills like this that seek to cause so much preventable harm,” she said. “This is why we fight.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trans-prison_-1-1024x683.webp,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

I was 7 years old when those funny-looking characters appeared on our black-and-white TV set. We lived in what the Tupelo city folk considered the country. If there was such a thing as cable, we surely didn’t know anything about it. The only static-free channel on our dial was the NBC affiliate, and that’s because the station on Beech Springs Road was barely a mile from our house. Suddenly, there was this new station – PBS. 
Those funny-looking characters were from this new show called “Sesame Street,” and they had me hooked from the first day. Of course, I was happy to have another TV choice. But this one was different. Skillfully included in the humorous scenes with Ernie and Bert, Oscar the Grouch, Cookie Monster and Big Bird were educational messages that proved educationally life-changing for my family and me. 
PBS aired “Sesame Street” – the same PBS that helped teach scores of children in our nation, including me, to read. And it’s the same PBS and member stations that just had their two-year forward-funding appropriation yanked by a $9 billion GOP-led rescission bill that finally succeeded in doing what “Sesame Street” teaches against – bullying.

After a long media career, including more than a decade as editor of The Clarion-Ledger, I spent another decade as executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting. It was one of my proudest moments for a kid from Saltillo, a child who came from a family of sharecroppers, to occupy the top seat in public broadcasting in my home state and to ultimately get elected to PBS’s national board of directors.
A kid who admired public media became an executive who ran a statewide operation and helped shape policy nationally. It felt like a dream. 
For those who care as much as I do about public media, it is unfathomable, inconceivable and plain dumb – choose your adjective – that both PBS and NPR stations are being picked on, possibly dismantled. And for what? Their financial impact on the multi-trillion-dollar federal budget is minuscule. The inexplicable action carried out by the GOP majority has hurt me deeply. While Republican members run home on recess to avoid further questions about Jeffrey Epstein, my mind can’t get away from the inevitable obliteration of content from local stations that looms.
PBS and NPR are certainly weakened by the passage of the recission, but it will be the rural stations in rural towns without wealthy donors that will feel the most pain. It is a foregone conclusion that some stations already barely getting by will close. 
One industry executive described the cuts as “catastrophic, devastating, unnecessary and mean-spirited.”  Several stations have already had layoffs and there will be more.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which announced Aug. 1 that it will begin shutting down in September, has been the congressional arm doling out funds to stations since 1967. For years, despite the shortsightedness of some members of Congress, CPB, with the assistance of affinity groups, fought off funding threats and delivered to the 1,500 stations federal dollars that were their lifeline.
Not this time.
The recent action to claw back the $1.1 billion public broadcasting receives over two years is a blow that most likely will place the industry as we know it in an unrecoverable position. 
The public media system and local stations have led the way in delivering some of the country’s best programming. PBS, for example, was among the first to bring to viewers travel shows, DIY content, cooking shows featuring cultural icons like the great Julia Child. There’s also Bob Ross, with his soothing voice, who made us all believe that we, too, could paint beautiful landscapes.
The children’s programming, which my grandchildren faithfully watch, cannot be matched by those with commercial interests. It provides a safe place for children, which is not always the case with the others. 
NPR frequently sets the agenda for the news of the day – often scooping better-financed media companies – with hosts and producers who have a knack for securing interviews with top newsmakers. Their aggressive reporting has always struck a nerve with thin-skinned politicians. As executive director of MPB, it was NPR that kept my phone ringing with lawmakers threatening to pull funding.  
Public broadcasting will survive in some form. It has been wounded, but it has not been silenced. I would not be truthful, however, if I didn’t believe that its strong voice has been reduced to a whisper.
The American people have supported public broadcasting with their viewership and donations, the perfect public-private partnership. But I don’t believe small-town America can keep up. Some larger stations will struggle, as well. 
So many people in my circle of friends have given their entire careers to public media. They won’t give up that easily. But they’ve been dealt a bad hand, a setback that has every station accountant working overtime to save as many people as they can.
What do I predict?
Expect to see mostly national programming and fewer local productions. Expect to see talented radio and TV professionals in the job market. But don’t expect to see public media and the ingenuity of its people give up. They will never quit.

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9%, and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6%, and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed, and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)A Washington gun shop is taking its case against the state’s ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Gator’s Custom Guns in Kelso filed a petition this week, asking the high court to review the state Supreme Court’s decision in May upholding the controversial law. Supporters of the restriction see it as an important step for quelling gun violence. 
Walter Wentz, the Cowlitz County store’s owner, said Friday he hopes to convince the Supreme Court justices to “do their job and not accept all these lower courts waving their finger at them.”
“I look forward to exercising our rights,” he said. “Hopefully, we’ll get some justice out of this.”
Gator’s has argued the state’s 2022 ban on the sale of gun ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds violates the Washington and U.S. constitutions. The state constitution protects “the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself, or the state.” 
But in their 7-2 decision, state Supreme Court justices ruled high-capacity magazines aren’t “arms,” but just a component of a gun that isn’t generally used for self-defense.
“By restricting only magazines of a capacity greater than 10, the statute effectively regulates the maximum capacity of magazines, leaving the weapon fully functional for its intended purpose,” Justice Charles Johnson wrote in the majority opinion. “Indeed, we can safely say that individuals are still able to exercise the core right to bear arms when they are limited to purchasing magazines with a capacity of 10 or fewer.”
The U.S. Supreme Court has, for years, expanded the understanding of what the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution covers. The justices have ruled the Second Amendment protects firearms that are “in common use” and are “typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.”
In their petition for review, Gator’s attorneys write that Johnson’s opinion “deepens an acknowledged division of authority among federal courts of appeals and state courts of last resort over whether these ubiquitous instruments are ‘Arms’ that cries out for resolution.”
“If this Court does not step in and stop the piecemeal removal of integral firearm components from the scope of the Second Amendment’s plain text, soon neither the piece nor the whole will be left with any constitutional protection at all,” the lawyers wrote.
At the state court level, the gun shop argued the magazines’ popularity meant they met those legal tests. Two of the state Supreme Court justices were sympathetic to this argument.
In 2022, in a case known as Bruen, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled state firearm laws must stay true to the nation’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation.” This left lower court judges to deduce how laws written over a century ago would square with technological advances, like high-capacity magazines and semi-automatic weapons.
The majority from the state Supreme Court didn’t grapple with the Bruen decision because they didn’t find the magazines were considered “firearms” in the first place.
Recent federal court decisions give reason for optimism on the state side. 
This spring, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned down a challenge to California’s similar law on these ammunition devices.
And in June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to Rhode Island’s restriction on high-capacity magazines. 
The Washington law, which has been in effect during the court process, still allows people to own high-capacity magazines, but bans importing or selling them. Over a dozen states have similar restrictions.
The case went to the state Supreme Court after a Cowlitz County Superior Court judge struck down the ban in April 2024. The judge, Gary Bashor, ruled the law violated the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms for self-defense granted in the state constitution. He cited the Bruen decision’s historical tradition test as justification.
In this latest appeal, the gun shop is represented by Paul Clement and Erin Murphy, who also represented the plaintiffs challenging a New York state gun law in the Bruen case. It’s a shift from lower courts, where the Pasco-based Silent Majority Foundation argued for the shop. The two teams will now work in tandem.
Clement, the former U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush, and Murphy didn’t respond to requests for comment. Nor did Austin Hatcher, the shop’s attorney from the Silent Majority Foundation. The state attorney general’s office also didn’t immediately respond.
Pete Serrano, the Pasco mayor and failed Republican candidate for state attorney general, has also represented the shop. The Trump administration is now considering Serrano to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Washington.

Historically redlined communities have less access to rapid emergency medical services, according to the findings of a new study (Brandon Bell/Getty Images).Residents of historically redlined communities experience slower response times from emergency medical services, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to Black and Hispanic residents. The practice deemed neighborhoods with higher proportions of nonwhite residents to be undesirable and financially risky for mortgage lending.
Researchers mapped locations of EMS centers across 236 cities and analyzed maps produced in the 1930s by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. The government agency, created as part of the New Deal, consistently ranked majority-Black areas as “hazardous” for lending. Redlining has been illegal since enactment of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968.
The research team calculated average EMS response times using the location of ambulance, fire and rescue services and historical traffic data. “Rapid” response was defined as five minutes or less, the benchmark set by the National Fire Protection Association for high-priority patients with life-threatening conditions.
The team found that more than 2.2 million people lack rapid EMS access. Areas historically graded “D” — financially “hazardous” for mortgage lending — had a significantly higher proportion of residents (roughly 7%) without rapid EMS access, compared with about 4% of residents in historically “most desirable” A-graded neighborhoods. D-graded neighborhoods had higher proportions of Black residents, whereas A-graded neighborhoods had more white residents.
Disparities were particularly acute in the Great Lakes region, the authors note. The odds of lacking rapid access to EMS were nearly three times higher for residents in historically D-graded neighborhoods, compared with A-graded neighborhoods in that region.
The findings add to the evidence linking policies rooted in structural racism to health disparities.
Research has shown redlined neighborhoods still disproportionately grapple with a multitude of health disparities, lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution.
The study found a racial disparity in where EMS stations are located, with fewer EMS stations in urban communities of color. Better tracking and accountability of EMS response times in communities could help address the issue, the researchers wrote.
Delays in emergency care are associated with higher mortality rates. For traumatic injuries, timely care is critical during what EMS professionals call the “golden hour,” or the first 60 minutes after an injury.
Other research has pointed to disparities in emergency response times. EMS response times for patients with cardiac arrest, for example, were 10% longer for low-income ZIP codes than high-income ZIP codes, according to a national study published in JAMA Network Open in 2018.
The study received funding support from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

,Source New Mexico,2025-08-08 17:55:25+00:00,Source New Mexico,Medicaid work requirements don’t work for New Mexicans with disabilities,"Gary Housepian, CEO of Disability Rights New Mexico",,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/08/08/medicaid-work-requirements-dont-work-for-new-mexicans-with-disabilities/,The CEO of Disability Rights New Mexico argues that the new federal Medicaid work requirements will harm disabled New Mexicans.,"Changes to Medicaid as a result of the One Big Beautiful Act could result in disabled New Mexicans losing their health insurance, the CEO of Disability Rights New Mexico writes.Just when we thought we’d seen everything, Congress has thrown down a breathtaking new gauntlet: a national work requirement for people participating in Medicaid.  Every state will now be required to track the employment status of its Medicaid recipients in order to receive federal funding for the program.
We don’t know exactly how New Mexico will enact this new rule.  The “One Big Beautiful Bill” does not prescribe how to set up such a tracking system, and it certainly doesn’t fund it.  But every U.S. state will need the system in place in extremely short order, most likely by late 2026.
There are a lot of unknowns, but what we do know is this: Work requirements don’t work for people with disabilities.
As CEO of Disability Rights New Mexico, I have seen how every year, we provide free legal services to thousands of people with disabilities across our state. We exist, in part, because the systems designed to support people with disabilities are so often unnavigable.
Now, Medicaid will erect a new barrier that many people with disabilities won’t be able to scale.  The new legislation requires that Medicaid recipients prove that they work, volunteer or attend school for 80 hours each month as a demonstration of worthiness for coverage.  If people fail to report, their health care is cut off.  There may be some exceptions to the work requirement for folks with medical issues or parenting obligations. But whether or not they are required to work, we are profoundly uneasy about the ability of many people to navigate a reporting system that requires regular check-ins and submission of documentation. Even if someone is entitled to a medical exemption, they don’t necessarily have the ability to provide regular proof of it.  
Consider the following common scenarios:
A young man with an intellectual disability works in a warehouse, where the predictable routine and structure support his ability to succeed on the job. He is enrolled in Turquoise Care, New Mexico’s basic Medicaid plan. Despite working 80 hours each month, his disability makes it impossible for him to regularly report his work hours to the state. Even though he is meeting the requirements, he loses his health coverage simply because he cannot navigate the reporting system.
A woman with traumatic brain injury meets the medical criteria exempting her from work. However, her disability deeply impacts her executive functioning skills to the point where she is incapable of filling out the exemption forms, scheduling a medical appointment to certify her status and regularly submitting the required documentation. Because of impairments caused by her disability, she loses her health care.
These aren’t hypotheticals. These are real examples of the many disability-related obstacles faced by real New Mexicans. And a lot more people are about to be impacted.
According to New Mexico’s Health Care Authority, HCA, New Mexico has 836,000 enrolled in Medicaid, approximately 40% of New Mexico’s population. Approximately 254,000 Medicaid members would be subject to the bill’s new work requirements. Although the details of exemption requirements have not been disclosed, we can expect a significant number of this group could lose coverage, not because they are unwilling to work, but because the policy ignores real world barriers. HCA estimates that nearly 89,000 will lose coverage for vital health care. We expect that number could be significantly higher, particularly in the rural areas where work and volunteer opportunities are limited. Added to that reality is the limitation of transportation of essential transportation services. As if those were not enough barriers to overcome, there is the new six-month redetermination requirements that pose an additional threat to maintaining continuing eligibility, especially for those with disabilities attempting to continue to meet paperwork requirements.  They will be subject to a confusing and punitive federal reporting mandate.  These individuals will need ongoing support to navigate the new rules and how to follow them.  
‘More paperwork for everyone’: NM Medicaid program braces for more churn

We shared these concerns with U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) at a recent Medicaid roundtable, and he has taken action to try and right the ship on Medicaid. The entire Congressional delegation has been supportive of New Mexicans regarding the consequences of these Medicaid changes. We ask that other state New Mexico lawmakers and state leaders do the same, recognizing the chaos and harm that will be unleashed by this new federal mandate and taking steps to do something about it. We call upon our state’s leaders to develop, fund and support an employment reporting system that is as accessible, inclusive and fair as possible. We cannot allow the Medicaid system to punish the very individuals it was established to support by depriving them of essential health care services.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/medicaidgettyimage-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 13:56:27.027924

Tony Evers signed the legislation on Friday. (Screenshot/WisEye)As expected, Gov. Tony Evers signed legislation Friday that clears the way for nurses with advanced training to practice independently.
“Nurses play a critical role in our healthcare workforce, and I’m proud of our work to expand opportunities for nurses to not only grow their career but create a system that allows for more advanced practitioners here in Wisconsin,” Evers said in a statement released Friday announcing his plans to sign AB 257, the advanced practice registered nurses (APRN) legislation, now Wisconsin Act 17.
The bill creates a new license category and a professional pathway for nurses who qualify to practice independently.
The Wisconsin state nursing board will oversee the credentialing of advanced practice nurses, a group that includes certified nurse-midwives, certified registered nurse anesthetists, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners.
Advocates said the measure will increase the availability of health care providers, particularly in parts of Wisconsin where doctors are scarce.
Evers vetoed previous versions of the bill in 2022 and 2024. Both times he expressed support for the concept but insisted nurses should meet tighter qualifications before they can practice on their own.
The bill he signed Friday adds those requirements — increasing the amount of supervision that an APRN must have under a physician to 3,840 hours before practicing independently; adding additional supervision requirements for certified registered nurse anesthetists who specialize in pain management; and including language to restrict the titles APRN practitioners use so patients aren’t confused about their credentials.
The Wisconsin Medical Society cited those issues in opposing APRN bills in previous legislative sessions, and with the 2025 revision shifted its stance to neutral.  
In floor votes in June, lawmakers from both parties stressed the bipartisan compromise reflected in the measure that was presented to Evers this week.
In his announcement, Evers thanked lawmakers for their work on the measure, including Republican state Sens. Patrick Testin and Rachael Cabral-Guevara, Republican state Rep. Tony Kurtz and Democratic state Rep. Lisa Subeck.
He also thanked “the many nursing and physician groups that we worked with to get this bipartisan bill across the finish line to help bring more folks into the healthcare profession and ensure that Wisconsinites get the high-quality care they need when they need it while setting our nurses up for success.”
Evers is expected to take action on other legislation Friday. On Thursday the Legislature formally sent nearly two dozen bills that passed in May and June to the governor for his signature.
This report is developing and will be updated.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, faced criticisms for his 2020 social media post about the Iowa caucuses Friday while he toured with state Democratic leaders and met with Iowans at the Iowa State Fair.
Though the Democratic nominating process no longer begins in Iowa, the state fair is traditionally a stop for presidential hopefuls as they consider a campaign. Gallego said a run for president is currently “out of the question,” saying his focus was on his family and supporting Democrats in the 2026 midterms.
Gallego still fielded questions on his previous statements about the process for nominating a Democrat to run for president during his State Fair visit. Gallego, 45, made social media posts in 2020 and 2021 that criticized the Iowa caucuses, the state’s contests that formerly kicked off the nation’s presidential nominating cycle for both parties. While the Iowa Republican caucuses still lead the calendar, Iowa Democrats were booted from their first-in-the-nation position following the 2020 election cycle, after delays reporting 2020 caucus results heightened existing criticism from Democrats that the in-person caucus system was inaccessible.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a post on Feb. 3, 2020 — the night of the Iowa Democratic caucus — Gallego wrote “F*** caucuses. Iowa failed time to move on.”
Speaking with reporters at the fair, Gallego said he has a different approach to the Iowa caucuses than he did in 2020 in part “because I’m a mature adult now” — but declined to weigh in on the future of the Democratic nominating calendar moving forward.
“What I said was, you know, dumb of me,” Gallego said. “No, look: really, in 2020, a lot of us were just very frustrated with the results. And … whatever happens in the future, it’s going to be left up to the DNC. But the Democrats do need to compete in rural America. And you know, Iowa needs to be part of that key no matter what.”
As the Arizona Democrat toured the fairgrounds with Iowa Democratic Party chair Rita Hart and state Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, members of Turning Point USA, a conservative political action committee, followed them, holding up signs of his tweets.
Though he spoke about the caucuses, Gallego said his visit to Iowa was a part of an effort to “reinvigorate the Democratic Party,” saying the party needs to return to a focus on working-class issues and families in order to win back Congress and the White House.
Gallego wrote an opinion piece Wednesday in the Des Moines Register, criticizing Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Sen. Joni Ernst for their votes in support of the budget reconciliation bill that included cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. He highlighted Ernst’s statement, “well, we all are going to die,” made at a May town hall and a video where Miller-Meeks did not respond to questions from Alex Lawson, executive director of the organization Social Security Works, on her decision to support the measure.
“Ernst and Miller-Meeks gave up on Iowa,” Gallego wrote. “I won’t.”
Gallego said Democrats faltered in the 2024 election because their messaging did not reflect the struggles American families were facing with inflation and issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. But he said the budget reconciliation bill gives Democrats an opportunity to correct course.
“The really bad bill that just passed gives Democrats an opening, because we could finally really show (what) Democrats are here for,” Gallego said. “We’re here to help those that are, you know, barely making it. That bill is going to push tens of thousands of Iowans off Medicaid. It’s going to really hurt rural hospitals … and they did it for a small group of people that are going to be able to have the benefits of a tax cut — many which aren’t in Iowa. And so this is the opportunity where we need to lean in.”
Republicans criticized Gallego, with National Republican Campaign Committee Spokeswoman Emily Tuttle saying Gallego “isn’t here to fight for Iowans, he’s fighting for his own political ambitions.”
“From mocking Iowa values to pushing policies that would destroy Iowa’s economy, it’s clear he doesn’t understand or care about what matters to Iowans,” Tuttle said in a statement. “While he plays politics, Mariannette Miller-Meeks is delivering real results for working families.”
In addition to visiting the state fair, Gallego said he had visited the JBS meatpacking factory in Marshalltown earlier Friday. He is also scheduled to hold a town hall Saturday with the state Democratic Party in Davenport.
As he visits Iowa, the Institute for Middle East Understanding, a nonprofit organization, announced a TV and digital ad buy in Iowa during Gallego’s visit, criticizing the senator for skipping a vote where a majority of Democrats voted to block the sale of U.S. weapons to Israel.
IMEU Policy Project Executive Director Margaret DeReus said in a statement Gallego failed a “critical test” by skipping the vote, saying the Democratic Party “cannot risk the 2028 election by nominating any candidate who refuses to stand with Democratic voters who overwhelmingly say Israel is committing genocide and support restricting weapons to Israel.”
“We hope Sen. Gallego and any other Democrats with aspirations to be president will understand: The old status quo is over,” DeReus said in a statement. “If you refuse to join Democratic voters in calling for weapons to be cut off to Israel, you’re out of touch with the party and not a credible option to be its presidential nominee.”
Gallego said many of the votes he has missed recently are because he is on paternity leave for his son, born June 13. But he said he believed the U.S. needed to focus on two things — “bring the hostages home, end this war” in resolving the Israel-Hamas conflict. He also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli government for starvation and the lack of aid entering Gaza.
“Netanyahu and Israeli government has a responsibility, an absolute responsibility, to actually be feeding and caring for Gaza while they are occupying the country,” Gallego said. “It’s not something that I’m saying.

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Former Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola holds a commanding lead in the 2026 election for governor of Alaska if she chooses to jump into the race, a new survey from progressive pollster Data for Progress (DFP) shows.
Peltola, who was elected to Alaska’s at-large U.S. House seat in a 2022 special election and then to a full term in the House before losing her seat in 2024, is widely viewed as the most formidable potential Democratic candidate for either governor or U.S. Senate in 2026. She was the first woman to represent Alaska in the U.S. House, the first Alaska Native person elected to Congress and could be the state’s first Alaska Native governor.
“I think that’s a huge thing, not just for representation, but for policy and people’s lives,” said Jason Katz-Brown, an Alaska-based senior adviser at DFP.
Peltola had the highest favorability ratings of major Alaska politicians in the survey, which was shared first with The 19th. She holds a net positive favorability of 9 points, and leads a crowded field of lesser-known and less popular Republican gubernatorial opponents by double-digit margins.
Katz-Brown said Peltola’s focus on issues like fisheries management and opposing the proposed merger of grocery chains Kroger and Albertsons has made her especially well-regarded among voters.
“She’s done a lot to deserve being so popular and being in such a strong position,” he said.
DFP conducts regular surveys of Alaska. In 2024, the organization’s polling accurately captured the margin of President Donald Trump’s victory in the state and the tight race for U.S. House that Peltola went on to narrowly lose to GOP Rep. Nick Begich. The most recent poll surveyed 678 likely voters from July 21 to July 27 with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Alaska votes solidly Republican on the presidential level, but its politics have a unique independent streak: over half of registered voters aren’t affiliated with either major political party, and both chambers of the state legislature have a majority ruling coalition made up of both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.
Incumbent Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited, setting up an open governor’s race. And with Democrats out of power, all eyes are on Peltola, who joined the legal and public affairs firm Holland & Hart in March and has not yet publicly made moves toward entering either race.
“The policies that she spent her whole last two years running on, especially on fisheries policy, are really, really popular things in Alaska, and the policies of the Republican governor are extremely unpopular,” Katz-Brown said. “All that’s combined, I think, really backs up the people in the state who really want to see a Peltola governorship.”
Several Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom and conservative activist and businessperson Bernadette Wilson, have declared or taken steps to launch campaigns while the Democratic side of the field remains open. Elections in Alaska are conducted with top-four nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice general elections.
The survey included a ranked-choice general election simulation of Peltola and several other declared and potential candidates, and in every round, Peltola came out far ahead of the competition.
In the first round, 40 percent of voters said they would rank Peltola first, 11 percent said they would rank Wilson, and 10 percent said they would rank Dahlstrom with other candidates in the single digits. When all other candidates were eliminated and their votes reallocated, Peltola would beat Dahlstrom by 30 points, 65 percent to 35 percent, in a head-to-head competition.
“This poll makes clear she’s in an extremely strong position to run for governor,” Katz-Brown said. Even “in the most pessimistic of scenarios,” where “not sure” votes are allocated to Dahlstrom or Republican voters rank four Republican candidates and their votes aren’t exhausted, Peltola comes out on top, he said.
Peltola would benefit from Dahlstrom being largely unknown and unpopular in the survey, and a fractured Republican field, Katz-Brown said.
“I think it reflects that the Republican Party is literally years away from unifying around one candidate, and has a ton of work to do,” he added.
In the 2026 Senate race, 46 percent of voters said they would rank GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan first, and 45 percent said they would rank Peltola first. But Katz-Brown said defeating Sullivan, a second-term incumbent who won reelection by 13 points in 2020, would be a much tougher lift for Peltola than an open governor’s race.
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski didn’t entirely rule out making a run for governor herself in recent comments to local media. But that potential bid could be threatened by her cratering favorability ratings.
The DFP survey found Murkowski’s net favorability has plummeted by over 20 points since the organization’s last poll conducted in the spring, following her controversial vote for Republicans’ massive party-line tax cut and spending legislation, which Trump dubbed his “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
In DFP’s last Alaska survey released in March, Murkowski had a slim net positive approval rating, with 49 percent of respondents holding a favorable view of her and 48 percent holding an unfavorable view. In the July survey, 37 percent of respondents held a favorable view of Murkowski, while 60 percent held an unfavorable view, putting her favorability rating at net negative 23 points.
Murkowski cast a critical vote for the megabill, which passed 51-50 with Vice President JD Vance breaking a tie, following the addition of several provisions and carveouts beneficial to Alaska. After voting for the legislation, Murkowski stated that she hoped the House would make changes to the bill, calling it “not good enough for the rest of our nation” and “not ready for the President’s desk.”
But House Republicans made no such changes to the Senate-passed bill, sending the legislation to Trump’s desk by the July 4 deadline he set for lawmakers. Murkowski later told the Anchorage Daily News that she felt “cheated” by Trump signing executive orders that undercut one of the concessions in the bill that she negotiated, a 12-month window preserving tax credits for wind and solar energy projects.
Murkowski, who has served in the Senate since 2002, has historically drawn much of her support from Democratic and independent voters. She’s frequently broken with Trump and in 2022, she defeated a Trump-backed Republican challenger to win another six-year term. While her net negative favorability ratings among Republicans stayed consistent between the two most recent DFP surveys, her net favorability among Democrats fell by nearly 40 percentage points from 63 percent in the spring to 26 percent in July. Among independent and third-party voters, her net favorability fell from 12 points to 21 points underwater.
“I think her run for governor could also be imperiled by having really no base of support anymore,” Katz-Brown said.
Peltola has ample time to make a decision about her political future before the June 2026 filing deadline for governor. On July 1, the day the Senate passed the megabill, Peltola spoke out against the legislation.
“We can not [sic] secure Alaska’s future by increasing healthcare and energy costs for regular Alaskans, so millionaires, like many of my former colleagues in Congress, and their billionaire donors can get even richer,” she wrote on social media. “Yes, let’s develop Alaska’s resources, but for the benefit of all Alaskans, not just a few.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC02302-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 13:56:27.027924

The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

A $50 million annual revenue loss resulting from the Big Beautiful Bill spurred the request. 
The post Republican lawmakers urge Wyoming’s federal delegation to give state larger share of coal royalties appeared first on WyoFile .","About a week before President Donald Trump’s Fourth of July signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, the co-chairmen of the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee made a request of the state’s congressional delegation.
Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, and Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, asked the delegation to consider either amending the bill or bringing future legislation to avoid a $50 million annual revenue loss for the state. 
In return for the bill’s rate reduction to federal mineral royalties for coal, the two lawmakers asked that Wyoming get a larger slice of the pie that’s usually split down the middle with the feds.
“Thank you in advance for any efforts to consider the financial impacts on the distribution of these revenues and align a revision to the federal-state share in harmony with the proposed royalty rate reduction,” Bear and Salazar wrote in a June 25 letter obtained by WyoFile. 
Companies pay royalties to the federal government for minerals extracted from federal lands. Generally, those dollars are split 50-50 between the feds and the government of the state in which the mineral production took place. 
In Wyoming, those royalties have long built schools and paved roads, and they continue to help fund K-12 education, city and town services and the University of Wyoming. 
The Big Beautiful Bill, however, reduced the federal royalty rate for coal from 12.5% to 7%. Supporters of the legislation, including Wyoming’s delegation, hailed the reduction as a way to boost coal production. But state forecasters estimate the rate reduction will cost Wyoming roughly $50 million in annual revenue, and it’s not expected to be offset in state coffers.

The coming revenue hit concerned Rep. Bear, former chairman of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus. 
“Enough so that I sent a letter to our Federal delegation asking them to change the percentage split between the feds and the state,” Bear said. 
More specifically, Bear and Salazar asked the delegation to consider either amending the Big Beautiful Bill or crafting separate legislation to temporarily modify the mineral royalty sharing from its traditional 50-50 distribution to a share that would give 12.5% to the feds and 87.5% to Wyoming. 
No amendment was made, but Sen. John Barrasso’s staff responded with a letter, telling state lawmakers they would look into it. Plus, Bear said there are plans to follow up with the delegation to see if they are interested in running a bill. 
To be clear, Bear said, he supports the rate reductions.
“That move is similar to our cutting their severance tax,” he said. “Unfortunately, it puts us in a bigger bind on school finance.”
Education funding 
Extractive industries pay severance taxes to Wyoming for removing, extracting, severing or producing minerals. Like royalty dollars, severance taxes are in part used to pay for education. 
In 2022, the Legislature reduced the state’s severance tax rate from 7% to 6.5% before reducing it once more to 6% earlier this year. Together, the two bills cost the state $20 million in annual revenue loss, while their stated purpose was to boost coal production, which has dwindled from its boomtime days.

Efforts like the rate reduction and the severance tax cuts “improve the competitive environment for coal production from Wyoming’s world-class mines and offer the promise of extending the financial viability of robust Wyoming coal production well into the future,” Wyoming lawmakers’ letter states. 
Still, Bear and Salazar wrote, modifying the rate share “is consistent with long-standing concerns to avoid reductions to Wyoming’s revenue generated from coal, oil and gas from administrative fees, congressional sequestration, and similar efforts to reduce Wyoming’s revenue from our treasured extractive resources.”
U.S. Sens. Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis and U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)North Dakota utility regulators have recruited support from their counterparts in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana to oppose electric grid upgrades from the transmission operator that delivers power to their states and across the nation’s midsection.
Partisan points have worked their way into the debate, with some Republican public service commissioners voicing their distaste for grid plans that involve renewable energy.     
On July 30, the North Dakota Public Service Commission filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regarding the issue of who benefits more when major power line projects are built and whether the calculations to determine those benefits are fair. 
An organization called the Midcontinent Independent System Operator manages a regional electric grid that services 15 states and parts of Manitoba, Canada. In December, MISO revealed 24 transmission upgrade projects with an estimated combined cost of $22 billion. The projects are part of an annual plan MISO develops every year to identify maintenance and upgrades for its infrastructure. All of the projects are in the MISO-North subregion, and the costs will be allocated to those states.
North Dakota regulators argue the benefit calculations used for the projects are “unjust and unreasonable” for customers in the state, according to a news release they issued Thursday. They have garnered support for their stance from other MISO network members, even though the southern states won’t have to pay for any of the projects.
While it’s not uncommon for state regulators to bring objections to MISO’s governing board, it is rare for states to join forces for a federal complaint on an issue that doesn’t apply to all members, Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat, said.
Although the complaint is already technically filed, Louisiana still has to ratify it, and partisan lines have already been drawn. Republicans hold a 3-2 advantage on the state Public Service Commission, which meets next Friday.
Lewis said he plans to vote against ratification and rejects the premise of arguments Republican commissioners are making. 
“This has nothing to do with Louisiana paying for things up in the north,” Lewis said. 
The federal complaint relies on a hypothetical situation that the cost-benefit allocations used in MISO-North might some day come down to MISO-South, Lewis said.
Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, a Republican, said he believes it’s a real concern. 
“We are not allocated the costs of the transmission projects now, but the precedent and the possibility of a future cost re-allocation that could impact us were factors that prompted us, Mississippi and Arkansas to join in,” Coussan said, adding that he’s closely considering the idea of Louisiana leaving MISO altogether. 
Commissioner Mike Francis, also a Republican, said there’s “a lot of windmill projects” up north that only benefit the local area up there.   
Although the complaint is an argument against transmission costs, it specifically mentions that some of the proposed power lines would hook up to renewable energy generation. 
North Louisiana power line project revived after lawmakers halted it

Lewis said North Dakota and Montana regulators are underscoring the presence of wind turbines in MISO-North in an attempt to turn their complaint into a partisan issue that can drum up support from other states. 
“That’s exactly what they are doing,” Lewis said.
During its meeting Thursday, North Dakota Public Service Commissioner Jill Kringstad, a Republican, said the slate of 24 MISO projects would help some states achieve renewable energy goals but pass some of the cost on to North Dakota ratepayers.
She called the costs “unjust and unreasonable” for North Dakota.
Kringstad and her colleagues estimated North Dakota’s share of the projects at $5 per month for an average customer, which the customer would pay for decades.
Commission Chair Randy Christmann, also a Republican, said there could be additional costs for increased power generation on top of the transmission projects.
They said MISO has changed the way it evaluates the cost-benefit of transmission projects to the detriment of North Dakota.
MISO spokesman Brandon Morris confirmed the cost allocation for the plan is on a subregional basis across the North and Central regions and does not include MISO South. 
“MISO is reviewing the filing submitted to FERC,” Morris said. “The [proposed] portfolio was developed through a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement, including more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits. The portfolio supports reliability and the future needs of the system.”

Gov. Greg Gianforte reminded Montanans on Friday about two new laws that provide Montana homeowners with property tax relief, including new tax rates and rebates.
“Recognizing the burden of rising property taxes, we worked with the Legislature to deliver permanent and meaningful property tax relief,” Gianforte said in a news release. “I encourage all eligible Montana homeowners to visit getmyrebate.mt.gov starting August 15 to claim a rebate before the application period closes on October 1.
“It’s critical that homeowners claim their rebate this year as you may be automatically enrolled into the lower Homestead Rate next year.”
Rebate, tiered tax rates
Senate Bill 542, carried by Sen.Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, establishes new, tiered tax rates to deliver property tax relief for Montanans for their homes, small businesses, farms, and ranches in 2025.
It also provides a property tax rebate for Montanans for their primary residence. Eligible Montana homeowners may qualify for the rebate — up to $400 this year — for property taxes paid in 2024.
To qualify for the rebate, taxpayers must have owned and lived in their home for at least seven months and paid property taxes on the residence in 2024.
To claim it, taxpayers may apply at either getmyrebate.mt.gov or by paper form by Oct. 1, 2025.
“The fastest way to get your rebate is to apply online,” said Montana Department of Revenue Director Brendan Beatty in a statement from the Governor’s Office. “Make sure to apply by the deadline of October 1.”
The application requires the physical address, geocode (go here for help identifying the geocode), amount of property taxes paid as shown on the property tax bill, and the names and social security numbers of the taxpayer and any spouse.
The Department of Revenue has created tools on getmyrebate.mt.gov to aid taxpayers in compiling this information, including a video demonstrating how to find a property’s geocode. The department will process claims as they are received, the news release said. 
For additional information about the property tax rebate or to check on the status of your property tax rebate, visit getmyrebate.mt.gov.
Montana homeowners who claim and receive a property tax rebate in 2025 may be automatically enrolled in the Homestead Rate for 2026, provided the homeowner did not move or change ownership in 2025, the news release said.
Homestead rate
House Bill 231, carried by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, establishes the Homestead Rate.
Recommended by the governor’s bipartisan Property Tax Task Force, the Homestead Rate is a new, lower property tax rate for long-term rentals and primary residences, “the places Montanans call home,” the news release said.
If a homeowner did not claim a rebate, moved, acquired a new residence, or was previously ineligible for the rebate, they must apply to claim the Homestead Rate through the Montana Department of Revenue from Dec. 1, 2025, and March 1, 2026.

Bill Lee announced Friday.
The waivers sought would also allow SNAP recipients to use benefits to purchase hot prepared chicken, including rotisserie chicken and grilled chicken. Fried or breaded chicken would not be eligible.
The proposed changes “will ensure SNAP fulfills its intended purpose of promoting healthier eating habits, supporting improved health outcomes and reducing chronic conditions for low-income families,” according to a news release from Lee’s office.
The proposed waivers include:

Allowing SNAP recipients to purchase hot prepared chicken, including rotisserie chicken and “non-fried, non-breaded items like grilled chicken tenders”
Excluding items that list sugar, corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, or similar caloric alternatives as the first ingredient
Excluding beverages in which carbonated water and sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, or similar caloric alternatives are the first two ingredients

The USDA has already approved waivers for 12 states, most of which used the waivers to restrict the purchase of soda and candy.
“I’m grateful to the Trump Administration for its leadership to Make America Healthy Again, and thank our grocery retailers, convenience stores, food producers, and beverage manufacturers for working to ensure that healthier choices reach every community across our state,” Lee stated in the news release.
Nearly 734,000 Tennesseans received about $1.4 billion in SNAP benefits in fiscal year 2022, with an average monthly benefit of $161 per person, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
SNAP funding cuts tied to new work requirements approved in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” are projected to reduce SNAP benefits by 20% for Tennesseans, totaling a loss of about $250 million. It’s not clear when these work requirements will go into effect.

Hurricane Debby brought rainstorms and high winds along Florida’s Big Bend area. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A nonprofit smart growth advocacy organization, 1000 Friends of Florida, is the latest entity calling for the Florida Legislature to repeal portions of a new law designed to expedite post-disaster rebuilding.
The measure (SB 180), sponsored by Pinellas County Republican Nick DiCeglie, initially was hailed as a support for homeowners in providing clear, streamlined permitting requirements to ensure families can make the repairs they need without being hit with higher tax bills.
The bill also increased disaster management planning, emergency resource coordination, financial transparency, and reporting across state and local government disaster management bureaucracies.
However, it’s since become the most controversial new measure signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis this year. The problem? Language barring new local land-use or development regulations considered “restrictive or burdensome,” even if they are completely unrelated to storm recovery.
And the law covers every part of the state, starting retroactively from August of 2024 and going up to October 2027. That’s listed in Section 28 of the law, which says that the new land use laws applies to each county listed in the Federal Disaster Declaration for Hurricanes Debby, Helene, or Milton “and each municipality within one of those counties” last year.
The law specifically says that “any person” can serve a local government with notification of intent to sue on belief the local government has violated the law. The local government then has 14 days to correct any problem. If the government chooses to repeal the restriction, any case would be dropped. If it declines to repeal, that person can go ahead and file a lawsuit.
“This legislative overreach ties the hands of communities striving to address urgent environmental, growth management, and disaster resiliency challenges,” said 1000 Friends of Florida president Paul Owens in a press release on Thursday.
“By undermining local authority, SB 180 puts Floridians at greater risk from flooding, pollution, and unchecked sprawl. We urge lawmakers to act swiftly to repeal these harmful provisions in 2026.”
The law is already having an effect far from its stated original intent to help local residents harmed by a storm. Last week, the Florida Department of Commerce notified Orange County that its new Vision 2050 comprehensive plan — eight years in the making — violated state law and was “null and void.”
That Vision 2050 plan largely updated the county’s guidelines to discourage suburban sprawl and the development of still-untouched rural areas, touching on issues like affordable housing, transportation, and environmental protections.
James D. Stanbury with the Florida Commerce Department’s Bureau of Community Planning and Growth cited language establishing that counties and cities listed in the federal disaster declaration for one of last year’s hurricanes “may not” propose or adopt “more restrictive or burdensome amendments to its comprehensive plan.”
Orange County officials say that they intend to meet with department officials soon to “gain a clearer understanding of their concerns and to receive guidance on next steps.”
Meanwhile, other local governments are scrambling to adapt.
On Tuesday, the Manatee County Commission unanimously authorized staff to collaborate with government regulation staff of Pasco County on submitting a legislative proposal that might “fix” the problems the law has created for local governments, the Bradenton Times reports.
In Volusia County, council members this week voted to request changes for next year’s legislative session.
Deltona City Commissioner Dori Howington doesn’t want to wait until next year to have Tallahassee work on the issue.
“What’s happening is. we’re seeing lawyers lining up to basically attack ordinances that developers have not liked seeing implemented, and as a result, the lawsuits are stacking up against us,” she said. “Anything that you do regarding land use, building codes — anything can be challenged.”
Speaking with members of the St. Petersburg City Council last month, DiCeglie, who lives in a beach community in Pinellas County, spoke about his intentions with the legislation. He was motivated, he said, by the way some local governments came up short in helping residents following last fall’s hurricanes.
“Make sure that the residents know what that plan is when it comes to permitting,” he said.
“What that place is when it comes to storm debris collection. When that plan was not in place [last year], and folks were looking and knocking on the door at City Hall and nobody is answering the door. Nobody is answering the phone calls,” he continued. The fact that local governments are not answering the call of their taxpayer to me was a complete disgrace and an ultimate failure.”
DiCeglie acknowledged that the regulation language was “very broad.”
Fort Lauderdale attorney Jamie Cole has reached out to several local governments about a potential lawsuit challenging some provisions of the law. Although he was unavailable for comment, an associate with his law firm told the Phoenix, “We are hearing from many cities and counties from all over the state, concerned about the impacts of SB 180 and considering whether to join in a lawsuit.”
The Deltona City Commission hasn’t taken a vote yet on whether to join that coalition, Howington said, but likely will consider it soon.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.
“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
 Tax credits axed

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
 A slower, costlier transition

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.
According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

Notably, U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate said during Thursday’s status conference that he’s planning an in-person visit next week to Blossom Apartments, where third-party utility JXN Water shut off service after the owner said he wouldn’t pay over $400,000 in unpaid water bills. The judge also said he wants to have the complex’s owner, Tony Little, appear in court.
But most of Thursday’s status conference focused on Jackson’s sewer contract with Veoilia, which has managed the city’s three wastewater treatment facilities and pumping stations for the past nine years. Jackson has been under a federal consent decree since 2013 over it’s sewer system failures, which include polluting the Pearl River. Wingate placed the sewer operations under JXN Water in 2023.

Earlier this year, WLBT reported, JXN Water manager Ted Henifin clashed with city leaders after he decided to replace Veoilia with Jacobs Solutions, the firm that already manages the city’s water treatment services. Jacobs is set to take over the contract in October. Veoilia’s contract was set to end in November, 2026. 
Henifin, along with several Jacobs employees, attempted on Thursday morning to enter the Savanna Street Wastewater Treatment Plant to meet with Veoilia regarding the transition. But Veolia staff denied Henifin and the Jacobs employees entry, saying they no longer wanted to have their pre-scheduled meeting. 
Matt Johnson, Veolia’s Vice President of Operations, told Wingate that the meeting would have been disruptive to daily operations, and that he didn’t understand the “business sense” of Henifin’s decision to end the contract contract early.

Welch, vice president and client account manager of Jacobs Engineering Group, speaks about Jacobs running the City of Jackson’s water treatment plant operations during a press conference at Hinds Community College in Jackson, Miss., Friday, February 24, 2023.

Henifin said going with Jacobs would save about $800,000 a year, largely because they already have staff in the area. Johnson contested that it would cost $1.2 million to $1.6 million to end its contract early, but Henifin disputed that number, saying Jacobs would attempt to retain all of Veoilia’s staff.
The manager also criticized Veoilia’s performance.
“I’m a little dumbfounded they’re continuing to push this,” Henifin said, arguing the company neglected Jackson for roughly seven years before only recently turning things around.
Johnson, as well as representatives for Jackson, pushed back on Henifin for not going through a competitive process for choosing a new sewer contract, arguing Veolia could have competed with Jacobs’ price if there was an open bidding process. Jackson interim chief administrative officer Pieter Teeuwissen, speaking on behalf of the mayor’s office, agreed that a request for proposals, or RFP, would benefit the city by providing transparency and boosting trust in JXN Water.
The federal order that appointed Henifin over the water and sewer systems allows him to bypass laws around bidding contracts as well as public records. The manager has said before that an RFP process would be expensive and time-consuming.

Wingate made no ruling regarding the contract itself, but told Veoilia that Henifin should have “unfettered” access to all sewer facilities going forward. 
At the end of the status conference, Wingate said he would soon address the question over whether to put Blossom Apartments and another abandoned complex into receiverships.
Representatives with the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign, one of the intervenor plaintiffs, asked whether there was any way to turn water on at Blossom Apartments for just the weekend as Wingate decides how to proceed. Organizer Danyelle Holmes described “inhumane” conditions at the complex, where tenants haven’t had running water for over two weeks. Henifin responded that, short of the judge ordering him to do so, he wouldn’t restore service, emphasizing that neglectful property owners need to face consequences.  
Earlier this week, Mayor John Horhn told reporters that the city is providing potable water to residents as officials work to relocate tenants. 
Horhn also came out against Henifin’s proposal to increase water rates, which Wingate is waiting to rule on as he finds out how the city spent money from its Siemens settlement.
“I’ve gone on record with the judge saying that I’m not in favor of a rate increase,” Horhn said at a press conference. “The people of Jackson are suffering enough under the water availability fee for example, just in order to qualify for getting water, you have to pay a $40 availability fee and a lot of residents have a lot of push back on that.”
The mayor mentioned the potential to reallocate federal funds to help pay for daily water operations. While Henifin has said he’s asking federal officials to do just that, he’s maintained a rate increase would still be necessary.

A new law in Illinois makes tax credits available to help alleviate news deserts.

Forty Illinois local news entities operating 120 outlets are receiving $4 million in state tax credits under a new law designed to encourage the retention and hiring of journalists, according to documents released this week.

The organizations that have received credits represent a cross section of Illinois’ local news ecosystem, according to records obtained through a Freedom of Information request by the Medill Local News Initiative.
They span major legacy organizations, small community newspapers, digital start-ups and public broadcasters. Most of the funding went to organizations outside the Chicago metro area. Nonprofit outlets received 30% of the money. The vast majority of news organizations in Illinois are for-profit.
“What I see is what appears to be a very efficient program at delivering public dollars to a broad range of community news organizations covering almost every corner of Illinois,” said Matt Pearce, director of policy at Rebuild Local News, a nonprofit advocacy group. “I think that’s reflected in the fact that this is a subsidy built into the tax code, and it’s accessible to any eligible publisher.”

So far in Illinois, 61 entities have applied for funding with 49 of those approved. Five applicants had their applications denied and seven more applications remain under review. The Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity did not immediately provide a response to written questions about who was denied and why.
Absent from the list of recipients were the nation’s two largest publishers of local news: Gannett, which publishes 11 dailies in the western and central parts of Illinois, and Alden Global Capital, the investment firm owner of the Chicago Tribune. It’s unclear if they applied and were denied or chose not to apply. Representatives of the companies did not respond to written questions.
The legislation attempted to cap the amount of funding to organizations backed by private funds like Gannett and Alden. One such company, Lee Enterprises, still managed to be the largest recipient of Illinois’ tax credits at $375,000 across applications it submitted for four newspapers in the state.
Earlier this summer, Illinois became the first state in the nation to distribute money directly to local news organizations for employing journalists. The Illinois law is the latest step in the growing movement of state and local governments using legislation to intervene in the local news crisis, even as the federal government clawed back $1.1 billion in funding for public broadcasting last month. Twenty-two states and municipalities have passed or are considering bills to support local news, according to Rebuild Local News.
Medill’s State of Local News Project tracks more than 200 counties without a source of professional local news and an additional 1,500 with only one remaining news source. That covers half of all counties and more than 53 million Americans. Illinois currently has five news desert counties and has lost 45% of its newspapers since 2005. The state lost 54% of its newspaper employees in the decade ending in 2023.
“I think this confirms there’s a great demand, a great need for local media outlets to receive this assistance,” said Illinois State Senator Steve Stadelman (D-Rockford), who chaired the bipartisan Illinois Local Journalism Task Force that studied the crisis and issued a report early last year. “I’m really pleased that we’re getting money out the door already.”
Illinois’ legislation, passed in May 2024, makes available $25 million over five years for local news organizations that hire and retain journalists in the form of refundable tax credits. In its first year, $5 million is available in tax credits broken into two buckets, with $4 million earmarked for retaining journalists and the remaining $1 million for newsrooms that add new journalists. A little over $1 million remains available in 2025, with 78% of the credits for expanding newsrooms unclaimed.
The credits are distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis. To receive funding, outlets must apply and demonstrate eligibility based on certain criteria, including consistent publication of original local content and employment of journalists.
In the closest parallel, New York allocated $90 million over three years for local journalism in its 2024 budget. But that program has stalled in the State Assembly and none of that money has reached New York newsrooms yet.
Don Craven, the president of the Illinois Press Association, expressed satisfaction with the roll-out of the program, while noting that there’s still work to be done to not leave money on the table.
“I know our members who got tax credit certificates were dancing in the aisles,” Craven said.

[…]","The Florida Supreme Court building. (Photo by Colin Hackley)Gov. Ron DeSantis has yet to fill a vacant judgeship in Northeast Florida, and the American Civil Liberties Union is asking the Florida Supreme Court to intervene.
After Eighth Judicial Circuit Judge Mark Mosely announced his retirement earlier this year, the judicial nominating commission for the circuit delivered a list of candidates to the governor. The Florida Constitution requires a governor to appoint a judge within 60 days after he receives the list.
ACLU attorneys representing Gary Edinger, a resident of the judicial circuit, filed a motion in the state high court Friday arguing that DeSantis has violated the Florida Constitution by taking longer than 60 days — the deadline elapsed on Aug. 3 — to name a replacement.
“If the Governor fails to fill this vacancy by August 18, 2025, his appointee may evade the electors until the 2028 election,” Edinger’s attorneys argue in a 14-page petition.
The difference between an appointment before or after Aug. 18 is the difference between the new judge’s first election happening in 2026 or 2028, they contend. Primary elections are scheduled for Aug. 18, 2026. Per the Constitution, appointees don’t need to stand in an election happening less than a year from the date of appointment.
Further delay could give the appointee an “extra two unlawful years” to serve, the motion argues. 
The circuit covers Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Gilchrist, Levy, and Union counties. Mosely had served since 2004. 
“The Governor’s failure leaves the court without a full complement of judges, burdens the People of Florida who rely on a fully functioning judiciary for the efficient administration of justice, and threatens to prevent the Circuit’s voters from having the opportunity to vote on the Governor’s appointee at the next election if he does not fill the vacancy by August 18, 2025 — ten days from today,” Edinger’s attorneys wrote. 
Last month, DeSantis was sued for the same thing in the Second Judicial Circuit, covering Leon County and the surrounding area. DeSantis filled that position seven days after the suit was filed and 11 days after the date constitutionally required.
“However, as explained below, this case warrants an expedited decision by this Court since Petitioner and other Circuit voters will be prejudiced — and indeed irreparably harmed — if the appointment is unlawfully made so late that the appointee is not up for election at the next election, in 2026,” Edinger’s attorneys wrote.

Free.,New lawsuit presses DOJ to release communications about Epstein files,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/new-lawsuit-presses-doj-release-communications-about-epstein-files,,"WASHINGTON — A nonprofit government watchdog sued the Trump administration Friday for failing to respond to public records requests for communications between the White House, Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation about Florida sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including any review of President Donald Trump’s past relationship with the financier.The lawsuit came as the White House continues to face fallout following the Department of Justice’s refusal in early July to release what are commonly referred to as the Epstein files.According to reporting by CNN, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Vice President JD Vance met Wednesday evening at the White House to discuss next steps in addressing the growing scrutiny.The Democracy Forward Foundation filed the lawsuit in district court for the District of Columbia alleging the administration violated the Freedom of Information Act for not responding to the organization’s expedited request within the legally required 10 days.The nonprofit is requesting the court order the DOJ and the FBI to provide a determination and turn over any non-exempt files, including email communication, calendar invites, and Slack and Microsoft Teams messages among officials who reviewed Epstein investigative files this year. The organization also requested records containing information about Trump’s communication with Epstein dating back to 1990.“President Trump has repeatedly said he would release the Epstein files, his spokesperson claims his administration is ‘the most transparent in history,’ and yet, they continue to hide from the American people. The only thing transparent about the Trump-Vance administration is how clearly they continue to disregard our nation’s laws,” Skye Perryman, Democracy Forward’s president and CEO, said in a statement Friday.“Public records laws outline a clear and simple process that requires the government to immediately produce important documents in response to urgent public information requests, and yet again, this administration is ignoring the law. The court should intervene urgently to ensure the public has access to the information they need about this extraordinary situation.”The White House and Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.DOJ says no Epstein ‘client list’ existsThe Trump administration’s handling of Epstein case material has come under a microscope since an unsigned Department of Justice memo on July 7 declared “a systemic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list,’” and department and FBI officials concluded that “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”The DOJ’s refusal to release further information sparked criticism among Trump’s voter base, and even among some administration officials. The memo also roused both Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress, who are now demanding records be released and ex-government officials testify under oath about the investigation into Epstein, who died in a New York City jail cell while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, avoided tough votes compelling the release of Epstein records by sending lawmakers home early for August break.The House Committee on Oversight, chaired by Kentucky Republican James Comer, issued several subpoenas Tuesday to past U.S. attorneys general and former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Epstein surrounded himself with powerful figures through the years, including Trump and the Clintons. A July 23 Wall Street Journal report revealed that Bondi briefed the president in May that his name appeared in the Epstein files. The context in which Trump’s name appears in the investigative material is not clear.In response to failing to fulfill his campaign promise to release the Epstein files, Trump ordered the release of grand jury testimony from the Epstein investigation. A Florida judge swiftly denied that request.Ghislaine Maxwell interviewThe president also dispatched Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to a Florida prison to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse girls. Details of the interview have not been made public. Maxwell has since been moved to a minimum-security facility in Bryan, Texas.The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed Maxwell for an Aug. 11 interview and rejected her recent request for immunity, according to media reports.

Among many other things, the bill included a tax on remittances, which refers to the money immigrants send back to their home countries. This tax was intended to discourage illegal immigration while also raising revenue for the government. Although the tax is only 1%, its impact is not negligible: in aggregate, $100 billion in remittances were sent from the United States in 2024. 
In Connecticut,  16% (1 in 6) of the state’s population is foreign-born immigrants. Based on national averages, over half of them are expected to send remittances back to their home country. When applied to Connecticut’s population, this means that over 300,000 people in this state alone are likely sending remittances. 
These remittances are crucial to many of the countries receiving them. For example, they account for around 25% of GDP in Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, as well as about 20% in Guatemala. Since a significant portion of American remittances is sent to these Central American countries, it is vital to understand how the tax will affect all aspects of their economies and communities. Given their dependence on remittances, any policy affecting these flows has significant consequences. 
While there are ways in which the tax may offer marginal long-term economic benefits for receiving countries, it is ultimately designed in a way that harms impoverished families and disproportionately penalizes immigrants who are positive contributors and play by the rules. 
The tax will have two direct effects: it will reduce the amount of remittances sent and channel them through informal networks. The tax makes it more expensive to send money to a relative, thus making people decide against it. However, instead of not sending the money, people may send it informally. Formal remittances are either sent through a Money Transfer Operator (MTO) or a typical bank, making them easy to tax. However, informally sent remittances are typically delivered in cash by hand– either by the sender, a relative, or a paid contractor. This not only makes informally sent remittances impossible to tax, but also makes them untrackable—and thus easy to use for illicit activity. In fact, the tax was set at only 1% because policymakers feared that if it were any higher, it would encourage the use of informal channels. 
A tax on remittances is not always bad for the countries receiving them. Although remittances often help families in need, they can be damaging to economies, especially those of countries with high poverty rates. When strategically utilized, a tax can mitigate many of the negative impacts of remittances. 
For example, a tax only on remittances sent through MTOs can help increase investments while limiting illegal activity. Investments are an economically productive way to spend remittances, yet due to the dire situation of people receiving them, only 1% of remittances are allocated toward this purpose. The other 99% is used for consumption (usually of necessities), which creates a long-term reliance on remittances while also having inflationary impacts. 
Taxing remittances sent through MTOs incentivizes senders to use banks instead, giving banks more money to finance loans, which people can use for investments. Additionally, money sent through MTOs can be picked up in cash with limited identification, allowing illegal operations to use them. For example, drug smugglers can bring substances into the country, sell them, and then send the profits back to their home country to help fuel the cycle. A tax on MTOs would disrupt this illegal activity and make it less profitable. However, such smugglers would still be able to continue their activity by either paying the tax or finding a way to send money illegally. 
The tax included in the bill, though, was not just for MTOs, but for all remittances sent from the United States. This may still contribute to reducing reliance on remittances abroad in the long term, but it will also harm families living in poverty in the short term. Unlike a tax only on MTOs, this offers almost no untaxed alternative for senders (though there are a few rare exceptions). To be fair, the tax is small, but given the value of American dollars in the receiving countries, the financial loss is far from negligible. The primary intent of the tax is to discourage illegal immigration, and it was initially planned to be levied only on undocumented immigrants. However, the bill was later amended, and in doing so, the tax now reflects a broader—and arguably less focused—policy choice, drifting from the original rationale. Additionally, for the undocumented immigrants who are affected, the tax will only penalize those who send money through legal channels while failing to address those who bypass the system entirely. 
Overall, when a policy is enacted, it is essential to remember the original intentions. If the point is to discourage illegal immigration, then it would make more sense to levy the tax exclusively on undocumented immigrants, even if that means raising the percentage of the tax. If the purpose is to specifically discourage shady activity funded by the remittances of undocumented immigrants, then a tax only on remittances sent through MTOs might be more effective. Lastly, if the goal is to mitigate the adverse economic effects on the receiving countries, the most effective approach may be to influence the policies adopted by those countries, encouraging them to prioritize economically productive spending and take measures to prevent illegal activity. 
Because of this tax’s lack of precision and focus on a specific issue, hard-working American immigrants and their families may be harmed, including the nearly 600,000 in Connecticut.

The state hasn't had any new measles cases reported in about three weeks. (Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Kansas reported no new measles cases for the third week in a row Wednesday, and health officials are encouraging parents to vaccinate their children as they return to school next week to keep that trend going. 
The lack of new cases puts Kansas about halfway through the 42 days required for a measles outbreak to be considered over, which is two incubation periods of 21 days each, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Close proximity in classrooms creates the ideal environment for the spread of measles, considered the most contagious vaccine-preventable disease, said Karen Winkelman, public health director for the Barton County Health Department. 
She said county health officials maintain a strong working relationship with schools, which helps speed communications if there is a measles case.
“With measles, it’s going to be quick action, quick notification,” she said, adding that they’re also encouraging schools to adopt and teach strong hygiene practices.
Handwashing, good practices when sneezing and coughing, and encouraging parents to keep their children home when they have symptoms are among the practices Winkelman highlighted.
“Also review immunization records, making sure they are properly and appropriately vaccinated, and also just being honest, up front,” she said. “We’re not going to force vaccination, but we want you to know what the consequences are if there would happen to be an exposure.”
With a 21-day incubation period, an unvaccinated child who has been exposed may not be able to attend school for that time period.
School vaccination data from 2025 isn’t available yet, but many Kansas school districts last year reported decreased vaccination rates, according to Kansas State Department of Education data. For instance, the Gray County kindergarten vaccination rate dropped from 76% in the 2022-23 school year to 66% in 2023-24. Stevens County dropped from 98% to 83% in the same time period.
Ninety cases of measles have been reported in 12 Kansas counties since January, according to Kansas Department of Health and Environment data. Most of the cases, 87, are related to an outbreak, which occurs when three or more cases are linked to each other. 
The last new Kansas measles cases were reported during the week of July 6. 
“Certainly we can hope that the current outbreak situation is improved and nearly ending,” said Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control at the University of Kansas Health System.
But Hawkinson said measles cases continue to increase at the national level. The CDC reported 1,356 confirmed cases of measles as of Wednesday.
Communicating about the importance of vaccines continues to be important, he said. Many people still quote information that has been thoroughly researched and debunked, Hawkinson said.
“There have continued to be publications which continue to support the safety and benefits of vaccines, but especially the (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine,” he said. “There continue to be new, updated, well-done studies that show the safety of these vaccines.”
Hawkinson referenced a recent Denmark study of 1.2 million children born between 1997 and 2018 that found no association between minute amounts of aluminum in vaccines and long-term health impacts.
“I think we have to continue to promote honest science and transparency, and it is a battle against disinformation, which has persisted and really grown in the past few decades,” he said.
Hawkinson said vaccine information has become intertwined with political and societal views.
“When we’re talking about our mechanic or our lawyer or our electrician, we will listen to them and take their advice,” he said. “But when it comes to the most important thing, we are finding it harder and harder, as a society, to take the advice of those people and those experts who are dedicating their lives and their training and their every day to giving accurate information and trying to keep individuals and communities healthy.”
Hawkinson said it’s important for parents to make informed decisions about their children’s health, and to also consider that an illness like measles can have an economic impact in terms of missed work and medical costs.
Before the measles vaccine was available in the 1960s, most people were infected with the measles virus, with about 400 to 500 people dying each year; 48,000 being hospitalized; and 1,000 suffering from encephalitis, or brain swelling, the CDC website said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2202122534.jpg,,,2025-08-08 12:57:28.716050

I was down on my hands and knees working in my garden. I glanced up to see Donna standing calmly above me. “We need to go to the emergency room,” Donna said, leaning on a cane, her leg stiff, the right side of her face drooping, her eye enlarging.
“You’re having a stroke. Get in the car right away!” I dashed into the house to grab my purse. Out my window, I could see the windmill repairman heading through Donna’s pasture gate, but I didn’t have time to deal with him. In minutes, we were speeding the 15 miles to the nearest hospital.
Donna and I, two English, or non-Amish women, have lived side-by-side in the middle of the Old Order Amish region for years. I moved into an old Amish schoolhouse in 1988, and fixed it up into a livable abode. The schoolhouse still held one lonely desk in the middle of the large room with layers of dust on the floor. There were two bathrooms, a boys’ and a girls’. I knocked down a wall, installed a shower, and created one restroom.
The schoolhouse had a long counter under the south windows. When I ran a sponge over the top of the counter, big chunks of linoleum came off in my hand. So, I ripped out the counter and installed a sink and cabinets. I went to the used appliance store and purchased an apartment-sized stove and refrigerator. Voila! I had a kitchen.
I began cooking meals, feeling right at home, except for one thing. The green house right next door. Here I was in the middle of nowhere, and I had another house butting up against me. There was an Amish phone booth in the garage of the house. Five or six families shared the phone there, and I loved the comings and goings this created.
My Amish neighbors pulled into my drive, hitching their horses to a couple of old T-Posts on my property. The Amish can use a phone but can’t have one in their house where it would inevitably ring whenever they sat down to a family dinner.
Harriet, the owner of the green house, didn’t care for the Amish and complained that they ran up her electricity bill through the one bare bulb that hung down from the ceiling in the tiny phone booth. Over the course of the year, there was a stand-off with Harriet scattering cinders and even some broken glass in her lane to prevent the Amish from using the phone.
“Darn it,” I said to myself one evening when I was doing my dishes. “Here I am in a beautiful neighborhood, except for that woman who lives in the green house. And the house is right next to me.”
Then after a year, a FOR SALE sign went up in front of the green house, and soon Donna and her husband Stu moved in. They painted the green house yellow. They cleaned up all the cinders and glass. They took an old flag pole down and made it into a hitching post, welcoming the Amish.
“Whoa, this was better,” I thought. My only complaint was the bright yard light that Stu installed. It ruined my stargazing, but I tried to let that go. I resisted the urge to shoot out the yard light bulb with the slingshot I kept on hand to drive away diseased cats and raccoons.
“When we moved into our house,” Donna told me years later. “I thought everything was perfect except for that old schoolhouse right next to us. And why would that woman be living in that old wreck of a building? I wish we could get rid of her.”
The day of her stroke, I stayed at the hospital with Donna, moving through various tests with her, an MRI, then a CAT scan, waiting for the neurologist to appear on a little TV screen beside her gurney. Finally, Donna was admitted to the hospital floor, and her son and daughter-in-law who had just gotten off work, stepped into the room.
Donna had been a city mouse, raising her family in an urban area until her five children were grown. Then she talked Stu into moving to the country. Once here, she quickly transformed into a country mouse, leaving her children to scatter to other cities in the U.S.
I drove home to grab a bite to eat, then crashed into bed. The next morning, I arose early, only to spy Donna’s two lambs wandering through her front yard, heading toward the road. Yup, the gate to the pasture was wide open, probably an oversight from the windmill repairman.
  (Photo by Mary Swander)
I shooed the lambs back into the pasture, and tried to close the gate, but the latch didn’t close securely. I found an old piece of wire and made a temporary repair. Then I saw that the gate didn’t fit against the adjoining pole. There was a gap wide enough for the lambs to wiggle through. I threaded a bungee cord through the gate and wrapped it around the pole, pulling it tight.
“There,” I thought. “That’s a bit of a girl fix, but it should hold until I can get help with this gate.”
A couple of hours later, the lambs were out again. This time, I watched them step right through Donna’s wooden gates. In the past, Donna had kept horses, and the wooden gates with their wide slats had always been enough to keep those animals contained. But after her divorce from Stu and the death of her favorite gelding, Donna decided to concentrate on more manageable critters.
But once again, the lambs, and Donna’s three high-stepping geese, went right through the wooden gates. This time, it took me a good couple of days to get the sheep and geese back where they belonged. The geese turned into versions of Daffy Duck, laughing at the barnyard dance. No handful of grain or hay would lure them. Off and on, for 48 hours, we do-si-doed, until the animals finally gave up.
Ding!
A text from Donna’s daughter-in-law.
We assume all is well and
you are taking care of the
animals.
I replied that I could use a little help with the gates out here. No help arrived. I covered the gates with some old pieces of cattle panel and more bungee cords.
Ding!
Can’t you just put
the lambs in with yours?
I explained that I could bring Donna’s lambs to my place and blend them in with mine, but then I would have to mow Donna’s hilly 2-acre pasture.
Ding!
Why don’t you just
put Donna’s lambs
in her barn?
I could do that if I could get them to go in there. And it’s so hot … It would be best if we could just fix the gates properly. Then I would be happy to care for them until I could take them to slaughter in the fall.
Ding!
Slaughter??????
Oh, no, I thought, the city mice are vegetarians. These lambs aren’t pets, I explained. They are livestock.
Ding!
We are contacting
the Humane Society
to take the lambs.
Good grief, I said. That isn’t necessary.
I called my handywoman and got on her list. A month later, she arrived, and we worked for a whole day together, fixing the gates and latches with new screws, with hardware cloth and cattle panels.
Later that day, I visited Donna in the rehab unit and told her that everything was fine, don’t worry about the animals or the house. We had been good neighbors long enough that we knew how to support one another.
“I can’t thank you enough,” Donna said.
She paused then turned to me. “And why don’t you see if you can bring my lambs with yours to slaughter in the fall.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/08/ct-state-worker-overtime-payroll/,"Connecticut spent a record $316 million in overtime last fiscal year, but overall spending, adjusted for inflation, is down from 2011.","Connecticut state government continues to struggle with a payroll quandary.
Overtime spending has continued to rise, hitting a new record in the fiscal year that closed June 30 and frustrating business leaders who see it as an unstable weakness in government finances.
But spending on overall compensation — including base wages and bonuses as well as overtime — has declined over the last decade-and-a-half once adjusted for inflation, as Connecticut has been slow to refill the thousands of public-sector jobs it shed during the 2010s.
According to Comptroller Sean Scanlon’s OpenPayroll website, the state’s total compensation bill was $5.8 billion in 2024. In 2011, it was just shy of $4.4 billion, which, after adjusting for inflation, represented $6.1 billion.
Overtime has become increasingly controversial in recent years. State employee unions argue that agencies are dangerously understaffed and much of that overtime is mandatory, exhausting staff and weakening morale. But business leaders and other critics note that overtime earnings are included in worker pension calculations.
“It’s a double jeopardy — taxpayers pay now and then get hit again when soaring overtime costs drive up overall state employee retirement liabilities,” Connecticut Business and Industry Association President Chris DePentima wrote in a recent post on the association’s website.
DePentima was referring to a report from the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis that found state government spent $316.3 million in overtime in the 2024-25 fiscal year, up $15 million or 5% from the prior 12 months.
The CBIA noted that’s also up $11 million from the record-high $305.4 million in overtime spending set just two years ago.
Business leaders have long cautioned against the huge pension debt Connecticut amassed over more than seven decades prior to 2011 by not saving properly for benefits pledged to state workers and to municipal teachers.
Connecticut entered last fiscal year with $35 billion in unfunded pension obligations. Coupled with another $44 billion the state either owes to its retiree health care program or carries in bonded debt, the $79 billion total makes Connecticut one of the most indebted states, per capita, in the nation.
When pension debt is high, the state must devote more of its annual budget to cover that expense. The minimum annual contributions Connecticut must make to its pensions already top $3.4 billion, more than 14% of the General Fund.
“We’ve got an affordability crisis in Connecticut — particularly with energy, housing, and child care — and that’s not going to get resolved if policymakers don’t curb state spending,” DePentima said.
Minority Republican legislators introduced a bill spring to remove overtime earnings from pension calculations, but it was killed by the Democratic-controlled Labor and Public Employees Committee. 
State officials have been working since 2017 to whittle down pension debt, employing aggressive savings measures that critics say harm core programs like education, health care and municipal aid.
Since 2020, Connecticut has deposited more than $8.5 billion from budget surpluses into its pension funds. And though a final audit of 2024-25 finances won’t be completed until late September, Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration estimates that surplus will be almost $2.6 billion, which is the second-largest in state history. Most of that cushion also is expected to go into the pension funds.
Does CT government face a staffing crisis?
State employee unions, and much of the legislature’s Democratic majority, say pension debt is far from Connecticut’s only concern.
During Gov. Dannel P. Malloy’s tenure, which ran from 2011 through 2018, he and lawmakers used attrition and hiring freezes to mitigate several deficits, ultimately shrinking the Executive Branch workforce by 10%.
Lamont, who took office in 2019, has refilled some of those vacant posts and negotiated pay hikes of about 4.5% per year between 2021 and 2025 to help attract and retain staff.
But unions were pressed to grant wage and benefit concessions in 2011 and 2017, which have made staff retention more challenging.
More than 4,400 veteran state workers retired in the first six months of 2022, leaving before more stringent limits on pension benefits took effect. 
That event became known as the “silver tsunami.” The state typically has about 2,000 to 2,500 retirements in a full year.
The 44,542 positions authorized in last fiscal year’s state budget across all agencies is still down 16% from the 51,509 authorized in 2011.
Labor advocates note the bulk of overtime earned in recent years has been in those agencies with the worst staffing problems, particularly within the prison system.
The Department of Correction accounted for $118.8 million or 38% of overtime spending recorded last fiscal year by the state’s chief human resources database, which does not include the University of Connecticut. Correction had paid $107.3 million in overtime in the prior fiscal year.
Bianca Stedman, a correction department nurse and member of SEIU 1199NE, the state’s largest health care workers’ union, said “severe understaffing” is making it increasingly difficult to get inmates care in a timely manner.
“Instead, we are struggling to deal with the ever-growing inmate population as our workforce just continues to shrink,” she said. “We are constantly overworked, overwhelmed and exhausted. Staff at DOC, not just health care, but across the board, are leaving in droves. Retention and recruitment are at all-time lows.”
Most of the remaining overtime from 2024-25 was paid out by four other departments:

Mental Health and Addiction Services, $62.9 million.


Emergency Services and Public Protection, $46.3 million.


Developmental Services, $42.6 million.


Children and Families, $30.3 million.

Though Connecticut spends more per capita on pension benefits than most other states do, about three-quarters of that involves covering payments past generations of taxpayers failed to make. In other words, most pension spending has little to do with funding the eventual retirement benefits for present-day workers.
In addition, the gradual downsizing of the state’s workforce has greatly controlled overall compensation spending, which involves base salaries and bonuses as well as overtime.
“Something needs to change,” Stedman added.  “Unfortunately. the hiring freezes, threats to our pension and constant denial of necessary positions for our facilities … are not the way to address the issue.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_057-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 11:58:25.598168

Having a loved one in prison or jail is estimated to cost families across the United States nearly $350 billion each year, according to a recent report from the criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)U.S. families lose nearly $350 billion each year due to the incarceration of a loved one in jail or prison, according to a recent report from the criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us. The estimate includes both direct expenses and long-term losses in household income.
The findings are based on a national survey of just over 1,600 adults conducted in partnership with researchers at Duke University and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
Families reported losing an average of $1,803 in income per month when a loved one is incarcerated. That includes the loss of the incarcerated person’s wages and may also reflect reduced work hours by family members to manage court proceedings or provide child care, according to the report.
The researchers also found that families spend an average of $4,200 annually per incarcerated relative.
These expenses include phone and email communication, travel for visits, child care and commissary purchases — such as food, hygiene products and clothing — some of which are marked up as much as 600% above retail prices, according to the report.
The burden is especially acute for Black families, who reported significantly higher expenses, according to the report. Black families reported spending an average of $8,005 per year supporting incarcerated loved ones — 2.5 times more than white families with an average of $3,251.
One in 5 family members reported being forced to move due to a loved one’s incarceration, including 1 in 3 children of incarcerated parents, according to the report. Overall, 9% of family members said they experienced a period of homelessness, a figure that rose to 18% — or roughly 1 in 6 — among those who had an incarcerated parent.
Low wages for incarcerated people, often just cents per hour, only deepen this strain, leaving families to fill in the financial gaps, according to the report. Meanwhile, extended prison lockdowns, staff shortages and overcrowded conditions have further limited access to basic services, including phone calls, visitation, medical care and rehabilitative programming.
Researchers also identified long-term economic consequences after incarceration. Collectively, formerly incarcerated individuals lose an estimated $111 billion in wages each year due to limited job opportunities, according to the report. The report also found long-term financial consequences for children of incarcerated parents, who collectively lose $215 billion in annual earnings — an average of nearly $4,500 per adult child each year.
The survey has some limitations. Many of the cost estimates were self-reported and rounded by participants. Still, previous research has reached similar conclusions. A 2017 report from the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization, estimated that mass incarceration costs governments and the families of incarcerated people at least $182 billion annually.
In 2023, the most recent year available, state governments spent more than $66 billion on corrections, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances. That total does not include the additional financial support provided by families of incarcerated people.
Preliminary national data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics shows the U.S. prison population is once again on the rise. At the end of 2023, there were more than 1.25 million people in state and federal prisons, a 2% increase from the previous year. The vast majority were serving sentences longer than one year and were held in state prisons.
The male prison population rose by 2% in 2023, while the number of incarcerated women rose by 4%. Still, both figures remain below their 2013 levels.
Researchers projected that if incarceration rates remain steady, families could face $3.5 trillion in cumulative financial losses over the next decade.

Those plans ignited significant controversy earlier this summer when the Army Corps released an initial proposal to expand its use of herbicides at a dozen sites along the lower portion of the river.
While those plans were in fact part of a years-long effort to study the effectiveness of using herbicides to control hydrilla, they quickly became the subject of viral social media posts laden with inaccuracies and conspiracy theories about the government’s intentions. In particular, many of those posts focused one chemical included in Army Corps’ plans — diquat dibromide.
In an attempt to clear the air, officials extended the public comment period for the project until August and held both in-person and virtual events to answer questions from the press and the public.
On Wednesday, the Army Corps held an online meeting to announce an update to its plans.
Beginning on Aug. 19, officials said, they plan to apply herbicide treatments to Selden Cove in Lyme and the Chester Boat Basin. Only the Chester location will receive treatments of diquat combined with another herbicide, endothall, according to the Corps’ plans. Selden Cove will be treated with only endothall.
Both treatments are scheduled to last two days, concluding on Aug 20. If weather or field conditions prevent the project from moving forward on those days, alternative dates are available the following week. (One alternate location, Middletown’s Pameacha Pond, was also included in the Corps’ schedule.)
The decision to pare the number of treatment sites down from 12 to two was due to a lapse in federal funding available for the project, according to Keith Hannon, the project manager for the Army Corps’ New England District. Last year, the project received $5 million in funding from Congress.
In addition to the two sites selected for herbicide treatments, Hannon said officials also plan to continue a related series of hydrological studies using colorful dyes at a handful of spots along the river, including a new location in Agawam, Mass.
“We are limited in what we’re able to do this year,” Hannon said. “The dye studies do have a cost, but they’re cheaper, so we’re able to do those, and those will directly inform the study and future riverside applications.”
Those dye studies date back to 2023, when research scientists working with the Army Corps began using dyes to study the flow of water in areas afflicted by hydrilla to determine which herbicides to use in specific concentrations to avoid harming other native species of wildlife. Based on those results, the Army Corps first started applying herbicides, including diquat, at five areas along the river last summer.
In follow-up sampling at those locations, researchers recorded large declines in the amount of hydrilla, with minimal impacts to native plants, according to results shared at Wednesday’s meeting. This summer, however, the hydrilla has returned in Chester Boat Basin and, to a larger extent, in Selden Cove.
Among the concerns raised by members of the public at Wednesday’s meeting was the potential impact on swimmers at a children’s summer camp at Hamburg Cove, down river from the two treatment areas.
Anne Overstreet, the director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s  Pesticide Re-Evaluation Division, said the agency did not find any information to justify those concerns during its most recent review of diquat in 2020.
“The bottom line is, if the labeled directions are being followed, there are no concerns from people swimming or coming into contact with water that’s been treated with diquat,” Overstreet said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5345047.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

Ro Khanna of California visited Jackson to highlight a technology job training initiative with Jackson State University he’s spearheading as part of a larger effort to connect the tech sector to historically Black colleges and universities.
Khanna, a Democrat, represents Silicon Valley, home to Google, Nvidia, and Apple. His Thursday visit is part of the congressman’s broader effort to connect Black communities, particularly in the Deep South, with the uber-wealthy companies in his home district.  
“We need a generation of people who are participating in the modern digital economy that are being trained and educated right here in Jackson,” Khanna said at the Smith Robertson Museum in downtown Jackson.
The program gives $5,000 scholarships to students at Jackson State University and allows them to participate in an 18-month course, according to Khanna. After completing the program, the graduates are usually offered a lucrative job in the technology sector, with a starting salary ranging from $65,000 to $80,000. 
“You have to bring the digital revolution to the Black South,” Khanna said. 
The son of Indian immigrants, Khanna and his family have a deep appreciation for the Civil Rights movement and the Mississippi organizers at its epicenter. 
The California lawmaker said his grandfather was jailed in India for four years for his support of Mahatma Gandhi’s movement for independence from the British Empire. That same movement in India inspired the nonviolent organizing tactics utilized by Civil Rights leaders such as Medgar Evers, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lewis. 
“The Civil Rights movement then led to the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, and that’s what led my parents to come to the United States,” Khanna said. 
Despite its rich civil rights history and status as the Blackest state in the nation, Mississippi is sometimes overlooked by the national Democratic Party because of the state’s overall conservative electorate. 
Khanna told Mississippi Today in an interview that the national Democratic Party should invest more in Mississippi. If it supports organizing efforts, he said, the Magnolia State could become competitive in statewide elections. 
Beyond politics, the lawmaker said the party and nation did not support the capital city enough during the Jackson Water crisis that left thousands of residents without clean running water and has not put Mississippi at the front and center of economic development. 
“Anyone who wants to understand the history of segregation, the history of racial justice, has to understand Mississippi,” Khanna said. “And anyone who wants to see the hope and promise of economic development has to come here.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/07140810/IMG_7163.jpg,,,2025-08-08 11:58:25.598168
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-08 15:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Renters displaced by UConn apartment purchase demand changes,Abigail Brone | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/08/stamford-uconn-apartments/,Displacement from may force renters to move into an apartment that makes them ineligible for a middle-income housing program.,"Stamford resident Brittany Lawrence moved into her home at The BLVD Apartments in downtown Stamford nine years ago. It was Lawrence’s first apartment after college.
Now, Lawrence is planning her next move as The BLVD Apartments on Washington Boulevard are in the process of being sold to the University of Connecticut. The building will be converted into dormitories for UConn Stamford.
Lawrence first received notice of the building’s sale and plans for tenant relocation from an email and notice on her door in February.
“I’m in an affordable unit, and those leases are renewable by recertification,” Lawrence said. “So if you’re not going to renew after my current term, what happens? And that was my question, basically.”
Lawrence is a member of the city-run affordable housing program, Below Market Rate (BMR), which is geared toward renters earning 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI). At BLVD there are nine affordable apartments.
Displacement may force renters to move into an apartment that makes them ineligible for the middle-income program, and city officials have been unhelpful, Lawrence said.
“‘Sorry’ is not going to keep people housed. ‘Sorry’ is not going to help the families that you claim to want to help,” Lawrence said. “All in all, it’s a state of vulnerableness that you know is a problem because you market it to the vulnerable population.”
Lawrence fears she and other residents at the BLVD apartments will now take whatever apartment they can get.
“When you have people that have nothing, whose hopes and dreams rely on you saying ‘This is what we can do for you,’ or ‘This is what we can offer you,’ you put them in a state of desperation that they’re not able to think through what those long term implications can be,” Lawrence said.
What Stamford’s BMR program means
Residents partnered with the Connecticut Tenants Union (CTTU) are advocating for reforms to the city’s Below Market Rate program.
In Stamford, the BMR program is tied to the affordable apartments, not the tenants, according to CTTU Vice President Luke Melonakos-Harrison. Unlike traditional voucher-based programs like Section 8 or Rental Assistance Program, once the tenants are moved out, they have to start over and reapply for the BMR program.
“People are clinging to these units for dear life. What these tenants are pushing for is recognition that once you’re in the BMR program, for that to mean something,” Melonakos-Harrison said. “If you get displaced by something like this, they’re leasing it to UConn, now all of those apartments are lost.”
Union members outlined five key requests for the city, including a freezing of the annual eligibility certification to protect tenants from disqualification due to income changes, household shifts, or evolving city policies caused by their involuntary displacement.
Tenants asked Stamford officials to give low-income renters from BLVD priority for new affordable apartments, and keep the BMR status dependent on the tenant rather than the apartment.
“Those tenants should be recognized as having a special status because they were in this program,” Melonakos-Harrison said.
The current co-owners, RMS Companies and the Wolff Company, informed tenants they need to move out of BLVD by April 2026, Melonakos-Harrison said. Neither RMS nor Wolff responded to Connecticut Public’s request for comment.
The tentative plan was for BMR renters to move into market rate housing, with RMS/Wolff paying the rent difference until the completion of the company’s next Stamford venture; the renovation of a former Burlington store into nearly 300 apartments.
UConn Stamford’s Chief Administrative Officer Jennifer Orlikoff said she’s impressed with RMS and Wolff’s effort to smooth over the transition for residents.
“They are going out of their way to pay for relocation costs, especially for the tenants who are below market rate,” Orlikoff said. “They are providing interim housing for them as well and just and I think, general guidance for folks who are looking for other places to live in town.”
By late August, about 100 UConn students will be moved into the BLVD building. The newly-converted apartments were part of the general flow of apartment vacancies, not the result of forced displacement, Orlikoff said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0216-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

After years of protesting his innocence of murder charges and failing to convince any court, Pointer cut a deal to trade his life without parole sentence for a 23-year term on two counts of second degree murder […]","Deandre Pointer, a man incarcerated at the Jefferson City Correctional Center, discusses his legal effort to get his parole date recalculated. If the date is not changed, Pointer will serve 40 years on a 23-year sentence (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).When Deandre Pointer appeared in front of a Jackson County judge in June 2023, his world was bright.
After years of protesting his innocence of murder charges and failing to convince any court, Pointer cut a deal to trade his life without parole sentence for a 23-year term on two counts of second degree murder and two counts of armed criminal action.
He had been in custody for 21 years and thought the deal would mean he’d served enough time to be released in 2024. 
“The only reason why I took this plea was that my father was sick,” Pointer said in an interview with The Independent at the Jefferson City Correctional Center.
But when a Missouri Department of Corrections record clerk finished processing his paperwork, Pointer’s world turned dark.
Instead of being given almost 7,000 days of credit for time served on all four charges, Pointer was allowed credit only for 557 days jail time before his 2005 trial on three of the four counts. 
He is not eligible for release until 2044.
As a result, he is back in court seeking a ruling that the records clerk made an error. For himself, and others who feel they have been short-changed on their time-served credits, the outcome of those cases will determine if they go home or stay in prison.
Over almost 20 years in state prison, Pointer, 52, maintained hope he would find a way out. He worked in the license plate factory, paid his attorney out of the 80 cents an hour he earned, maintained contact with his family and became an ordained minister.
“I never took anxiety meds,” Pointer said in an interview with The Independent. “Never in my life. Now, you know, I have to take anxiety meds just to have a functional day.”

On Monday: A working group created by Missouri’s governor seeks to address myriad issues with the state’s parole process.

Pointer’s situation is tied to how parole dates are initially calculated, something that happens within 90 days of a person arriving to serve their sentence. Other people in custody complain that the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole’s new interpretation of parole policies that state how much time must be served for one particular charge — armed criminal action — pushed their possible release date back, in some cases a decade or more.
Advocates say there could be hundreds of others across the 19 adult prisons who thought they’d served enough time to be eligible for parole but were suddenly and unexpectedly years away from being released. 
Kent Gipson, an attorney from Kansas City who represents Pointer in his court battles, has handled several cases challenging the reinterpretation of how much time must be served for an armed criminal action charge.
“You get your sentence reduced, and then they recalculate it and say that you have to do more time than you did before you got your sentence reduced,” Gipson said. “This can’t be right.”
Gipson called the Board of Probation and Parole’s change to armed criminal action sentences “egregious,” because “those guys actually had parole hearings scheduled, and they took them away from and said, ‘Sorry, we’re moving it back 15 years because we’re changing this rule.’”
The board was using its authority and did not change how much of a life sentence must be served, even if those charged with armed criminal action think it was changed, Steven Mueller, operations manager for the board, wrote in an email.
“There is no maximum release date on any life sentence and release is at the discretion of the board,” he wrote.
For several months now, Pointer has been waiting for a court ruling in two cases challenging the calculation. Meanwhile, prisoner advocates are hopeful a working group empaneled by Gov. Mike Kehoe will address the issue. 
Kehoe directed the group to bring “clarity, transparency and accountability” to the parole process.
Parole policy or rule changes that would extend the time to be served for particular crimes or sentences should be forward-looking, applying only to new convictions, Clifton Davis of the Missouri Justice Coalition, a group that advocates for better treatment of incarcerated people, testified at the working group’s June 13 public hearing.
“While (armed criminal action) carries a minimum, internal practices often add years that were not imposed by the sentencing court,” Davis said. “We ask that this working group ensure that the board’s decision reflects legislative sentencing intent, not internal enhancements.”
 The calculation

 The Jefferson City Correctional Center (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Under the Missouri criminal code, second-degree murder since 1994 has been considered a dangerous felony, with a requirement that the offender serve at least 85% of their sentence before being considered for release. 
For a 23-year sentence like Pointer’s, that is a little more than 19 and one-half years.
When Pointer pleaded guilty and was resentenced, he had been held for 6,929 days, or 18.9 years.
In the calculation Pointer received on his return to prison, he found he was being required to serve 18 of the 23 years, or until 2039, on the armed criminal action charges. That was done based on the 2019 parole regulation revisions. 
But that isn’t his release date, just the date that he will finish those charges. The second-degree murder conviction carries a requirement that he serve 85% of the 23-year sentence, with a release date in 2044.
The change impacted anyone who had a parole hearing on an armed criminal action conviction scheduled after Sept. 1, 2019, moving their hearing date a decade or more into the future. Those who received a hearing, and a release date, before the revisions were issued went home.  
Advocates are uncertain how many other incarcerated people are serving sentences that extend beyond the time they were told to expect parole when they arrived in prison. 
 Pointer’s charges

On June 12, 2003, Pointer was at his rented home in Kansas City when Eddie Hall, who he was allowing to stay with him, arrived with a woman named Angela Ray.
After they smoked crack cocaine, according to court records, Hall pulled a gun, forced Ray to have sex, then bound and strangled her. Hall disposed of Ray’s body with Pointer’s help, prosecutors claimed in court documents, by loading her into the trunk of her rented car, driving to an undeveloped area and setting it on fire. 
Five days later, Hall and Pointer were home when Bobby Roby, a cousin of Pointer, and another woman arrived in the evening. Near midnight, according to the statement Pointer made to police, Hall again pulled a gun, tied Pointer to a chair with speaker wire, bound Roby with duct tape to a basement support pole and raped the woman. 
Hall then strangled Roby to death and forced the woman to go with him to dump the body in a pond by threatening to kill her children. They then returned to Pointer’s home, where he had been tied to a chair.
About 12 hours later, Pointer went to a police division station and reported both murders. When police returned to his home, they arrested Hall and freed the woman.
The initial court filing on Hall names Pointer as a victim. In an interview with The Independent, he said he didn’t go to police immediately after Ray’s death because of fear of violence from Hall or his friends. 
Ray was killed, Pointer claims, because she had testified against one of Hall’s friends.
A year later, the woman involved changed her story and accused Pointer of participating in her rape and the choking death of Roby. 
Pointer was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. 
The charges were later amended to add second-degree murder for the death of Ray.
After his October 2005 trial, Pointer said, prosecutors offered him a deal of 18 to 20 years in prison if he would testify against Hall. But Pointer says he was forced at gunpoint to help dispose of Ray’s body, and was tied to a chair during Roby’s murder. So he believed he was innocent and was unwilling to admit to committing a crime.
“I told (the prosecutor) I would testify, but I do not want to take the plea for something I did not do,” Pointer said. “I testified, but I didn’t take the plea, because I wanted to keep my appeals open.”
Pointer was convicted in 2005 and sentenced to life in prison without parole on the first-degree murder charge and life in prison on second-degree murder and the two counts of armed criminal action. The terms were to be served consecutively.
Hall was convicted of a single count of first degree murder in December 2005 and is now serving life without parole.
 Conviction reversed

One of the most common ways to challenge a sentence or conviction, in addition to a direct appeal, is called post-conviction relief.
Defendants who plead guilty lose their direct appeal rights. A person in prison can have the conviction or sentence set aside by successfully showing the constitution has been violated, or an attorney has failed in some manner.
After his direct appeals were exhausted, that’s what Pointer did in October 2007. A public defender was appointed to represent him. But in February 2008, after finding that Pointer filed a document too late, the judge rescinded the appointment and dismissed the case.
In 2022 Gipson succeeded in reopening Pointer’s post-conviction relief case on the grounds that he had been abandoned by his public defender in 2008. That’s when negotiations began with the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney’s office ultimately leading to the original conviction being set aside so Pointer could plead guilty to two counts of second degree murder and two of armed criminal action.
At the June 1, 2023, resentencing, Gipson conceded prosecutors had enough evidence to convict Pointer of the restated charges. And before he was formally resentenced, Burnett took testimony from Myesha Robertson, the daughter of Bobby Roby, and Ruthie Kidd, the mother of Angela Ray.
They, too, thought Pointer would be released soon.
“It definitely infuriates me that after 20 years I stand here or sit here today only because you are remorseful for the position you put yourself in,” Robertson said.
She saw no justice in the resentencing, she said.
“Your actions have caused an indefinite void in my life,” she said.
Kidd said she believed in capital punishment and that Pointer should not be released.
“I feel it’s most unfortunate that I work every day, and my and others taxes go to feed this man, clothe him, house him, cool him, exercise him, at our expense,” Kidd said. “He’s taken something from us that we can…that he can’t give back, that we can never get back.”
 Other cases

 Steven Tyler Decker, third from left, is incarcerated at the Jefferson City Correctional Center, where he feels his remaining time before parole has been miscalculated. He is shown in a family photo with, from left, Blake Decker, a brother, Fabian Camacho, an uncle, and his son Ryan (Submitted photo).
Steven Tyler Decker, like Pointer, feels he is being shortchanged on jail time credit.
In March 2021, Decker was charged with first-degree murder for a killing that occurred at a Kansas City motel. After charges were reduced to second degree murder, he was allowed to post a $50,000 bond while he waited for trial.
Before he could be tried, however, he was arrested on drug and weapons charges. The judge in that case ordered he be held without bond, but the bond in his earlier case was never revoked.
That, he said in a telephone interview from the Jefferson City Correctional Center, is the source of his complaint about how his parole date has been calculated.
”I should have been eligible for parole now,” Decker said.
He pleaded guilty in the drug case on Aug. 18, 2023, and was sentenced to five years on each of two drug counts and four years on unlawful use of a weapon, all to be served concurrently.
Then he pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to seven years, to be served concurrently with his other conviction.
Under state parole regulations, Decker has 523 days of jail-time credit. When he was sentenced, the judge ordered Decker be given credit for time served from March 16, 2022, to June 13, 2025. But that came with a caveat — if the Department of Corrections didn’t allow it, Decker couldn’t file an appeal on that basis.
With 1,185 days in custody, Decker thought the guilty plea would position him for release. But the department did not allow the time he was in jail on the drug charges or the time he was held by the state on the manslaughter sentence.
“They never revoked my bond, so technically, I was still out on bond on the murder case” until the April guilty plea, Decker said.
Decker is eligible for parole in 2028. His security level was recently reduced and he’s seeking transfer to another prison.
On Aug. 1, 2019, James Dunn received notice his parole hearing would be held in two months. He had been in custody since 1996, when he was arrested and charged with second degree murder and armed criminal action. He was given consecutive life sentences. 
At the time of his scheduled parole hearing, Dunn had completed 85% of the murder conviction and was approaching the three-year statutory minimum time for the armed criminal action charge.
A month before he was to go before the parole board, the department issued its revised guidebook for parole procedures. It required anyone serving a life sentence with eligibility for parole to serve at least 15 years, or half of what the statutes define as a life sentence.
Dunn was informed his hearing date had been changed to June 2036. 
“I’d done the time that makes me eligible to be released, and they moved the goal posts at the last second,” Dunn said in a telephone interview from Jefferson City Correctional Center.
Dunn challenged the change in court but was turned down in Cole County Circuit Court then lost again in his appeal.
In the interview, Dunn said he feels he has received the punishment he was due for his crimes.
“I have two granddaughters,” he said. “I don’t want anything special. I want to see my family, spend time with my mom while she’s still around, and my granddaughters, and just live a normal life.
“I’m not looking for an extravagant life when I get out here, I just want to get out of here.”
 Fighting for release

Pointer is directly challenging his parole date calculation in Cole County, where he is being held, and in Jackson County, where he was sentenced.
In the Cole County case, Circuit Judge Brian Stumpe has been weighing his decision since April 24.
“It is simply shocking to the conscience that a state can, without consequence, require a prisoner to serve an additional 20 years beyond the maximum sentence imposed by the trial court’s judgment and sentence,” Gipson wrote in the petition in Jackson County.
The calculation is correct, Assistant Attorney General Andrew Clark argued in a filing in Cole County, “because his prior sentences were ordered to be served consecutively and he cannot receive credit for those offenses even though they were vacated and subsequently imposed concurrently.”
Hindsight provides a clarity that is not apparent as things are happening and for Pointer, the plea deal he was offered in 2005 to testify against Hall looks pretty good now.
“My oldest daughter, Monique, said, ‘Dad, I wish that you would have just taken the pleas that they offered you a long time ago.’” Pointer said. “Because if I would have taken the 20 year plea, I would have been gone, gone home, a way long time before now.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Deandre-Pointer-06262025-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-08-08 11:58:25.598168

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)On Aug. 1, Cornerstone Apartment Services — the largest property management company in central Denver, with over 290 properties across the Front Range — sent out a notice that they will begin billing tenants for utilities using a variable system managed by third-party companies Zego or RealPage.
The change, effective Oct. 1, replaces flat-rate utility billing with a monthly, usage-based system determined by proprietary algorithms. While seemingly innocuous, Cornerstone’s adoption of third-party utility billing reflects a broader and more dangerous trend: the normalization of AI-driven pricing systems that use opaque algorithms to manipulate costs and extract more from tenants, supported by a governor working to advance AI technology.

Many Coloradans might recognize the name RealPage, the Texas-based software company currently at the center of an ongoing antitrust investigation and multi-state lawsuit, which includes Colorado, that highlights how algorithmic price fixing enables corporate landlords to share proprietary rental data and coordinate rent increases, effectively suppressing competition and driving prices up in cities across the U.S. These systems obscure how prices are set and shift financial risk onto working people.
The Colorado Legislature has also made its own attempt to push back on AI price-fixing in the housing market. House Bill 25-1004: No Pricing Coordination Between Landlords, the second attempt of its kind following a similar bill was killed in the 2024 legislative session, looked to restrict the sale, distribution and use of algorithmic pricing tools in rental housing as a direct response to the growing body of evidence that software like RealPage’s is driving up housing costs through covert collusion.
However, in May, Gov. Jared Polis vetoed the bill.
Instead of siding with tenants and affordable housing advocates, Polis’ veto sent a clear message: He is more interested in protecting the interests of tech giants and property monopolies than defending Coloradans from predatory pricing schemes. The veto came at a time when rent has far outpaced wage growth, evictions remain at record highs, and corporate landlords have consolidated control of a significant portion of the rental housing market.
In Colorado and across the nation, the implications of AI overreach extend far beyond housing. Polis is reconvening the Legislature for a special session to address the state’s severe budget shortfall. But the agenda also includes efforts to weaken or eliminate emerging AI regulations put into place by Senate Bill 24-205: Consumer Protections for Artificial Intelligence, scheduled to go into effect Feb. 1. This will mark a profound misalignment of priorities between state legislators and the executive branch at a time when tens of thousands of Coloradans are losing access to essential services.
Drastic cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, child care assistance, and other safety net programs in the recently signed “One Big Beautiful Bill” have left many working families across Colorado reeling. Coupled with Colorado’s own budget shortfalls, a special session should be laser-focused on stabilizing public services and correcting the state’s dire budget trajectory.
In a time of volatile federal preemptions and deepening budget constraints, the governor’s focus on deregulating AI, particularly in the housing sectors, is yet another troubling example of his alignment with corporate interests over the needs of Coloradans. Rather than enabling an industry that threatens affordability and consumer protections, Polis should use every opportunity, beginning with the special session, to fight for the well-being of the very people he was elected to serve.

“They could barely breathe because there’s no opening like a bus — it's like a closed box,” a Canadian police spokesperson said.

Forty-four asylum-seekers, most from Haiti, were found packed in the back of a 16-foot U-Haul truck in southern Québec early Sunday, according to Canadian authorities.
Canadian police also arrested three people on smuggling charges.
Cpl. Erique Gasse, a spokesperson for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, estimated the asylum-seekers walked a few miles in the United States to cross the border before getting into the truck in Canada.
Working off a tip, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Sûreté du Québec intercepted the box truck just south of Stanstead, Québec, minutes north of the Vermont border station at Derby Line, Sunday at 2:20 a.m.
The truck was carrying 44 foreign nationals — including a 4-year-old child and a pregnant woman — packed in dangerously hot and cramped conditions in a suspected case of human trafficking, according to Gasse.
“They could barely breathe because there’s no opening like a bus — it’s like a closed box. So they were pretty relieved to see the police opening the door but at the same time, obviously, they got caught,” he said.
Many of the smuggled migrants were wet and told officers they had to walk for about two hours in the forest and had to wade through waist-high water before they got into the truck on the Canadian side. The weather was getting cold and Gasse said officers provided blankets and shared water and food with the asylum seekers. 
“They were hungry. They were thirsty, and they needed some energy,” he said.
It was an unusually large number of people by the Canadian police’s standards, he said, as they usually apprehend families or small groups of people trying to cross the border. 
“We see that a lot in Europe,” he said. “I hope it’s not a new trend.”
The 47 people were arrested and brought to the Canada Border Services Agency at the Stanstead Highway 55 border crossing, according to Guillaume Bérubé, a spokesperson for the agency. 
Ogulcan Mersin, 25, Dogan Alakus, 31, and Firat Yuksek, 31, were arrested on charges of aiding and abetting to commit an immigration offense as well as a charge of assisting people to enter Canada outside of a designated customs office.
They are detained in Sherbrooke until their next court hearing on Aug. 28, for a bail hearing, according to Alessia Bongiovanni from the Public Prosecution Service of Canada.
“The investigation is ongoing and additional charges may be laid. The (Canada Border Services Agency) cannot comment further as the matter is before the courts,” Bérubé wrote in an email Wednesday. 
Most of the asylum-seekers were taken to the agency’s refugee processing center in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle and are set to be subject to individual immigration assessments, he wrote.
Canadian news outlets, such as the CBC, have reported that many of them were sent back to the U.S.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment.
U.S. Sen. Peter Welch’s office is aware of the incident and is working with the delegation and partners involved, said Elisabeth St. Onge, Welch’s press secretary.
Welch has condemned the Trump administration’s decision to reverse the temporary protected status and a humanitarian parole program that allows people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to legally enter and stay in the U.S. for two years.
The reversal of temporary protected status for people from Haiti endangers the safety and well-being of refugees and asylum-seekers seeking a better life, St. Onge said.
Temporary protected status is based on the circumstances in the country and Haiti has long been facing a severe humanitarian crisis involving gang violence, food insecurity and a collapsing health care system.
The situation in Haiti is actually worse this month, according to Yvonne Lodico, founder and executive director of the Grace Initiative Global, a nonprofit that provides services to several refugee groups living in Vermont, including Haitians.
Almost 1.3 million people are displaced in Haiti, which some say has the highest homicide rate in the world, according to the Human Rights Watch report Lodico cited. Violence continues to escalate, and more than 5,600 people were killed there in 2024.
“The Haitians love Vermont. It is welcoming, peaceful, and they have all been able to work and become economically self-sufficient,” she said. “However, the situation is frightening, and the prospect of being sent to a detention center provides compelling reasons for individuals to seek help and a chance to survive. So it seems that Canada, even though there is no guarantee that they will be able to stay, is worth the effort.”
Canada looks to tighten border control
The Canada Border Services Agency and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police work with partners “to disrupt human smuggling networks and to combat international criminal organizations that seek to profit from the desperation and vulnerability of others,” Bérubé wrote in the email.
So far this year, the agency has processed 14,874 asylum applications as of July 27 in Québec, a dip from the same period last year when it processed 22,337 asylum applications, according to data shared by Bérubé.
“People who attempt to enter Canada illegally by smuggling across the border can easily find themselves in vulnerable risky situations and may be exposed to extreme climatic and environmental conditions … leading to malnutrition or serious injury,” Bérubé wrote. 
Those who enter Canada in violation of immigration laws illegally could face criminal charges, court-imposed fines, jail terms and deportation, he said.
Meanwhile, similar to the Trump administration’s continued crackdown on immigration in the U.S., Mark Carney, Canada’s newly elected Liberal prime minister, has proposed the Strong Borders Act. 
It outlines sweeping changes to prevent refugee crossings, the BBC reported, and has been criticized by advocates and Canada’s left-leaning New Democratic Party and advocates.
President Donald Trump has long made claims about undocumented migrants and drugs moving across the U.S.-Canada border. He recently increased tariffs on Canadian imports, citing the country’s alleged failure to curb fentanyl smuggling into the U.S. But many imports will avoid the increase thanks to an existing treaty, the BBC reported.

The post Healey signs bill expanding reproductive, transgender care protections appeare[...]","SURROUNDED BY HEALTH CARE advocates and curious tourists peering into Nurses Hall, Gov. Maura Healey signed an expanded shield law Thursday giving patients and providers in Massachusetts a new layer of defense against out-of-state intrusion into reproductive and transgender care.
“No one is going to come to Massachusetts and attack our people, attack our institutions, attack our providers because we believe in freedom,” Healey said. “It’s why we’ve continued, collectively, to take action, and we will continue to take action as necessary. We owe it to the people of Massachusetts. And you know what? We owe it to Americans. We owe it to this country.”
Attendees at the bill-signing ceremony represented Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, Reproductive Equity Now, ACLU Massachusetts, GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, Fenway Health, Health Imperatives, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Massachusetts Medical Society, among others. 
At a time of enhanced federal scrutiny and legal threats largely led by Republicans in other states, lawmakers last week moved to update the 2022 shield law intended to protect providers and patients of reproductive care, including abortions, and transgender care. Supporters say additional steps are needed to plug gaps in existing law in the wake of the US Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
The expanded shield law limits the release of sensitive data, allows prescription labels to display a practice name instead of an individual physician’s name, and codifies a state requirement for abortion care to be provided in emergencies when medically necessary. The anonymity provision for prescription labels is linked to the case of a doctor in New York — which has a shield law — who’s faced a felony charge in Louisiana and a hefty penalty in Texas for providing abortion medication.
The law also blocks courts here from considering or admitting cases of abuse, neglect or maltreatment for parents who support their children in receiving transgender care.
“It’s a true honor today to celebrate a law that will save lives, including my own, and so many other trans people who I know,” said Dallas Ducar, who’s transgender and is Fenway Health’s executive vice president of donor engagement and external relations. “This will save families, will protect families, and remind our country what leadership looks like.”
In a statement to the News Service, the Massachusetts Family Institute warned about the law’s impact on children.
“Governor Healey and Massachusetts legislators have sadly, but predictably, bowed to ideology instead of protecting Massachusetts citizens, especially children,” MFI general counsel Sam Whiting said. “This ‘shield law’ only shields activist healthcare providers from transparency and accountability, all while infringing on the rights of other states to protect children from abortion and irreversible gender mutilation procedures.”
Healey called the law a “necessary step forward,” as she invoked the gravity of the week, which brought Texas Democratic lawmakers to Beacon Hill twice to amplify their resistance to  efforts in their state to redraw congressional districts to favor Republicans. Similar to how those Texas Democrats say they are fighting to protect voting rights nationwide, Healey signaled Massachusetts Democrats are taking a similar approach to “reproductive rights.”
“What we do to protect people’s rights here in Massachusetts impacts the country,” Healey said. 
House Judiciary Committee Chair Michael Day said last week that the urgency of the effort to update the shield law “has been dictated by the wild rhetoric as well as the acts taken by both this presidential administration, as well as several of our sister states, in the field that this bill covers: the right for a woman to control her body and the right for transgender individuals to be treated as equals here in the commonwealth.”
In New Hampshire last week, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed two bills banning transgender care for minors, including puberty blockers or hormone treatments, as well as chest surgeries, according to NHPR.
“Medical decisions made at a young age can carry lifelong consequences, and these bills represent a balanced, bipartisan effort to protect children,” Ayotte said in a statement.

About 40 percent of transgender youth across the country — or roughly 120,400 individuals — live in 27 states that have bans on gender identity care, according to the Human Rights Campaign.
Georgia’s six-week abortion made national headlines this summer, after a pregnant woman who had been declared brain-dead was kept on life support for months until her baby was delivered via an emergency C-section.
In Missouri, a trial is slated for later this month surrounding the certification of a 2026 ballot initiative, based on a measure state lawmakers approved, to largely ban abortions with some exceptions, KOMU 8 reported. Just last November, Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment to protect abortion access, after the state outlawed the procedure following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling, according to PBS News.
Forty-one states have some form of abortion bans, including 12 with total bans and 28 with bans based on gestational duration, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on reproductive health care. Twenty-two states and Washington, DC also have shield protections for reproductive and transgender care.
Sen. Cindy Friedman, the Senate’s point person on the original and expanded shield law, said the measure is “fundamentally about protecting our state from those outside who wish to decide how we in Massachusetts choose to deliver health care and the values we decide should drive that care.”
“We sit down together and decide what our values are — not Texas, not Missouri, not the federal government,” Friedman said. “It’s us here in Massachusetts. States across the nation have continued actually to look to us to see what we’re doing to provide these vital protections.”
Massachusetts Medical Society President Dr. Olivia Liao released a statement supporting the new law.
“The law provides critical protections for patients seeking and physicians delivering reproductive and gender-affirming care, responding to growing threats that seek to interfere with decisions that belong to patients and their doctors,” Liao said. “Out-of-state legal actions seeking to criminalize care that is grounded in science, medical standards, and ethical practice have no place in the Commonwealth.”

In 2023, it had the lowest.","Connecticut has traditionally been among the states with the most reported Lyme disease cases, despite having only about 1% of the United States’ population. But in recent years, Connecticut’s case rate has not increased as quickly as in other Northeast states.
The number of cases per 100,000 Connecticut residents declined fairly steadily from 2010 through 2021. But a big increase in 2022 and 2023 was still not as large as the increase in case rates in other Northeast states. 
Connecticut’s Lyme disease rate has been below the Northeast average since 2016. In recent years, only New Jersey has had a lower rate.
The number of Lyme disease cases overall has remained somewhat steady in Connecticut compared to other Northeast states, with an average of 2,718 cases per year since 1995, according to the Department of Public Health.
The Northeast — all the New England states, along with New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania — has remained the epicenter for Lyme disease. Every year, the Northeast accounts for about 70% of the country’s cases, according to a CT Mirror analysis of CDC data.
On an average year, almost 9% of Northeast cases came from CT.
Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in both Connecticut and the United States, according to the state Department of Public Health. The disease was first reported in 1975. It is caused by a bacterial infection spread through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, also known as deer ticks. Early symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, and a distinct rash. If untreated, the disease can lead to more serious complications affecting joints, the heart and the nervous system, according to the CDC.
A recent study from Dartmouth found that in the Northeast, including Connecticut, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine, half of all adult blacklegged or deer ticks carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Up to 25% of nymph-stage ticks, which are harder to detect, also carry the bacteria.
Recent tick surveillance shows that deer ticks are by far the most common species collected in the state. New London County recorded the highest density of adult and nymphal blacklegged ticks. Meanwhile, Litchfield County showed the highest rate of adult female tick infection, and Fairfield County had the highest nymph infection rate.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-3.12.56-PM-1024x733.png,,,2025-08-08 11:58:25.598168

Read this story in English.
El “gran y hermoso proyecto de ley” del presidente Donald J. Trump introducirá cambios en la forma en que algunas personas califican o siguen siendo elegibles para Medicaid o asistencia alimentaria durante los próximos dos años.
Una de esas revisiones es la implementación de nuevos requisitos laborales: más personas deberán trabajar, capacitarse o hacer voluntariado al menos 80 horas al mes para acceder a estos programas en los próximos años, aunque existen varias exenciones.
Estas normas se aplicarán a Medicaid, conocido como HUSKY en Connecticut, así como al Programa de Asistencia Nutricional Suplementaria, comúnmente conocido como SNAP.
Quienes apoyan la iniciativa afirman que fomenta la participación en la fuerza laboral y garantiza que las personas no se aprovechen de los programas de la red de seguridad social. Sin embargo, los críticos argumentan que la mayoría de las personas que acceden a estos programas ya trabajan, lo que les impone un requisito adicional para demostrar que participan en la fuerza laboral o en un programa de capacitación.
Desde que la “gran y hermosa ley” se promulgó hace apenas un mes, los Estados aún están definiendo cómo se verán los cambios para los solicitantes y beneficiarios, así como para las agencias que deberán administrar y hacer cumplir las nuevas normas.
Esto es lo que sabemos hasta ahora:
¿Cuáles son los requisitos laborales? ¿Los tiene Connecticut actualmente?
Los programas de asistencia pública pueden imponer reglas para que algunos afiliados puedan acceder y mantener los beneficios. Dicho requisito no significa necesariamente que una persona deba conseguir un trabajo. Por lo general, una persona puede ser voluntaria o participar en un programa de capacitación para calificar.
Connecticut y la mayoría de los Estados no tienen actualmente ningún requisito laboral para Medicaid, y será una novedad cuando la nueva ley entre en vigor en este ámbito.
Ya existe un conjunto de reglas a nivel nacional para los beneficios de SNAP: requisitos laborales generales y requisitos adicionales para adultos sin discapacidad sin dependientes.
El requisito general implica registrarse para trabajar, participar en un programa de Empleo y Capacitación del SNAP, aceptar un trabajo adecuado si se le ofrece y no abandonar voluntariamente un trabajo ni cambiar su horario a menos de 30 horas semanales sin una buena razón. Hay excepciones para las mujeres embarazadas, las personas que estudian y las personas que cuidan a niños pequeños.
Los adultos sanos sin dependientes de entre 18 y 54 años deben trabajar o participar en actividades comunitarias durante al menos 80 horas al mes. Si no cumple con este requisito, puede perder los beneficios del SNAP después de tres meses y podría tener que esperar el período de tres años para recibirlos nuevamente.
Para el SNAP, un dependiente se define actualmente como una persona menor de 18 años, pero esto está sujeto a cambios como parte de la nueva ley.
¿Quiénes están exentos según los requisitos laborales actuales y los nuevos?
Bajo el formato actual del SNAP, no es necesario cumplir con el requisito de trabajo para adultos sanos sin dependientes si está embarazada, tiene limitaciones físicas y mentales, vive con alguien menor de 18 años o ya está exento del requisito general de trabajo, como quienes participan en programas de tratamiento de alcoholismo y drogas, o si un inscrito estudia o participa en un programa de capacitación al menos medio tiempo.
Hay algunos grupos de adultos sanos sin dependientes que actualmente están exentos del requisito de trabajo, pero que perderán sus exenciones con la nueva ley: veteranos, personas sin hogar, adultos jóvenes que superan la edad límite de acogida y padres o tutores que viven con alguien mayor de 14 años.
Una vez que se promulguen los requisitos laborales para HUSKY, habrá casi una docena de exenciones: mujeres embarazadas o en período de posparto, jóvenes en hogares de acogida, veteranos con discapacidad, personas con trastornos por consumo de alcohol y sustancias, beneficiarios que ya cumplen con el requisito a través de otros programas federales, personas con una exención por dificultades económicas a corto plazo, personas recientemente encarceladas, padres y cuidadores de un dependiente menor de 14 años o con una discapacidad, y personas con problemas de salud.
¿Cuándo entrarán en vigor las nuevas normas? ¿Se aplicarán en mi caso?
El momento exacto y el número de personas afectadas por los requisitos laborales aún no se conocen, a menos que usted pertenezca a alguna de las categorías exentas mencionadas anteriormente.
Esta es la primera vez que Medicaid estará sujeto a requisitos laborales en la mayoría de los Estados. Entrará en vigor a principios de 2027. Sin embargo, Estados como Connecticut podrían retrasarlos dos años más, hasta 2029, si demuestran que están haciendo esfuerzos de buena fe para implementarlos.
Las nuevas reglas se aplicarán a la población de expansión de Medicaid, conocida como HUSKY D en Connecticut, que incluye cobertura para adultos de bajos ingresos sin dependientes.
Para que esta población califique para Medicaid como adulto menor de 65 años, el beneficiario deberá trabajar o participar en capacitación, educación o servicio comunitario al menos 80 horas al mes. Este criterio también se aplicará a los padres o tutores con hijos mayores de 14 años.
El Estado aún desconoce cuántas personas en Connecticut podrían ser expulsadas de Medicaid o no ser elegibles al solicitarlo debido específicamente a requisitos laborales. Sin embargo, los primeros informes sobre la “gran factura” del Departamento de Servicios Sociales de Connecticut y la oficina del contralor estatal estiman, de manera más general, que entre 100,000 y 200,000 residentes podrían perder su cobertura HUSKY en el futuro por diversas razones.
En el caso del SNAP, se ampliarán los requisitos laborales para los adultos sin discapacidad y sin dependientes, con el mismo mínimo de horas de trabajo o participación comunitaria que para quienes reciben HUSKY. No está claro cuándo entrarán en vigor las normas más estrictas, y un informe preliminar del Departamento de Servicios Sociales (DSS) indicó que la fecha de entrada en vigor está “pendiente de la guía federal”.
La ley eleva el límite de edad para los adultos sanos sin dependientes de 54 a 64 años. También se aplicará a los adultos sanos con hijos mayores de 14 años que vivan en casa. El proyecto de ley redujo la edad de los dependientes, que actualmente es menor de 18 años.
¿Cómo implementará Connecticut los requisitos laborales?
El Departamento de Servicios Sociales de Connecticut, que supervisa HUSKY y SNAP, está trabajando para abordar el aumento en la verificación de elegibilidad y la aplicación de ambos requisitos laborales.
Las autoridades predicen que Connecticut podría experimentar nuevos gastos de entre 20 y 50 millones de dólares, según un informe de la contraloría estatal. Es probable que esos costos se destinen a nueva tecnología y a un mayor número de personal para determinar qué residentes de HUSKY cumplen con los requisitos laborales y quiénes están exentos.
En Connecticut, el 73 % de los adultos que reciben Medicaid trabajan, según la organización sin fines de lucro KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation). Sin embargo, las autoridades estatales advierten que algunos afiliados que ya trabajan o que cumplen los requisitos para una exención podrían perder la cobertura, si no presentan la documentación necesaria que acredite que cumplen los requisitos para recibir beneficios.
“Se proyecta que muchas personas que cumplen con el requisito perderán la cobertura debido a los nuevos trámites de cumplimiento”, declaró el informe del Contralor Estatal en julio. “Muchas de las personas que no trabajan, por ejemplo, debido a responsabilidades de cuidado o una discapacidad, calificarían para una exención, pero se espera que incluso un número significativo de quienes deberían estar exentos sean dados de baja debido a la nueva burocracia que implica demostrarlo”.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snap-spanish-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-08 10:56:09.839907

Officials on Thursday marked a milestone in flood protection for the Fargo area, with water from the Red River flowing through part of a channel designed to send floodwaters around the city.
The 30-mile Red River diversion is scheduled for completion in 2027 to protect the Fargo area’s more than 260,000 residents from flooding.
Thursday’s event took place at a dam near Horace, south of West Fargo. Officials had planned to remove plugs in berms that were keeping the Red River from entering the channel around the control structure, but recent heavy rains caused the river to top the berm, filling the channel. Instead, officials opened gates on the dam to mark the rerouting of the river.
The $3.2 billion project includes $850 million from the state of North Dakota and $750 million in federal funds. The control structure alone used $115 million of the federal funds.
The Red River Control Structure includes three 50-foot wide by 52-foot tall steel gates, each weighing nearly 300,000 pounds, according to a news release from Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D.

It is the largest of the three gated structures on a 22-mile earthen embankment.
“This has been a tremendous undertaking, requiring us to bring in partners from across all levels of government and from the private sector, but now, we are seeing tremendous results as the very heart of the project, the Red River Control Structure, is brought online,” Hoeven said.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong applauded the cooperation on the project with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The diversion also improves flood protection for Moorhead, Minnesota, with Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith taking part in the ceremony.
“Not since the opening of Garrison Dam in 1953 has a river of this size been intentionally rerouted through a manmade structure in North Dakota,” Armstrong said. “What is happening here today is beyond impressive, moving our state’s largest metro area one giant step closer to a more secure and prosperous future.”
The project has had some detractors. During floods, the dam could create a reservoir on farmland to the south of the north-flowing river.
Cash Aaland is an attorney who lives in an area that could be flooded. He said the dam was added to the diversion project to protect farmland near Fargo for possible future development at the expense of landowners who are being forced into the reservoir area.
He has joined with other attorneys to help fight for fair compensation in the area impacted by the diversion.
He said the group has settled about 30 cases where the Metro Flood Diversion Authority has used eminent domain to obtain easements on property that could be flooded by the dam. He said the group is still working on more than 50 cases.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)In a series of decisions on transgender legislation this year, Gov. Kelly Ayotte has taken a page from her predecessor’s playbook.
Like former Gov. Chris Sununu, Ayotte signed two bills, House Bill 377 and House Bill 712, that ban gender-affirming care for minors, meaning the state will soon bar all forms of such care for people under 18, including medication and surgeries. But also like Sununu, Ayotte vetoed a bill, House Bill 148, that would have allowed businesses and organizations to separate bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams by biological sex.
The result is a combination of decisions that has frustrated people on both sides of the debate. Conservatives and other Republicans sharply criticized Ayotte for vetoing HB 148, with one, Rep. Erica Layon of Derry, arguing she had “broken her promise to protect women.”
“I was stunned to learn that Governor Kelly Ayotte vetoed a bill meant to protect women’s spaces from men — an unthinkable rejection of women’s safety and rights,” Layon said in a statement in July. “… Many Granite Staters, especially women like myself, are saying that they feel betrayed, misled, and let down by the Governor’s broken promise.”
LGBTQ+ support organizations in New Hampshire, meanwhile, say that while they appreciate the veto on HB 148, the ban on gender-affirming care for minors will set back transgender youth and curtail parents’ rights to decide their children’s health care.
And they are hoping to fight the new laws and give advice to transgender teenagers and their families in the meantime.
“We’re lucky to be surrounded by states that provide gender-affirming health care to young people,” said Linds Jakows, the founder of 603 Equality, an advocacy group.
Options for teens and families
Advocates say they are working to inform families about their options.
To start, the new bans on gender-affirming breast surgeries and medication treatments for minors do not take effect until Jan. 1, activists note. And under the new laws, anyone who receives care before the ban will be able to continue to do so even after the ban takes effect.
“We are really asking folks in our orbit to publicize that the bill does not go into effect around puberty blockers and hormone blockers until Jan. 1, and if it is an appropriate choice for kids to seek care, we are strongly encouraging them to be in touch with Dartmouth Hitchcock and their gender affirming care clinic,” said Heidi Carrington Heath, executive director of New Hampshire Outright, an advocacy organization.
For teens and their families who want to begin after January 2026, the bans will require them to travel out of state to get care. That prospect carries with it numerous hurdles: It is more time-consuming, it could incur transportation and accommodation expenses, and it could mean a pricier cost of care if the out-of-state provider is not in that family’s insurance network.
There is a program that could help families do so, Jakows says: the Trans Youth Emergency Project. Run by the Campaign for Southern Equality, an LGBTQ+ rights group that primarily operates in Southern states, the project allows families living in states where transgender care is banned $500 every three months to cover travel expenses to other states. 603 Equality has partnered with the Campaign for Southern Equality to bring the program to New Hampshire.
The project also provides one-on-one consulting for teens and families weighing their options, given the new bans.
“603 Equality and the Campaign for Southern Equality urge families with transgender youth to consult with their child’s physician as soon as possible about care plans,” the organizations wrote in a joint statement shortly after Ayotte signed HB 377 and HB 712 on Aug 1. “The Trans Youth Emergency Project is here to provide support to families of trans youth in New Hampshire in this difficult climate.”
Legal action contemplated
Many of the legal avenues to fight New Hampshire’s ban are now blocked by a U.S. Supreme Court decision from June. In U.S. v. Skrmetti, the court upheld a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors, and dismissed arguments that it was unconstitutional.
But to Chris Erchull, staff attorney at the GLTBQ+ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), that decision does not end all arguments against the new laws.
The Skrmetti case was based on the argument that Tennessee’s law violated the 14th Amendment by classifying teenage patients by transgender status and barring health care only to transgender teenagers. The court found, instead, that Tennessee’s law classified usage based on age and medical use, not trangender status, making it legal.
Erchull says the Supreme Court did not extend its decision to cases in which it is proven that a law is intended to discriminate against transgender people. And he said the court did not contemplate the argument that such a law could violate parents’ rights under the 14th Amendment to determine the health care of their children. Both of those arguments could be valid approaches to challenging New Hampshire’s law, Erchull argued.
Erchull also said there could be an avenue to challenge the laws under the state constitution, which also prohibits sex discrimination.
“I think we have ample evidence in this case that the motivation for the ban on medical care was an effort to single out transgender kids for different treatment and deny them access to care that they need,” he said in an interview.
Erchull declined to answer specific questions about whether GLAD is planning to sue the state in state or federal court to overturn the laws. The organization is currently involved in a federal lawsuit against a 2024 New Hampshire law that bars transgender girls in grades 5-12 from participating in girls’ sports.
Political advocacy continues
LGBTQ+ advocates say they’re hoping to shift the political narrative into one more supportive of trangender people. That means encouraging affected families to share their stories with voters and community members, they say.
“We know that the power of telling those stories can help to move the needle,” said Carrington Heath.
Jakows noted that 603 Equality has begun hosting listening sessions in Dover, New London, and Plymouth, and hopes to put on more.
“We want to spend more time organizing communities and getting people to talk to their friends and neighbors to share stories about transgender and nonbinary lives that counteract the flood of misinformation that is going on at the State House,” Jakows said.
Jakows said Ayotte had signed the bills even after members of her office had met with parents of transgender children, arguing the governor had sided with “fear and misinformation.”
Still, some of the advocacy efforts this year may have influenced Ayotte’s decision to veto HB 148, Jakows argued. Parents and teens reached out to Ayotte’s office urging the veto. And activists attempted more high-profile visibility efforts, too.
At Manchester’s pride parade on June 28, transgender performer Bobby Bratwurst took part in a float with a pointed message. Bratwurst, dressed as Lady Liberty, stood near a portable toilet and made statements like “going to the bathroom is a human right.”
And in May, demonstrators at the State House showed up during a House voting session dressed up as “genital observation police,” handing out cards to lawmakers entering bathrooms telling them they needed to have their private parts inspected by a Republican lawmaker before entering, The Boston Globe reported.
Those efforts kept the issue in the public eye, Jakows said, and may have helped push Ayotte to issue her veto.
“I believe there are important and legitimate privacy and safety concerns raised by biological males using places such as female locker rooms and being placed in female correctional facilities,” Ayotte wrote in her veto message. “At the same time, I see that House Bill 148 is overly broad and impractical to enforce, potentially creating an exclusionary environment for some of our citizens.”
