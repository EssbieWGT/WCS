(Photo by Mimi Ditchie Photography/Getty Images)“Why Trust Science” is the title of a book written a few years ago by Naomi Oreskes. It asks the question and provides an answer that everyone should understand. Oreskes makes the case that the scientific method and its reliance on research, publication, confirmation through repetition, and ever more research — which is all exposed to the examination and critique of a community of scientists — is the essential way to understand our world and all its parts.  
Science derives its trustworthiness from its “collective character,” in which every idea, hypothesis, or theory is exposed to rigorous review, criticism, and the requirement that the data and conclusions be replicable by other independent research. When it sometimes goes “off track,” it eventually comes to correct conclusions through this process.
In today’s world of misinformation and disinformation, which can come from many sources that purport to be based in science, citizens do not know what to trust and easily become confused by opinion and partisan claims. This is why it’s so important to get information from reliable, science-based institutions that subject their work to critical review and that are funded not by industries or political interests, but by governments, nonpolitical foundations, and sources that do not have a particular ax to grind.
One can assert, with ample evidence, that academic and other independent science is what has made America the world leader in medical science, information technology, environmental protection, space exploration, advanced energy technology, and many other fields. We have, for generations, supported with our tax dollars independent research in government agencies and at many of the world’s leading American universities, including the University of New Hampshire. Our science has fueled our technological and medical advancements and inspired generations of young people to become world leaders in their fields.
Today, that foundation of “greatness” is under extreme threat. An administration of scientifically illiterate politicians has decided that if they don’t like what science is telling them, they should simply ignore it and stop funding it. In effect, they have decided, “Don’t confuse me with the facts; I’ve already made up my mind.” Even worse, they don’t want anyone to work on science that might produce facts they disagree with.
The examples over the past few months are numerous, but here is a sampling:

Major cuts to the nation’s medical research (National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and others) have undermined the basic research that is critical to ensuring the health of our nation. These include cuts of 39% to the institute that researches heart disease, 37% to the institute that researches cancer, 40% to the program that researches Alzheimer’s, and 38% to research on drug overdoses and suicide. On top of this, the replacement of independent experts on a number of medical advisory boards with people who closely adhere to the dogma of the new administration has undermined the trust of many in the medical field. Doctors have said that they can no longer fully trust federal health guidance and their patients will suffer.
Notable to us here in New England, where the incidence of Lyme disease is the highest in the nation, the program at Cornell funded by the Defense Department to develop a single accurate test for numerous tick borne diseases was eliminated. 
Staffing and budgets for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been dramatically slashed, and the Trump administration budget for next year would close 10 laboratories that research life-threatening weather disasters. The lab that flies the “hurricane hunters” into storms to collect critical data used to predict the path and intensity of hurricanes is among those to close.
The Trump administration budget eliminates funding for the Ecosystems Mission Area, a program in the US Geological Survey that studies nearly every aspect of the ecology of our landscapes and waters in the country. Decades of regular data gathering that has documented how our environment is changing both for good and bad, will be ended. Scientists say this will be a loss that cannot be easily recovered.
The current EPA says it will completely eliminate its scientific research arm. The research program is the basis for nearly all of the air, water, toxic materials, and other regulations required by federal law. The union that represents 8,000 EPA workers has said, “Without it, we don’t have the means to assess impacts on human health and the environment. Its destruction will devastate public health in our country.” 
Similarly, the administration has cut or proposes to cut science in the national parks, from scientists who provide educational programs to projects that study changes in the landscape over time and the impacts of rapidly melting glaciers. Managing our national parks requires science for good decision-making, and apparently that no longer matters.
As if all of this wasn’t enough to convince one that politicians and their big donors have abandoned science in favor of advancing their own power, the EPA just announced it will propose eliminating a bedrock scientific finding on climate change. Disregarding a worldwide scientific consensus that climate change endangers public health and the environment, the EPA wants to eliminate the “Endangerment Finding” that was established in 2009 and later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. In essence, Donald Trump’s EPA wants to both eliminate any information about climate change and prevent the government from taking any actions that would attempt to slow or stop it.

All this anti-science behavior is truly astonishing. If one doesn’t base decisions on facts, supported by rigorous independent science, what will decisions be based on? Political expediency? Whomever donates the most money to political campaigns?
Adding insult to injury, the White House had the audacity to issue a statement on Earth Day with this headline: “On Earth Day, We Finally Have a President Who Follows Science.”
What?  
The statement went on to list the president’s proposals to cut “wasteful” environmental regulations, champion sound forest management, “end the forced use of paper straws,” and protect public lands. Meanwhile his agencies are gutting whole areas of regulations, demanding environmental rules be suspended to increase drilling and forest cutting on public lands, undoing protections for endangered species, decimating the incentives for clean energy, and reducing fuel economy of autos, which will simply increase air pollution.  
In the face of climate disruption that is creating extreme weather events that are killing people, is our president really spending his time targeting paper straws?
No, there’s no science being followed in this White House. And it will have lasting negative impacts not only on our health and our environment, but remove us from our position as the world leader in science and technology. We will watch China and the European Union leave us behind.

(Photo Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio General Assembly tacked an expiration date on the state’s independent campaign finance watchdog as part of the latest state budget. On Jan. 1, the Ohio Elections Commission’s responsibilities shift to a new office under the Secretary of State’s umbrella. Beyond that date-certain transfer, much of what happens next is still up in the air. In the meantime, their work continues.
The commission meets
The Ohio Elections Commission meets in a basement hearing room at the Vern Riffe Center, just across the street from the Ohio statehouse. Commissioners sit at a long table on a dais in front of several rows of sparsely filled chairs. The mood among commissioners is light-hearted and collegial. They trade jokes and tease one another about who seconded a motion first.
By and large, the cases coming before them are honest mistakes — part-time treasurers who forgot to file reports or filed them incorrectly. In one case the candidate passed away and the treasurer didn’t realize there was more he needed to do. Many of those incidents receive no penalty or a modest fine of $50-$100.

But commissioners also try to put a foot down after repeated delays. One organization has been struggling to reconstruct its books after a previous treasurer took off with their records. The commission agreed to give them another 30 days. But Commissioner Stephen Caraway warned, “I would be in favor of moving to a substantially higher fine violation, from $50 into the $1000s,” if it’s still not resolved.
In another case commissioners had to throw up their hands. Township trustee candidate Justin Peroli criticized a political mailer sent out by “a multitude of concerned citizens of Lafayette township.” It’s a bogus disclaimer, he argued, because there’s no committee with that name and no campaign finance filings for the mailer.
Commissioners were frustrated but had to dismiss the complaint because they couldn’t serve notice to the non-existent group. A representative from the Secretary of State’s office urged Peroli to file another complaint with them so they could follow up.

Where we’re headed
For the OEC’s critics in the state legislature, that feeble response to obvious violations and repeated extensions for straggling treasurers only underscore the commission’s obsolescence.
“I’ve had a four-year front row seat to how inept this process is,” state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said back in April.
The commission’s perceived shortcomings, though, are a function of the laws governing it. They can impose fines and refer cases for prosecution, but after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Ohio’s false statement statutes, a substantial chunk of the commission’s job went away.
Referring to that case, Stewart said lawmakers never “right sized the operation in response.” As the House’s chief budget negotiator, he pushed to abolish the OEC and transfer its duties to the new Election Integrity Unit with the Secretary of State.
Ohio House budget would eliminate independent campaign finance oversight

Instead of the Ohio Elections Commission, the budget directs the secretary to set up a new Ohio Election Integrity Commission. That unit will investigate campaign finance complaints as well as election law violations like improper registration. It will have five members instead of the current seven, and at least three of the five must be attorneys. Commissioners will be chosen by the secretary and legislative leaders of both parties.
That’s a departure from the current structure where the governor names three Republican and three Democratic members who in turn select a seventh independent member. In all likelihood, the new arrangement will set up the secretary’s designee as the tie-breaking vote. In cases of a potential conflict of interest, the attorney general is meant designate someone else to investigate a complaint.
Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Sec. LaRose for this story, but his office did not respond.
How do we get there?
At the close of the most recent OEC hearing, commissioners took a moment to discuss what it will look like to wind down their operation. Commissioner Ernie Knight cut to chase.
“So, for me, the most important part, first and foremost, for the next meeting is to understand at a very granular level, if we have enough capital to get through the end of the year,” he said.
In an interview, Executive Director Phil Richter wasn’t particularly optimistic about funding lasting until the handoff.
“Depending on how you mean, ‘get through the rest of the year,’ not necessarily, no,” he said.
The problem is the funding typically appropriated to the commission lands in April or May in an ordinary budget cycle. That’s obviously too late if they’re handing things off at the beginning of January. Richter said they’re still working through the figures, and if it looks like they’ll fall short, “that would be worked out between me, my budget analyst, (the Office of Budget and Management) and the Controlling Board.”

In the next couple of weeks Richter is going to tell county boards to pause new referrals. He wants the commission to clear as much of its docket as possible before handing things over. Right now, they’ve got roughly 150 cases.
“Of the about 150, I feel like we’ll get through most of those,” Richter explained.
But beyond abstract questions about funding or the transferring of cases, there’s the very tangible question of what to do with the office. What happens with the cabinets full of paper files? Or the desks? Or the staff?
“Great question,” Richter said with a grin. “There isn’t an answer right now — let’s put it that way.”
The budget carries a provision transferring existing staff to the secretary, and Richter is hopeful they’ll be kept on. He’d already been contemplating retirement and said he expects to finish the year and move on, although he left the door open to “other opportunities.”
As for the files and furniture, Richter has had preliminary conversations with the secretary’s staff but that’s about it.
“I don’t know that they want all this stuff,” he said. “but all this stuff at one level becomes their stuff.”
“It could be it all just gets taken and put out to storage, out on Surface Road, and put into the next auction,” he added.

Mike DeWine wants to get rid of proposition bets after two Cleveland Guardians players were placed on leave for gambling allegations. 
DeWine is calling on the Ohio Casino Control Commission to remove prop bets from the type of bets that can be placed in Ohio. 
A prop bet is a wager on an individual player or a specific event in a game, rather than the final outcome of the game. The number of strikeouts a pitcher throws or if a player hits a home run are examples of prop bets.

“The evidence that prop betting is harming athletics in Ohio is reaching critical mass,” DeWine said in a news release. “The harm to athletes and the integrity of the game is clear, and the benefits are not worth the harm. The prop betting experiment in this country has failed badly.” 
DeWine is calling on the commissioners and players unions of Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the Women’s National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer to support the ban on prop betting. 
Ohio does not allow bettors to place prop bets on college athletes. Instead, Ohio bettors are able to make bets on the overall outcome and final score of college sporting events. This happened after NCAA President Charlie Baker wrote a letter to the OCCC asking for the change in 2024. 
Prior to Baker’s letter, DeWine had spoken out against threats made against University of Dayton basketball players shortly after Ohio launched legalized sports gambling in 2023. 
“The Ohio Casino Control Commission took quick action to protect student athletes from unnecessary and potentially harmful threats,” DeWine said back in 2024. “Amending rules to focus bets on the team and away from individual athletes will improve the marketplace in Ohio and properly focus betting attention on the teams and away from individual student athletes.”
MLB placed Cleveland Guardians pitcher Luis Ortiz on non-disciplinary paid leave on July 3 to look into gambling charges against him during Guardians games in June. About two weeks later, MLB extended Ortiz’s leave of absence through Aug. 31. 
On July 28, MLB also placed Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase on non-disciplinary paid leave through Aug. 31 as part of a related sports betting investigation.

Laura Kelly speaks at a rally on May 29, 2025, in Topeka. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)Amid all the ominous signs for the unraveling of our constitutional republic — and the 50 state governments contained therein — one last month struck me as particularly bleak.
The Atlantic first reported that Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would be leaving the National Governors Association. The bipartisan group claims that it serves as “the voice of the nation’s Governors and a leading forum for bipartisan policy solutions.” Democrats Kelly and Walz apparently didn’t see it that way.
Meanwhile, Kelly has raised her national profile as chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association and has called for a robust response to potential gerrymandering in Texas.
The cliche response to this storm of news would be: “I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore.” But we are in Kansas, and in every other state besides. The notion that officials might benefit from listening to one another and working together has been thrown on the partisan bonfire. As Republicans attempt to extract maximum advantage from government, Democrats find themselves forced to react in kind.
None of this reflects reality. According to Pew, the United States splits right down the middle between Republican and Democrat party registration. There’s a similar division between governors, with 27 Republicans and 23 Democrats. But what does the real word have to do with politics?
Apparently Democratic governors have grouched about the national group for some time.
Michael Scherer and Ashley Parker of the Atlantic wrote July 24 that “some Democratic members of the group have privately been fuming in recent months over the organization’s tepid reaction to President Donald Trump’s federal incursions into state matters. They complain that the group did not respond forcefully enough when Trump’s Office of Management and Budget briefly ordered a disruptive pause on the disbursement of all federal funds in January; when Maine Governor Janet Mills and her staff clashed with the White House the following month, over transgender sports; and in June, when Trump deployed the California National Guard to the streets of Los Angeles over the objections of local authorities.”
That makes sense. But what an unfortunate situation for governance in this country. What an unfortunate lack of spine as the federal government spirals.
Kelly decided not to privately fume any longer, making her unhappiness public. Remember, we’re not talking about a stereotypical wild-eyed leftist here. We’re talking about Laura Kelly, a politician whose primary skill has always been demonstrating her sanity in an otherwise insane world of political maneuvering.
“I just felt like Kansas was not getting a return on investment, and we will keep our eyes on it,” Kelly said, according to KSNT. Dues for the organization run about $100,000 a year. “The NGA does some very good things particularly in the area of training for governor’s staff, but there also needs to be a state rights advocate, and I think they’ve sort of fallen down on that role.”
In the meantime, political tensions have flared over mid-decade redistricting for congressional seats. Lawmakers usually draw maps every decade, following U.S. Census results. However, Texas legislators have been pressed by Trump to create new maps earlier, making it more difficult for Democrats to win U.S. House seats. Given that the governing party usually loses seats in midterm elections, this redistricting could cushion the expected blow for Republicans.
This has enraged Democrats, and leaders of blue states like California have threatened their own gerrymanders in retaliation. Guess who’s OK with that? Laura Kelly.
“I have never believed in unilateral disarmament, and so while I may not want to participate in certain activities, if I have to, in order to level the playing field, I would support my Democratic colleagues who decide to answer in kind,” she told ABC News at a policy retreat last week.
She added: “If the other side is going to pursue this, regardless of the obvious unconstitutionality of it, then I don’t think we have any other choice but to go there. You just don’t go to the front lines without your bullets.”
By running and governing as authoritarian wanna-bes, Republicans have pushed moderate Democrats like Kelly toward bare-knuckle political combat. They have alienated would-be allies, all in the service of the dime-store strongman living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We live in a narrowly divided country, but the GOP has chosen to eschew rules, norms or the barest sense of shame.
Kelly will do fine. I wish I could say the same for our state and nation.

Despite the strength of the U.S. economy, the gap between rich and poor Americans is increasing.
The wealthiest 1% of Americans have more than five times as much wealth as the bottom 50%, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve. That’s up from four times as much in the year 2000. In 2024 alone, the wealthiest 19 families got a total of $1 trillion richer – the largest one-year increase on record.
And yet 59% of Americans don’t have enough money saved up to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense.
We are political scientists who study human rights and political economy.
In a 2023 study, our team looked at 145 countries, including the U.S., to understand the link between labor rights and inequality. We found evidence that strengthening collective labor rights may reduce economic inequality.
 Empowering workers

Collective labor rights include the rights to form and join a union, bargain collectively for higher pay and better working conditions, go on strike, and get justice if employers punish workers who exercise these rights.
In the U.S., where less than 10% of workers belong to unions, union members typically earn higher wages than their nonunion counterparts.
Through negotiations on behalf of their members, unions can pressure employers to provide fair wages and benefits. If negotiations break down, the union can call for a strike – sometimes winning better benefits and higher wages as a result.
Some U.S. unions don’t have the right to strike, including air traffic controllers, teachers and those working on national security issues. But most unions have some ability to implement work stoppages and impose costs on employers to negotiate for raises and better benefits and conditions.
 Reducing inequality

For our study, we analyzed the human rights in the CIRIGHTS dataset, which uses human rights reports from the U.S. State Department, Amnesty International and other sources to measure government respect for 24 human rights, including the rights to unionize and bargain collectively. The dataset is produced by the University of Rhode Island, Binghamton University and the University of Connecticut. One of us, Skip Mark, serves as a co-director of the project.
Using a scoring guide, a team of researchers reads human rights reports and gives each country a score of zero if they have widespread violations, one point if they have some violations, or two if they have no evidence of violations. The team has assigned scores for all 24 rights from 1994 through 2022.
Using this data, we created a measure of collective labor rights by adding scores for the right to workplace association and the right to collective bargaining. The resulting collective labor rights score ranges from zero to four.
Countries where workers’ rights are routinely violated, such as Afghanistan, China and Saudi Arabia, scored a zero. The United States, Macedonia and Zambia, three countries with little in common, were among those that tended to get two points, placing them in the middle. Countries with no reported violations of the rights to workplace association and collective bargaining, including Canada, Sweden and France, got four points.
According to the CIRIGHTS dataset, the strength of respect for collective labor rights around the world declined by 50%, from 2.06 in 1994 to 1.03 in 2022.
At the same time, according to the World Inequality Dataset, the share of income earned by the 1% with the biggest paychecks increased by 11%.
We used advanced statistical methods to figure out whether better worker protections actually reduce inequality or are just associated with it.
 Gaps between individuals and ethnic groups

We also measured what’s been happening to economic inequality, using two common ways to track it.
One of them is vertical inequality, the gap between what people earn within a country – the rich versus the poor. The more unequal a society becomes, the higher its vertical inequality score gets. We measured it using the disposable income measure from the Gini index, a commonly used indicator of economic inequality that captures how much money individuals have to spend after taxes and government transfers.
We found that a one-point increase in collective labor rights on our four-point scale reduces vertical inequality by 10 times the average change in inequality. For the U.S., a one-point increase in collective labor rights would be about enough to undo the increase in inequality that occurred between 2008 and 2010 due to the Great Recession and its aftermath. It would also likely help stem the growing wealth gap between Black and white Americans. That’s because income disparities compound over time to create wealth gaps.
We also assessed the connection between horizontal inequality, which measures income inequality between ethnic or other groups, and collective labor rights.
Negative horizontal inequality measures the amount of a country’s income held by the poorest ethnic group. Higher scores for this metric indicate that the lowest-earning ethnic group has less income relative to the rest of society. Black Americans have the lowest median income of any racial or ethnic group, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Positive horizontal inequality measures the income earned by the richest ethnic group. When positive horizontal inequality rises, that means the richest ethnic group has more income relative to the rest of society. According to the same Census Bureau report, Asian Americans had the highest median earnings.
We found that stronger collective labor rights, both in law and in practice around the world, also reduce both types of horizontal inequality. This means they raise the floor by helping to improve the income of the poorest ethnic groups in society. They also close the gap by limiting the incomes of the richest ethnic group, which can reduce the likelihood of conflicts.
That is, our findings suggest that when workers are free to advocate for higher wages and better benefits for themselves, it also benefits society as a whole.

Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
‘Pure emotion’ frequently drives debates on sports stadium deals

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.

After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

(Mac Johnson/Nebraska News Service)Nebraska legislators spent much of their recent session debating and parsing the political landscape in two primary areas: the will of the people via the ballot box and the ongoing culture wars, those nitpicky, divisive punch ups, which often cleave communities. 
That focus last session was the subject of an excellent article by Nebraska Examiner reporter Juan Salinas II.
While he meticulously detailed the body’s battles over issues ranging from taxes to school books to whether your cheeseburger came from a petri dish or a pasture, most troubling was the inordinate amount of time senators spent on what can only be described as undoing the will of the people. 
By the end, the majority had watered down, thinned or undermined initiatives already approved by voters regarding paid sick leave, medical cannabis and minimum wage requirements, the latter, while not passing muster this past session, is sure to be debated again next year. 
Governing by ballot initiative is a tedious, meandering process, often exacerbated by lengthy campaigns to gather petition signatures and court filings disputing everything from language to intent. Nevertheless, that’s our way of doing things. 
Yes, democracy isn’t easy. Nor is it quick.
Ergo, I understand and respect — sometimes grudgingly — that once the votes have been counted, game over. For example, after railing in a number of commentaries about how a lie led to a petition that resulted in Nebraska now requiring photo IDs to vote, I dutifully had my driver’s license at the ready to mark my X when the time came. 
True, the Legislature is charged with putting flesh on the bones of passed initiatives. But weakening them in any way truly is at odds with the people’s will. In our system, “Put it to a vote” both poses the question and has the expectation that we follow the answer … even when we vehemently disagree with the result because we have other remedies. (See your local civics class for details. Wait, do we still teach that?)
Politics is the mechanism by which we practice these principles of democracy. At its core is the art of creating and selling an idea, one that the majority of those affected believe will better their or their neighbors’ lives. We call voting our civic duty, though usually a third to half who have the right don’t use it. Even so, having the decision subverted or enfeebled by another elected body should be a non-starter in a democratic republic.
That said, if an initiative that passes turns out to be a real stinker or constitutionally challenged, the separation of powers can reign in or block such nonsense going forward. Legislators know that and should act accordingly. 
Ballot initiatives as a political solution have become popular. Paid petition circulators and expensive PR campaigns routinely accompany such efforts. Legislators should expect to continue to deal with them while never minimizing the power and voice of a vote of the people nor alter the initiative’s focus.
I hesitate to talk about the culture wars for a number of reasons, not least of which is that I too often seem to write about the horrors and hijinks of too many who don’t like how others chose to live, love, pray, eat, read … the list could go on. 
The Legislature last session joined the fray debating transgender issues and sports, lab grown meat, what books kids can read in school, and, most curious, that Nebraska public schools should only be deemed full and functioning if they posted the Ten Commandments in every classroom. The proposal never made it out of committee. Thank God.
I’m often hard-pressed to see what problems are solved by shaking down colleges and universities for being “woke.” Or banning books not simply because you don’t want your child to read them, but because you don’t want anyone’s child to read them. Or continually obsessing about transgender youth, which, in practice and new laws, effectively questions their actual being — who they are. 
While issues such as trans athletes’ participation in scholastic sports are up for debate, it seems that much of what has transpired in legislative chambers, political debates and coffee shops about trans kids specifically and the LGBTQ+ community generally could have been avoided by simply minding our own business.
But what do I know? White hot culture war arguments still erupt on social media and nearly 600 pieces of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation were proposed in state legislatures in 2025. Go figure. 
Here’s the most critical point of the culture wars: What are the spoils for winning?

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Florida has always been a magnet for criminals, despots, and big-time sleazeballs.
Al Capone liked to relax in Miami Beach.
Ex-dictators, junta leaders, and death squad commanders from Cuba, Nicaragua, Peru, Honduras, Venezuela, and Panama have moved here when things got too hot at home.
Then there are the dodgy New York billionaires, including the felonious current occupant of the White House and his erstwhile pal, the late Jeffrey Epstein, who installed themselves in ocean-front mansions and became Florida Men.
Epstein’s girlfriend/posh pimp Ghislaine Maxwell made herself a Florida Woman, too, shopping for young girls in Palm Beach County.
Then she moved north, although not by choice: She was sentenced to 20 years for sex trafficking and imprisoned at FCI Tallahassee.
Now the feds have whisked her off to some tennis prison in Texas.
If you’re a halfway rational human being, you probably haven’t given much thought to her over the past six months, what with the attacks on science, the attempts to wreck higher education, the dismantling of environmental protections, and destruction of the rule of law.
 Obsession
Our brothers and sisters in MAGA, however, just can’t get her out of their heads.
They’re fixated on her, Jeffrey Epstein, and these alleged files which may or may not still be sitting on the attorney general’s desk.
They’re convinced the files contain mighty secrets about nefarious cabals, Pizzagate, Lizard People, and sex island dirt on the Clintons.
Pam Bondi claimed on Fox “News” she would “review” the files then put Epstein’s stuff out there for everyone’s delectation.
Yet no files have been forthcoming, and boy, is MAGA mad.
Recently some “personal finance” website voted Tallahassee the ninth most boring city in America.
Unfair!
Until last Friday when Maxwell left us, everybody wanted to visit Tallahassee.
Florida’s capital was the focus of the political world, an object of slathering fascination especially among podcast hosts, news junkies, cable TV reporters, Never Trumpers, Ride-or-Die Trumpers, and people on psychotropic medication.
Call that boring? We hadn’t gotten this much attention since the Great Presidential Vote Count Screw-Up of 2000.
Trump acolyte Todd Blanche (his side-hustle is being Bondi’s deputy AG) recently descended upon the United States Courthouse in downtown Tallahassee to interview Maxwell in the presence of her Miami attorney David Markus.
 Look over there!
Blanche and Markus admit they are good friends but swear there’s no conflict of interest, no sir, nothing to see here.
We don’t know what they said, but Ghislaine-o-mania isn’t going away.
Hoping to distract us, the regime keeps hollering “Squirrel!”
The FBI just released 230,000 files on the assassination of Martin Luther King.
National Security Tsarina Tulsi Gabbard has accused Barack Obama of treason, claiming he cooked up a coup against Trump in the 2016 election.
Speaker Mike Johnson was all for releasing the Epstein files until he wasn’t (maybe there was a phone call from the Oval Office?), so he adjourned the House early to avoid a vote on it.
Trump himself has been slinging delusions around like a chimp with a barrel of feces, claiming the Epstein files were created by James Comey or Joe Biden or maybe sinister Greenlandic elves.
When that didn’t seem to work, he started barking about changing the names of NFL teams in Cincinnati and Washington back to “Indians” and “Redskins.”
Then he tried to change the subject by flouncing off to Scotland (where three-quarters of the population heartily despise him) to (in order of importance) 1. Play golf; 2. Make a “trade deal” with the EU that will cleverly raise costs for Americans.
The Scots and the international press made sure nobody forgot how the president and Florida’s favorite pedophile used to be bosom buddies, dogging him with questions and snark.
There’s a grand sign at the entrance to his Aberdeenshire golf course proclaiming “Trump International Golf Links.” Underneath, somebody placed a smaller, quite official-looking sign which said, “Twinned with Epstein Island.”
 Overboard
Neither heat domes nor killer floods nor ICE agents nor gloom of night will stay Americans from their fixation with Epstein and Maxwell.
And so — inevitably — back to Florida, always the humid center of bad behavior, back to Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach palace of horrors, and back to Ghislaine Maxwell, surely the most uptown inmate in FCI history.
She was once an heiress, the youngest child of megabucks London newspaper baron Robert Maxwell. As a student at Oxford, she was described as a “shiny glamazon.”
But her father was not only physically and emotionally abusive, he was embezzling from his own company and defrauding its employees.
In 1991, they found Robert Maxwell face down in the sea.
He’d been sailing near the Canary Islands on his yacht “The Lady Ghislaine.” Nobody ever figured out whether he jumped or was pushed.
Next thing you know, Ghislaine is Jeffrey Epstein’s arm candy, hard at work procuring young girls for him.
Like Trump, Epstein was a New Yorker trying to be a big deal in Palm Beach. In 1990 he bought a 14,000 square foot mansion and partied at Mar-a-Lago.
Like Trump, noisome stories about sexual abuse swirled around him like a nasty cocktail of skunk spray and dog poop.
 Enabling Epstein
You will not be surprised to learn that the state of Florida played a major role in enabling Epstein.
Having amassed vast evidence he’d raped and sexually assaulted at least a dozen under-age girls, Palm Beach County cops searched his Palm Beach mansion in 2005, only to find his six computer hard drives had disappeared.
Epstein finally got arrested, and though a federal grand jury returned a 60-count indictment, he was allowed to plead guilty only to “soliciting a prostitute.”
In 2008, he was put into the private wing of the Palm Beach County jail. He had his own television room. His personal driver arrived every morning to take him to his office.
Turns out the Palm Beach County state attorney, the FBI, prosecutors and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida — a man named Alex Acosta, later appointed Secretary of Labor by Donald Trump — colluded to give Epstein the sweetest of sweet deals: a 20-month sentence.
He served about a year.
This is corrupt even by Florida standards.
When he got out in 2009, Epstein went back to living the lifestyle of the rich and infamous while the young women he assaulted and exploited were forgotten.
We might never have known all this were it not for the relentless and brilliant work of journalist Julie Brown, whose 2018 series in the Miami Herald gave voice to his victims: She tracked down more than five dozen of them.
 ‘Pyramid scheme’
Brown’s reporting detailed how he’d prey on homeless girls or especially vulnerable kids, paying them to bring in other girls.
This sex-trafficking “pyramid scheme,” as Brown calls it, was run by Ghislaine Maxwell.
Maxwell would visit South Florida gyms and spas, telling petite blonde high schoolers — apparently Epstein’s “type” — they could make big money giving massages to “this old guy.”
She encountered 17-year old Virginia Giuffre working at Mar-a-Lago’s spa and convinced her to “work” for Epstein.
Virginia Giuffre said Epstein passed her around to various men, including Prince Andrew and prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz, instructing her to have sex with them. Prince Andrew denied the allegations but he wound up reaching a settlement with Giuffre. Dershowitz has also repeatedly denied allegations. Giuffre dropped her allegations against Dershowitz in 2022 and said she “may have made a mistake.”
Trump claims he had no idea what his good friend Jeffrey was up to back then, variously insisting he ditched Epstein for being “sleazy” (insert your own pot-and-kettle joke here) or they quarreled over Epstein’s “stealing” his pretty young Mar-a-Lago employees.
Brown’s attention to the shady nonprosecution deal in Palm Beach eventually led to his 2019 New York arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.
Epstein, of course, is now dead, most likely by suicide — though lots of MAGAs don’t believe that.
Virginia Giuffre is also dead, definitely by suicide.
Ghislaine Maxwell, however, is still here.
She wasn’t exactly living her best life in Tallahassee, spending her days giving yoga classes, teaching etiquette (even criminals want to be ladylike!) and, no doubt, explaining over and over that her name is not pronounced “Gizz-Lane.”
MAGA (and quite a few Democrats) want her to talk; she wants out of prison.
She may be about to get lucky.
 Pardon
Thanks to Trumpists’ rich fantasy life, in which everything is a conspiracy of the Deep Swamp, she suddenly has some power.
She says she’ll testify in public as long as Congress agrees to a few little provisions as spelled out by her lawyer, chiefly immunity and a chance to see the committee’s questions in advance.
She also doesn’t want to appear before them until after the Supreme Court hears her appeal, in which she makes the thoroughly bizarre argument that the nonprosecution deal the Southern District of Florida cut with Epstein should apply to her, too.
Classic Florida move: The rules are different here.
Anyway, if they don’t comply, she’ll take the Fifth.
Trump keeps saying he’s “allowed” to pardon her, though he evades the question of whether he actually would.
That, no doubt, depends on what kind of dirt he thinks she has on him and whether that outweighs dirt she might have on his perceived enemies.
Here in Tallahassee, we’re feeling a little sore, a little mad at Texas for stealing our celebrity sex offender.
But once a Florida Woman, always a Florida Woman.
Texas will never take that away from us.

CT Democrats might want to look in the mirror” wrongly cast doubt on legislation that creates quality jobs for Connecticut’s working families.
Let’s be clear: SB 1370 didn’t create a loophole, it closed one. For years companies have dodged fair wage standards by shifting construction work to nearby “off-site” locations. Working families were getting hung to dry because of a stupid technicality. 
With SB 1370, common-sense finally prevails. Skilled workers will get paid fairly, and public dollars will support quality local jobs. This bill went through a transparent, public process, with a hearing, a committee vote and broad support that earned its place in the budget. Our lawmakers and the governor were absolutely right to get it done.

Vital health coverage and food assistance programs are being slashed to fund massive tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy. A mass deportation agenda is infused with hundreds of billions of dollars. The LGBTQ+ community is under heightened threat.  A provision to immediately “defund” Planned Parenthood from the federal Medicaid program makes access to reproductive healthcare more precarious than ever.
The rollback of rights and resources is not hypothetical. These are deliberate choices, with devastating consequences for people in every corner of our state.
That’s why, months ago, Protect CT, a coalition of 11 statewide advocacy and service organizations, came together to sound the alarm and share a roadmap for resilience and safety. Now, with the recently signed-into-law One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the harm is no longer looming; it’s landing.
Connecticut took some important steps this past legislative session that go beyond incremental, and that will help advance progress. We celebrate efforts to invest in early childhood and K-12 education, and acknowledge the thoughtful planning to set aside funds for an economic recession. These are good examples of why we love Connecticut and what will continue to make our state a great one. This is also a testament to decades-long community advocacy and political will—doing what’s right even when it’s hard. 
However, Connecticut’s response has been uneven at best. 
While modest funding increases were made to Medicaid and the EITC for families, and marginal improvements were made to the state’s Trust Act, these investments and policy changes fell short of what’s needed. In fact, in a troubling unwillingness to address certain issues, the Gov. Ned Lamont threatened to veto important bills and concepts had they gone to a vote in the regular session. What’s more, the Governor vetoed the primary housing bill of the session. 
There has been talk of a potential special session to respond to the federal reconciliation bill. While this is an important next step, if our elected leaders are serious about protecting Connecticut, we cannot afford to remain reactive. A special session should address federal funding gaps as well as the various crises (like housing) that have been and continue to be felt by residents across our state. The only way forward in Connecticut is to proactively pass and enact ambitious policies that will allow Connecticut to rise and meet this moment.
We have a plan to make that happen.  
The federal landscape has changed. We are living through unprecedented times unlike anything we’ve seen in a generation. And, in spite of this, the partners of Protect CT still believe in what’s possible. We believe in the values the people of this state hold: fairness, justice, and opportunity for all. But belief is not enough. We need bold action. 
So, to every state leader who failed to vote for immigrant protections: these people are important members of our community and our economy – we must stand by them. 
To those who support reproductive freedom and transgender rights, now is the time to take bold action that protects access to vital health care for those who need it today and for years to come.
When you call for affordability for families but haven’t yet passed a state-level child tax credit: now is the time to provide meaningful support to families to help manage the high cost of living.
And to those who say now is not the time for bold action: If not now, when?
The next legislative session cannot be business as usual because these are not normal times. The stakes are too high. We will continue to fight for a future where our residents are safe, supported, and free, no matter what zip code they live in, how much money they make, or where they were born. But we can’t do it alone. 
We call on state leaders to act boldly and urgently: to protect immigrants, safeguard access to the full spectrum of healthcare, and pass a child tax credit. If you’re ready to fight with us for a better Connecticut, join us:  Call your legislators and Governor Lamont today and ask them to move forward with these measures to protect Connecticut and move us forward.

Starting Aug. 1, New York will offer free phone calls in state prisons, becoming the sixth state to do so — and the first to enact the policy without legislation. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)New York began offering free phone calls to people incarcerated in its state prisons on Aug. 1, becoming the sixth state to do so.
The change is projected to save roughly 30,000 families across the state an estimated $13.3 million per year in phone call fees, according to Worth Rises, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
New York joins California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons, though Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026. New York, however, is the first state to implement the change administratively, without any legislation.
Previously, incarcerated New Yorkers were charged $0.024 per minute for domestic calls under the state’s contract with Securus Technologies and received three free 15-minute calls per week, according to the department’s news release.

The new policy eliminates all charges for calls made from facility phones or tablets. The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will cover the costs through its operating budget and expects to spend $9 million this fiscal year.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The policy change also comes as the department continues to work to restore operations following a three-week correctional staff strike earlier this year, which has left thousands of officer positions unfilled and led to cutbacks in visitation, programming and recreation. Some facilities have extended officer shifts up to 12 hours and increased cell confinement to up to 20 hours a day.
“Understanding the value of family ties while in prison is crucial – not only for emotional support, but for improving an individual’s outcomes while incarcerated and when returning to society,” Daniel F. Martuscello III, the corrections department’s commissioner, said in a statement.
This latest initiative also aligns with the department’s goal of reducing New York’s recidivism rate to 17% by 2030. The state recently reported a historic low of 18.9%, according to the state corrections department’s news release.
The new phone policy also builds on other efforts to reduce financial strain on incarcerated people and their families. The department has increased the amount of “gate money” or money provided upon release from $40 to $200, eliminated work release program fees and expanded Wi-Fi access and secure messaging on tablets to improve communication beyond phone calls.
New York’s new policy change also comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing new rate caps for prison and jail phone calls. The rules, which passed unanimously last year under the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, aimed to significantly lower the cost of calls for incarcerated people.
Facilities that haven’t yet lowered their phone and video call rates — or that decide to roll back recent changes — can continue charging higher rates until at least April 2027. The FCC had approved rate caps of 6 cents per minute for phone calls in prisons and large jails, 16 cents per minute for video calls in prisons, and 11 cents per minute for video calls in large jails, though those rates may change again before the rules take effect.

A group of state attorneys general, led by New York, has filed a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of mounting an unconstitutional pressure campaign against gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, challenges actions taken by the Justice Department to investigate and halt gender-affirming care across the country.
The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is pursuing a backdoor strategy to restrict gender-affirming care at the federal level through threats of criminal and civil penalties, while skirting state laws that protect transgender patients’ health care.

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

As federal investigations and funding threats roll out, hospitals across the country are shutting down their gender-affirming care programs for minors — including in areas where access to this care is protected by state law. Clinics and medical programs have shuttered in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois and Washington, D.C., among others — despite state laws that protect the care’s legality. Multiple hospitals have attributed shuttering or pausing their gender-affirming care programs to President Donald Trump’s executive orders and federal administrative actions, including the Yale health system and Denver Health in Colorado.

The White House recently celebrated these closures as a direct result of Trump’s executive orders.
“The administration’s actions put providers in an impossible position: either comply with unlawful federal threats or violate state laws that require nondiscriminatory access to medical care,” New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office said in a statement.
James and other attorneys general suing the Trump administration argue that these actions are not based in law, since no federal statute prohibits gender-affirming care in the United States. Instead, these actions are an intimidation tactic to suppress the health care, the lawsuit alleges. Through the courts, they are attempting to halt the Justice Department’s actions.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the attorneys general of states where gender clinics have recently shuttered, as well as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. They assert that gender-affirming care is legally protected in all of their states and that federal efforts to block that care violate states’ rights provided by the 10th Amendment.
Over the past few months, federal agencies have begun to follow through on Trump’s executive orders regarding gender-affirming care.
In early July, Chad Mizelle, chief of staff at the Justice Department, announced that the agency had launched at least 20 subpoenas into clinics involved in gender transition care, alongside subpoenas to drug manufacturers and investigations into hospitals providing the care. Doctors are being subpoenaed for patients’ private information, the New York Times reports. The agency is following the White House directive it received in January, via executive order, to broadly investigate gender-affirming care. In these directives, the Trump administration has incorrectly conflated the care with female genital mutilation.
The New York lawsuit challenges these actions, as well as FBI criminal investigations into three children’s hospitals that currently provide gender-affirming care or have done so in the past. Although the lawsuit is being brought against Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department, it also references other actions taken by federal agencies targeting gender-affirming care — including an all-day event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission. That event, titled “the dangers of ‘gender-affirming care’ for minors,” is where the Justice Department first announced its subpoenas for confidential patient information.
Major medical groups including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The new president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which sets global standards for doctors and nurses providing health care to trans patients, has expressed concerns that banning gender-affirming care will simply drive the care underground and endanger patients.
Transgender people, as well as the families and parents of transgender youth, are feeling increasingly worried and scared as the Trump administration targets their identities and their health care. For years, states have banned gender-affirming care for minors in red states and through Republican-controlled legislatures; but now, with the crackdown taking place on a national level, trans people living in blue states and liberal cities face the same threat.

[…]","A protester being escorted out of the ballroom at the Rosen Shingle Creek Hotel in Orlando on August 2, 2025 (Photo by Mitch Perry/ Florida Phoenix)ORLANDO – The Republican Party of Florida has never been more powerful than right now.
It has controlled the governor’s mansion for nearly three decades – and also currently holds all three Cabinet offices, maintains a supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature and maintains a more than 1.3 million voter registration lead over Democrats.
Yet several top-leading GOP leaders at the Florida Freedom Forum in Orlando on Saturday warned that complacency and infighting could give an opening to their political rivals.
“Don’t get high on your own supply,” said Gov. Ron DeSantis. “There is nothing permanent in politics.”
For proof, both the governor and his close ideological ally, newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, referenced two proposed constitutional amendments on last year’s statewide ballot that nearly passed.
Amendment 3 would have legalized adult recreational cannabis, while Amendment 4 would have enshrined abortion rights into the state’s Constitution. Both received more than 55% support, a clear majority but not enough to break the 60% threshold required for passage.
“If the left can spend $250 million running these ballot initiatives, they can turn this into California through the backdoor,” DeSantis said. “Without ever having to control the Legislature. Without even ever being able to elect a governor, again, and we could wake up in 10 years and all of a sudden, we’ve got a left-wing state. And so Amendments 3 and 4 were really a big test for this state.”

“Never, ever underestimate leftists and their ability to lie, cheat and steal,” added Ingoglia. “Leftist and progressives know they can’t win in Florida as candidates anymore. So now they’re trying to buy our Constitution in an effort to turn this state into California. Massive voter fraud. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent. Vague language. Enticing titles. Foreign money. Last year’s amendments should be a wake-up call for every God-fearing Republican in this room … they’re not going to let up, and neither should we. Guard our Constitution!”
Left unsaid was the fact that in reaction to those proposals, the Legislature passed and DeSantis signed into law a measure that Democrats say has made it significantly more difficult to pass (or even get on the ballot) citizen-led constitutional amendments in the future. The criticisms over Amendment 3 are also notable because the measure was backed by President Donald Trump and state Sen. Joe Gruters, who Trump is now backing to become chair of the Republican National Committee.
So it could be seen as notable that Byron Donalds, the Naples-based Republican U.S. Rep. who President Trump endorsed in the 2026 gubernatorial race, said the only thing that could shut down the GOP’s momentum in Florida is intraparty fighting.
“Listen man, we cannot fight among ourselves in this moment,” he told conservative influencer Benny Johnson in a conversation. “The wind is at our back. 1.3, 1.4 million voter advantage in the state of Florida. We are winning. And the only way you stop winning is when we start fighting each other, because this person wants to be in charge. That person wants to be in charge. Or I want my committee. ..we need to stay united and we need to keep winning.”
Donalds has already won the backing of Trump for governor, but DeSantis has declined to endorse him so far.
Other officials who spoke at the event —which also included an award handed to Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff who has been at odds in the past with DeSantis — included Attorney General James Uthemier, who like Ingoglia, was appointed to his position by DeSantis earlier this year (in his case to replace Ashley Moody).
While relatively unknown except in Florida political circles before his appointment, Uthmeier has been in the news frequently this summer, warning local officials they could be removed from office if they don’t get with the DeSantis agenda on illegal immigration.
Uthmeier took a victory lap of sorts telling the audience how he had come up with the notion of the detention facility in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”
And he accused state Democrats who recently paid a visit to the site as “political grandstanding” and said they cared more about the undocumented than American families who have suffered from the open border policies under former President Joe Biden. “Which is why their party is getting their butt kicked every single day,” he said.
Uthemier also reminded the crowd of Republicans that he will be on the ballot next year.
“If you want somebody who’s soft on crime, that’s lenient, that wants illegal immigrants to get an easy way out, I am absolutely not your guy,” he said.
 A day of protests

Uthmeier also had to deal with a protester who began shouting at him early in his presentation, one of more than half-a-dozen such outbursts that took place throughout the day at the Rosen Shingle Creek hotel.

“Get this guy outta here,” he shouted. “You know what? I think we’ve got a spot in Alligator Alcatraz for that guy.”
Nobody was interrupted more than DeSantis.
“You’ve got to do a better job than that if you’re going to interrupt,” he proclaimed after a fourth protestor began shouting out during his speech. The protestor was escorted out of the ballroom and DeSantis offered: “That was a weak performance.”
Two other protesters also were escorted out earlier in the morning after shouting at U.S. Rep. Randy Fine, who was in conversation with fellow Republican congressional members congress Daniel Webster and Aaron Bean.
The group of activists issued a press release later in the day explaining their actions.
“Republican lawmakers have made it difficult to register complaints,” read a portion of the statement.  “They’ve dodged town halls, ignored petitions, ducked our phone calls, and generally done everything they can to avoid hearing from any constituents who don’t already agree with them.”
Joy Metzler, who wore a “Veterans against Fascism” T-shirt and described herself in the press release as a “recently separated Air Force Veteran,” blasted Florida Republicans for helping to construct the immigration detention center, saying they had “built a concentration camp in our own backyard, a stunningly disrespectful insult to my grandfather, who fought against the Nazis in WWII.”
The intermittent outbursts were mostly treated as annoying distractions in a day otherwise set aside for a celebration of GOP dominance in the state.

(South Dakota Searchlight images)There is early, bipartisan interest in serving as the next governor of South Dakota.
Republicans already have three announced candidates for the primary in 2026, with one more likely contestant waiting in the wings. Democrats have signed up a 19-year-old college student with hints that an adult or two may also seek that party’s nomination.
So much early interest in the job is baffling because being governor of South Dakota is a task that is getting tougher by the day. So far, the U.S. House and Senate have acquiesced to the Trump administration’s attempts to cancel federal funding that has already been approved by Congress. Those actions will mean profound changes for state budgets.
19-year-old at the top of the ticket is no way to build a party

The irony is that the Republican candidates applying for such a tough job have all, to some degree, offered their loyalty to Donald Trump. According to a South Dakota Searchlight story, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden has already spent $187,000 to build his name recognition in the state. In his commercials and mailings, the name that often appears next to Doeden’s is Trump’s.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson doesn’t have to run ads claiming loyalty to Trump as he has been in Washington, D.C., doing the president’s bidding. Johnson voted for a “big, beautiful bill” that is estimated to add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. He also gave his approval to the president’s plan to claw back money that had been allocated for South Dakota Public Broadcasting, financially hamstringing a state institution.
Not much is heard yet from state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen who doesn’t have Doeden’s money or Johnson’s name recognition. Since Hansen is from the same MAGA/“patriot” wing of the state Republican Party as Doeden, it’s unlikely he would break with Trump on any issue. Undeclared as a candidate so far is Gov. Larry Rhoden, who has had nothing but praise for the president.
Yet, as Trump and his minions continue to take a machete to the federal budget, he only serves to make life tougher for the next governor of South Dakota.
An easy reference for this can be found on South Dakota Searchlight’s “Federal Fallout” page, containing stories detailing the impact of federal budget cuts in this state. A scroll through the stories shows some of the challenges that the next governor will face as federal funding starts to disappear:

$5 million of extra costs for the state to manage the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
$2.2 million cut from South Dakota Public Broadcasting.
$5.6 million cut from efforts to expand digital access.
$2.8 million for teacher training.

Remember, in South Dakota, a million dollars still goes a long way. Consequently, replacing a million dollars in the state budget will be hard work. The state budget is $7.3 billion. Of that, $3.1 billion comes from the federal government.

South Dakota impacts from federal funding cuts and policy changes.
Read the latest > 


Ultimately, there’s no telling how much the federal government’s share of the state budget will shrink. Cutting foreign aid and funding for public broadcasting were just the first of Trump’s rescission efforts to erase federal spending that has already been approved by Congress.
All of this is happening at a time when South Dakotans are upset about the continual rise in property taxes. The next governor will be faced with the task of figuring out how to moderate or cut those taxes while also finding a way to replace federal funds that have gone missing.
Some of these federal cuts will be felt in the next session of the Legislature. A South Dakota Searchlight story about a meeting of state fiscal experts included a projection that lagging revenue could result in as much as $24.5 million less for the next state budget.
These candidates who want to be governor should pay close attention to the funding problems faced by Gov. Rhoden and legislators in the next session. There is still plenty of time between now and January for Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress to make more cuts. The struggles in Pierre will serve as a harbinger of the challenges the next governor will face.
Fear of Trump’s wrath sparks an almost blind loyalty within the Republican Party. These GOP candidates for governor must ask themselves if they really want the job of running South Dakota government while the party leader they praise is working overtime to make the job more difficult.

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)PITTSBURG, Kan. — Amid a summer swelter last week, more than 80 people crowded into a trendy gastropub in downtown Pittsburg, Kansas, for cold drinks and hot talk.
The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.










They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that … all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party.


– Justin Mcelwain, Pittsburg, Kan., resident


Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
‘Not a bumper sticker bill’
The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”

In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
Democrats ‘fight back’
This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.

In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”

The post A nation of immigrants imperiled  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AT THE RECENT graduation ceremony for Northern Essex Community College’s Center for Adult Education, we celebrated the accomplishments of 24 students who had completed their high school equivalency exams, dozens more who finished English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) programs, 15 inductees into the National Adult Education Honor Society, and six newly naturalized citizens of the United States, who, waving American flags, treated the crowd to a surprise performance of “God Bless America.” 
Adult education programs like these are offered by community colleges, school districts, and non-profit organizations across the country, and are in high demand by people seeking a second chance at improving their lives through education; by employers looking for talented, credentialed workers in a tight labor market; and by immigrants drawn to the promise of America. 
Recently, these programs seemed to be at risk, as the Trump administration announced that $716 million in adult education program funding that was supposed to be distributed to states by July 1 was being withheld. The administration said the freeze on these funds was due to a wider review of resources allocated to education, under suspicion that, according to a spokesperson at the Office of Management and Budget, “Many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”  
Last week, facing mounting criticism, the Trump administration said that it will release the adult education funds – along with more than $4 billion in other funding for K-12 schools and higher education that had also been held back.  
That news was a huge relief. Still in place, however, is a directive in letters sent by the US Department of Education to colleges rescinding guidance that had been in place since 1997 that allowed federal funds to be used for undocumented residents in some adult education programs. The letters notified them the “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders” executive order signed by President Trump in February is intended to “prevent spending of American taxpayer dollars on Federal assistance for illegal aliens,” and therefore, colleges should no longer admit undocumented students into these programs. 
While the focus in these recent announcements is on ending federal support for undocumented residents, it is clear from other White House communications and actions that the broader agenda is to practically eliminate immigration into the United States entirely. 
In both of his terms in office, the Trump administration has taken aim at each of the principal ways that people from other countries can become naturalized United States citizens, including: 

Family-based sponsorship: A way for a US citizen or lawful permanent resident to sponsor close relatives for a green card that President Trump has derided as “chain migration,” and vowed to curtail by reducing the categories of eligible family members, increasing income requirements, and imposing stricter, more time-consuming vetting processes. 


Employment-based sponsorship: A way for an employer to sponsor a foreign national for a green card with a qualifying job offer that Trump is aggressively trying to limit through stricter interpretation of H1-B visa requirements, setting higher wage requirements for work visas, and enhanced vetting of visa applications, which slows processing time and presents barriers for employers seeking to fill vacant positions. 


Refugee or asylee status: A process used to recognize individuals fleeing their home country because of a fear of persecution that the Trump administration has nearly eliminated by suspending the US Refugee Admissions Program, suspending asylum applications for anyone attempting to cross America’s southern border, and ending Temporary Protected Status designations for asylees from Afghanistan, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and other strife-torn nations. 

These steps are in addition to the Trump administration’s attempts to end birthright citizenship, which has been guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution since 1868; and severely limit the number of international students studying at American universities through travel bans, suspension of visa interviews, social media vetting, and other steps designed to dissuade aspiring scholars from other countries from considering American higher education. 
Despite this array of restrictions on everyday people attempting to emigrate to the United States, Trump has proposed, and even set up a web site for wealthy foreigners interested in applying for, the “Trump Card,” which offers US citizenship to anyone willing to pay $5 million for the privilege. 
The president is not alone in pursuing these immigration restrictions.  Although it passed by the narrowest possible margin in Congress, the recently enacted “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” contains a number of provisions, like a 300 percent increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), $45 billion for construction of ICE detention facilities, and $46 billion for border wall construction, designed to deter would-be immigrants to America. 
Taken together, Trump’s executive orders since January and his signing of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” Act represent a radical shift in federal policy toward immigrants, based largely on myths and misinformation, like claims that immigrants are overrunning the US population, are more prone to committing violent crime, and are taking American jobs or relying on welfare assistance. In fact: 

The proportion of foreign-born residents of the US is the same today as it was in the early 1900s. While the share of the population made up immigrants has increased in recent decades, it is now same as it was at the turn of the 20th century. According to the Migration Policy Institute, in 1910, 14.7 percent of US residents were born in other countries. Today, that figure is slightly lower, at 14.3 percent. 


Immigration is stabilizing our population. Massachusetts has experienced a net migration of native-born citizens out of the state each year since 2011, and we have slipped from 9th to 16th place in population size. Immigration has been the only way we did not actually lose population overall. And the same is true across New England, which has the oldest average population of any region in the country and, as the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has noted, is being reenergized through immigration.  The consequences of losing population are significant, and include a smaller workforce, fewer consumers, and fewer representatives in Washington. 


Immigrants are educated: According to the Migration Policy Institute, 48 percent of recently arrived immigrants have a college degree, compared to only 38 percent of native-born Americans. 


Immigrants are law-abiding: One of the big fears often stoked about immigrants is crime, and accusations that those seeking asylum or citizenship are violent criminals. But numerous studies over the years have demonstrated conclusively that immigrants commit fewer crimes and have lower rates of incarceration than native-born US citizens. 


Immigration improves our economy: According to a study from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, “Most economists agree that the effects of immigration on the US economy are broadly positive,” and include: 


Increased wages: Immigrants often do not compete for the same jobs as native US citizens, putting minimal downward pressure on wages. Rather, immigrants’ consumer needs increase the demands for goods and services, and studies find that immigration has actually raised average wages of native-born workers over the past few decades. 


Improved innovation: Immigrants account for a disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms. In addition, the presence of immigrants often creates opportunities for less-skilled native workers to become more specialized in their work, thereby increasing their productivity. 


Higher tax revenue: Contrary to one often expressed belief, most immigrants, including those in the country without authorization, pay significantly more in taxes over a lifetime than they consume in government services. According to a report by Pew Research, immigrants in the US illegally contribute more than $12 billion annually in state and local taxes. The average estimated tax rate of unauthorized immigrants is 8 percent, while the wealthiest one percent of Americans pay just over 5 percent. Approximately 75 percent of unauthorized immigrants contribute to Social Security—a benefit they are not even eligible to receive. 


Saving retirement: The US population is getting older. In 1990, there were five workers in America for every retiree. Now, there are only three. Without immigration, by 2030 that ratio will fall to only two—not enough to sustain our population of retirees. 

Over the past few national election cycles, our nation has seemingly swung from one extreme to another as each party has sought to impose its vision for immigration on a population that appears equally divided over which way to turn. 
A few years ago, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, ever the pragmatist, suggested that what we really need is “A high wall with a big gate,” an approach that would balance our very real need for national security and social cohesion with our equally compelling need for shoring up our aging, birth-rate-declining population with the energy and vibrancy of immigrants seeking a better way of life. 
The last time Congress passed meaningful comprehensive immigration reform that moved us in that direction was nearly 40 years ago, when President Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which imposed penalties on employers who knowingly hired undocumented immigrants and increased funding for border security, but also provided amnesty and a path to citizenship for nearly three million undocumented immigrants. 
President Reagan, and indeed leaders of both political parties until recently, recognized the importance of immigration to the very essence of what it means to be an American. 
In his final speech as president, which is worth taking a few minutes to watch as a reminder of why he was called “the great communicator,” Reagan noted, “We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people—our strength—from every country and every corner of the world. And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation.”  
Then he cautioned, “If we ever close the door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon be lost.” 
Four decades later, under the policies being implemented by the Trump administration, we are rapidly spiraling in the direction Reagan feared for the nation. 
Reagan added one more particularly poignant point, which was inescapably obvious to the crowd watching those half-dozen newly naturalized American citizens wave their flags and sing “God Bless America” at the recent graduation ceremony for Northern Essex’s Center for Adult Education: “Those who become American citizens love this country even more.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)As residents rally to alert neighbors to immigration agents around the city, Durham City Council member Javiera Caballero warned Saturday that anyone could be arrested off the street and detained.
Speaking to an audience of around 70 at a “State of Durham” town hall held in the Durham County Main Library, Caballero said the massive boost in funding given to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the recent congressional megabill would only embolden the agency to abduct noncitizens and citizens alike.
“Once that money really hits, what’s going to happen to our community is actually quite terrifying. And so when I say we’re going to have to put our bodies on the line, it’s not hyperbole,” Caballero said. “They will disappear folks, they will kidnap folks, and it’s not just going to be folks who, quote, shouldn’t be here.”
Though the discussion, moderated by organizers with Kids Voting Durham and a journalist from INDY Week, ranged from housing and transit to education and crime, the presence of ICE and other ways the city might be targeted by immigration enforcement proved a recurring source of anxiety among audience members.
Caballero said she was proud of the city for mustering an “amazing community response” to ICE agents spotted at the Durham County Courthouse, apparently seeking to detain a man ahead of his initial court appearance. Their presence became widely known through immigrant advocacy group Siembra NC’s “ICE Watch” program, which trains spotters who monitor their communities for ICE amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.
“Those are the kinds of things we’re going to have to be doing, bringing attention to it and then really fighting for our community,” she said. “When we say that Durham is a welcoming place, it’s not just a tagline — we believe it.”

‘It’s about mass deportation’
Nida Allam, who chairs the Durham Board of County Commissioners, said standing up to ICE will take a collective effort from residents.
“Showing up when there’s ICE sightings, making sure community is out there to witness, record, document what is happening to make sure that our community stays as safe as possible, and that there’s a record of these incidents so that way we can protect our community,” said Allam, among the local officials who spoke out at the courthouse last month.
She pointed to the case of Greensboro man Mohamed Naser, a Libyan father of five detained in July who has spent weeks in a Georgia detention facility. Though he was granted bond, ICE denied his release. “He has been here on a valid visa, is a pending asylum case, and unfortunately, they have taken him away from his family, he’s the main breadwinner,” she said.

“We know that U.S. citizens have been taken all over this country already, and kept in detention for weeks while they’re trying to get legal services to get themselves out,” Caballero said.
Durham School Board Chair Bettina Umstead stressed that “every student is welcome in our public school system,” and noted that they do not ask for the immigration status of enrollees. Asked how Durham Public Schools would address ICE agents attempting to come onto the property, she was circumspect.
“Our principals all have a guidance document around what to do in the public school system, and I think there was a message sent to families that we are aware of what’s going on,” Umstead said. “We want to be really mindful of what we’re sharing publicly to everyone to make sure that our policies and procedures around safety at school stay something that remain private.”
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham), who billed herself as the bearer of bad news throughout the forum, said the passage of House Bill 318 over Governor Josh Stein’s veto would only expand ICE’s ability to seize North Carolinians. The bill requires sheriffs to vet the immigration status of detainees and hold them beyond their time of release pending ICE action.
“It’s no longer about public safety, it’s about mass deportation, and it’s right out of the Project 2025 playbook,” Morey said. “We’re still going to fight it, we’re going to do all we can to take that back.”
After she alluded to the fact that the bill became law only after a single Democrat joined with Republicans to override the veto, an audience member interrupted: “Let’s name her name, Carla Cunningham.”
‘What’s affordable?’
In stark contrast to clashes over immigration, Durham officials described continued support from the federal government in expanding the city’s and region’s transportation infrastructure.
“The federal government hasn’t really cut transit dollars — that’s not what we’re seeing so far,” Caballero said. “That’s one space that we’re kind of very much holding our breath around, but the federal dollars are still moving forward.”
She described the city’s plan to move forward on a bus rapid transit project through a federal grant, upgrading a line from Duke Hospital through downtown to Wellons Village, one of the highest ridership communities in the city. “Bus rapid transit is basically your regular bus line but way nicer and faster,” she said.

At the interstate level, Caballero noted that federal funding also continues to support the S-Line “Raleigh to Richmond” Amtrak expansion, which is set to create a faster passenger train line connecting Washington to Atlanta through North Carolina and neighboring states. She urged residents to make their voices heard in the upcoming midterm elections to ensure that elected members of Congress continue to support the state’s transit initiatives.
She expressed frustration, however, that so much of the state-level transit dollars are tied to the widening of old roads and the construction of new ones — to the point that the Triangle West Transportation Planning Organization, which she and Allam serve on, expects to forgo much of the North Carolina Department of Transportation funding.
“Having an effective General Assembly that doesn’t hate its cities would be great,” Caballero said. “[We decided] we didn’t want to take NCDOT dollars that were just going to expand roads and make them wider, that we really wanted to move away from that, that it did not align with our goals around transit and climate.”
Allam said transit and housing affordability are the two biggest issues where she sees the potential for bipartisan collaboration. She noted that Johnston County, long a Republican stronghold, is on track to be the fastest growing county in the state from now to 2055 — creating the same pressures around growth that have long affected more urban and left-leaning areas in the state.
“Affordable housing 10 years ago was a Raleigh issue, a Charlotte issue. It wasn’t a Johnston County issue, it wasn’t a Person County issue,” Allam said. “And now, it is.”
Morey said affordability would be out of reach so long as workers in the state are underpaid.
“What’s affordable? When you’re paying people $7.25 an hour minimum wage that hasn’t gone up in 20 years, how are you ever going to have affordable housing?” she asked. “Putting a down payment, the rent, the dream of buying a house is going out of reach for people and we need to do better.”
‘Bored kids cause trouble’
Another area of concern around federal funding is education, city officials said, pointing to after-school and summer programs that rely on money from the Department of Education that has been in doubt. Those funds were frozen by the Trump administration and only released after lawsuits from dozens of states, including North Carolina.
“When that federal freeze happened in the summer, there was a lot of concern from community partners that work directly with our Durham Public Schools students over, can we fund our program? This is where students go after school,” said Umstead, the school board chair.

Officials connected the existence of these programs and other educational opportunities with crime prevention. Discussing gun violence, Umstead touted a “text-to-tip” program allowing students to report potential threats as well as mental health investments like therapy provided on school property.
“The role the school system needs to play is to make sure students have connections to all the opportunities that are listed there,” Umstead said. “How do we make school an exciting place for students to be, that’s a connector to the other places?”
Caballero, a mother of three teenagers, pointed to crime reports showing teenage boys getting access to guns, often stolen out of unattended vehicles, and warned that “bored kids cause trouble.”
“There’s not enough for them to do, you can’t even go to an arcade in most places in Durham because it’s a 21-plus establishment, and so we have to do better by our youth,” she said. “How do we, as a community, make sure that we’re offering what we can to our kids and keeping them busy?”
Speakers also criticized attacks on reading materials and diversity, equity, and inclusion in schools. Morey called a set of bills seeking to ban DEI in North Carolina “horrific,” and said it was vital that lawmakers uphold Stein’s vetoes on them.
“It is criminalizing a concept, diversity, equity, inclusion, our country is built on,” Morey said. “In my eight years, they’re the most despicable bills I have ever seen.”
After the forum, resident David McCole said the bills seeking to ban DEI were his top concern. He added that he was impressed with Morey’s earlier comments on income inequality, adding that he was glad she called out tax breaks given to corporations under changes to North Carolina’s fiscal policy.
“Our General Assembly is not doing enough or anything to look at where we stand and helping our workforce, the people at the lower level of the economic scale,” he said. “How do we improve their ability to be able to afford things such as rent or housing, things along those lines? I loved her comments on that.”
Attendee Najerie McMillian said she was disturbed by the ongoing ICE arrests in the community.
“It’s disheartening to hear what ICE is doing. They’re actually going to schools and churches trying to pull people out,” McMillian said. “It’s actually U.S. citizens, people born and raised here, whose parents and grandparents were born and raised here, getting snatched up too.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Durham-Town-Hall-Featured-1024x641.jpg,,,2025-08-03 08:56:19.365128

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
In Utah, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson’s Office shared its letter  to the Department of Justice in response to its request, which says the state has provided its publicly available voter registration list. Henderson’s office also pushed back on the department’s claim that Utah has “the lowest rate in the nation for voter registration records removed from the voter registration rolls.”
“Utah remains one of the most proactive states for maintaining current and accurate voter registration rolls,” explaining that the department was relying on the limited reporting available from Utah’s 25-year-old system, which is being replaced.
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

Every choice we make matters — and the choices we make right now will affect how prepared we are for our next natural disaster.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Anne Watson: How to flex your flood preparedness muscle.","This commentary is by Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington. She is chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy. She has served in the Vermont Senate since 2023 and was previously Montpelier’s mayor from 2018 to 2022.


It has been heartbreaking to see flash flooding occur in Vermont for the past three summers, and increasingly around the country as well. 
I, for one, do not want to let this kind of news begin to feel normal. This is not the Vermont I grew up in. It is already hotter and wetter from climate change, and there are a number of things we can do as individuals, homeowners and renters to be prepared for the next natural disaster. 
What the last three years have taught me is that flooding and erosion can impact anyone anywhere in Vermont, depending on what areas receive intense rainfall. So it’s important that we are all prepared for that possibility.

READ MORE

Every choice we make matters — and the choices we make right now will affect how prepared we are for our next natural disaster. Here are some practical steps you and your family can take to be better prepared for potential flooding events. Some of them may apply to you, some may not, but these are taken directly from Vermont Emergency Management’s website:

Install “check valves” in sewer traps to prevent flood water from backing up into the drains in your home.
Ensure your home is ready. Where possible, minimize damage from basement flooding by elevating utilities and materials that could be damaged by limited basement flooding.
Anchor fuel tanks to ensure that they do not wash away, which can create a safety and environmental issue inside or outside of the home.
Develop a family emergency kit, which could include food and water, medications, a first aid kit, and a flashlight with extra batteries, amongst other things.
Make a family communication plan. Designate an out-of-state relative as a central point of contact.
Be prepared to turn off electrical power when there is standing water, fallen power lines or before you evacuate. Know how to safely turn off gas and water supplies before you evacuate.
Contact your insurance agent or local government to discuss flood insurance coverage.

Other recommendations from ready.gov include: knowing evacuation routes, safeguarding documents and planning with your neighbors.
Also, if you have not signed up for VT-Alerts — which, according to the state’s website, is “used to notify the public of emergency situations,” such as evacuation information, severe weather advisories and roadway interruptions — now would be a great time to do that. 
You can sign up by following the instructions on the VT-Alert website. WCAX reports that only 90,000 Vermonters have signed up to receive these alerts — 14% of the state’s total population. I would highly recommend doing so to anyone living or working in Vermont.
Finally, I’ll add one recommendation of my own. Since we know these events are driven and exacerbated by climate change, we all also have an obligation to do what we can to reduce our fossil fuel consumption. 
Thankfully, most renewable alternatives are much cheaper to operate than their fossil fuel counterparts. Maybe this means taking the bus or carpooling; leasing or buying an EV or plug-in hybrid; or adding a heat pump, pellet stove or another renewable heating system. 
For each of us the solutions may look different, but it’s important that we are all looking to take that next step toward the ways in which we can reduce carbon pollution.
Meanwhile, the Legislature will continue to have more work to do this next session to protect and prepare Vermont for potential natural disasters. This includes ensuring that Vermont’s dams are safe and that we are protecting our wetlands to help prevent and reduce the risks from these kinds of events in the future.
We all have a part to play. We can all make a difference to ensure that our families and neighbors are safe and able to weather the storms that we know are likely to continue on into the future.
You can access multi-language translations, a free workbook and other resources on the Vermont Emergency Management website.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-03 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Tommy Duff might attempt what few have done: win a governor’s race in first campaign,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/03/tommy-duff-governor-campaign/,"Column: If ultra successful businessman Tommy Duff does run for governor of Mississippi in 2027, history will not be on his side.","If ultra successful businessman Tommy Duff does run for governor of Mississippi in 2027, history will not be on his side.
Duff of Hattiesburg, who along with his brother James are listed as the state’s only billionaires, according to Forbes Magazine, has made no secret of the fact he is considering a run for governor.
If he does, it will mark the first time for Duff’s name to be placed on ballot for public office. The 68-year-old would be starting his political career vying for the highest office in Mississippi.
Combustible Vicksburg contractor Kirk Fordice, a unique politician in Mississippi on many levels, is the only person in the modern era to win the Mississippi governorship in his first venture as a candidate.
All other successful candidates for governor in the modern era have held other elected offices before capturing the seat.
Going all the way back to the 1950s, Ross Barnett was a successful trial attorney before running for governor — his first elected office. He lost the governor’s race twice before finally winning the post in 1959 and then becoming a national figure as he fought to maintain Mississippi’s segregated society.
A few other people have tried to win the governor’s mansion in their first campaigns. They have not been successful.
People always say a candidate needs strong name identification to run for governor. Even though he has not run for statewide office, Duff has the wherewithal and presumably the willingness to write seven — and maybe eight — figure checks to develop that recognition. And with his money, he has the ability to craft the narrative he wants Mississippians to hear.
But what we don’t know yet is whether Duff has the “it” factor. Will Duff look comfortable in his own skin traveling around the state asking people for their support?
Often, though not always, it comes down to the old adage that people vote for the candidate with whom they would have a beer or glass of tea.
It can take a special personality to navigate campaigning. Experience on the campaign trail helps develop the skills to do and say the right things in often stressful circumstances. It helps to be quick on your feet.
Andy Mullins, a longtime administrator at the University of Mississippi and before then an aide to Gov. William Winter, tells the story of Winter campaigning.
Winter entered a drug store in south Mississippi and went to the pharmacist to ask for his support. The pharmacist told him in no uncertain terms, Mullins said, that he would not vote for Winter because he would not help get his son into medical school.
After enduring a verbal beating from the pharmacist, Mullins recalled what Winter said as he left the store: “Put the pharmacist down as undecided.”
Who knows how Duff will perform if he does engage in his first campaign. He may be a natural.
Many thought Tupelo businessman Jack Reed was a natural in 1987 when he entered the governor’s race as a political novice. Indeed, he did appear to be one, but he ran into and lost a close election to a politician with more experience in Ray Mabus.
Reed will go down with others, such as Mike Sturdivant and John Arthur Eaves Jr., who waged and lost their maiden political campaign for the hard-to-obtain office of governor.

BURLINGTON — Vermont’s dirt roads span 8,534 miles — more than the straight-line distance between Burlington and San Francisco three times over. They contribute to the state’s rustic charm, bring tourists looking for gravel biking and are beloved by rural residents.
They are also particularly vulnerable to floods. 
Runoff from any type of road can harm water quality, but Vermont has some 1,300 more miles of dirt than pavement — and that dirt is subject to easy erosion. 
With the state experiencing an increase in flooding, those old roads are hitting waterways and their ecosystems hard. 
And the state is pretty much stuck with them. “Putting in paved roads is very expensive, and we just don’t have that kind of funding in Vermont to want to do that,” said Jim Ryan, former manager of the Vermont Municipal Roads Program with the Department of Environmental Conservation.
But there are ways to improve those roads that reduce pollution and strengthen against floods. 
Like paved roads, dirt roads are essentially impervious, meaning they do not absorb water, said Beverly Wemple, a University of Vermont professor who helps lead the college’s Water Resources Institute. When it rains, water washes across those surfaces, eroding sediment and running into ditches or bodies of water.
Phosphorus likes to bind to sediment, meaning it gets swept away too. In excess, it fuels harmful algae blooms — as is the case in Lake Champlain, where runoff has deposited high levels of the nutrient. Large sections of the lake are on the federal impaired waterways list.
Phosphorus aside, those sediments can hurt aquatic ecosystems where plants and animals struggle to survive in water choked with dirt and debris. 
Wemple’s research helped bring attention to dirt road runoff at a time when Vermont was focusing more and more on water quality. 
A 2008 lawsuit alleging poor pollution control forced federal and state officials to revise plans for Lake Champlain. State lawmakers passed the Vermont Clean Water Act in 2015, anticipating stricter standards. Those came a year later when federal officials tightened limits on phosphorus in the lake. 
People wanted a better understanding of where the phosphorus was coming from.
Funded by the Lake Champlain Basin Program, Wemple studied the impact of Vermont’s transportation network on water quality.
Tropical Storm Irene hit while research was underway, allowing Wemple’s team to also see what happens to Vermont’s roads when they flood, she said. 
The study, released in 2013, proved erosion from dirt roads was a significant source of sediment in waterways — and confirmed phosphorus attached to the sediment was polluting Lake Champlain. It also included research on ways to keep water off roads and reduce runoff.
“That research essentially gave us the first piece … of scientific evidence of the importance of our road network as a source of pollutant transfer but also of the potential for some fairly straightforward practices to minimize that pollutant runoff,” Wemple said. 
After the new phosphorus regulations, the state created a permit program that set road standards for towns. It aimed to reduce erosion contributing to phosphorus pollution. The Department of Environmental Conservation and Agency of Transportation run the program. 
Towns must record the condition of their roads and key characteristics — such as whether they connect to water and whether they use storm drains, or ditches and culverts, for drainage. Over half the roads in Vermont connect to waterways, the state says.
The Agency of Natural Resources says open-drainage roads — those with culverts and ditches — are often gravel and produce the most phosphorus. Those roads are where the bulk of the standards are applied.
Towns must upgrade roads not up to code. For a dirt road, this usually means improving drainage: lining ditches with stones and vegetation to filter out sediment.
There are also improvements to the road itself. Crowning a road, or lowering the sides so the high point is in the middle, helps it shed water, as does removing berms and ruts that trap water. Another element: properly sizing culverts, the tunnels that allow water to pass underneath roads. 
“We were able to document that many of these practices are quite effective in both reducing erosion and making the transportation network more flood resilient,” said Wemple. 
Through the Agency of Transportation’s Better Roads Program, towns can apply for grants to cover projects.
Making improvements also helps protect from floods, said Ryan. Working as a deputy stream engineer in the aftermath of Irene, and doing “flood forensics” after the 2023 floods, he found that up-to-standard roads came away in better shape.
Where there was damage, the culprit was most frequently culvert size, he said. Often the issue stemmed from small culverts under driveways or over intermittent streams. In heavy rain, culverts have to handle more water than usual. If they’re too small, they flood or get blocked by debris, leading to a domino effect where one failed culvert takes out several others down the road, Ryan said.
Municipalities are slowly updating their roads. Ryan said Vermont towns have an average of 25 miles of roads running directly into waterways and are upgrading about a mile a year.  
Flood resilience can get a boost right away, but maintenance is ongoing. 
“There’s no finish line there. The road grader always has to go out and put a proper crown on the road, remove the grader berm, lower the road’s shoulders and clean out the ditches,” Ryan said.
His observations are set to be tested: Wemple just began a two-year study on the impact of the road permit program on flood resilience in 2023 and 2024.
“We hear anecdotally … that it looks like places where we’ve upgraded the storm water infrastructure on roads, there were fewer damages,” she said. “But we don’t have the scientific evidence to back that up yet.” 
Wemple said people often ask, Should we just pave the roads?
One factor is uncertainty about which is worse for water quality. Wemple said there’s not much difference between paved and unpaved.
But there’s also what she called “the societal question.”
“Many of us in Vermont are quite attached to our rural landscapes and those unpaved roads,” she said. “And if we paved them, people would drive a lot faster. And we’d lose some of that rural ideal that we are really attached to.” 
Eric Barker lives on a dirt road in Underhill close to where he grew up. When he chose where to raise his family, a dirt road was a priority. 
“I don’t even think we looked at a single lot on pavement,” he said.
His driveway requires a lot of care, and his car has gotten stuck in the mud at inopportune times, but he said it’s worth it.
“I think you have to have the right vehicles, and I think you have to have the right mentality,” he said. He values the privacy his home allows for his family — and the sparse traffic. 
Dirt roads also draw tourism. Waterford resident Fritz Fay is president of Northeast Kingdom Gravel. The organization’s mission is to bring dollars to the Kingdom by mapping gravel biking routes and attracting tourists. 
The sport has exploded in recent years — and Fay said Vermont, with its sprawl of dirt roads, is ready made for it.
Big events and concentrated trails can overwhelm small towns, and locals often resent that, Fay said, but gravel biking is gentler. 
The NEK has witnessed that scenario in East Burke with the popular Kingdom Trails. Gravel biking brings in a few people at a time across multiple towns, Fay said. 
“It’s scattered, and that’s an advantage,” he said. 
The benefits go beyond drawing cyclists, though.
“If all these roads were paved, it’d be one less kind of unique thing to come to Vermont (for),” he said.

The historic home of Vermont’s oldest professional theater company rebounded after a 1962 fire and 2011’s Tropical Storm Irene, only to now face questions in the wake of a 2023 soaking.

WESTON — When the Weston Theater Company announced its musical now playing would be a stage adaptation of the 1954 film “White Christmas,” some locals wondered about the seeming incongruity of orchestrating summer with sleigh bells in the snow.
More residents, however, are worried about an even bigger toppling of tradition.
Upon its start in 1937, Vermont’s oldest professional acting troupe performed in a white-pillared playhouse on the postcard green of its namesake Windsor County town of 623 residents.
In 1962, a fire ravaged everything but the building’s Doric columns. In 1973 and 2011, storm overflow from the neighboring West River flooded the cellar of the restored structure. But come hell or high water, the company always reopened in keeping with the theatrical credo “the show must go on.”
Then on July 10, 2023, a record downpour swallowed up the playhouse’s basement and first floor. The troupe relocated to a smaller second stage at the nearby Walker Farm with hopes of bailing out the main theater in time for that summer’s musical — fatefully, the splashy “Singin’ in the Rain.”
But two years later, the playhouse sits empty as its nonprofit operators wrestle with questions about finances and the future.
“Our estimate right now is we’re three years out from getting back into the building, and when I tell people that, they’re shocked,” said Susanna Gellert, the theater company’s executive artistic director. “They think, ‘Why can’t we be back in tomorrow?’”

The answer, according to all involved, is almost as complicated as the bureaucratic paperwork they’re swimming in.
The theater company doesn’t own the playhouse, which was built as a church in 1839. Instead, the troupe leases it from the Weston Community Association, a volunteer-run nonprofit that also oversees the nearby 1795 Farrar-Mansur House museum and Cold Spring Brook Park.
In 2011, Tropical Storm Irene washed away a $700,000 renovation of the playhouse’s dressing rooms, prop shop and orchestra pit. Twelve years later, the 2023 floodwater rose about 30 inches higher, swelling cleanup costs to nearly $500,000 and the proposed reconstruction to as much as $5 million.
Both the community association and theater company are seeking damage reimbursements from insurance carriers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. They’re also planning separate fundraising campaigns to pay for their parts of a shared restoration project.
But the state fire marshal has closed the playhouse to the public until the community association replaces the alarm and sprinkler system — a nearly $200,000 expense that volunteers have yet to figure out how to fund.
“A lot of the people we know who are capable of writing a big check are reluctant to do so until all of the building mitigation has been done,” community association President David Raymond said. “It’s a Catch-22 situation.”

The community association and theater company are not giving up. They recently welcomed U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, to tell him about the cleanup challenges shared by dozens of communities statewide.
“When you look at this town at the helicopter level, we’ve got probably $12 million to $15 million worth of capital needs in the playhouse, fire station, post office, school,” Weston Town Moderator Wayne Granquist said. “That’s incredibly far beyond our capacity to raise money. We need to have external help.”
Welch didn’t promise federal funds, just words of understanding.
“The Weston Playhouse is such a community resource,” the senator said.
Planners are aiming to move all of the playhouse’s electrical and mechanical systems and backstage and storage space above the most recent flood line.
“It’s going to be a push to get the building sustainable, and then a push to get it functional again,” said Rebecca Marzalek-Kelly, the theater company’s general manager.
In the meantime, the theater company is presenting its 89th summer season at its nearby Walker Farm performance space.
“We’re doing what work we can right now so that we’re ready to get back into the playhouse once it’s ready,” Gellert said. “But all of that starts with funding.”
Raymond, for his part, knows the playhouse may be within walking distance of everything in town, but he and his community association colleagues have a long road ahead.
“Hope,” Raymond said when asked what kept him going. “And patience.”

U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
The race to replace Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is crowded on both sides.
Whitmer, a Democrat and potential 2028 presidential contender, is term-limited. The current Democratic primary contenders are Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist; Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson; Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson; and Marni Sawicki, the former mayor of Cape Coral, Florida. If elected, Gilchrist would be the state’s first Black governor.
The crowded Republican field includes Rep. John James, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox and Anthony Hudson, a truck driver who ran for Congress in Michigan’s 8th District in 2024.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a Democrat, is also running for governor but as an independent candidate, potentially throwing a wrench into the dynamics of what is expected to be one of the closest and most competitive 2026 governor’s races.
Michigan has long been a key swing state — and a pipeline for women leaders — where control of the governor’s office has switched between Democratic and Republican over the last 40 years. Former President Joe Biden won the state by 2.8 points in 2020. In 2024, Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin won her election to the U.S. Senate by just 0.3 points while President Donald Trump carried the state by 1.4 points.
In all, 36 governorships are up in 2026. Five Democratic-led states won by Trump in 2024 (Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) are holding elections for governor in 2026, while two Republican governors in states won by former Vice President Kamala Harris (New Hampshire and Vermont) are up for reelection.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3115471-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-03 06:56:17.412214

(Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Daniel Cressy yawned, tired after three days of watching a machine pull blood out of his body, extract his stem cells and pump the blood back in. Tubes protruded from the side of his neck, preventing him from turning his head. He gestured toward them while sitting in his hospital bed at the Manning Family Children’s Hospital.
“It’s uncomfortable at first, but then you kind of get used to it,” he said Wednesday.
The tubes were annoying, but, to Cressy, the reward is more than worth the discomfort: freedom from sickle cell disease. This procedure marked the first major step toward what he hopes is a long-lasting cure for the rare genetic blood disorder.
Over the next year and a half, Cressy’s genes will be altered to remove the trait that causes his red blood cells to sickle, or harden and bend in a way that blocks blood flow and causes immense pain. He will be the first patient in Louisiana to complete the gene therapy treatment.
The 22-year-old’s stem cells will be sent to a lab in Scotland where they will be treated with an enzyme to reach a specific part of the cells and edit the gene to stop his blood cells from changing shape. Then, Cressy’s edited stem cells will be returned to Louisiana and infused back into his body. More than 90% of the patients in a clinical trial who received this treatment known as Casgevy, went at least a year without sickled cells blocking blood flow.

(Christiana Botic/Verite New and CatchLight Local/Report for America)
The process is long and expensive. Between insurance approvals, paperwork and preliminary doctor appointments, it took Cressy nearly a year to get to this room. But, for Cressy, it’s the only way to achieve his dream of becoming a commercial pilot.
Three years ago, Cressy discovered his love of flying, but after hours of lessons, working toward his certification, he was told his dream might be impossible. People with sickle cell disease seeking a pilot’s license face scrutiny over their health backgrounds from the Federal Aviation Administration.
High altitudes can make cells more likely to sickle, creating the risk of intense pain while in the air if there isn’t enough oxygen.
“The Office of Aerospace Medicine routinely reviews evolving medical therapies and updates policies when there is proof that new treatments are safe in the aviation environment,” said an FAA spokesperson in a statement.
Cressy applied for his medical certification in 2022 but was rejected despite several appeals. To Cressy, his condition was manageable. Unlike many people with severe cases of sickle cell disease, he hasn’t needed frequent hospital visits and blood transfusions to avoid pain.
“One thing that people don’t understand is that sickle cell affects everybody differently,” he said. “I believed that I could fly without getting cured.” But the FAA disagreed.
When Cressy first asked for the treatment, his hematologist, Dr. Zach LeBlanc, said no. To LeBlanc, a career in aviation didn’t seem like a top medical priority. But Cressy’s passion – and an official rejection from the FAA – changed LeBlanc’s mind.
“The more I got to know him, I understood that it wasn’t as superficial as it appeared the first time,” said LeBlanc, a pediatric hematologist with the hospital who was part of clinical trials to develop another long-term sickle cell cure. “He was really serious about this, and he understood the risk.”

Traditionally, bone marrow transplants have been the primary way to provide long-lasting relief, but patients have to fit specific criteria and find an unrelated donor with a close genetic match. The right bone marrow donor is hard to find, and Cressy didn’t have many options for a cure until two gene therapies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2023. Children’s Hospital is the first in the state to be approved to administer the treatments.
Cressy and LeBlanc hope other sickle cell patients will soon receive better care.  The Louisiana Department of Health recently estimated that at least 3,000 people in the state have been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia.
The disorder occurs mostly in Black people like Cressy. It’s caused by a genetic mutation that evolved and spread across much of Africa as a response to malaria. People who only have one sickle cell gene are at least 90% more resistant to malaria, but if a person inherits two sickle cell genes, they will develop the painful disorder.
Many health care providers and researchers, including LeBlanc, now acknowledge how the medical community has historically neglected and stigmatized patients with the disorder. But LeBlanc believes, especially with the addition of new treatments at Children’s Hospital, that such care is starting to improve.
“Sickle cell disease in the state of Louisiana is hopefully in a time where it can really change,” he said.
There are still vast areas in rural parts of the state where basic care for sickle cell isn’t available, especially for adults, but there’s been an uptick in attention, he said.
Advocates for people living with the disorder say that attention is much needed. Courtney Davis is the deputy executive director of the Sickle Cell Association of South Louisiana. He said the state legislature has begun to pay more attention to the disorder, forming a commission and starting a registry to monitor the prevalence of the condition in 2021.
“There’s a lack of knowledge about sickle cell,” said Davis, who is also living with sickle cell disease. “We’re always trying to garner more support for sickle cell all over the state.”
Compared to other rare disorders like cystic fibrosis, there’s a large disparity in both public and private funding for sickle cell treatments and cures, researchers have found. Disparities in health care for Black Americans also affect how patients are treated.

Rhonda Chube, a community health worker with the Sickle Cell Association of South Louisiana, said her clients often face stigma when trying to receive care. They struggle to get hospitals and employers to understand the severity of their pain, she said.
“They may look okay physically, but what’s going on inside their body is where the problem is,” she said.
The condition also comes with financial burden due to hospitalizations, transfusions and regular doctor appointments. Chube and Davis said it’s nearly impossible to survive the disorder  without insurance.

Many patients also need insurance in order to afford a curative treatment like Cressy’s. The medication alone costs $2 to $3 million. The stem cell collection and infusion, among other doctor visits, add another few hundred thousand dollars.
Lynn Winfield, Manning Family Children’s Hospital’s senior director of patient care services, said it can take more than a year for private insurance providers to approve reimbursement for the procedures. Without that guarantee, neither the patient nor medical providers can afford the treatment. Medicaid recipients are easier to get approved, but Winfield said she worried that could change with recent federal cuts to funding.
Winfield said the hospital is already lining up more patients, including a boy from Shreveport.
Cressy hopes he is only the beginning. He plans to advocate for more people with sickle cell as he goes through treatment and is excited to eventually become one of the first commercial pilots with the disorder. Cressy will be following in the footsteps of a friend with sickle cell who participated in a gene therapy clinical trial in Atlanta two years ago. They met through a Reddit post, bonding over experiencing the same roadblock to aviation. That friend, Cressy said, has since received a pilot’s license.

“Becoming aviators with sickle cell was once something that people thought was impossible,” he said from his hospital bed, wearing a Mr. Impossible t-shirt that he created. “My buddy has already proved to the world that it’s not. Nothing is impossible.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Less than a month after I moved to Durham for graduate school, Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina. Helene, the deadliest storm to ever hit the state, took 108 lives and caused an estimated $48.8 billion in damage. Less than a year later, Tropical Storm Chantal killed six North Carolinians and did more than $56 million in damage to Orange County. This is just one of the 13 counties for which Governor Stein declared a state of emergency. The physical and emotional trauma being felt during this time reminds me of watching my hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana struggle to overcome tragic extreme weather events.
As a Gulf Coast native, I’ve felt the presence of natural disasters my entire life. When I was three, I evacuated New Orleans with my mother and younger sister ahead of Hurricane Katrina. When the levees broke, my dad watched the water rise up, filling our street and submerging our front lawn, creeping up the steps to the top lip of our front porch. We were lucky the water began to drain before it could make it into the house.
As I grew older, I felt Katrina’s legacy in New Orleans. Many people were not as fortunate as my family – some lost their homes and others their lives. Some who made it out during evacuations or in the storm’s aftermath never returned to New Orleans. I worry for my family that still lives there.
Throughout my childhood and adolescence, we experienced other large storms. None were as seriously damaging as Katrina, but it was common to wake up to felled tree branches and flooded streets. In 2021, Category 4 Hurricane Ida whipped through New Orleans, leaving the city without power for over three weeks at the hottest time of the year. Unfortunately, such extreme weather experiences were not limited to my time in New Orleans.
The morning after Chantal hit Durham, my coworkers and I watched live news reports of the 130 casualties caused by flash flooding in Texas. Twenty-seven young girls were killed by the floods while attending a sleepaway camp similar to the one I attended for seven summers.
While watching these reports in shock and horror, I listened to people calling the disaster an unavoidable “act of God.” Of course, we should dedicate thoughts and prayers to the families suffering during this tragedy, but the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather is not random. It is directly attributable to human-induced climate change. To prevent future tragedies, we need accurate forecasts and warnings, timely federal relief programs, more resilient infrastructure, and climate action plans.
It is mystifying to me that the president claimed that he is investing in technology to protect people from extreme weather events on the same weekend he slashed support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and renewable energy. We need to be proactive, not reactive, and that means investing in climate adaptation.
Devastating extreme weather events are our new reality, no matter what state you live in. If it’s not a hurricane, it’ll be a tornado like the one that hit St. Louis in May of this year. Or wildfires like those that burned through Los Angeles in January. Or an extreme heat wave like the heat dome that is triggering heat alerts from Nebraska to Florida this past week.
As someone just starting to establish a career and life as a young professional, I fear the upcoming years during which extreme weather will become an even more powerful and disastrous force. Flooding from Chantal in Durham wiped out an entire suspension bridge in the Eno River State Park, where I frequently hike and recreate with friends. This is reality for my lifetime, and I want to do something about it.
We need to get serious about climate action. Without concerted environmental efforts, communities will continue to suffer, and people will needlessly die. We need to make our voices heard.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7182574-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-03 06:56:17.412214

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.
“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture where officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
State suicide prevention efforts are lacking amid federal cuts

About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, though most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.
Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health issues in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health issues.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would negatively affect an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers also disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that –– to provide those services,” Archbold said.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Nevada has had either the highest or one of the highest unemployment rates in the U.S. over most of the 21st century. In the latest report Nevada has the nation’s second highest jobless rate, behind only the Musk-ravaged District of Columbia.
Occasionally Nevada’s notoriously persistent high unemployment rate is attributed to almost optimistic factors, like an economy in transition that is diversifying away from service sector jobs.
But for all the state tax breaks ladled to pretty much any expanding or relocating company that asks for one, before Trump killed it earlier this year Canadian tourism still supported more jobs in Southern Nevada than manufacturing does. Statewide, manufacturing only accounts for less than 4% of the state’s total employment. Nevada remains primarily a service sector economy with a service sector workforce.
From 9-11 to the Great Recession to the pandemic and now the tariff chaos, every time Nevada’s service economy starts to emerge from a crisis, it gets hammered by another one. (And through it all, the state’s primary industry has taken advantage of the carnage to trim its workforce. In the summer of 2000, 210,000 people were employed in Nevada’s casino hotels; in June of this year, 157,000 were.)
Trump threw one of his trademark Queen of Hearts “off with her head” tantrums Friday and fired U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, because Friday’s BLS jobs report indicated the Trump economy hasn’t been creating anywhere near as many jobs as were being created nearly every month during the Biden years.
Trump insists on government employees who are more dedicated to toadying up to him than faithfully executing the legitimate duties required in their jobs.
So now presumably monthly jobs reports won’t be determined by the Current Employment Statistics survey of more than 100,000 private and public employers, along with analysis and modeling of additional tools used by the BLS. Instead, official employment statistics will be corruptly determined by whatever numbers Trump jots on a poster board with his beloved Sharpie.
Which brings us back to Nevada’s unemployment rate.
Monthly state unemployment rates basically mirror those reported by the BLS. So with Trump now insisting that federal employment data must reflect positively on him, it’s possible Nevada’s official unemployment rate could drop substantially. Not because of an improving Nevada economy, or because fewer people are unemployed, but because of the aforementioned Sharpie.
There are at least two scenarios by which Nevada’s unemployment rate could officially (but not really) drop.
First, Trump could take a break from his busy schedule of tariff madness, Texas gerrymandering, and Epstein nostalgia and notice that Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo is on the ballot next year. Trump could order his loyalists installed in the BLS to start lowering Nevada’s unemployment rate month by month. Then, when Democrats point out Lombardo has no economic policy to speak of, Campaign Joe could cite official data indicating the unemployment rate is dropping thanks to his economic mad skills.
Or, echoing his tariff-setting methodology, Trump could just pronounce arbitrary unemployment rates depending on how he feels about some state or other that day.
California? Ewww, a 9% unemployment rate because Gavin Newscum and woke, so Californians need to elect Republicans, Sharpie says.
Nevada? Oh, perhaps a little below the national average, just like Lombardo’s net approval rating. At least until the election. After that, it depends. If Lombardo remains governor and very nicely and publicly proclaims that his reelection was only possible thanks to Trump’s benevolent magnificence, Sharpie will say Nevada’s unemployment is super low. If Lombardo loses, only California’s is higher, or something along those lines.
“When leaders of other nations have politicized economic data, it has destroyed public trust in all official statistics and in government science,” reads a statement on Trump firing the BLS commissioner issued by a group led by the person Trump named to head the BLS during his first term.
Destroying public trust? Nothing is more dear to Trump’s heart. (See: Democracy and elections, Trump’s undermining of and assaults on.)
“Policymakers themselves are induced to undertake mistaken interventions in the economy if the data upon which decisions are taken is incorrect,” write the authors of a 2024 academic article on governments manipulating economic statistics.
Hmm, guess that’s one way to get the Fed to lower interest rates — trick it with bogus data. What could possibly go wrong?
Closer to home, imagine Nevada’s budget forecasters trying to determine how much money the state can budget for education, public safety, Medicaid and all the other state programs and services if official economic data isn’t worth the poster board it was scribbled on.
Business and industry and banks and investors of course rely on government economic data when making all manner of decisions, so it would be in their interest to see credible research instead of Sharpie jottings. But U.S. corporate and financial powers have been brought to heel, and dare not say a discouraging word, lest Trump unconstitutionally crush them while the U.S. Supreme Court aggressively looks the other way.
“When I become president, it will mark the end of credible, reliable government data, which will be terrible for many, many households, and the history of economic disturbances in this century suggest the effects will be even more damaging in long-struggling Nevada” is not a promise Trump made while campaigning last year.
But if he had, he’d be on his way to keeping it.

Advocates say they save lives. Others say they encourage drug use.,"In late May, a group of people who had lost friends and family to drug overdoses gathered behind the velvet ropes just outside the House chamber at the state Capitol. 
Many of them had come to this building time and again to tell their stories to lawmakers, reliving painful memories of some of the worst moments of their lives. 
But on this day, they’d come full of hope: it was the final stretch of the 2025 legislative session, and they wanted to make one last push for passage of a landmark bill establishing Connecticut’s first overdose prevention centers. 
As the day unfolded, though, it became apparent that the bill faced a major roadblock: Gov. Ned Lamont. 
“‘We’re hearing that the governor’s threatening a veto,’” Diane Santos recalled another advocate telling her when she arrived at the Capitol. “I still didn’t fully grasp that it was going to play out the way that it was.”

Santos, who lost her 26-year-old son, Mark Collins, to an overdose in 2023, had spent the weekend emailing state representatives and had received encouraging responses. The measure was tucked into a bigger public health bill, and the odds of passage looked good, she thought. Another advocate had even spoken to Lamont by phone and came away feeling confident in his support. 
But now the word was out that Lamont would veto the broader bill if it included the overdose prevention center.
The provision would have made Connecticut one of the only states in the country to have an overdose prevention center, or OPC, a space equipped with supplies to mitigate the dangers of drug use that would allow people to bring illegal drugs and use them under the supervision of trained staff, equipped with supplies, like Narcan, that can prevent and reverse overdoses.
The concept, though relatively new in the United States, had won approval in the Connecticut Senate, and advocates expected the House to follow suit. They anticipated that Lamont would then sign the bill into law, and that, in time, the new center would join OPCs in states like New York and Rhode Island as a lifesaving instrument in the fight against drug overdoses. 
Last year in Connecticut, just shy of 1,000 people died of an overdose, down 35% from a peak of 1,530 in 2021, according to data from the Department of Public Health. Despite the unprecedented drop in deaths in both the state and country over the past couple of years, overdose remains the leading cause of death for American adults under 45. 
Supporters of overdose prevention centers — also known as supervised consumption or safe injection sites — say they are a crucial part of the fight to save lives, one that has for too long been avoided in the U.S. out of stigma and fear. With the availability of naloxone, the overdose reversal drug, saving lives is relatively straightforward as long as people don’t use drugs alone. Therefore, advocates say, the argument in favor of OPCs comes down to a simple truth: no one can recover from substance abuse disorder if they are dead. 
Skeptics question the legality of the centers and whether they encourage people to continue using instead of seeking treatment. Some also worry about their impact on the neighborhoods where they are placed. 
Evidence from around the world indicates that no one has ever died of a drug overdose at an OPC and that the facilities reduce public drug use and decrease demand on local emergency services without increasing crime. But accounts from advocates and community leaders in Rhode Island, New York City and Canada show that, even with evidence, it can take time to build approval among a public that isn’t familiar with the concept.

Lamont: “Wait and see” 
That afternoon at the Capitol, despite reports of the governor’s disapproval, Santos and other advocates kept on talking to legislators, hoping through some political maneuvering that their key issue would prevail.
But behind closed doors, the measure appeared doomed. The governor’s staff told House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, that Lamont would veto the bill if it included OPCs. In an effort to save the rest of the sprawling legislation, which tackled issues from fluoride in drinking water to pancreatic cancer screening, lawmakers sacrificed the OPC measure.
“Just complete disappointment,” Santos said of the result. “Just heartache and heartbreak and feeling like I was letting my son down all over again.”
In an interview with The Connecticut Mirror in July, Lamont said he had wanted more time to consider results from other states and see whether the facilities draw the ire of the Trump administration. 
“I think I said I’d have to take a look at it, but I’d be pretty reluctant to do it. I think it’s pretty early,” Lamont said. “I think Rhode Island really hadn’t gotten going yet. New York was going. Donald Trump was in office. He was coming down pretty hard.”
Plus, he said, Connecticut already uses nearly every tool at its disposal to combat the overdose crisis, including four harm reduction sites, with a fifth slated to open in Bridgeport, where people can get wound care, clean syringes, connection to counseling or just a cup of coffee.
“We have harm reduction sites already,” Lamont said. “We do everything in terms of Narcan and prevention and counseling and clean needles and such. We do everything except for the drug injection. And I just figured it was worth a little more wait-and-see.”
Lamont referenced a few conversations with individuals skeptical of the sites or their impact but said he hadn’t been on the receiving end of any significant opposition to the idea, either.
The legality of overdose prevention centers is itself controversial. Some question whether the centers violate the federal Controlled Substances Act, which prohibits maintaining a site “for the purpose of … using illegal drugs.” Others argue the law doesn’t apply to public health programs meant to prevent death. The sites in New York City and Providence have been able to operate mostly unbothered, but a 2019 Department of Justice lawsuit prevented the opening of an OPC in Philadelphia. 
An executive order issued by the Trump administration last month directed agencies to withhold discretionary grants from organizations like “safe consumption sites” that allow for illicit drug use.
Lamont did, however, suggest a willingness to consider the policy.
“It’s not something we’re saying ‘hell no’ to,” Lamont said. “Let’s just get a little more experience based on Rhode Island and perhaps a couple other states.” 
But the wait-and-see approach has enraged some advocates who say that people are dying now — advocates like Dita Bhargava of Greenwich, whose son died of an overdose in 2018. 
“I know the governor. I know he has a compassionate heart. But at the end of the day, I think, unfortunately, he doesn’t understand the disease. He doesn’t understand the gravity of this epidemic. Lives that can be saved are being lost.”

Other states are also taking it slow 
Lamont isn’t the only state leader taking a cautious approach, however. In 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a measure in California that would have allowed an “unlimited number” of sites, though he said he remained open to discussing a “truly limited pilot program.” Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont vetoed an OPC bill in 2022 and again in 2024, but, the second time around, lawmakers overrode his veto. 
In 2023, Connecticut’s Public Health Committee introduced a bill to establish three “harm reduction centers” that would include, among other services, a space where people could bring drugs to use under supervision. But legislators removed on-site drug use from the version that went to the broader legislature out of concerns from the administration about the use of state funding and conflicts with federal law, according to Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, the co-chair of the Public Health Committee.
This year’s effort would have established a pilot program of four OPCs without tapping state funding. The centers would include access to substance use disorder and mental health counseling, laundry, bathrooms and showers. The Public Health Committee passed the measure as a stand-alone bill, and the Senate cleared it as part of a sprawling public health bill.
Republican lawmakers on the committee, who nearly unanimously voted against the measure, voiced concern about the centers’ effects on surrounding communities and questioned whether they encourage drug use instead of treatment. 
During an eight-hour public hearing, advocates presented personal stories and real-world evidence, including studies suggesting the facilities prevent overdose deaths for clients, increase uptake of treatment services, reduce emergency-related health care costs and reduce public drug use and publicly discarded drug paraphernalia, without increasing crime rates in the surrounding areas.

Cameron Breen helps to coordinate the Statewide Harm Reduction Project, or SHaRP, a group of more than 100 overdose prevention advocates from around the state. He said the focus on abstinence-only solutions can be frustrating. 
“People think that the only truly successful intervention is the person stopping to use drugs altogether,” he said. “The reality is that substance use exists and too many of our community members are dying.”
But Breen agreed there’s room to increase community outreach in the future.
“Without it, we’re left in this limbo of people not having a good understanding of how much these centers save lives,” Breen said.
Rep. Tracy Marra, a Darien Republican and the only member of her party in favor of the measure during the Public Health Committee vote, said she understands her colleagues’ hesitation around community buy-in and potential effects on crime. 
Marra agrees the sites reduce overdose deaths but said she’s also interested in exploring other interventions that could be effective, like cleaning up the drug supply and stopping drugs from coming in across the border. 
With just three OPCs in the U.S., Marra added that studies about the effects of overdose prevention centers in this country are necessarily limited. There are over a hundred sites around the world, but what might work in Vancouver, for example, may not play out the same way in Waterbury, she said. Plus, she had concerns that the Connecticut bill proposed establishing four sites across the state, when New York City, with well over double the population, has only two.

Part of her questioning nature, Marra said, comes from witnessing the beginnings of the opioid crisis firsthand as a pharmacist. 
“We were taught as pharmacists that if someone was in pain, they would not get addicted to opioids,” Marra said. “Shame on me if I believe anything that quickly again.”
Marra has focused her legislative work in part on addressing the crisis, including a 2023 proposal to put Narcan in vending machines. During a visit to one of the OnPoint sites in New York City a few years ago, Marra became convinced OPCs were a powerful solution. But still, she said, the decision to establish them in Connecticut is “much more nuanced than that.” Other factors, like location and timing, have to make sense, too.
She encouraged elected officials, including Democrats voting ‘yes’ along party lines, to visit.
“Seeing the site, seeing this done, was definitely eye-opening,” Marra said. “If you don’t know what this is about, then go see.”

Success in Rhode Island
In an understated brick building in the heart of Providence’s medical district sits one of three OPCs in the entire country, Project Weber/RENEW. 
From the outside, Project Weber/RENEW looks much like the OB/GYN and spinal health offices that surround it. The first floor is a common space that feels like a cross between a church basement and a community center, outfitted with showers and laundry machines. There’s also a medical suite, staffed with a full-time nurse, behavioral health physician and part-time doctor, available for walk-in patients, with or without insurance. 
On the second floor, clients find the OPC. It’s a meticulously clean environment, with the hospitality of a better-quality medical office. There are individual stations for people to use illegal drugs with sterile supplies, a smoking room with a robust ventilation system, and of course, overdose-reversing naloxone kits. There are also oxygen tanks, which can prevent an overdose without painful withdrawal side effects.

The atmosphere is calm; a mellow Macy Gray song plays from a speaker, and staff members discretely check in on clients every 10 to 15 minutes. There’s even a room equipped with soft surfaces for when clients inadvertently take a drug that agitates them.
The center opened in Providence in January and has received high marks from advocates, elected officials and community members. The staff exude pride in the OPC and their lifesaving work. But the road to realizing that goal was a long and at times heartbreaking slog, one that could offer lessons on Connecticut’s stalled effort to open a center of its own. 
It took multiple attempts before Rhode Island’s governor, Dan McKee, signed an OPC bill in 2021, creating a two-year pilot. But the center still had to be funded, ultimately achieved with $2.6 million in settlement funds from opioid lawsuits. Then, organizations had to bid for the contract. 
Project Weber/RENEW won the bid. The group was already doing harm reduction work, like providing clean syringes, wound care supplies and access to medical treatment. But to open the OPC, they had to find a location and win approval from the Providence City Council.

City Councilwoman Mary Kay Harris represents Ward 11, home to the hospital district. She grew up and raised four kids here. When it comes to Ward 11, “I just love it.” 
Harris had some concerns about the OPC (like this common question: wouldn’t the OPC encourage drug use?). She wasn’t necessarily against the idea, but she didn’t want it in her ward, which includes Upper South Providence, a majority Black and Hispanic neighborhood where about a third of residents live below the poverty line. Neighbors there “had more than their fair share” of the city’s social services. 
“No, absolutely not,” Harris remembers thinking at the time.“It’s just too much pressure on the ward.”
Harris prides herself on being a good listener and making decisions based on consensus; in rejecting the OPC, she believed that she was representing her constituents. 
But in the months that followed, Harris began to hear from others, including advocates from Project Weber/RENEW, like Deputy Director Ashley Perry. Perry has lived experience with drug use and got involved with the organization as a volunteer running support groups for sex workers. Perry had been reluctant to engage with recovery groups in the past, which are often structured around repentant confessions.
“It didn’t feel good to always be reminded of the worst things that I’ve done,” Perry said. “I really wanted to move past that, and I really wanted to find safer ways for people who I knew were still suffering in a lot of different ways.” Project Weber/RENEW felt different, a nonjudgmental group giving people the tools to reduce harm and stop using drugs when they were ready.

But after Perry started volunteering, fentanyl sent the overdose death rate soaring. Then COVID worsened the isolation of the community, contributing to a leading cause of overdose: using alone. 
The group staged a mock funeral procession in January 2021, with doctors carrying caskets on their shoulders, representing 384 people who had died in the nation’s smallest state of an overdose the previous year. 
As time went on, Perry and her team became a constant presence in community and state-level meetings on the opioid epidemic, explaining why an OPC was needed. Their team also responded to calls from the community, like requests to pick up needles in neighborhoods. They were, Harris said, relentless. And Harris began attending meetings, too. 
“The more I attended, the more I understood, the more I heard people struggling, the more I heard people losing their family members, the more I heard drug addicts who said, ‘I’m not ready to stop using drugs.’”
Harris’s own granddaughter died of a fentanyl overdose during that time period, at age 26, a young woman she describes as joyful and creative. Harris believes an OPC might have saved her life. 
But it was before her death that Harris came around to the idea of putting the OPC in Ward 11, a change of heart she attributes partly to the location of the building. The proposed location wasn’t in a residential neighborhood or on a Main Street like she feared. Rather, it was a building in the medical district, accessibly located on a bus line.
Between opening day on Jan. 13, 2025, and July 8, Project Weber/RENEW saw 460 unique clients and performed 99 interventions to prevent overdose. They haven’t lost anyone to overdose so far. 
Perry and Harris are quick to talk about the importance of community buy-in as Connecticut considers its own OPC.
In New York City, where the two other OPCs in the U.S. are located, that kind of participation did not happen. City Councilwoman Carmen De La Rosa explained to The Connecticut Mirror that she learned, along with her constituents, during a press conference on the last day of former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration that New York would get two OPCs and that one of them would be located in her district of Washington Heights, a low-to-middle income neighborhood where about half of residents are immigrants. 
“I have to say that that has caused a lot of trouble in terms of the community feeling involved,” De La Rosa said. That includes the choice of location — near one of the largest and most popular parks in the neighborhood.
Though the OPC has since made progress in gaining some community support, De La Rosa said that complaints persist, and she’s often blamed for the OPC, even though she had no say in where it was located. 
“The minute someone runs into a needle somewhere, they bring up the OPC,” she said. “The needle could just have come from someone who is in the throes of addiction and was using on that street. But they’re like, ‘Well, you know, if that OPC wasn’t here, they wouldn’t be able to get needles.’” 
 She wonders what it might have been like if the community had been involved from the get-go, as they were in Providence.

What’s next for Connecticut?
In late May and early June 2025, a spike in overdoses took dozens of lives in New Haven County, sparking a desperate attempt to stem a fatal mix of drugs. As this was taking place, Lamont sent out a press release announcing a significant drop in overdose deaths for 2024. 
Though the release nodded to the seriousness of the issue, it did not mention the crisis that was unfolding. Advocates like Diane Santos, already raw from Lamont’s singlehanded move to prevent OPCs, said the announcement was jarring. 
“To me it says he is either out of touch himself, or he’s getting bad information from somewhere.”
When a bill fails, advocates and lawmakers usually put their heads together and consider what strategy they might try next time to turn public opinion and rally support from other lawmakers. But some advocates in Connecticut say they already had the votes, and there was no public testimony opposing the concept, so they now face a different scenario: they must convince an audience of one, Gov. Lamont, to support the measure. 
Sen. Anwar was among the most committed advocates of the OPC measure. Since the measure failed, he has been publicly criticizing Lamont and says he’s calling Lamont out every time there is an overdose death. 
“It still makes me sad, and it makes me angry,” Anwar said of Lamont’s decision. “Because I value our citizens, and for somebody to make a decision knowingly and then shrug it away like it’s not a big deal is unacceptable to me.” 
Bhargava also lobbied for Lamont’s support. Her son, Alec Pelletier, had been in and out of treatment for substance abuse disorder when he died of an overdose on his birthday in 2018 while living in a sober home. Like Harris’s granddaughter and Diane Santos’s son, he was 26. 
Over the past year, as a student at the Yale School of Public Health and as an advocate, Bhargava educated herself about OPCs, visiting one in Vancouver and speaking with the program managers of the centers in Rhode Island and New York. She came away convinced that such a center could have saved her son’s life. 
The issue, she says, is simply too urgent to wait.  
“We don’t have the time. We just don’t. The time is now. And Gov. Lamont should hold a special session and get this done to save the people’s lives he’s serving to protect.” 
When asked if he would visit an OPC, Lamont said he’s open to it. 
“Visit or call, we’ll see what happens. I don’t want to overpromise. I have an open mind, if that’s what you’re suggesting,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SAFE-CONSUMPTION-SITES-0716-SR-22-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-03 05:56:41.418493

Over 100 organizations statewide are uniting to End Child Poverty Now through bold, coordinated advocacy and urgent policy reform.","While Connecticut, one of the wealthiest states in our country, may seem like an ideal place to raise a family, for far too many children it is not. Nearly one in 10 children in Connecticut grows up in poverty. In the City of Waterbury, that statistic is more than double –  with 22% of children living in poverty.
For these kids – our kids – basic needs like stable housing, nutritious food, and access to quality childcare aren’t guaranteed, and the educational opportunities they deserve are often out of reach. While some areas boast world-class schools and enrichment programs, children in poverty are being left behind.
So, is Connecticut a great place to be a child? For many, the answer is no —especially when poverty limits opportunities and dreams feel distant.

That’s why more than 100 organizations – hospitals, higher ed institutions, nonprofits, philanthropy and experts throughout the state — have come together and pledged to End Child Poverty Now! Almost every community foundation serving our 169 towns is involved and leading local efforts to raise awareness, convene partners and advocate on behalf of our state’s children who do not have enough to thrive.   
Morally, we know that this should not be.  Sixty-one years ago, in his 1964 State of the Union Address, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced an unconditional war on poverty and called it a national disgrace that merited a national response. Unfortunately, those calls went unheard until the COVID-19 pandemic brought the issue to the forefront. The pandemic served as an unprecedented global crisis, but it also revealed the profound impact of targeted government assistance in alleviating poverty.  

Through programs like emergency food aid and the refundable child tax credit, we saw a dramatic decrease in child poverty across the United States. In Connecticut, the federal government provided $2,000 to $3,000 in child tax credits per child, and child poverty was reduced by nearly 70%. However, as we now know, this progress was short-lived. The expiration of key pandemic relief programs in 2023 led to a sharp increase in child poverty, serving as a stark reminder that without sustained investment in social safety nets, progress remains fragile at best.

Children in Connecticut were not spared! Even here, with our great wealth, Connecticut experienced skyrocketing child poverty since 2022. According to the report, “Poverty in the U.S. and Connecticut 2019-2023,” by the Connecticut Voices for Children, the supplemental poverty rate was 10.5 percent in 2020, or 74,520 children living in poverty.  By 2021, the child poverty rate had dropped to 6.8 percent or 27,080 children.  Yet, by 2023, our numbers have skyrocketed and exceeded pre-pandemic level. 
This spike tells us that when families have access to financial resources, they can meet their children’s basic needs, invest in education, and create a stable environment in which their children can thrive. To let these gains slip away is not just an economic failure, it is a moral failure. 

The data is clear. Still far too many children in our state are growing up without the things that they need. Child poverty is not inevitable. It is not a natural condition. It is a policy choice and we can advocate for different choices.Kathy Taylor, President and CEO, Connecticut Community Foundation

In June, Connecticut Community Foundation hosted a public forum and panel discussion featuring a Community Data presentation with Mark Abraham, Executive Director DataHaven, and a panel discussion moderated by Ginny Monk, housing reporter for The Connecticut Mirror, with Panelists Emily Byrne, MPA, Executive Director of CT Voices for Children; Chelsea Harris, Director of Early Care & Education, Waterbury Bridge to Success, and Rashida Rattray, Education and Outreach Coordinator, Connecticut Fair Housing Center. Their wide-ranging conversation was both enlightening and sobering; serving as a wake-up call to remember the children and families left behind in our highly resourced state.
This moment calls for a renewed commitment to ending childhood poverty – a commitment that must be underpinned by policy change. The End Child Poverty Now Campaign is a unified platform for advocacy behind a common vision: a thriving and economically robust Connecticut where no child experiences the debilitating effects of poverty. 
This nonprofit advocacy collaborative engages lawmakers and policy influencers to promote and enact policies that address the root causes of child poverty, including income inequality, access to healthcare, safe and affordable homes, and quality education. 
Our collective goal for the 2025 legislative session was to advance the following:  

Support a permanent, refundable CT Child Tax Credit at $600 per child. 
Support universal no-cost healthy school meals (breakfast, lunch, and afternoon snack).  
Support universal childcare subsidies for families earning up to 85% of the State Median Income.
Expand good cause eviction protections to support family housing stability. 

We made progress: Connecticut chose to invest in our children’s education, approving a suite of bills designed to enable thousands of additional children to enroll in early childhood education programs. But our work is not finished, and the 2026 legislative session is soon approaching. 
The End Child Poverty Now will continue to advocate for the passage of child-friendly policies that will lead to meaningful change for many more of our children.  We cannot sit and watch while our neighboring states make steady progress to end child poverty.  Now is the time for our vision of being a child-friendly state to be reflected more fully in the everyday experiences of all of our children and families within our state of Connecticut.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)It was such a peaceful morning that Yoshito Matsushige could scarcely believe it was wartime.
Matsushige, a 32-year-old newspaper photographer who had been up most of the night before covering air raid warnings, woke from a brief nap at army headquarters in time to see the sun rise over Hiroshima.
It was Monday, Aug. 6, 1945.
Now we know Matsushige was witnessing the last sunrise of the age before humankind had developed a weapon powerful enough to annihilate itself — and had demonstrated a willingness to use it.
There had been just one other explosion of a nuclear bomb, a test shot July 16 of a plutonium implosion weapon at the Trinity Site in southern New Mexico. The resulting fireball had fused the sand of the desert floor into a kind of glass later named Trinitite. On the morning of Monday, Aug. 6, another atomic bomb — a uranium gun-type device — was bound for Hiroshima.
Wednesday marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, a grim milestone that has me pondering the nature of time, memory and hope. It’s been slightly more than an average human lifetime since the bomb devastated Hiroshima, and those who are still around to recount the unthinkable are increasingly few. Once Hiroshima and Nagasaki fade from living memory, how will its warning be passed to future generations?
At 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6, an American B-29 named the Enola Gay, after the pilot’s mother, released a 12-kiloton atomic bomb over the city. The aircraft was flying six miles up. The aim point was a T-shaped bridge in the center of the city. The bomb fell for 43 seconds and then detonated at 1,968 feet.
What happened next took only milliseconds.
The temperature on the ground reached 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit, vaporizing humans near the epicenter and leaving only their shadows behind. A 1,000-mph blast wave spread from the epicenter, destroying two-thirds of the city’s homes and buildings and contributing to a massive firestorm. A dark mushroom cloud rose over Hiroshima, carrying deadly radioactive fallout.
Matsushige had left army headquarters and returned to his home, about a mile and a half from the target bridge, where he was sitting shirtless in the August heat eating a meager breakfast of rice.
“There is an explosive called magnesium that is used for photographic (lighting) and everything went white as if that magnesium had been fired,” Matsushige told me through an interpreter in 1986, when I was a young reporter in Japan on a grant project to interview those who had experienced the bomb. “It seemed the light was an electrical short, or spark. So I was about to stand up and try to switch off the light, … and then came the blast.”
The force lifted Matsushige from his feet and slammed him into a far wall. He was covered in debris and broken glass, and his bare chest was bleeding, although he wasn’t badly hurt. He and his wife ran outside and hid in a sweet potato field for 40 minutes in the dirty brown gloom of ash and dust. Then Matsushige put on his uniform, retrieved his Mamiya camera from the rubble of his home and two rolls of film, and set out for newspaper office in the heart of the city.
Matsushige was a photojournalist but like most everyone else in Japan had also been pressed into military service. He worked for both the city newspaper and military headquarters, wearing a uniform with no rank insignia. Civilian photography was prohibited.
When he was about a kilometer, or six-tenths of a mile, from the center of the city, he had to turn back because the fire was too intense. He made his way to the Miyuki Bridge. The bridge was a landmark in a city known for its bridges and river, but this morning it was swarmed by thousands of wounded and dying civilians.
In 1986, I stood with Matsushige on the Miyuki Bridge and he told me what he had seen 41 years earlier. It was one of the last times the photographer, then in his early 70s, would visit the bridge, which was closed and about to be demolished to make way for a new structure. My interview with Matsushige originally appeared in my newspaper, the Pittsburg (Kansas) Morning Sun, which had sponsored my application for the Akiba Project travel grant to interview the aging hibakusha, a Japanese term translated as those who had received or been exposed to the bomb. In 2021 I wrote about my memories of that assignment for the Reflector.
Matsushige told me in 1986 that he had yet to take a single photograph on his grim trek into the city but here, at the bridge, he readied his Mamiya. Many of those on the bridge were junior high school students. Unlike elementary school children, most of whom had been evacuated to relatives and others in the hills around the city, the junior high students had been kept in the city to clear fire lines or to work in the ammunition factories. The victims on the bridge looked as if their clothes were hanging from their bodies, but they weren’t trailing fabric, it was tattered pieces of their own skin.
“I thought that I would take a photo of (the scene on the bridge), so I checked the camera in my hands,” Matsushige said. “When I saw this tragic scene, I was unable to push the shutter button. Among these people, there was a person holding a child. She was crying the name of the baby, and the baby probably was dead. The mother was saying, ‘Please open your eyes, please open your eyes.'”
It took Matsushige more than a quarter of an hour to make a photo.
“I felt as if the eyes of these people were piercing me,” he said. “These people had black faces because of the burns. It was such cruelty. I couldn’t stop my tears as I tried to take that second picture, and I remember that the viewfinder of my camera was blurred because of the tears.”
He returned home but set out again that afternoon.
He attempted to go to the newspaper office again but found it ablaze. He passed Hiroshima University, where he saw corpses at the bottom of a swimming pool that had been nearly emptied by the heat. The deeper he went into the city, the greater the destruction.
“People were under collapsed buildings and utility poles and were buried alive,” he said. “Among (the corpses) there were some mothers with children. I was totally numb. I didn’t feel anything, didn’t feel any heat or pain.”
He found a streetcar filled with corpses.
“All their clothes were burnt off,” he said. “I thought about taking a picture, I put my hands on my camera at one time, but since all these dead people were naked, I felt (ashamed) to take such a photo.”
Hours later he found himself back at the Miyuki Bridge, where he took a photograph of an injured policeman writing out relief certificates for food rations. The photo of the policeman was the last Matsushige would take that day. He had carried enough film for 24 exposures but ended up making only five. Two of the photos were at his home, two on the bridge, and one at an intersection near the bridge.
  Only five photos were made the day the bomb fell on Hiroshima, all by the same man — Yoshito Matsushige, a 32-year-old newspaper photographer. He was at home at the time the bomb was dropped on the morning of. Aug. 6, 1945, He made his way into the city. The first photo he took, around 11 a.m., was of badly burned junior high school students on the Miyuki Bridge. What appears to be rags is, in many cases, skin hanging from arms and legs. (Yoshito Matsushige)
Matsushige took some of the hardtack biscuits next to the policeman’s station for his and his wife’s dinner. After it was dark, he developed the film in trays in the kitchen sink and washed the negatives in a nearby creek. He hung the strip of film in a tree to dry. The photos weren’t published in the Hiroshima newspaper until the next year. They didn’t appear in the United States until Life magazine published them in 1952.
The death toll at Hiroshima was horrific. Estimates vary widely, but at least 70,000 died from the bombing. Three days later, on Aug. 9, a plutonium bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, killing another 40,000. These are conservative estimates, however, and the actual number might be double for each city.
When I went to Japan to interview Matsushige and the other hibakusha in 1986, it was the height of the Cold War. There were 70,374 nuclear warheads deployed or in stockpiles around the world, according the Federation of American Scientists, an all-time high. Of those, all but a few thousand belonged to the United States and the Soviet Union. The Doomsday Clock, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist’s graphic representation of how close we were to nuclear annihilation, was at six minutes to midnight.
Now the Doomsday Clock is at 89 seconds.
There are fewer nuclear weapons — about 12,000, according to the FAS — but there are hot wars around the world, tensions are high, and the Doomsday Clock now takes into account other existential risks.
“We now move the Doomsday Clock from 90 seconds to 89 seconds to midnight — the closest it has ever been to catastrophe,” the Bulletin said in a January 2025 statement. “Our fervent hope is that leaders will recognize the threats posed by nuclear weapons, climate change, and the potential misuse of biological science and a variety of emerging technologies.”
The Bulletin cited emerging and re-emerging disease and the military use of artificial intelligence as concerning. It also said threat of nuclear war had been exacerbated by various conflicts.
“The war in Ukraine, now in its third year, looms over the world,” it said. “The conflict could become nuclear at any moment because of a rash decision or through accident or miscalculation. Conflict in the Middle East threatens to spiral out of control in a wider war without warning.”
The 10 or so countries that possess nuclear weapons are increasing the size and the role of their arsenals, the Bulletin said, and the nuclear arms control treaty process is collapsing.
We seem hellbent on our own destruction.
In my hand is a relic of the birth of the nuclear age, a bit of Trinitite that my wife, Kim, bought at a rock shop in New Mexico near Alamogordo. Yes, it’s legal to possess because it was gathered from the site decades ago, and no, it’s no longer dangerously radioactive. Why did she want it? Because she gathers information of all kinds — books, objects, experiences — that will help her understand the beauty and darkness of the world. The Trinitite sample cost a few bucks and is only mildly radioactive. It’s about the size of a peanut, is greenish black, and weighs about the same as the albatross in the Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner.
Trinitite is among the artifacts that were to be included in the Library of the Great Silence, a catalog of objects representing transitions and periods of existential threat. The project was part of the SETI Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to the search for intelligent life beyond earth. The library is a response, in part, to the Fermi Paradox. Posed by physicist Enrico Fermi, the paradox asks why, given how vast and old the universe is, we haven’t found evidence of other communicative technological civilizations?
I won’t bore you with the math behind the Drake Equation, which seeks to estimate how many intelligent worlds there might be out there, except to cite the most important variable, L. That stands for the average lifespan of technological civilizations. One explanation for the great silence is that civilizations have a tendency to destroy themselves. Nobody knows what L might be, because we have a lack of observable data, but our current estimate is at least 80 years.
If we are not to fall into the great silence, we must learn to do a better job of passing on the lessons of the past. Part of that is honoring the testimony of those who have gone before, such as Yoshito Matsushige.
Matsushige died in 2005, at the age of 92, but his words and his pictures live on. They were given to me in 1986, and now I share them with you.
The time the bomb detonated will be observed with a moment of silence at 8:15 a.m. Wednesday in Hiroshima. That’s 6:15 p.m. Tuesday for most of Kansas, because of the 14-hour time difference.
Honoring the dead is proper.
But too many of us who yearn for peace content ourselves with prayer and visualization. This may be mentally healthy and personally satisfying, but it’s not enough to turn policy or change minds. The pursuit of peace is an active one, requiring a knowledge of the past combined with a willingness to engage the future.
It’s 89 seconds to midnight.
Let’s raise some L.

The final approval came days ago from the MTA, parent of Metro-North, which rubber-stamped the Connecticut Department of Transportation’s fare hike decision.  At least one MTA Board member called the hikes “scary” and another exclaimed that he was “actually kind of offended”.  But, hey… there is nobody on the MTA Board representing Connecticut riders so they both voted to approve the hike as did the entire MTA Board.  After all, it’s not their money.


Mind you, the MTA is also shortly expected to approve a 4.4% fare hike for New York’s Metro-North riders as well as a 25-cent increase for New York City subways and buses, so put that in your pipe of moral indignation and smoke it.
As I explained a few weeks ago, the Connecticut fare increase can be blamed on Gov. Ned Lamont and the legislature, which knowingly under-cut the CDOT budget, pretty much telling the agency to raise fares to make up the difference.  After all, they seem to assume that everyone who rides Metro-North along Connecticut’s “gold coast” is a millionaire. 
But a 10% increase in one year?  On top of a 4.5% hike just two years ago?  That adds up to a compounded 15.2% increase since 2023… way more than inflation.  Remember, Metro-North has a captive audience and can do anything it wants.

And adding insult to injury, there are new ticket rules coming!
With more and more commuters buying one-way e-tickets (57%) instead of monthly passes (36%), those tickets will automatically be activated on purchase, not when you get on the train and activate them yourself.  Why?  Because, the railroad says, 55% of ticket holders don’t activate their tickets until they see the conductor coming around. 
But isn’t it the conductor’s job to collect those fares and put seat checks on each row?
According to MTA Deputy Chief Jessica Lazarus “Conductors are spending more than 20,000 hours each year reminding customers to activate one-way mobile tickets.” Really?  How did they come up with that metric?
Requiring activation of the ticket at time of purchase, she says, will “recapture those hours that can be better put to use for fare collection and train safety operations.”  Like enforcing the “no radios rule” and “no feet on seats?”
If you’re doing a same-day roundtrip you won’t buy two one-way tickets but, instead, a new Day Pass.  It’s good for unlimited travel until 4 a.m. the next day. Day-trippers using the pass will get a 10% fare discount compared to buying two one-way peak tickets.
For hybrid commuters, after buying ten one-way tickets within two weeks the 11th will be free.  For seniors, the disabled and those on Medicare, the new reduced fare ticket will be valid at all times, even in the morning peak.
Make no mistake:  fare evasion is a serious problem for MTA, which estimates they lose $700 million each year, most of it on buses ($315 M) and subways ($285 M).  Metro-North losses are estimated at $44 M.  Given that train fares are much more expensive than bus and subway, that’s not a lot of commuter scofflaws; just 6% of riders compared to 15% of subways riders and 37% of bus passengers.

Of course, bus riders can easily board by the rear door and subway riders can jump over turnstiles.  On Metro-North we have conductors.  It’s an hour-long ride from Stamford to Grand Central Terminal, plenty of time to look at everyone’s ticket… which they will still have to do even under the new rules.
But what about the Dashing Dan running to make his train, grabbing a seat and then trying to buy an e-ticket in a cellphone dead spot, nervously watching the conductor moving down the aisle?  No ticket to show?  You’ll get whacked with a $2 surcharge.

Mike Dunleavy’s veto of more than $50 million in funding for Alaska’s K-12 schools.
As legislators were set to gavel in at 10 a.m., about a dozen protesters lined the hallways to advocate for legislators overriding the veto, with signs reading “vote like your kids live here,” “vote to override” and “fund public education!” 
One protester was Peter Sidmore, a middle school teacher in the Juneau School District, where he graduated in 2019.  
“It’s impressive how much the system in town has degraded in the six years since I graduated, just due to lack of funding. And I’ve been pretty present to see all of that, because we did have a fairly robust school system, and it’s really changed,” he said. 
Sidmore said that last year, the consolidation of Juneau’s two high schools was especially hard on students. This year, it’s the continued climate of uncertainty, he said. 
“That’s the hardest part. When we have a direction and we know what we’re getting, and we know what we can do, we can prepare students to an extent, but it’s the indecisiveness, it’s the back and forth that really, really is hard on students. Yeah, you hear that in education all the time. It’s just, you want to have a plan, even if it’s not the best,” Sidmore said.
McLain Sidmore, standing with him holding a sign, works for an education nonprofit in Juneau. “I see classes seem to be getting bigger every year,” McLain Sidmore said. “Teachers are being moved around until weeks into the school year; there are students not getting the services they need. And just parents are stressed. Kids are stressed. Teachers are stressed.”
Eric Antrim, an engineer with the U.S. Forest Service, as well as a member of the National Federation of Federal Employees, NFFE Local 251, held a sign reading “education is our future.” 
“I benefited from a public education growing up, and that was good enough to get me into engineering school and to perform well,” he said. “And I want our Legislature to act responsibly and pay it forward. They all benefited from safe schools and good schooling, and they shouldn’t be taking that away from the next generation.”
Debra Craig, a 43-year-resident of Juneau, said she worked in state government in social services. “So I have a fairly deep understanding of the challenges that people face when they don’t have adequate resources,” she said. “And education is like a fundamental resource that people need to be able to get ahead in the world, to be able to survive, to be able to just exist adequately.”
Craig said she’s concerned about the quality of education in Alaska, especially the lack of civics education and understanding of government. “Alaska is one of eight states that doesn’t require students graduating from high school to pass a civics test. And I think all of that is showing up throughout the United States in our national politics and our state politics,” she said. “So we need to support education. We need to support civics education so people understand what their government does, and doesn’t do for them.”
Outside the Capitol, a rally kicked off at 11 a.m with a crowd gathered to join a national day of action, and to support public education in Alaska. More than 300 demonstrations were set to take place on Saturday, part of a “Rage Against the Regime” protest against the Trump administration and threats to democracy, due process, and civil rights and freedoms. 
Speakers condemned the Trump administration’s actions on immigrant communities, public services and higher education, and they called for solidarity to continue protesting the president. 
“Public schools are democracy’s tools!” the crowd chanted. 
Just after 1:30 p.m., legislators voted to override two of the governor’s veto. A handful of demonstrators in the hall cheered senators after they left the house chambers.  
“It was great. We were very happy,” said Pat Race, a demonstrator who was standing outside the House doors. He’s a Juneau-based filmmaker and illustrator, and a product of Alaska schools. “There was a lot of clapping and then shushing of the clapping, because they were still working on things. But both veto overrides were a really big deal. And it was really nice to see them come through,” he said, referring to legislators also voting to override a veto of Senate Bill 183, a bill to require reports on oil tax settlements.
“And afterwards,” he added. “It was a sunny day in Juneau, and I fled the building for a celebratory taco.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said her office was going to shed “sunlight” on the University of Iowa’s DEI policies through her office’s investigation following a request from Gov. Kim Reynolds earlier this week.
Bird spoke on the issue at the annual “Bird Barn Bash,” a fundraiser for the attorney general as she looks ahead to running for another term in 2026. Bird, who was first elected in 2022, spoke about her time challenging federal policies during former President Joe Biden’s tenure, but also spoke on a more recent issue – investigating UI for potential noncompliance with state and federal policies banning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.
Fox News published an “undercover” video Tuesday of a person identified as Andrea Tinoco, the assistant director of UI Leadership and Student Organization Development, who said her department was still committed to working on DEI despite directives from university leadership.

After the video was posted, Reynolds issued a statement saying she was “appalled” by the comments made in the video and would be filing a complaint to the Attorney General’s office for further action. On Friday, a second video was posted by Townhall, a conservative outlet, of another UI employee identified as Cory Lockwood, senior associate director of the Iowa Union Memorial, making similar comments about continued work on DEI initiatives.
Both employees featured in the videos have been placed on administrative leave.
At the fundraiser Saturday, Bird said her office has launched an investigation into the situation and “is going to get to the bottom of it” – but asked the crowd for patience.
“Please know – the investigation’s going to take a little bit,” Bird said. “I know all of us want it to be fast — and we will not make it be slow — but I’ll tell you, to do something right, it takes time. And we’re going to do it right, we’re going to do it by the book and by the law.”
She also reiterated her commitment to upholding the ban on DEI at Iowa’s regents universities, saying ”here in Iowa, our taxpayer-funded universities are supposed to be about education, not indoctrination.”
Talk radio host Simon Conway, who spoke in support of Bird at the event, said the UI investigation shows the importance of having Bird in office – and reelecting her for another term. He said former Attorney General Tom Miller, the longtime Democratic incumbent who Bird defeated in 2022, would not have followed up on Reynolds’ request to investigate the university if he was in office.
“If we had Tom Miller, or a Tom Miller, in the attorney general’s chair right now, with what is going on in our state in regards to DEI — I think first of all, there’d be a really good chance that regents universities would be losing federal funding,” Conway said. “They still might, by the way. But I think it’s an absolute given if he was there. And you don’t want to see that, do you?”
Cruz, Schmitt stay in D.C.
U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Eric Schmitt of Missouri were also scheduled to speak at the event, but both were unable to attend. The U.S. Senate was in session Saturday, with Senate Republicans aiming to confirm more than 100 of President Donald Trump’s nominees despite a breakdown in negotiations with Senate Democrats.
Bird said she was disappointed the two Republican senators could not be at the event, but that she told them on behalf of attendees, “we want you to do your job like you’re doing, confirming President Trump’s nominees.”
Schmitt will be back in the state later in the month, Aug. 23, for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson’s fundraiser in Cedar Rapids.
Bird was considered a top choice to become the next Republican nominee for governor in the 2026 election cycle, following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she would not seek reelection after finishing her current term. But in July, Bird announced she would not run for governor, instead running for reelection for her current position.
At the event, Bird said she had spoken with many people in the crowd about her plans in 2026 – and that her decision to run for reelection was because she believed there was still more she had to accomplish in the role.
“We’ve done some good things in the attorney general’s office to help Iowa but we are not done,” Bird said. “The work is not done. And I’m not going to leave that unfinished to run for something else.”

BURLINGTON — Vermont Green Football Club are national champions. 
The Green toppled Seattle-based Ballard FC, 2-1, in Saturday night’s United Soccer League 2 championship game at the University of Vermont in Burlington. Thousands of fans turned out to the Green’s home stadium at the school, Virtue Field, to watch the team cap off its undefeated 2025 season with its first-ever national-level prize. 
United Soccer League 2 is a semi-professional, summertime competition made up largely of collegiate players. It has about 150 total teams across the country.
Saturday’s win was the culmination of a dream run for Vermont Green, which is in its fourth season and has garnered international attention for its outspoken support of climate justice and other progressive social causes. The team regularly draws sellout crowds for its home games, boasting some of the highest average attendance of any similar team in the country. 
After tying just three regular-season games and winning every other, the Green won its local United Soccer League 2 division, the Northeast Division, in early July. Later that month, the team topped the league’s regional Eastern Conference bracket to advance to the final stages of the national playoffs.
Saturday’s win marks the second national championship for a Vermont-based soccer team in the past year. Last December, the University of Vermont men’s soccer team won the NCAA Division I championship, the first national collegiate title in a major sport in school history. Four UVM players were part of the Vermont Green team that won Saturday’s game.

Andy Barr and Lexington businessman Nate Morris — have been taking snipes at each other on the campaign trail this summer as they barrel toward the May 2026 primary, but […]","U.S. Senate candidates (from left) Nate Morris, Andy Barr and Daniel Cameron before speaking at annual Fancy Farm Picnic, on Saturday, Aug 2, 2025. (Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)FANCY FARM, Ky. — The top three Republican candidates hoping to represent Kentucky in the U.S. Senate — former Attorney General Daniel Cameron, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and Lexington businessman Nate Morris — have been taking snipes at each other on the campaign trail this summer as they barrel toward the May 2026 primary, but they pulled out the stops for the annual Fancy Farm Picnic. They laid into the event’s tradition of trading zingers with opponents Saturday afternoon in the small West Kentucky town.  
The picnic, a fundraiser for the St. Jerome Catholic Church, has historically brought together Democrats and Republicans for roasts from the stage as supporters and detractors yell and heckle. With Kentucky’s top Democrats, including Gov. Andy Beshear and Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman skipping the event Saturday afternoon, Republicans either joked at the lack of their presence or toward each other, in the case of the GOP Senate candidates. 
Beshear said he had a scheduling conflict and Coleman said the stage should be reserved for candidates on the ballot. 
Each Senate candidate tried to tie themselves closer to President Donald Trump, who has not made an endorsement in the race so far. Morris took it a step further by tying his opponents to U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is not running for re-election and who also spoke at the picnic. 
Cameron won a coin toss to speak first. He joked about the lack of Democrats, saying “there aren’t even enough of them to run Joe Biden’s autopen.” Kentucky U.S. Rep. James Comer, also a speaker at the picnic, is leading a probe into the former’s president’s alleged use of an autopen to sign documents. 
“But look, I understand why they aren’t here,” Cameron said of the Democrats. “They’re out searching for a national identity, which is going to be hard to find when they’re afraid of being misgendered.”

Cameron took some swipes at his opponents, saying Barr has voted with former Democratic U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and that Morris donated to former United Nation Ambassador Nikki Haley’s 2024 presidential campaign. Cameron also said Morris had supported diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives as a company executive in the past. 
“Some would say his campaign reminds him of a fart: it stinks, it’s unproductive and it’s a sign that the emitter is full of crap,” Cameron said of Morris. 
Cameron ended his speech by saying that he and his wife, Makenze, want their sons to grow up in a “a colorblind society — one based on merit and opportunity, not division and handouts.” He vowed to be focused on “the future, not the past,” as senator. 
For the most part, Barr focused on his record in Congress and touting his support for Trump’s policies in office. He did tease Beshear for his absence and his rumored aspirations to run for president in 2028, saying that “Americans will soon learn what we Kentuckians already know — he’s as liberal as he is boring.”

“I’d say anyone could beat this guy, but I wouldn’t want to offend Daniel Cameron,” Barr said, referring to Cameron’s loss to Beshear in the 2023 governor’s race. 
Barr added that he hopes Kentucky keeps “the tradition alive of Andys beating Daniels.” 
But Morris was also the punchline of some of Barr’s remarks, calling him a “dumpster fire” and attacking his business record and his Haley donations as well. 
Barr ended by promising to be a “friend” to West Kentucky, with several regional nods, like supporting the military at Fort Knox and cheering on Murray State University in sporting events. 
Morris was critical of McConnell ahead of the picnic and opened by saying, “I didn’t realize this was bring your boys to work day,” referring to Barr’s and Cameron’s ties to the senior Kentucky senator. 
Speaking last out of the three, Morris told the crowd that he wanted them to remember three things about him — that he supports Trump, he started a garbage company in Kentucky and that he’s “going to trash Mitch McConnell’s legacy.” 
“The third one is pissing off a lot of people, but I have a serious question — who here can honestly tell me that it’s a good thing to have a senior citizen who freezes on national television during his press conferences as our U.S. senator?” Morris said, referring to 2023 episodes McConnell had in front of reporters.

Morris said that Barr and Cameron would continue the senator’s legacy in office, calling them the “McConnell boys.” 
“To break some real news here, perhaps you could both show us the seat of your britches so we can finally understand where Mitch McConnell’s hand goes.” 
McConnell spoke before the Senate candidates, but didn’t directly address them in his remarks. A longtime attendee, Fancy Farm organizers presented McConnell with a plaque before the speeches began to recognize his frequent participation. 
However, McConnell did share some thoughts on the race during the Graves County GOP Breakfast earlier Saturday morning. The event’s attendees included Republicans from the region and around the state, as well as the GOP Senate candidates. 
“Surely this isn’t true, but I’ve heard that one of the candidates running for my office wants to be different,” McConnell said. “Now I’m wondering how you want to be different from the longest serving Senate leader in American history. I’m wondering how you’d want to be different in supporting President Trump.” 
McConnell then posed a “little quiz” to the crowd: “Which of Kentucky’s two Republican senators supports President Trump the most?” Multiple people in the crowd replied, “You.” 
McConnell argued that he’s repeatedly supported Trump more often than U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, who did not go to the picnic this year, pointing out that Paul voted against the GOP spending megabill, while McConnell supported it. McConnell also had his staff tally up the money he’s brought to Kentucky while being in office for 41 years, saying the total was $60 billion. 
“I leave by thanking you all for giving me this remarkable opportunity,” McConnell said.”Not just to help myself, not just to brag on how long I may have been there, but look at the difference that I’ve made to try to help us move into a different place — a place when they talk about Kentucky, they talk about how well we’re doing, not how many people we have, how well we’re doing.” 
When McConnell stood before the crowd of Republicans, he received a standing ovation. Cameron and Barr also stood and clapped for McConnell while Morris stayed seated. 
The lone Democrat
Only one Democratic candidate addressed the crowd at the Fancy Farm Picnic — John “Drew” Williams, who is challenging Comer in the 1st Congressional District. The district includes Fancy Farm and West Kentucky. He kept his remarks mostly focused on Comer’s record and told the crowd that he would offer them more public service if elected to Congress.

Comer spoke after Williams, but largely talked about national issues and made fun of Beshear. However, he did add that he didn’t know Williams’ name but still brought him a gift from Washington, D.C. A Comer supporter then came to the stage and held up a prop poster with an endorsement of “Comer’s opponent,” signed by Biden’s autopen. 
Williams had a chance to campaign in a room of Democratic voters the Friday night before the picnic at the Marshall County Democrats’ Mike Miller Memorial Bean Dinner. In an interview with the Kentucky Lantern, he said he has wanted to speak at the Fancy Farm Picnic since he was in middle school, so he was excited for the opportunity.
However, he said he didn’t blame other Democrats like Beshear for not going to a “hateful space” but added that it “doesn’t mean that it has to stay that way.” He’d like to see the space become a way for candidates to have a conversation. 
“I’d much rather me pick an issue, they pick an issue, and we come together. They don’t do that.”
During the dinner, Coleman reiterated that her decision to not go to the picnic this year was because she was not on the ballot. She said there were “so many obvious jokes” to make “but not much worth laughing about in this moment.” 
She hinted that Kentucky’s statewide races in 2027, which would include the governor’s race to succeed Beshear, may bring her back to the picnic stage. 
“We have to leave here tonight with a renewed sense of purpose,” she said. “We have to leave here and talk to our neighbors, listen to their concerns, and remind them that we are fighting for their kids’ and grandkids’ schools, for their families’ security and for a Kentucky where every person has a chance to thrive.”

Speaking to reporters after her speech, Coleman said that the Fancy Farm Picnic has become a “tradition for many, many years” for people in West Kentucky. She added that it’s an exciting year to have the first female emcee, Ashli Watts, the president and CEO of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. But Coleman argued she showed up for rural people in other ways, like supporting the rebuilding efforts after devastating tornadoes in West Kentucky. 
When asked if she thought Democrats should find an alternative event to the picnic, which has become dominated by Republican speakers in recent years, or if changes should be made to its format, she recalled the attempted assassination of Trump on the campaign trail and the attacks earlier this summer on Minnesota Democratic lawmakers, that left a state representative and her husband dead and seriously wounded a state senator and his wife. 
“We got to think about the rhetoric. We’ve got to think about the way that we present things. And jokes are one thing, but it can get out of hand, and especially in an environment like that, I could see how it could,” she said. “So, I would leave it to the people who run the organization. I saw that they said they have to evolve with the times, and then got some primary candidates this year. I would encourage them to evolve with the times when it comes to rhetoric as well.”
Matthew Powell, a member of the Graves County Democratic Party, attended the dinner in a Beshear 2028 shirt. He said he likes Beshear because of what he’s done for the area during his response to tornadoes and floods, calling him a “champion for the working class and myself.” 
Powell didn’t mind the governor skipping the Fancy Farm Picnic. 
“His record speaks volume. He’s been in Fancy Farm and in Mayfield before, and when it counted. He was there with us in Mayfield, Kentucky, through the tornadoes and the flooding. So yes, he’s always there with us.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fancyfarm_018-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-02 20:56:11.046726

The vote was 45-14. Forty-five votes are needed to override an Alaska governor’s budget veto.
The override eliminates a 5.6% year-over-year cut to public school funding, leaving districts with a small funding increase. 
School district superintendents said before the vote that if lawmakers were able to override the governor, they would be able to reduce class sizes and restore programs that had been cut.
Lawmakers were also expected to vote on whether or not to override Dunleavy’s veto of Senate Bill 183, a measure that would require the Alaska Department of Revenue to provide lawmakers with a report on oil tax settlements. Sen Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, has said that could reveal the state has been settling tax disputes for much less than their stated value. 
As the session opened, Dunleavy issued another version of an executive order creating a cabinet-level Alaska Department of Agriculture.
Lawmakers rejected the governor’s first executive order on a 32-28 vote in March and introduced broader legislation instead.
The presiding officers of the House and Senate responded to the second order with a letter of their own, saying that the governor’s order is unconstitutional and that they will not accept it.
The governor’s office did not respond to a question asking what it thinks of the legislative response.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Saturday as part of a nationwide anti-Trump movement dubbed “Rage Against the Regime.”
The Denver protest was led by Colorado 50501, which also organized “Good Trouble” demonstrations honoring civil rights leader John Lewis on July 17, and “No Kings” anti-Trump protests in mid-June. The “Rage Against the Regime” protests, which were planned in more than 300 cities across the United States, focused on bringing communities “together to transform anger into action, harnessing the energy of collective resistance,” according to the 50501 website. 
Several local left-leaning groups, including the Denver chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation and the immigrant rights group Aurora Unidos CSO, set up booths in front of the Capitol on Saturday. 
The demonstrators protested President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportations, the elimination of federal funding for public media by Congress, and mass layoffs at several federal agencies, among other Trump administration priorities.

At around 12:15 p.m., organizers led chants of “When we fight, we win” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here,” which were met with clapping from the crowd and honks from passing cars. 
Brandon Quintanilla, a co-founder of Aurora Unidos CSO, called for protestors to “stand up for our immigrant communities and educate our neighbors.” Quintanilla, 23, said members of his family were deported several years ago, adding that “these attacks on our people have been happening for years, and they have only escalated to unprecedented levels under the Trump administration.”
“We are all well aware of the attacks on our people: masked (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents picking up our parents as they pick up the trash, our siblings being picked up on the way to work or to immigration court,” Quintanilla said.
Protestors yelled “shame” when Quintanilla mentioned the recent federal Republican tax cut and spending law’s allocation of $170 billion in funding for the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Denver residents Phaedra Andersen, 54, and Nancy Andersen, 71, have attended several anti-Trump protests in the past eight months. The mother-daughter duo first got involved in community organizing decades ago. Phaedra’s first protest was at age 13, against apartheid in South Africa, while Nancy started out with Vietnam War protests.
“I am hoping that we can break this cycle of human rights violations,” Nancy said. “If anyone’s rights are violated, all of our rights can be attacked. We are on the very edge of losing our democracy.”
Robynn Bartholomew, 52, attended the Denver protest carrying dozens of handmade bracelets beaded with the word “resist.” She stood near the Capitol and handed them out for free to fellow demonstrators.
“I just wanted to do what I could, what’s in my lane, to lift people up, because this is a marathon, not a sprint,” Bartholomew said. “Every day there’s a new thing that can bring you down, but I’m trying to make people smile. We need to come together.”

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”

For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.

“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
State regulations
As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.

Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.

The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs look like?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.

Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

The party approved a new rule that allows it to remove Republican candidates from a re-election ballot if they appoint a Democrat in their term. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Republican Party Saturday approved a new rule that would allow the party to disqualify an elected GOP official if they appoint a Democrat to a position during their term.
About 83% of the attendants at the GOP Summer Meeting in Montgomery voted for the rule that prohibits elected partisan officials from appointing people other than Republicans. Suzelle Josey, a former candidate for Senate District 30 in 2014, wrote the rule change. 
Josey said in an interview after the meeting that the rule is meant to send a message to Republicans to keep Republicans in office.
“If you are Republican, if you have taken Republican support, if you have depended upon people to get out there and knock on doors for you, taking money, their time, their treasure, once you have the opportunity and the privilege of being elected as a Republican, then we certainly would expect you to be appointing Republicans when you have the opportunity,” Josey said. “We hope this bylaw change will send a message to elected Republican officials that we have new expectations.”
In the chairman’s report, John Wahl claimed that Democrats do not listen to opposing views or debate, but said that the new rule would allow Republicans to be in the room in areas that are typically Democratic. 
“You would never see a Democrat appoint a Republican,” Wahl said in an interview. “I want to see Republicans taking seriously the fact that we want the opportunity to debate. The open debate here is actually giving Republican appointees the chance to go out and talk to their community, explain their values that they may never have the chance to do if they weren’t appointed to these positions.”
The Alabama Democratic Party’s bylaws do not have a similar rule.
Wahl also gave the 287 attendants an update on the congressional redistricting litigation. The court ordered the state to draw a new congressional map in 2023 after nearly two years of litigation with two appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. The panel determined that voting in Alabama is racially polarized, with white voters tending to support Republicans and Black voters tending to support Democrats. With that determination, the judges ruled that the Legislature-approved map did not give Black voters the ability to choose their preferred leaders, and ordered a majority-minority congressional district and a district with a near-majority of Black voters to be drawn. 
After a trial earlier this year, the court ruled in May that Alabama had intentionally discriminated against Black voters by approving a map in 2023 that initially only had one majority-Black district. The judges are considering sanctions, which could include requiring court approval of any future congressional maps, a process known as preclearance.
Wahl said that the litigation is not fair because California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to redraw the state’s congressional districts to include more Democratic seats. Texas Republicans on Wednesday drafted a map that would flip five Democratic-held districts.
“California and New York redistricted based on a political basis, without any repercussions from federal courts,” Wahl said. “Now I’m not arguing that anyone should be unrepresented, but I’m going to tell you double standards are not okay.”
Wahl said that majority-minority districts were inherently racist because not all members of minority groups vote for Democratic candidates.
“It shouldn’t matter what the color of your skin is. And if that’s the case, then if any district is drawn based on the color of someone’s skin, it is racist by the nature of that decision,” Wahl said. “I do not think this should be a political or or racial decision. This should be based on communities of interest and traditional lines.”
The party also established qualifying dates for the 2026 midterms. State and county GOP candidates must file their candidacy between Jan. 5 at 8:30 a.m. and Jan. 23 at 5 p.m. with the party’s chairman, according to the resolution that passed at the meeting. The resolution was amended from the qualifying period for statewide candidates only starting on Jan. 12 with 69% of the party’s support. 
“I think it’s confusing to have two different dates there as a former county party chair,” said Michael Hoyt, former Baldwin County GOP chair. “I think it’s helpful to have uniform dates across the board. I think a lot of the 11 day period is far too short.”
Wahl said the original 11 day period was due to the primary election being moved from May 26 to May 19, and the qualifying period could not start sooner because of winter holidays.
“Originally it was at three weeks for county parties and two weeks for the state party. Members felt that they would like to have the dates consistent,” Wahl said in an interview after the meeting.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0174-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-02 15:56:49.562015

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Rapid City has conducted what sources in law enforcement and government say could be one of the first compliance checks for hemp-based intoxicants since a South Dakota law banning their sale took effect a little over a year ago. 
The Pennington County Sheriff’s Office, Rapid City Police Department and Pennington County State’s Attorney’s Office partnered on the operation.
Officers and deputies visited eight area smoke shops and convenience stores on Thursday, purchasing products like gummies, suckers, vape cartridges and beverages containing hemp-derived ingredients. 
The products will be tested to see if they contain any of the prohibited high-inducing chemicals lawmakers voted to restrict in 2024. 
Law banning sale of some near-pot products takes effect, but won’t prevent every legal high

The compounds occur in tiny amounts in hemp plants, but are synthesized to infuse into consumable goods at levels significant enough to induce marijuana-like euphoric feelings in those who use them. The law is targeted at the synthetic versions of the compounds, sold under names like Delta-8 and THC-O, sometimes called “diet weed.”
The bill restricting the sale of those products did not bar the possession of them. Their sale is a low-level misdemeanor, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
A press release on the operation said businesses were sent letters on June 10 warning them to pull offending products from their shelves.
“We want to better understand what’s being sold in our community and ensure that both consumers and retailers are informed,” Pennington County State’s Attorney Lara Roetzel said in the press release.
Katy Urban, spokeswoman for Roetzel’s office, told South Dakota Searchlight that the products collected in the end-of-July sweep will be tested at local law enforcement laboratories, and by the State Health Lab in Pierre.
There is no specific timeline for results. 
Since the law banning the products took effect on July 1, 2024, 100 charges have been filed, according to the State Unified Judicial System. Spokeswoman Alisa Bousa said the figure includes pending and completed cases, and that each case could involve multiple charges. 
Rep. Brian Mulder, R-Sioux Falls, prime sponsor of the bill creating the law in 2024, said via text message he hasn’t heard of any other counties or agencies doing similar compliance checks. 
Representatives from local law enforcement agencies in Mulder’s city did not immediately respond to a question on whether they intend to conduct similar compliance checks.

Gretchen Whitmer call a special election in Michigan's vacant 35th Senate district. | Kyle DavidsonThis article was originally published by Votebeat, a nonprofit news organization covering local election administration and voting access.
 
LANSING — It’s been more than 200 days since residents of Michigan’s 35th District have had a state Senator, prompting growing and bipartisan complaints over Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s refusal to call a special election to fill a vacant seat.
“We’re being taxed, but we have no representative in the state Senate. I think that’s egregious,” Saginaw County Democratic Party Chair Brandell Adams said this week.
Brandell is among three candidates who have so far filed to run for the seat in a district that includes parts of Bay, Midland and Saginaw counties. It’s been vacant since Jan. 3, when Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet began her new job in Congress, leaving about 270,000 residents without a state senator.
Under Michigan law, only the governor has the power to call a special election to fill the seat for the remainder of the term, which runs through next year. Whitmer has not said when she’ll do so — or why it’s taken so long.
“We expect an announcement will be made in the near future,” Whitmer spokesperson Stacey LaRouche said Wednesday in a text message. “We will keep you posted.”
The governor’s office has offered variations on that statement for months but missed opportunities to utilize existing election dates to fill the seat, including Tuesday’s municipal primary.
In the meantime, the absence of a state Senator “has real consequences” for people in the district, said state Rep. Bill G. Schuette, a Midland Republican who is considering a run should Whitmer call a special election.
“We’re debating serious issues in the state Legislature, whether it’s our state’s budget, how we finally work to fix our roads … ,” he said. “People in the Great Lakes Bay region only have half of their voice.”
Schuette and other Republicans have continued to question the delay, accusing Whitmer of petty politics driven by a fear that the district will flip to Republicans.
Should it, Democrats and Republicans would each hold 19 seats in the state Senate.
Democratic Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist would have the power to break a tie, but Republicans could effectively block bills by asking a lawmaker to miss session. In the event of a 19-18 vote, a bill would fail, with no opportunity for Gilchrist to provide the 20th vote necessary for passage.
“It seems like Gov. Whitmer is very intent on doing the most political thing, because it seems like they’re afraid they’re going to lose the seat to Republicans,” said Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, R-Porter Township. “It’s blatantly political, partisan politics that they’re playing.”
 People in the district ‘deprived of representation’

It’s not uncommon for a lawmaker to leave office before their term concludes. But Michigan’s solution — giving the governor almost absolute control to call an election with little restriction on timing — is a poor solution, experts say.
“This is an endemic problem,” said Quinn Yeargain, a professor of law at Michigan State University. “Any time there’s a vacancy and you have to have a special election, there’s going to be a period of time in which nobody is in the seat and the people are functionally deprived of representation.”
Half of U.S. states instead use some version of an appointment system — typically, where the party that previously held the seat gives names to the governor for a replacement candidate — to expedite the process.
Political appointments can appear undemocratic, Yeargain said, but they help ensure voters do not lack representation for prolonged periods.
Michigan lawmakers in recent years have tried but failed to force a timeline for filing vacant seats in the state Legislature.
Former state Rep. Andrea Schroeder introduced a bill in June 2021 that would require a governor to announce within 30 days of a vacancy whether there will be a special election to finish the term.
The bill was personal for Schroeder, a Republican from Independence Township: She had been diagnosed with stomach cancer, and she died in October of that year.
Lawmakers in the House and Senate approved the legislation, but Whitmer vetoed it, saying she would “not tie the hands of future Michigan governors.”
Schuette, the Midland Republican, introduced a similar bill this year that would require a special election within 180 days of a legislative vacancy.
The proposal was co-sponsored by 16 Republican colleagues and referred to the House Election Integrity Committee in June. The GOP-led House has yet to hold a hearing on the bill, however.
State Board of Education Chair Pamela Pugh, a Saginaw Democrat who has already filed to run for the vacant seat, said Whitmer may have a good reason for not yet calling a special election, including ongoing negotiations over the state budget and road funding talks in Lansing.
But it’s getting to the point where she needs “to bump us up on that priority list,” Pugh said, adding later: “We are asking her to prioritize us. This district. A district that has great needs.”
 The cost of a special election

A lack of clarity around when — or even if — Whitmer will call a special election also leaves local election officials in a lurch.
Whitmer could call a special election to be run outside of the standard schedule, which can prove expensive and labor-intensive for clerks who will only have a single question on the ballot.
It’s not uncommon, as both May and August local elections frequently have little on the ballot. But any election requires a lot of clerks, from the ballot design to machine testing to counting ballots, and balancing that with the many other tasks they manage can be tricky.
The governor could also call a special election to coincide with other upcoming election dates. That might be easier on clerks, but it would likely also mean the state Senate seat stays vacant into next year.
State law requires that there is first a primary, Department of State spokesperson Cheri Hardmon confirmed. It’s far too late to get the race on next week’s ballot, and the language for much of the November ballot is finalized by the middle of the month to meet state and federal requirements.
Officials in the affected counties said they haven’t heard anything about possible special election dates from the Whitmer administration or the Michigan Bureau of Elections.
It’s been “radio silence,” said Bay County Clerk Katie Zanotti, who is concerned about the potential timing.
If the election is scheduled for later this year, officials could be looking at canvassing during the holidays. If it waits until 2026, Zanotti and other local clerks could have to run four elections next year, including major statewide primary and general elections for governor, U.S. Senate, the Legislature and more.
That was “really challenging” for fellow clerks when it happened last year in Metro Detroit, said Zanotti, a Democrat.
“I wish it would have been called much, much sooner,” she said. “Otherwise, it’s going to be a mad dash if it gets called at all, and I don’t know if it’s going to be.”

Kim Reynolds and Attorney General Brenna Bird, third from right, shown here in a July 2023 file photo, are investigating a university employee's statements about DEI in a video aired on FOX News.

Fresh off an embarrassing defeat to Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx, the state’s chief enforcers of Iowa RightThink have decided to take on someone they undoubtedly believe is more vulnerable.
The governor has filed a complaint concerning a University of Iowa employee who had the misfortune of being captured on hidden camera disparaging the anti-Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Gospel of the Republican Party.
In a secretly recorded video that aired on Fox News this week, an employee who has been identified in news reports as Andrea Tinoco, assistant director of Leadership and Student Organization Development, said that despite being ordered to remove “DEI” from their websites, “we are essentially finding ways to operate around it. … “We were like, ‘oh, OK, we can’t use that word. OK, ‘civic engagement.’ I think that’s a lot of what we’re doing.”
Civic engagement? The horrors!
In another part of the heavily edited video, Tinoco says: “We are still doing DEI work. We’re still working with our students. I have yet to be told, like, ‘Drea, you can’t say DEI,’ and I’m still gonna say it.”
Reynolds — who once said a jury’s verdict convicting Donald Trump of 34 felonies didn’t matter  — was instantly triggered by the video. She’s already pronounced Tinoco guilty of defying the state law banning diversity, equity and inclusion offices and activities. This, before the investigation was even completed; perhaps before it had even begun.
But it’s not at all clear that Tinoco has violated anything. The vaguely written law, passed in 2024, prohibits establishing offices or engaging in activities that give “special benefits” or encourage “preferential treatment” based on characteristics like race, religion, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation.
Just because the adherents of Iowa RightThink get wiggy at the mere mention of “DEI,” and some university employees continue to believe in the idea behind it — equal opportunity — this doesn’t mean they are breaking the law.
Disparaging a concept, or attempts to banish it, are not illegal, either.
Nor are attempts to maneuver within the law’s meaning. Politicians do this all the time.
We’ve seen this movie before.
In February, Dan Marx violated Iowa RightThink by having the nerve to say he would uphold the Constitution, even if it meant refusing to pledge unquestioning loyalty to the federal government’s immigration practices.
These words also triggered the governor, who complained to Bird. The attorney general then tried to bring Marx to heel for what he wrote, going to court claiming he had broken state law. But Marx, a popular Republican sheriff in a Republican leaning county, chose to fight. He won.
This no doubt embarrassed Reynolds and Bird. So now they’ve chosen someone who might not have the resources or the level of public support of the elected sheriff who humiliated them. A person who they now seek to intimidate, either themselves or by leveraging the Board of Regents or the university to do it for them.
I don’t know Andrea Tinoco, but I hope she’s got access to good legal help. Because the weight of Iowa’s government is being brought to bear against her.
If she doesn’t, I hope Iowans who believe in free speech will step up.
I also hope the University of Iowa doesn’t knuckle under. We’ve already seen larger universities, with hefty financial resources, cave under the pressure of Trumpian intimidation, surrendering their free-speech values in the process. It would be a shame to see the University of Iowa join this crowd.
Here’s the bottom line: Iowans, including public employees, ought to be able to express an opinion, even if it runs against the prevailing winds of Iowa’s ruling party; even if it is expressing how you have tried to find ways, in the face of a pernicious law, to do “what we know we have to do for students.”
If this breaks the law, then Bird should have to prove it. If not, then she and the governor ought to leave people alone to say what they want in our free society.
Iowa Republicans have been on a jihad for years to try to establish RightThink in this state — by muzzling public school teachers, banning library books, seeking to impose loyalty oaths on law enforcement, etc.
If they can’t do it by law, then they’ll try to do it by intimidation. They failed with Dan Marx, so now they’ve chosen a new target. But the truth is they’re not just trying to persecute a state employee. We are all the targets of Iowa RightThink.

She climbed onto a boat mobilized by her husband, and as he steered, she held a flashlight to scout in the dark for submerged mailboxes that they might bump on their way to safety.

Though the Mendenhall River flowing by their backyard had been swollen with floodwaters in past years – and though the Lindoffs had taken precautions last summer like sealing doorways and stacking sandbags – the Aug. 5-6, 2024, event was the biggest Mendenhall Glacier outburst flood ever measured. The water that rushed out of a breached glacial ice dam brought the river to a record crest of 15.99 feet, inundating about 290 homes and stunning much of the community.

	“No one expected it to be this big,” Lindoff said months later in an interview at her freshly repaired and refurbished house.
The community is no longer likely to be caught by surprise.
“It’s probably likely that the floods could get larger in the future,” said Eran Hood, an environmental science professor and glacier specialist at the University of Alaska Southeast.
Hood is part of a broad effort mounted by scientists, government agencies, the local Tribal government, nonprofit community groups and individuals to limit the damage that may result from future floods.

By 1 p.m. that day, more than 100 cars had checked in at the Dimond Park Field House, according to city officials. Each household was allowed to fill 75 sandbags. The event, one of several held by municipal and Tribe officials, was in anticipation of another glacial outburst flood. (Photo by Corrine Smith/Alaska Beacon)
 

	A first step is ensuring that the public knows the risks. To that end, Hood and others at UAS and partner organizations have created an online resource, the Juneau Glacial Flood Dashboard, launched in May.
Though the floods glaciers produce can happen quickly, there can be early warnings of water releases. The Juneau Glacial Flood Dashboard gives real-time information on water levels pooled above the ice dam that forms each year at one of the glacier’s basins. It has weather data, aerial images and other up-to-the-minute information. One of the most important features is a detailed flood-inundation map; users can type in their addresses and get predictions for flood impacts, depending on river-level scenarios and other conditions.
The dashboard idea came up as an answer to a basic question, Hood said: “What are the best ways to communicate hazards?”
Work by Hood and his colleagues is supported by a National Science Foundation grant. The foundation funded a project to do detailed studies of Mendenhall Glacier and the flood risks it poses, hone systems for predictions and warnings and apply those tools to other flood-prone glaciers in Alaska and possibly beyond.
Outburst flooding is a natural phenomenon in glaciated areas, sometimes referred to by an Icelandic name: jökulhlaup. They occur from the Andes to the Arctic. Their suddenness can make them dangerous to people in certain parts of the world, like the Himalayas; overall, about 15 million people in the world are at risk of such floods, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Nature.
The risks are increasing with climate change and glacial melt, studies have shown. Globally, glacial lake volume increased by 48% between 1990 and 2018, according to a 2020 study by Canadian, U.S. and British scientists who used satellite imagery to make the calculations.
Alaska outburst floods
Glacial outburst floods are also natural in Alaska, though the trends are a bit different.
There were 1,150 of these outbursts released from 106 ice-dammed lakes between 1985 and 2020, according to a study published in 2023 by scientists from Colorado State University, the University of Alaska Fairbanks and other institutions. The frequency of such events was unchanged over that period, they found. But there was a big change in timing, with most of the sites flooding earlier in the year, likely the result of warming temperatures and faster melt, the study found. Rapid changes in glaciers’ structures also means that new water-filled dams — and new flood risks — are emerging at individual sites, the study said.

Alaska’s glaciers are melting faster than those elsewhere in the world. The melt has varied and sometimes contradictory impacts on outburst floods, the 2023 study explains. Less ice overall has meant a reduced supply of meltwater. But accelerated melt can also increase the size of glaciers’ basins and weaken the ice dams that hold their meltwater. Rapid melt can also cause huge chunks of ice to calve away from higher elevations into the basins, boosting volume quickly.

Most of Alaska’s outburst floods have occurred in remote areas where there are no immediate threats to communities, like parts of sprawling Wrangell St-Elias National Park.
The Mendenhall Valley, however, is not remote.
The broad valley was carved into the landscape over millennia by its namesake glacier. It is a major suburb of Alaska’s capital city, home to about 12,000 of Juneau’s 31,200 residents. It holds neat neighborhoods where houses are more spacious than in the city’s upscale but tightly packed downtown district. It also holds abundant parks and trails, scenic views of mountains, meadows and coastline; and conveniences like shopping malls and commuter bus service. And, within the Tongass National Forest that surrounds the city, the valley is known for the big glacier that looms over it and draws hundreds of thousands of tourists each year.
Mendenhall Glacier has ebbed and flowed over thousands of years, but it has been in retreat ever since the Little Ice Age ended in the mid-1700s. As the climate has warmed — a trend amplified in far-north latitudes — the retreat has accelerated. That is the case not just for Mendenhall but for the other glaciers connected to the vast Juneau Ice Field that caps the mountains spanning Southeast Alaska and adjacent parts of Canada. The Juneau Ice Field lost a tenth of its glacier area from 2005 to 2019, according to NASA.
This melt created a relatively new gap within Mendenhall’s ice called Suicide Basin, reportedly named after the drop that ice above the basin would experience. Retreat of the smaller Suicide Glacier, which had been connected to Mendenhall, created the gap.
As glacial ice melts over each summer, the basin fills with water. As the water within the basin rises, it breaks through the ice dam and rushes down into Mendenhall Lake, Mendenhall River and, sometimes, over the riverbanks. The process is repeated year-to-year as ice dams are formed and then breached, though water amounts and speed of releases can vary.
Had modern technology and alertness existed in the past, the risk to the Mendenhall Valley could have been identified many years ago, Hood said.

	“Twenty years ago, someone could have looked at Mendenhall and looked at the side basins and said there could definitely be a problem in the future. Nobody did that,” he said.
The first Suicide Basin outburst flood was in 2011. “That pretty much caught people by surprise, although in hindsight, it shouldn’t have,” said Jason Amundson, a UAS geophysics professor and the principal investigator for the National Science Foundation-funded project.
Since then, floods have occurred almost annually, though at varying levels and intensities. Recent floods were big. A record 2023 flood, with a maximum crest of the Mendenhall River measured at 14.97 feet, was followed by the even-bigger 2024 flood.
Though it caused more damage, last year’s flood came and went quickly. “The whole thing lasted maybe 12 hours,” Amundson said..

There is not yet enough data to identify a clear pattern, making predictions difficult for now, Hood and Amundson said. But there is a good chance that Suicide Basin will continue emptying out huge amounts of water.
“If we keep having full drainage like we did last year, then I would expect that we would keep having big floods,” Amundson said.
Local officials, meanwhile, are looking beyond Suicide Basin as they consider future risks, said Robert Barr, Juneau’s assistant city manager.
“There very well could be other basins behind Suicide that will form as Mendenhall Glacier retreats,” he said.
Holding waters back
The municipal government, a partner in the flood dashboard, has embarked on another short-term response to the flood risk.

	It spent nearly $8 million on a flood barrier erected this year along the Mendenhall River. The barrier, a stout sandbag structure originally designed for military use, was recommended by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a short-term fix. To recoup part of the cost, the local government is assessing a fee on the 466 property owners in the river area. The fee, about $6,300 per household, is to be paid over 10 years.
The Lindoff home is among those behind the new barrier, which bears the brand name HESCO. Danielle Lindoff, who has watched river waters rise and churn over the years, eroding the far bank and felling huge trees, said she is grateful for the protection. But her feelings are mixed.
“We bought this house because of the view,” she said. “Now we won’t even be able to see it.”
Barr, at the City and Borough of Juneau, concedes the barriers are not particularly pretty. But he said most homeowners accept their presence.
“I wouldn’t say the question was, ‘Do you find the HESCO barriers attractive or not?’” he said. “But they are our best effort, in consultation with the Army Corps and all the other experts that we’re talking with, to keep water in the river.”

	The barriers are temporary, Barr said.
For the longer term, the Army Corps of Engineers might design a bigger flood-control system, he said. That could be something as substantial as the diversion project installed in Fairbanks after a devastating 1967 flood. The Fairbanks system is large, subject to ongoing maintenance, and has cost $220 million to date. The Corps has already embarked on a technical study for the Mendenhall Valley, a project supported by $4.75 million in federal funds.

It is possible that the Corps will create something similar for Juneau’s Mendenhall Valley. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)

Whatever is done will depend on scientific research.
The University of Alaska Southeast-led team, which also includes scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Carnegie Mellon University, is using field and remote-sensing data to better understand how the glacier has changed in the past and to create models for how it will change in the future. Technologies used include LiDAR, which measures elevations and features through light beams; radar, which employs soundwaves to measure the thickness of glacial ice over bedrock; and drones, which capture aerial images that can be compared over time.
 


	Weather and tide data is important, too. The record 2024 outburst flood came on a night after a gloriously sunny and warm summer day. Things could be much worse if an outburst flood happens during a rainstorm or when tides in the adjacent Gastineau Channel are exceptionally high, experts say.
Beyond Juneau
The Mendenhall work being led by Amundson is about more than Juneau’s famous glacier. The risk-analysis systems the team develops for Mendenhall are intended to be applied to other glaciers in Alaska.
Beyond Mendenhall, Hood said, the second-highest priority for risk analysis is probably Snow Glacier on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage and just north of the coastal town of Seward.

	Though the Snow Glacier’s periodic floods have not reached communities beyond a popular campground and a smattering of nearby houses, they do threaten infrastructure. The Seward Highway, a major state thoroughfare, and the Alaska Railroad run right along that flood zone. The railroad is planning to raise the elevation of a bridge at the trouble site, and the Alaska Department of Transportation plans a related elevation rise to the highway. The estimated cost of the road project alone is $20 million.

	Hood and Amundson pointed out another spot where glacial outburst floods are threats: the Prince William Sound port town of Valdez, home to 3,900 people and site of the terminal where oil that passes through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System is shipped out.
In the mountains outside of town, the Valdez Glacier has been damming and releasing meltwater every year or two. Some years, releases are relatively slow and small; some years’ releases cause problems. An outburst flood in 2018 inundated part of Valdez.
Weakened federal partners?
Continued work to understand glacial outburst floods and the risks they pose to Alaskans depends on partnerships with academic institutions and agencies at various levels of government.
But federal agencies that are important partners have been weakened by deep budget cuts and abrupt firings that could hollow out scientific programs.
One partner is the U.S. Geological Survey, a branch of the Department of the Interior that has been doing both long-term monitoring of Mendenhall Glacier’s changes and collecting day-to-day data and imagery from Suicide Basin. The Trump administration is proposing slashing total USGS spending by nearly 40%, including an approximately 30% cut to the agency’s natural disaster programs.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Weather Service, is another key partner that has already been targeted for deep cuts and likely faces more. The administration’s budget for the coming fiscal years proposes eliminating all funding for NOAA research.
The U.S. Forest Service is another partner. It manages the Tongass National Forest, which covers most of Southeast Alaska, and Southcentral Alaska’s Chugach National Forest. Both are heavily glaciated.

Mass firings by the Trump administration left the visitor center nearly unmanned earlier in the year, with only two employees still on the payroll there in February. Several workers have been rehired since, but staffing levels remain uncertain.
Barr said Juneau officials worry about losses at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, an important partner even though its general definition of flood zones does not consider glacial outburst floods.
The agency in April canceled its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program, and halted work on all pending grant applications, even though the program has won praise for helping communities reduce costs of disaster emergencies.
Several states are pushing back against the program’s termination; 20 filed a lawsuit in mid-July challenging the administration’s decision.
“We are potentially concerned about hazard-mitigation grants and those going away,” Barr said. And along with loss of financial aid is the concern about “losing expertise” as veteran emergency and risk-assessment experts are pushed out of the agency, he said.
Uncertainty also affects the National Science Foundation, which is funding the Mendenhall research project. The Trump administration is proposing a 55 percent cut for the coming fiscal year.
The grant money was already paid, and so far, the project has remained intact, Amundson said. “As far as I know, everything is going forward,” he said.

,California,2025-08-02 13:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California affordable housing programs are on the chopping block after Supreme Court ruling,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/08/affordable-housing-developer-fees/,Many California cities require homebuilders to create affordable housing or pay fees to support construction of those units. A new lawsuit contends those fees are unconstitutional.,"In summary
Many California cities require homebuilders to create affordable housing or pay fees to support construction of those units. A new lawsuit contends those fees are unconstitutional.


East Palo Alto, like cities across California, has a law on the books that forces developers of new housing projects to foot the bill for the state’s shortage of affordable homes.
New residential projects need to set aside a share of the units they plan to build for lower-income renters and homeowners under the terms of the city’s “inclusionary zoning” ordinance. Builders who refuse have to instead pay a fee, ranging from the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
An East Palo Alto homeowner filed a lawsuit in federal court on Thursday challenging the constitutionality of that law, likening it to “extortion” — and he had a little help from the U.S. Supreme Court.
The implications of the lawsuit range far beyond the Bay Area. A 2017 report estimated that 149 cities and counties across California have some form of inclusionary zoning rule, though the specific terms vary. That makes it one of the most commonly used affordable housing programs both in California and in the country. 
Now all that may be on the constitutional chopping block.
The case was filed in federal court in San Francisco by Wesley Yu, a husband and father between jobs, who was planning to build a home and backyard guest cottage for himself and his extended family on a neighboring parcel.
Because Yu was planning to construct two new structures, the city’s inclusionary zoning rules kicked in, requiring him to either sell or rent out one of the units at “affordable” rates or to pay a one-time fee of $54,891 to be deposited in the city’s affordable housing subsidy fund.
The core of Yu’s lawsuit, which was filed by the libertarian-oriented Pacific Legal Foundation, draws on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from last year that also emerged from a heated California housing dispute. 
That case was brought by Placerville septuagenarian, George Sheetz, who contested that the government of El Dorado County had not done enough to justify the $23,420 traffic fee it placed on his home construction project.
Sheetz’s case drew on the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which puts limits on when the government can take private property. Decades of court rulings have said that if a local government wants to base approval of a construction permit on certain conditions, those conditions have to directly relate to the costs associated with the development. A city, for example, might be able to hold off on approving a new dump until a developer pays an environmental clean up fee, but not a fee to fund local arts and recreation. 
Courts have also ruled that such “exactions” on private development should be “roughly proportionate” to their cost. That is, the $23,420 that El Dorado County wanted to impose on Sheetz should match the cost of fixing the wear and tear his new home would leave on local roads.
The Supreme Court agreed that these standards ought to apply to the impact fee.
Now Yu and his legal team are asking a federal judge to apply that same rule to inclusionary zoning. For East Palo Alto’s program to pass constitutional muster, the city would have to show that the $54,891 fee or the requirement to set aside new units at a discount relates to and matches the cost that Yu’s development would impose upon the city.
The city won’t be able to show that, said David Deerson, the lead lawyer representing Yu.
“New residential development doesn’t have a negative impact on housing affordability. If anything, it has a positive impact,” he said.
A growing body of economic research has indeed found that local market-rate development puts downward pressure on neighborhood and city-wide rents.
Affordable housing in California zoning
In the past, California courts have ruled that the high constitutional bar set by the Fifth Amendment doesn’t apply to inclusionary zoning programs like the one in East Palo Alto. Requiring private developers to toss in some added affordable housing isn’t an “exaction,” the courts have found, but a standard land-use restriction akin to any other zoning rule. 
Whether a city decides it needs more schools, apartment buildings, businesses or, in the case of inclusionary zoning, affordable housing, it has broad power under the constitution to “decide, for the good of the general welfare, that we’re going to require this,” said Mike Rawson, director of litigation at the Public Interest Law Project. 
The state Supreme Court ruled as such most recently in 2015. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to weigh in, a tacit approval. 
“They can always change their mind,” said Rawson. “I don’t see a basis for it, though obviously that doesn’t necessarily stop them.”
The composition of the court has changed since 2015, veering sharply to the right. The Sheetz decision from last year has offered new fodder for legal challenges to inclusionary zoning.
“Sheetz really helps out here a lot” in that campaign, said Deerson. He pointed to other challenges in Denver and Teton County, Wyoming. “I would expect them to keep coming.”
Tradeoffs in housing policy
If and when the nation’s highest court takes up the issue of inclusionary zoning, it will be wading into one of the more politically charged debates in housing policy.
Evidence on the impact of these laws is mixed. Requiring private developers to build affordable units can and regularly does result in more local housing options for lower income tenants at no additional cost to taxpayers. By putting affordable and market-rate units side-by-side, they also promote economic and racial integration, supporters argue. 
But inclusionary requirements can also make any given housing project less profitable, meaning that fewer units get built, leading to higher prices and rents overall. In housing markets, like California’s, that see relatively little new development, the rate at which these programs add designated affordable units to the housing stock is also quite slow.
That policy debate isn’t relevant to the legal case, which will be fought and won over abstract constitutional principles. But for libertarian-leaning groups like the Pacific Legal Foundation, building industry groups and many “Yes In My Backyard” housing development advocates, an end to inclusionary zoning would be a win on both fronts.
“In addition to being illegal, I think that these inclusionary zoning policies are also frankly stupid,” said Deerson.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/012425-Affordable-Housing-DD-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-02 09:56:11.407167

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)As the Trump administration shrinks and even considers eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Alaska Legislature is considering a substitute for one of the agency’s key functions.
A bill introduced by Sen. Bert Stedman, a Republican from the Southeast city of Sitka, would establish an Alaska flood authority and an Alaska flood insurance fund. As far as he knows, it would make Alaska the only state with its own flood insurance, Stedman said.
The veteran state lawmaker said his measure, Senate Bill 11, stems from his dissatisfaction with FEMA and its flood policies, feelings that predated the agency’s possible demise in the Trump era.
The federal agency is, for now, the only source of flood insurance in Alaska, as private carriers that offer policies elsewhere in the country do not operate in the state’s small market, Stedman said.
But Alaskans overall pay much more into the FEMA insurance pool that they receive, he said.
“There’s a cost factor involved here, with Alaska residents subsidizing the Mississippi Delta and the Gulf Coast and East Coast and all that compared to our losses,” Stedman said.
FEMA’s rules about insurance and assistance, which are aimed at flood-prone flat Lower 48 areas, are another source of irritation for Stedman. In Lower 48 areas, FEMA encourages communities to avoid building along coastlines, but in Southeast Alaska, where steep mountains rise from the water’s edge, there are few options for moving inland, he said. An only-in-Alaska flood program could consider local conditions and local governments’ zoning rules rather than FEMA national guidelines, he said.
The Trump administration’s antipathy toward FEMA and its mission has given his bill more urgency, he said.
“It’s reasonably likely that there’ll be significant changes to FEMA coming out of Washington, from restructuring to possibly elimination, so the timing of this bill might be, by happenstance, timely,” he said.
The bill moved through committees this year and is due for more work next year’s session, including an examination of funding options. If a system is established, Stedman said, it could potentially be expanded to another type of disaster that is occurring with increasing frequency in warming Alaska: landslides. There is no specific landslide insurance available in Alaska, Stedman noted.
That may be of interest to Jason Amundson and Eran Hood, University of Alaska Southeast scientists who are focused on glacial outburst flood risks. Though immersed in their project at Mendenhall Glacier, they do not live in the path of the meltwater. Rather, both live in the city’s downtown area, which clings to the lower slopes of steep mountains. There, avalanches and landslides pose the most serious risks.
“There’s hazards everywhere in Juneau,” Hood said.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
GADSDEN — The coal ash lagoon at Alabama Power’s Plant Gadsden was supposed to be a model for how to close ash ponds by covering them in place, a process utilities insisted would protect human health and the environment from toxic contaminants in the ash.
Now, groundwater monitoring data and a federal lawsuit are challenging that contention.
The ash pond was the first in Alabama to be closed with a cover-in-place system in 2018, after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2015 coal ash rules, and Alabama Power planned to use the same basic technique at the coal ash ponds for five other power plants across the state.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But today, seven years after the Gadsden pond closure was completed, environmental groups say the facility is still leaking toxic substances into groundwater on the banks of the Coosa River and Neely Henry Lake, a popular boating and bass fishing destination in east Alabama.
The Southern Environmental Law Center, on behalf of environmental group Coosa Riverkeeper, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Alabama Power, challenging what it called “unlawful and defective capping” of the coal ash pond at Plant Gadsden.
The groups say that as recently as October 2024, Alabama Power’s self-reported groundwater monitoring results show “levels of arsenic forty times the legal standard in groundwater,” as well as potentially harmful levels of boron, chromium and cobalt.
“The citizens of Gadsden and folks who depend on Neely Henry Lake deserve so much better than Alabama Power’s legacy of pollution,” Justinn Overton, executive director and riverkeeper at Coosa Riverkeeper, said in a news release. “Drinking water supply, booming ecotourism, and hard-working Alabamians are all threatened by Alabama Power’s recklessness.”
Coosa Riverkeeper is among numerous groups that have called for Alabama Power to excavate its coal ash and move the material to a lined landfill, rather than leaving the ash in unlined impoundments near rivers. Alabama Power has announced plans to cap all of its coal ash ponds in place, but Gadsden is the only plant where that process has been completed.
“It’s time for Alabama Power to do the right thing and move their ash,” Overton said.
A spokesperson for Alabama Power said “[a]s a matter of practice, we do not comment on pending legal matters.”
Coal ash, or coal combustion residuals, are the leftover solid material from burning coal, typically in a power plant or other industrial facility. According to the EPA, coal ash often contains contaminants like mercury, cadmium, chromium and arsenic which can be “associated with cancer and various other serious health effects.”
The EPA’s 2015 coal ash rules allowed for two possible cleanup options for the coal ash lagoons, which can be hundreds of acres in size, containing millions of tons of wet ash slurry. Utilities could dig out the coal ash and move it to a lined landfill, or they could cover it in place, as long as certain conditions were met.
In 2016, Alabama Power announced plans to use the cover-in-place option at all its plants. The permit for Plant Gadsden was approved by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management in 2020, two years after the physical work had already been completed.
But last year, the EPA denied approval of Alabama’s coal ash permitting program, saying that the state had approved permits that were “significantly less protective of people and waterways than federal law requires,” and that “coal ash units cannot be closed in a way that allows coal ash to continue to spread contamination in groundwater after closure.”
The Riverkeeper lawsuit—filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama—contends that nearly 40 percent of the ash at Gadsden remains saturated in groundwater, constituting a violation of the EPA coal ash rules and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
It is not yet clear how the coal ash regulations will fare under the Trump administration.
The groups filed a notice of intent to sue in May, and went forward with the suit Tuesday, after the required 60-day notification period.
In addition to the lake being a popular fishing spot, the ash pond is located less than a mile upstream of a drinking water intake, although the lawsuit does not allege any contamination of the drinking water.
The coal ash pond at Plant Gadsden is on the opposite side of the river from the old power plant, which was demolished last year. According to the lawsuit, the coal ash slurry was pumped through underwater pipes across the river for disposal in a lagoon.
“There is no excuse for a company with Alabama Power’s resources to risk a community and commercial riverfront with this type of hazard,” Barry Brock, director of SELC’s Alabama office, said in a news release. “Alabama Power must join utilities across the South cleaning up unlined coal ash dumps. This type of waste must be in safe storage away from waterways like the Coosa and Neely Henry Lake.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Coal-ash-pond-for-Aug-2-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-02 08:56:11.654961

(Photo by Emree Weaver for InvestigateWest)Throughout her two decades working on forestry issues, Jasmine Minbashian has often found herself at odds with the U.S. Forest Service and the timber industry. Her environmental activism started during the second wave of Pacific Northwest “Timber Wars” — an intense period of conflict between environmentalists and the timber industry that unfolded in the late 1980s and ’90s over logging in old-growth forests.
Instead of camping out in century-old trees or destroying timber-felling equipment in protest of sweeping logging practices on public lands, Minbashian took a different approach. She worked to bring disparate groups together to restore old-growth forests, supporting rural economies and reducing wildfire risk at the same time. 
So when she joined the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative in 2019, Minbashian felt cautiously optimistic. The organization — one of dozens of forest collaboratives that had sprung up across the West — brought together conservation groups, agency officials and timber companies to plan forest restoration projects in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. As the executive director of the small environmental nonprofit Methow Valley Citizens Council, she was excited to have a seat at the table to find common ground.
One of the group’s first major efforts focused on restoring 50,000 fire-prone acres near Twisp, the rural town where she lived. For years, the group collaborated closely with the U.S. Forest Service to design the Mission Restoration Project and garner community support. The plan included some commercial logging, but largely focused on thinning small trees, restoring habitat and decommissioning old roads — work Minbashian believed could protect communities without resorting to the kind of aggressive logging she had spent years fighting.
But when no timber companies bid on the commercial logging portion of the project, federal and state agencies quietly rewrote the plan to, as Minbashian put it, “sweeten the pot” by including more large trees — circumventing years of planning, environmental assessments and community outreach. The $1.1 million contract was ultimately awarded in 2021 to Hampton Lumber, a member of the collaborative, which trucked the logs more than 100 miles to its mill on the other side of the Cascades.
“That started some of the questioning of, like, what’s going on here?” Minbashian said.
When she later visited logged areas near the Libby and Buttermilk creek drainages, she was stunned. Some sections looked as expected. Others had been stripped of trees she thought were protected by the restoration project plan — including old-growth trees that are key to the forest’s health.
“When you’re talking about restoring forests and climate-smart forestry, you want to retain those old or big trees,” she said. “They’re the most fire-resistant. They store water. They just serve so many important ecological functions.”
Over the last decade, hundreds of millions of private, state and federal dollars have been funneled to forest restoration and wildfire mitigation projects spearheaded by the U.S. Forest Service and collaborative groups like the one in North Central Washington. The group is one of 19 forest collaboratives focused on public lands in Washington and Oregon that emerged in the wake of the “Timber Wars” in an attempt to find agreement around contentious forestry issues. 
These forest collaboratives, touted as a model of consensus-driven conservation, have quietly become influential engines for federal forest management decisions across the West. But critics worry the groups are too aligned with timber interests that prioritize commercial logging, and that they helped pave the way for the Trump administration’s latest effort to expand logging on public lands throughout the country by skirting environmental protection laws.
Some community groups and grassroots environmental organizations have become disenchanted with the arrangement, saying forest collaboratives offer a false sense of community engagement and transparency into forestry projects on public lands. Other mainstream environmental groups see timber’s influence in the projects as a double-edged sword. While the commercial logging aspects of the projects are often the most controversial, the timber sale can help fund other aspects of the restoration plans — like improving fish spawning areas and decommissioning roads that fragment wildlife habitats — to help keep the momentum going. But those funds aren’t always guaranteed.
“Everybody’s at the table because they have their own interests,” said Tiana Luke, the co-chair of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative and the senior conservation manager for The Wilderness Society, a national environmental policy nonprofit. “In this climate, we can’t do the important ecological forest restoration without that economic component.”
Unlike some forest collaboratives, the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative is not classified formally as a federal advisory committee, meaning the group isn’t required to follow accountability and transparency measures meant to limit the influence of special interest groups on public policy. 


The collaborative insists that it wields the same influence as any other community member when making suggestions to the Forest Service. But years worth of internal documents and emails obtained by InvestigateWest show the group has worked closely with the U.S. Forest Service at nearly every step of the process to carefully craft public messaging around logging projects, placate community concerns, and keep projects on pace and out of the courts. For at least one project, records show that a bid was awarded to the same timber company that had previously led a discussion among collaborative members about how to make the project more attractive to buyers. 
“It’s all because they want to rush the projects through,” said Ric Bailey, a Winthrop resident and a longtime environmental activist. “They’re showing the public, look, we are doing something to protect you from fire.”
But he sees no difference in the current approach to what he witnessed in the ’80s and ’90s, when the Forest Service’s main priority was meeting federally mandated timber quotas. 
“I looked at the projects, and I said, ‘These don’t have anything to do with fire or fuel reductions,’” he recalled thinking, referring to the Mission Restoration Project. “It’s just logging.” 
Public plans versus reality
In the wake of the Timber Wars, forest collaboratives emerged to bring lumber mill owners, environmentalists and local governments to the table to figure out how to move forward. Public perception had begun to move away from viewing national forests as “piggy banks” for economic benefit and resource extraction to treating them as ecological treasures worthy of protection, according to Steve Pedery, the conservation director at Oregon Wild, a Portland-based environmental organization that helped create some of the first collaboratives. 
But over the last decade, the pendulum has swung back toward timber interests, according to Pedery.
“There are still places where you will find functional collaboratives and their citizens who come together with loggers and the Forest Service and counties and community groups to hash out a common vision,” Pedery said. “But I would say that’s the rarity these days.” 
Pedery feels mainstream environmental groups participating in forest collaboratives have compromised their values in exchange for access to funding and a seat at the decision-making table — a dynamic that’s helped set the stage for the Trump administration’s current efforts to expand and expedite logging in national forests by 25%.
“There are a lot of people who had a little too much hubris over the last decade who helped create this mess that we’re in around losing what are really some of the existential environmental protections in the Pacific Northwest,” he said. 
The Trump administration claims that, in addition to reducing the country’s reliance on domestic timber, recent actions to expedite logging operations will improve forest health and reduce the risk of catastrophic fire by thinning out overgrown forests. But some legal experts and environmental scientists warn that while some thinning could help, excessive logging could have the opposite effect by creating drier conditions, altering forest structures to make them less resilient and increasing flammable logging “debris” across the landscape.
While many of the restoration projects being spearheaded by the Forest Service and the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative call for ecological restoration efforts aside from logging, those aspects often lag behind — calling into question whether the restoration plans are simply commercial logging under a different name. 
“Typically in the past, what would happen is that the commercial part would get done, but all the stuff that needed funding would not get done,” Minbashian told InvestigateWest in February. “So even though they did the (environmental assessment) for it, it doesn’t mean it necessarily happened.” 
That’s been true for the Mission Project, where 95% of the commercial thinning outlined in the environmental assessment has been completed as of June 2025; 69% of noncommercial thinning has been completed; and less than 5% of the planned prescribed burning has occurred as of July 2025, according to a Forest Service spokesperson. Only a quarter of fish culverts have been replaced, though 80% of the planned habitat improvement plans for streams have occurred. 
The collaborative, founded in 2013, gained momentum in the wake of two catastrophic wildfire seasons in North Central Washington — a time often cited in press releases and scientific reports as highlighting the need for restoration work.
On a windy, hot day in July 2014, lightning strikes ignited the Carlton Complex Fire, which went down in state history as the largest continuous wildfire, engulfing more than 250,000 acres, destroying over 350 homes, and leaving $98 million worth of damage in its wake. The following year, another million acres burned in the area, leading to renewed public outcry from residents wanting to see more done to prevent wildfires. 
“When people talk about the trauma of that fire event, and then the 2015 fires that devastated a huge area of Okanogan County, it’s real,” said Susan Prichard, a fire ecologist for the University of Washington whose family lived through the fire. “I can still choke up about it.”
As wildfires in the Pacific Northwest have become more frequent and more devastating, collaboratives like those in Washington have become increasingly vocal about the urgency of improving the ecosystem and addressing the long legacy of fire suppression from the U.S. Forest Service, which led to a buildup of “wildfire fuels” across the landscape.
For centuries, Indigenous people stewarded forests by thinning and resetting the landscape using fire, which is critical to ecosystem health. But the U.S. Forest Service’s longstanding practice of aggressive fire suppression led to a buildup of dense, dry forests, primed to burn. The resulting catastrophic wildfires triggered an influx of state and federal funds for “fuel reduction treatments” such as forest thinning — a broad term which can mean removing small branches and trees or conducting massive commercial logging projects — as well as prescribed burning.
“Fire is such a big component of the ecology of the forest here, and they have been historically fire-suppressed, and so we need to reintroduce fire,” Minbashian said. “But if you did that without some thinning first, it could lead to bigger fires than we want, which is what we’re seeing because of climate change as well.”
“Some thinning prior to fire can be helpful, but thinning alone is not going to get you the results you need,” she added. 
Tools meant to speed up the process
A major goal of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative is to speed up the approval process for restoration projects, which is made easier if the project is proposed to help address wildfire risks. 
To do so, the group pays private consultants to conduct environmental studies and surveys on behalf of the Forest Service in an attempt to circumvent federal bureaucracy. It also relies on condition-based management, a tool which allows the group to get planning approvals based on a broad-strokes outline of a decision, with the promise that the details will get hammered out later. But the practices also obfuscate the plans for the public and make it harder for environmental groups to sue, advocates say. And since the collaborative is part of the planning process so early on, it gives timber industry representatives who are part of the group a front-row seat to million-dollar timber sales they might ultimately bid on. 
During the planning phase for the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative’s first project, called the Upper Wenatchee Restoration project, Anjolene Price, the collaborative forestry manager for Hampton Lumber, led discussions within a subcommittee about how to design the project to entice buyers while remaining “cautious of anti-trust violations,” according to meeting notes obtained by InvestigateWest. Anti-trust laws are meant to promote fair competition and prohibit activity like price-fixing, bid-rigging and monopolization. 

Hampton Lumber ultimately received a $1.5 million timber contract in 2024, the first commercial sale awarded for the Upper Wenatchee Pilot Project.
Price represents Hampton Lumber on several forest collaboratives in Washington, driving hundreds of miles each week to attend in-person meetings. In 2022, she became the co-chair of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative. 
With sawmills in Washington, Oregon and Canada, Hampton Lumber has the largest forestry footprint in Okanogan County and the second largest in the state of Washington. Over the last decade, the company has received $443 million worth of timber contracts to conduct logging on state-managed lands throughout the state. The company has completed five timber sales in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest since 2021 – including at least three projects that Price helped to design – accounting for nearly 58% of all the timber removed from the federally-managed forest, according to data obtained from the Washington Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Forest Service. 
“When it comes to collaboratives and forest health treatment projects, it would be more difficult, even inappropriate, if the local mills were not involved,” Price, who declined numerous interview requests, wrote in a prepared statement. 
“The success of these projects depends on finding markets for any wood fiber that is removed; ultimately, the forest health treatment must pencil out in order to be implemented,” she wrote. “By participating, I can help inform what will work and what does not.”
The collaborative doesn’t define what would be considered a conflict of interest in its operating procedures, and some members within the group insist that no such conflict exists since all parties benefit in some way from the project. 
The group also doesn’t define what success looks like for the projects.
Luke, the co-chair of the collaborative and the senior conservation manager for the Wilderness Society, said it’s challenging to quantify the group’s successes over the last decade. The projects are complicated, span decades, and involve dozens of state and federal agencies and outside groups to pull off, she said. 
Personally, she’d like to see more monitoring happening to help answer that million-dollar question: Are these projects actually helping the environment? 
“Are we reducing the risk of crown fire in this stand or across the landscape as a whole?” said Luke, referring to wildfires that quickly spread through the “crown” or tops of trees. 
“If you look at a broader scale, are we doing that?” she added. “And sometimes the forest has funding and capacity to do that (monitoring), and then sometimes they don’t.”
In the final environmental assessment for the Upper Wenatchee Pilot Project published in 2017, the Forest Service said it was working with partners to develop a “broad monitoring strategy” to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and restoration actions. “While this strategy is still in development, it is expected to result in a monitoring partnership with collaborators and regular reporting of monitoring results,” the plans read. 
The North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative’s website says it is spearheading that effort, but Luke said questions about monitoring should be directed to the Forest Service. In response, a Forest Service spokesperson wrote in an email that they are collecting data on vegetation density and the size of trees within the areas that will be logged. “The Forest Service is coordinating closely with NCWFHC to inform future implementation strategies and adaptive management,” she said.
Still, the collaborative is celebrating the Upper Wenatchee Pilot Project as a success.
In May, a group of around 40 community members piled into two white Forest Service vans to visit a slice of the forest where the project took place, outside Leavenworth. 
Standing in a semi-circle in the middle of a recently logged area of the forest, the tour group was a mix of forestry experts and retirees — many of whom live along Lake Wenatchee, one of the most wildfire-prone areas in the country. Those involved in the project celebrated their decade-long collaboration, declaring that the nearby community was better protected from wildfire because of the work done. 
“We did it,” said Lloyd McGee, a founding member of the collaborative and the Washington forests program manager for the nonprofit The Nature Conservancy, as the crowd clapped. “We didn’t increase the pace, but we’re still learning from that.”
The project originally listed many of the same ecological goals as the Mission Project, such as decommissioning roads, restoring fish habitat and conducting prescribed burning — but much of the work remains incomplete, apart from two timber sales. Approximately 2,300 acres have been sold for commercial logging, with about 30% of the logging having been completed as of July 2025, according to a Forest Service spokesperson. Only a small fraction of the noncommercial thinning has occurred, and no prescribed burning or road decommissioning has taken place. 
“Maybe that’s step two or three,” Andrew Lakota, a staff member with the Wenatchee River Ranger District who helped steward the logging operations for the project, told the crowd. “I don’t know what step that is, but now we’re generating receipts from the timber, and we can start doing a lot of other (restoration) activities we identified.”
Public cut out of the process
When Ric Bailey moved to North Central Washington’s Methow Valley in 2014, tucked in the eastern foothills of the Cascade Range, he was hoping to retire. 
With the help of a local carpenter, he built a small yurt-style home just outside downtown Winthrop — 12 minutes from the edge of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. After decades of environmental activism to stop logging in old-growth forests and wilderness areas throughout the Pacific Northwest, Bailey was burned out and yearned for some stillness. But it wasn’t long before he found himself fighting the same fights. 
Bailey, alongside a small but mighty group of neighbors, has been critical of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative’s behind-the-scenes role in crafting Forest Service projects, often years before community members have a chance to weigh in. They see the setup as nothing more than a mirage, offering the illusion of transparency and community engagement into plans that do nothing more than pad the profits of powerful timber companies.
“All we can do is document how they have cut the public out of the process,” Bailey said. “Once these (environmental assessments) are signed, all you got is litigation.”

The Forest Service isn’t required to listen to the collaborative’s recommendations, but they often do. Any citizen can submit a proposal for consideration during the agency’s environmental review, but the collaborative knows months — and even years — before the public knows what the project might look like, including how much timber companies might get. Unlike members of the public, collaboratives also work hand and hand with the federal agency to iron out the details. 
For example, in 2020, the Forest Service gave collaborative members a three-week “sneak peek” of a final environmental assessment for a contentious restoration project before it was released to the public for a 30-day comment period, according to emails obtained by InvestigateWest.
“They get a front-row seat,” Bailey said.
While the group’s quarterly meetings are open to the public, community members are not permitted in steering committee meetings or a project working group, where collaborative members discuss pending Forest Service projects and current collaborations on public lands. 
Meeting notes are also only sporadically posted online. The most recent quarterly meeting minutes available are from November 2024, the only notes posted since 2021 — though the new facilitator of the group said the lag is due to website issues.
Bailey and other community members have criticized the group for being insular, saying it contradicts their publicly stated goals of engaging the community on public projects. 
“There’s sensitivity on how we talk about work of the collaborative,” Price, the co-chair of the collaborative and Hampton Lumber representative, told members during a meeting in February in which she reiterated the group’s policy of directing media inquiries to the co-chairs. “We don’t want to be knocking ourselves.”
Bailey is also critical of the ways the Forest Service, with help from the collaborative, is trying to expedite “restoration” projects by speeding up the environmental review process using tools now openly championed by the Trump administration under the guise of wildfire mitigation. The tools include finding “flexible ways” to write environmental assessments that leave ample room for different interpretations on the ground. Those strategies also make it more difficult to sue, he said. 
Each project must be reviewed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a landmark 1970 environmental law that requires federal agencies to assess whether an action will have a significant impact on the environment before a project is approved. But there are various levels of review, and the agency gets to determine which is the most appropriate. The Forest Service determined that the second-narrowest environmental review — for projects they consider to have no significant impact on the environment — sufficed for over 200,000 acres encompassed in the four major restoration projects unfolding in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. 
“How can you say that you’re going to reduce wildfire risk and reconstruct the forest, the whole forest ecosystem here, and not have a significant environmental impact?” Bailey said. “Are you kidding me?”
Restoration projects are also set to undergo even less review under the Trump administration. In an executive order issued in March, the Trump administration ordered agencies to expand the use of categorical exclusions, the least stringent type of environmental review, and to exempt timber thinning projects entirely to expedite logging throughout the country’s national forests.
While Prichard, the forest ecologist with the University of Washington, sees commercial logging as a necessary tool to thin out the forest and reduce wildfire risks, she remains cautious. “I’ve become more comfortable with the idea that we need mills to take the material out and help defray the very expensive cost of fire exclusion,” she said.
“Do I think that we should be really careful about next steps and provide a lot of oversight? Absolutely,” she said, referring to Trump’s executive orders regarding logging. “But the term commercial harvesting doesn’t set my hackles up the way it might some of my neighbors.”
Bailey isn’t opposed to fuel reduction projects like noncommercial thinning or even logging, if done thoughtfully. He’s worked on Forest Service projects and as a timber faller in the ’80s, and later as a wildland firefighter. But he takes issue with the collaborative and the Forest Service offering false hope to people that the projects will protect them from fire without providing the evidence to support their claims.  
“It’s a big smoke screen,” he said.
Bailey’s small community group celebrated a win in May. A federal court partially ruled in favor of an environmental group that had challenged the environmental assessment for another project the collaborative is working on, the 24,000-acre Twisp Restoration Project.
The court didn’t completely shut down the logging being done by Hampton Lumber, but paused it until the Forest Service could examine what cumulative effects the project might have on the landscape. The initial environmental assessment stated that the project would have “no substantial impact” on the environment. 
“It’s something,” Bailey said. “We will take it.”
But the timber industry also took it as a partial win. The ruling upheld “condition-based management,” the tool that was used to justify the increased logging for the Mission Project, setting an “excellent precedent,” Tom Partin, the president of the American Forest Resource Council, told fellow collaborative members during a meeting in June.
‘That’s a whole new variable’
Minbashian hasn’t completely lost faith in the collaborative process or the Forest Service. 
After her organization produced a monitoring report of the trees that were cut for the Mission Project, the Forest Service acknowledged that some of the logging didn’t go as planned and issued a statement in 2023 committing to making some changes going forward. 
Minbashian said since the Mission Project, she’s seen modest improvements on the ground. 
She’d still like more guardrails and transparency around the Forest Service’s reliance on logging plans that allow companies to decide in real-time which trees to cut, and clearer expectations for when large trees will be removed.
“Consistently, the way that the project is described in public documents and then the way it’s implemented is really different,” she said.
The lack of details in the plans makes it hard to compare what unfolds on the ground. “All the Forest Service does is say, ‘Oh, we’ll do better next time,’” Bailey said. “There’s nothing you can hold them to legally, that says you have to do something different than what you’ve been doing.” 
Minbashian’s organization is now working with the Forest Service to do baseline monitoring for the upcoming Twisp restoration project, in hopes that large trees are kept on the landscape and history doesn’t repeat itself. She still wants projects to succeed. 
“There’s a lot more components to it than just the commercial timber sale,” she said. “There’s road decommissioning and stream restoration, and understory thinning and all that to improve the damage that was done in the past.”
Minbashian understands where Bailey’s mistrust comes from. She feels it, too. But she thinks the people working locally with the Forest Service have good intentions, and she’s choosing to focus on that.
“You can say, well, of course, they did that. They’re the Forest Service; they’re going to have bad intentions,” she said, referring to the Mission Project. “Or you can say, well, there could be a variety of factors why it didn’t get implemented in the way we envisioned. And let’s look at that and what happened, and can we fix that going forward?”
“That’s just the approach we’ve decided to take, and we will see how it goes,” Minbashian said before pausing. “I think the folks who don’t see it that way may just think that this is another timber grab, and maybe it could be going forward under this new administration. That’s a whole new variable.”

Thousands of K-12 students in Detroit consistently miss days of school.
Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing at least 10% of school days – or 18 in a 180-day academic year. In Detroit, chronic absenteeism rose during the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a persistent challenge.
To encourage attendance, the Detroit Public Schools Community District is getting creative. This past year, Michigan’s largest school district awarded US$200 gift cards to nearly 5,000 high schoolers for attending all their classes during a two-week period, and Superintendent Nikolai Vitti also floated the idea of providing bikes to help students get to class. Some district students lack access to reliable transportation.
To understand the consequences of kids regularly missing school, The Conversation U.S. spoke with Sarah Lenhoff, associate professor of education at Wayne State University and director of the Detroit Partnership for Education Equity & Research, an education-focused research collaborative, and Jeremy Singer, an assistant professor of education at Wayne State University. Lenhoff and Singer wrote a book published in March about the socioeconomic drivers of chronic absenteeism in K-12 schools and how policymakers and communities, not just educators, can help.
Is chronic absenteeism the same as truancy?
No. Truancy is how schools have thought about and dealt with student attendance problems since the early days of public education in the United States in the 19th century and is still defined in state law across the country. It focuses on “unexcused” absences and compliance with mandatory school attendance laws. By contrast, chronic absenteeism includes any absence – whether “excused” or “unexcused” – because each absence can be consequential for student learning and development.
Chronic absenteeism is usually defined as missing 10% or more school days. The 10% threshold is somewhat arbitrary, since researchers know that the consequences of missing school accumulate with each day missed. But the specific definition of chronic absenteeism has been solidified in research and by policymakers. Most states now include a measure of chronic absenteeism in their education accountability systems.
How big of a problem is chronic absenteeism in Detroit’s K-12 public schools?
Detroit has among the highest chronic absenteeism rates in the country: more than 50% in recent school years. Prior to the pandemic, the average rate of chronic absenteeism nationwide was about 15%, and it was around 24% in 2024.
In one of our prior studies, we found Detroit’s chronic absenteeism rate was much higher than other major cities – even others with high absenteeism rates such as Milwaukee or Philadelphia.
This is related to the depth of social and economic inequalities that Detroit families face. Compared to other major cities, Detroit has higher rates of poverty, unemployment and crime. It has worse public health conditions. And even its winters are some of the coldest of major U.S. cities. All of these factors make it harder for kids to attend school.
Rates of chronic absenteeism spiked in Detroit during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they did statewide. The Detroit Public Schools Community District has come close to returning to its pre-pandemic levels of absenteeism. The rates were 66% in the 2023-24 school year compared to 62% in the school year right before the pandemic began, 2018-19.
Detroit’s charter schools have struggled more to bring down their chronic absenteeism rates post-pandemic, but the numbers are lower overall – 54% in the 2023-24 school year compared to 36% in 2018-19.
How does missing school affect students?
The connection between attendance and achievement is clear: Students who miss more school on average score worse on reading and math tests. As early as pre-K, being chronically absent is linked to lower levels of school readiness, both academically and behaviorally. By high school, students who miss more school tend to earn lower grades and GPAs and are less likely to graduate.
And it’s not just the absent students who are affected. When more kids in a class miss school regularly, that is associated with lower overall test scores and worse measures of skills such as executive functioning for other students in that class.
Does chronic absenteeism vary by family income or other factors?
Rates of chronic absenteeism are much higher among students from low-income families. In these cases, absenteeism is often driven by factors outside a student’s control such as unstable housing, unreliable transportation, health issues, lack of access to child care, or parents who work nontraditional hours. These challenges make it harder for students to get to school consistently, even when families are deeply committed to education.
School-based factors also influence attendance. Students are more likely to be chronically absent in schools with weaker relationships with families or a less positive school culture. However, even schools with strong practices may struggle if they serve communities facing deep socioeconomic hardship.
Ultimately, we don’t view chronic absenteeism as an issue of student motivation or family values. Rather, we see it as an issue related to the unequal conditions that shape students’ lives.
Does punishing absent kids or their parents work?
Many schools have suspended students for absences, or threatened their parents with fines or jail time. In some cases, families have lost social services due to their children’s chronic absenteeism.
Research shows these strategies are not only ineffective, they can make the problem worse.
For example, we found that when schools respond with punishment instead of support, they often alienate the very students and families who are already struggling to stay connected. Harsh responses can deepen mistrust between families and schools. When absences are treated as a personal failing caused by a lack of motivation or irresponsibility rather than symptoms of deeper challenges, students and parents may disengage further.
Instead, educators might ask: What’s getting in the way of consistent attendance, and how can we help? That shift from blame to understanding can help improve attendance.
What can policymakers, school districts and community organizations do to reduce chronic absenteeism?
Chronic absenteeism is a societal issue, not just a school problem. In other words, we need to recognize that chronic absenteeism is not a problem that schools can solve alone. While educators work to improve conditions within schools, policymakers and community leaders can take responsibility for the broader factors that influence attendance.
This could look like investing more resources and fostering collaboration across sectors such as health care, housing, transportation and social services to better support students and their families. Community organizations can play a role too, offering wraparound services such as mental health care, access to transportation, and after-school programming, all of which can support families. In the meantime, educators can focus on what they can control: strengthening communication with families, building supportive relationships and helping families connect with existing services that can remove attendance barriers.

(Frank van Manen/USGS)Here we go again.
The internet is abuzz with claims that animals are fleeing Yellowstone National Park and suggesting that the bears, elk and other creatures know something about Yellowstone’s volcanic system that humans don’t.
Hogwash.
The nonsense seems to have started on July 10, when a social media post suggested that “hundreds” of mountain lions were leaving Yellowstone National Park, heading south — never mind that there are only about 40 of those animals in the entire park. The video showed cougars walking on a snowy paved road, which is obviously not how Yellowstone looks in July.
A few days later, the rumors went into overdrive when the same account shared a video of bears walking past a few cars — the claim was, once again, that they were leaving Yellowstone. The animals were hugely fat and not behaving as they would in the wild, and the landscape and vegetation looked nothing like Yellowstone. Internet sleuths eventually traced the location of the video to a drive-through wildlife park in South Dakota.
Not that such inconsistencies mattered. Millions of people viewed the original post and the claims went viral, repeated and modified on numerous other platforms and made more and more fantastic and ominous. One post showed a herd of wildebeest crossing a river in Africa. It’s not clear if that post was trying to be sarcastic. Soon, even major media outlets were covering the “story,” and Yellowstone National Park staff members and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory Consortium scientists had to give interviews to counter the rumors.
The original post seems to have been a joke, but just like the children’s game of telephone, the more the story was retold, the more it was twisted.
The flames might have been fanned by this very Caldera Chronicles column, which on July 14, 2025, described the discovery of a new thermal feature in Norris Geyser Basin. That story, too, was picked up and reposted, but often with worrying overtones — for example, that scientists were supposedly “baffled” by the appearance of the new hot spring.
Maybe this is why all the bears were leaving Yellowstone? Except, of course, the spring at Norris Geyser Basin formed in December 2024, and several new features like that appear every year across the park — for example, the steaming vent near Nymph Lake between Norris Geyser Basin and Mammoth Hot Springs that formed in August 2024.
The myth that animals are leaving Yellowstone is nothing new. This rumor comes up every year or two, and sometimes, as in 2025, it grows to ridiculous proportions.

In 2014, an employee of a Yellowstone nonprofit organization filmed several bison running along a road and posted it online — he thought it was a fun video and not at all abnormal, given that bison are always running around Yellowstone National Park. But the video took on a life of its own, and it was reposted by people claiming the bison were running away from the park, even though they were actually running toward the park’s interior.
More than two weeks after the 2014 video was filmed, a M4.8 earthquake occurred near Norris Geyser Basin — the strongest earthquake in the region since 1975. This caused a further surge in claims that animals were running away, with some suggesting that the video of bison running was filmed after the earthquake because a volcanic eruption was imminent.

The speculation became so widespread that Yellowstone National Park put out a “rumor control” video explaining that, in fact, animals were not stampeding away from the park.
Earlier in 2025 a social media site known for satirical content showed a doctored photo of dozens of bears sitting on a road, supposedly in Yellowstone, and saying that the animals were blocking the entrances. Some bears were even carrying crudely drawn signs. Most people got the joke, but misleading reposts of the story caused concern among some who thought the animals knew something we didn’t.
Because of its incredible natural history and environment, Yellowstone can inspire our imagination. Where else but America’s first national park could you take in a view shaped by massive volcanic eruptions and featuring some of the country’s most iconic wildlife?
Perhaps, then, it is not a surprise that fantastic stories sometimes accompany this fantastic landscape. But the next time you hear that animals are, once again, fleeing Yellowstone in droves, we would suggest a healthy dose of skepticism. At least until those bears with signs learn to write more legibly, anyway.

A recently signed New Hampshire law will require doctors to follow patients’ wishes with regard to voluntary sterilization. (Photo by Getty Images)New Hampshire has become the first state to require doctors and medical staff to sterilize patients who request it.
The measure focuses on adults who have medical conditions for which sterilization may be a treatment option. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed the bipartisan bill into law on July 15.
The law says physicians can’t deny sterilization based on a patient’s age, number of children, marital status, or if the physician has views on fertility that run contrary to the patient’s wishes.
It’s the first law of its kind. And it comes at a time when state legislators across the country have enacted laws restricting women’s reproductive choices.
“A doctor should not withhold your needed treatment because the doctor doesn’t like the idea that you decided not to have kids or don’t want any more kids,” New Hampshire Democratic state Rep. Ellen Read, who sponsored the bill, said earlier this month during a panel at the National Foundation for Women Legislators.
Her cosponsors included two Democrats and two Republicans.
Read said her own medical experience led her to sponsor the bill. She was diagnosed at 26 with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that can cause painful periods, infertility, ovarian cysts and an increased risk of other diseases, such as diabetes. As Read’s health worsened over the years, she said, her doctors continued pushing her to wait to get a hysterectomy, in case she wanted a child in the future, even though she and her husband — who had already gotten a vasectomy — had decided they didn’t want children.
Sterilization, or permanent contraception, is the most common method of contraception among U.S. women of reproductive age, and it’s one of the most straightforward surgical procedures an OB-GYN can perform, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
In women this is a tubal ligation, where the fallopian tubes are closed off or removed; in men it is a vasectomy, where a portion of the tube that carries sperm is removed. A hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, also renders a woman sterile.
But in the United States, sterilization has a fraught history. Vulnerable groups have been sterilized without their knowledge or consent, including people with disabilities, Indigenous women and Black women. In the past, many have been sterilized as the result of state laws.
Meanwhile, others who desire sterilization have been unable to access it. One survey of 1,800 obstetrician-gynecologists found that while most OB-GYNs said they would help a patient obtain a tubal ligation, up to 70% would try to dissuade her, depending on characteristics such as how many children she had or whether her husband agreed.
Surgical sterilization rates among women have increased since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturned the constitutional right to abortion, according to a study published last September by researchers at Columbia University.

When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs law that directs state funds to private school tuition

“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.

 States without programs face rollout decisions without clear federal guidance, advocates say

As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Administrative costs for Idaho’s private school tax credit rise to $675,000

Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.










If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.


– Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution


The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
 What do these programs look like across the country?

FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
New national school voucher program included in ‘big, beautiful’ law, with no cap on cost

Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

(Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Momentum is building for a special session of the Missouri Legislature to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts with the aim of gaining a seat for Republicans.
Democrats will fight it, but a united Republican majority with more than two-thirds of the seats in both chambers can force it through if they wish.
Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, speaking Friday on KSSZ-93.9 in Columbia, said it is “likely” that lawmakers will be called in. She was in Jefferson City for discussions about a special session, but she had seen no map proposals and was unsure on the timing.
She first heard that President Donald Trump was urging Republicans to redistrict the state from discussion of social media posts by Republican members of Congress, O’Laughlin said.
“Lots of things run downhill,” O’Laughlin said. “So I thought, ‘well, this will be ending up in our neighborhood here before long.’ And it has.”
Gov. Mike Kehoe would need to convene a special session. His office did not respond to an email inquiry asking for comment on Friday.
In a little more than a week, the idea of redrawing Missouri’s congressional district lines has gained enough momentum to seem inevitable, House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said in an interview with The Independent.
Republican members are “gung-ho,” she said, while Democrats are looking for ways to derail it. The chances of that are slim, she added.
“I’m kind of just waiting, I suppose, but I fully expect it to happen,” Aune said. “Everyone I’ve talked to, especially on my side of the aisle, expects to go down and get steamrolled on the issue during a special session.”

Missouri has eight seats in the U.S. House, six held by Republicans and two held by Democrats — the same total and partisan division it has had since a seat was lost after the 2010 census. Of the eight members, only U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, a St. Louis County Republican, has won with less than 60% support in the two elections since the maps were redrawn to reflect the 2020 census.
Wagner represents the 2nd District, which has portions of St. Louis, St. Charles and adjacent counties.
The target for Republicans is the 5th District, held since 2005 by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat. He won his two most recent elections with 61% in 2022 and 60% last year. The two adjacent districts, the 4th and the 6th, are held by Republican U.S. Reps. Mark Alford and Sam Graves, who each received more than 70% of the vote for the past two elections.
A major hurdle for any special session on redistricting is that it will have a purely partisan intent, to gain an advantage for the Republican Party. This year saw a major break between Republicans and Democrats in the state Senate when partisan priorities were slammed through with a motion, rarely used in the upper chamber, to shut off debate.
The previous question, or PQ, was invoked to overturn the voter-passed initiative providing minimum standards for paid sick leave at most businesses and to send voters a constitutional amendment repealing the abortion rights measure approved in November.
It would almost certainly have to be used again to bring a redistricting bill to a vote because, otherwise, Democrats could use the rules that put no limit on how long a member can hold the floor to block it.
After the Senate adjourned at the regular session, Democrats vowed to punish Republicans by clogging up the chamber so little work can be accomplished as a way to prevent a repetition. State Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat, forced Republicans to bring 17 senators from their homes in late May for what was supposed to be a largely ceremonial day of final paperwork from the session.
A truce of sorts prevailed in the Senate during a special session in June that approved stadium financing for professional sports teams and aid to storm victims in St. Louis. 
A redistricting special session would 
 “The point is to discourage future PQs and get us back on track to functioning and working together,” Webber said. “The more times that the process is abused, probably the stronger the correction has to be, which would mean that, for a larger correction, you need more consequence, more intervention.”
Some Republicans aren’t enthusiastic about redistricting now. The only time Missouri lawmakers have revised maps between census-determined allocations was in the 1960s following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that districts must be nearly equal in population.
State Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, in 2022 was an enthusiastic supporter of drawing a map that made it likely Republicans would win seven of the state’s seats. He’s not sure he wants to vote for a bill to do that now.
“I started thinking about, what if the tables were turned and the Democrats had the majority?” Moon said. “If we’re honest with ourselves, I would say that we would not want the tables turned the other way. And you won’t get many people to say that publicly.”
The other danger, House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins of Bowling Green said, is that voters the GOP takes for granted may not be so firm.
“I don’t know that a 7-1 map ever existed,” Perkins said. “I think a 7-1 map is easily a 5-3 map in a year that doesn’t go the way that conservatives want it to go.”
State Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, said that is not something that worries him. Schroer, the leader of the Missouri Freedom Caucus, said he wants to change district lines on the eastern side of the state as well, to put all of St. Charles County into the 2nd District with portions of St. Louis County. 
But cutting off discussion won’t make next year worse, he said.
“It’s politics. You’re going to have fighting no matter what. You’re going to have some strange moments,” Schroer said. “But look, the use of the PQ is not a new thing. I mean, it comes and goes. It’s like a roller coaster.”
Texas lawmakers are in special session looking at redrawing districts in that state to give Republicans an additional five seats. Democratic governors in California, Illinois and New Jersey have suggested they would do the same in response.
 Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins of Bowing Green speaks during debate Feb. 11 on his bill exempting capital gains from the state income tax (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
If Missouri Democrats are upset about a new redistricting plan at home, they should also be saying Democratic states shouldn’t do it, either, Perkins said.
“To someone on the left, your fury and outrage needs to be directed equally to Illinois and California for doing the same thing,” Perkins said
Vice President J.D. Vance, in a social media post, attacked the way California is currently drawn.
“The gerrymander in California is outrageous. Of their 52 congressional districts, 9 of them are Republican. That means 17 percent of their delegation is Republican when Republicans regularly win 40 percent of the vote in that state,” Vance wrote. “How can this possibly be allowed?”
In the November election, no Democrat running statewide received less than 37.9% of the vote, and Democrats hold 25% of the U.S. House seats, which would fall to 12.5% if the 5th District became Republican.
Vance’s criticism of California could be applied to Missouri, Perkins said.
“Do I think that it’s ethical to be the same across the board, to have your opinion applied the same to all things?,” he said. “Yeah, I think it probably is right.”
With Republicans holding a slim majority in the U.S. House, Republicans at the state level have a responsibility to their voters to do what they can to shore it up, Schroer said.
“It’d be a disservice to them to not revisit this issue to see if we can make the manual cleaver spot a competitive seat,” Schroer said.
O’Laughlin, in the radio interview, said she understands the criticism from Democrats.
“The biggest concern that people have, first of all, is that the Senate doesn’t like to do something out of the ordinary like that, because it’s viewed as just not listening to the other side, not working with other people,” O’Laughlin said. “And I understand why they would feel that way.”
But with Democratic states preparing to redistrict, she said, Republicans need to rally to protect the Trump presidency and what they view as its achievements.
If Kehoe issues the call, Democrats intend to paint him as Trump’s puppet.
“I don’t think anybody that I’m aware of was talking about redrawing maps in the middle of the census until Trump started pushing it,” Webber said.
In a video shared on social media by the Missouri Democratic Party, Webber bluntly assessed the push for redistricting as a distraction from the biggest issue plaguing the president right now, the demands from his supporters to release files on child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
“This entire thing is to make sure there (are) not investigations into the Epstein files,” Webber said. “Because if you’re a pedophile that raped kids on Epstein island, the biggest winner of this would be those people.”
Aune, who said Moon’s comments give her a small hope Republicans will resist Trump’s demands, said Kehoe’s actions will show who he is.
“Who needs a governor,” Aune said, “and even who needs a Republican super-majority legislature, when we have daddy Trump in the White House pulling the strings?”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/012424_olaughlin1-1024x713.jpg,,,2025-08-02 06:56:32.988249

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)To me, our government has become more and more out of step with the general public every year. At both the federal and state levels, legislatures are passing laws that face big public opposition while ignoring policies that have supermajority public support. 
If our government is supposed to reflect the will of the people, it’s clearly failing.
Our plurality elections are a big reason for this failure. Even though it’s all we’ve really used in Kansas, plurality is not benign or neutral. I believe it actually harms most voters. It works to shut out those who are in the opposition. It also harms voters in safe districts by denying them a voice. Their representative has been chosen long before any votes have been cast. Plurality elections are also very easy to gerrymander, as we see in each redistricting cycle.
Is this the best way to choose our representatives? To minimize the number of votes that actually make a difference? I understand why some may support plurality if they believe it best advances their interests, but I like to think that most people agree that the current way of doing things is fundamentally unfair.
One’s opinion on a voting system is a moral choice as much as it can be a strategic one. This is why I advocate for proportional representation in our elections. Such a system allocates seats by vote share, so parties will still gain seats in districts where they are in the minority. This does a better job of electing bodies that reflect the priorities of the entire electorate, and not only the whims of one group. If the goal of our government is to give all voters an equal voice, then proportional representation will get us much closer to that ideal than plurality.
Of course, there are high barriers to passing election reform. The largest beneficiaries of plurality are our elected officials and their donors. Even if they don’t explicitly say it, they have a great motivation to keep things the way they are. I can understand why representatives in safe districts wouldn’t want more competition for their seats, but I also think that it says a lot about their character that they’d rather benefit from a broken system than use their power to fix it.
There are some politicians who support reform, but they are in the minority. In Kansas, former Republican state Sen. John Doll is one such supporter. In the 2023 session, he introduced Senate Bill 202. This bill would have allowed proportional representation in our state using ranked ballots, but it died without a hearing. His party colleagues then went on to ban ranked ballots this year so local governments couldn’t adopt that reform themselves.
With these barriers in mind, I went looking for historical examples of election reform to understand how they succeeded. In our original Kansas constitution, the state House was apportioned such that every county had a minimum of one seat. By the 1950s, a report by professor C. Stewart Boertman of Emporia State showed that this created a massive malapportionment between the rural and urban areas.
From the report: “For Greeley county one representative represents 1,966 persons; for Sedgwick one representative represents 85,620 persons. Thus, if Greeley county receives one member for about 2,000 persons, Sedgwick should have approximately 128 representatives.”
Today, our state House seats are apportioned into districts of roughly equal population. I wish I could share an uplifting story in which our representatives put aside their self-interest and came together to pass a constitutional amendment, but that’s not what happened. It was the U.S. Supreme Court’s “one person, one vote” rulings in the 1960s that first forced the state to reapportion the House by population.
That isn’t to say that there was no advocacy for reform, as there certainly was. Most notably, the Hutchinson News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1965 for its years-long campaign “to bring about more equitable reapportionment of the Kansas Legislature, despite powerful opposition in its own community”. When the Legislature finally got around to amending our constitution to align with the ruling, voters easily approved the measure.
Does this mean we’d need to wait for another favorable Supreme Court ruling for further election reform? Thankfully, no. Ordinary people still have the agency to make this change happen. Canadian political scientist Dennis Pilon found that significant election reform in western countries most often happens as a result of multi-party agreements. The motivations for this agreement could be different – some parties may want reform as it aligns with their principles, while others may see it as a hedge against a total loss of power.
If proportional representation becomes a reality, it would come from popular support for the issue. It would come by elevating politicians who support reform and drive their parties to adopt the policy as a plank in their platform. It would come from sustained advocacy from the media and grassroots organizations.
The moment for reform might come when those who currently work to maintain the status quo end up getting burned by plurality’s failings. As political scientist Lee Drutman suggests, if Elon Musk’s America Party spoils a handful of Congressional elections in 2026 then that could create more of an appetite for reform at the national level. Or perhaps the proposed mid-decade gerrymander by Republicans backfires and leads to them losing seats overall. Whatever the case, proportional representation must be part of the conversation when that moment comes.

Shown is the downtown Lincoln campus of Southeast Community College. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)The U.S. bioeconomy is driven by access to domestic feedstocks and our ability to successfully convert those feedstocks into the manufactured goods that we use every day. America’s heartland is a rich source of these feedstocks — including corn, soybeans, and sugar beets — that can be used by bioindustrial manufacturers to realize the promise of the bioeconomy.
Specifically, Nebraska has abundant natural resources and a strong, capable, resilient, workforce. Gov. Jim Pillen has said, “The biobased economy is gigantic for the future. It’s [Nebraska’s] Silicon Valley.”
While the U.S. tries to reach its full potential of this bioeconomy, many factors have fallen into place that could allow Nebraska to emerge as a leader, including political support, government and private sector funding and workforce development. Growing the bioeconomy is a state priority, and Lincoln-based Southeast Community College (SCC) is working to help meet the current and future demands of our state.
SCC serves a primarily rural 15-county area in southeast Nebraska, including the future home of Citroniq Chemicals’ decarbonized plastics production facility, the largest in the world. To ensure our workforce is adequately prepared, SCC in 2021 launched a new biotechnology program featuring three stackable credentials to prepare the next generation of skilled technicians to work in the industry.
Students acquire industry-relevant skills, along with the knowledge of how to work in a regulated environment. Twice a year, industry professionals provide input on the most relevant skills they hope new employees hold — to ensure that graduates fit industry needs. Furthermore, SCC’s programs ensure that agreements are in place and that courses remain transferable to 4-year institutions, so that education opportunities can extend beyond a 2-year degree for those who want them.
Another key priority has been to ensure that a full pipeline has been built from middle school through graduate school, resulting in key partnerships with educational institutions and industry partners.
One success has been the development of an industry-relevant citizen science research project that links dog genetics to attachment behavior. SCC’s industry partner Neogen runs an animal genomics facility, also located in Lincoln, and many graduates of this program have gone on to lead successful careers at the site.
Furthermore, middle and high school teachers have been trained in summer workshops onsite at Neogen. During the school year, teachers are supported with equipment, materials and in-person assistance as they incorporate the research project into their classes. Career awareness helps expose teachers and students to the breadth of careers available in the bioeconomy. From the network of over 40 teachers trained, many are interested in adding more biotechnology to their current courses, as well as dual credit biotechnology courses. SCC is working to expand our capabilities and this network of teachers.
Collaborating with industry partners in the development of relevant curriculum is also a feature of SCC’s work. In partnership with Bluestem Biosciences and their recently funded BioMADE project to scale up production of bioacrylates, SCC is creating a module of related bioindustrial manufacturing curriculum. This will include study materials, assignments, and assessments designed to expand resources for community college programs in bioindustrial manufacturing.
This initiative supports Bluestem’s commitment to leveraging existing bioethanol assets in the Midwest, which includes cultivating workforce talent. The curriculum will provide an engaging introduction to fermentation and purification of organic acids, life cycle assessment and environmental justice.
It will also be crafted to resonate with Gen Z and Gen Alpha students and to align with best practices in educational content creation. The approach fits with BioMADE’s efforts to equip the next generation of technicians, engineers, entrepreneurs and plant operators.
Lastly, SCC has partnered with trade organization Bio Nebraska in its Fermentation Collaborative that seeks to increase collaboration between industry and educational institutions to improve opportunities for seamless work between 2- and 4-year institutions and raise awareness of the usefulness of precision fermentation. These collaborations have led to more connections with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, allowing for more opportunities for SCC students to engage in summer research and improved transfer opportunities.
Collectively, this work demonstrates the important role of community colleges in ensuring industry needs are met in the short term while also facilitating long-term partnerships that lead to future gains for a trained workforce. There are opportunities to participate in STEM careers at all education levels. Together, this will bring bio-based solutions to global problems.
Misty Wehling is a biology instructor at Southeast Community College, where she also co-chairs the biotechnology program. She led a team at SCC focused on meeting the workforce needs of Nebraska’s bioscience industry.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska lawmakers prepare to convene back at the Alaska State Capitol on Saturday for a special session, on the agenda for lawmakers is a vote on whether to override a veto by Gov. Mike Dunleavy of a portion of the state budget.
If the veto is overridden, the Legislature would provide more than $50.6 million for K-12 schools this year. 
The vote comes just weeks before the start of the school year, and many Alaska school officials say the funding is essential for education, from managing class sizes, to hiring or keeping teachers and staff, academic and enrichment programs, as well as maintaining stability for students.
Fairbanks North Star Borough School District Superintendent Luke Meinert called the impacts of “chronic underfunding” devastating for the district’s more than 12,000 students. “In the last five years, we’ve closed seven schools, reduced administrative staffing by 25% and eliminated more than 250 positions in our district,” he said. “These aren’t just numbers. These are real people who spend time with our students every day.”
For Fairbanks, the governor’s budget veto represented a $2.5 million shortfall in June, following months of grappling with a $16.5 million deficit, and cuts and closures of three schools this year. 
Meinert called for adequate funding for schools that keeps up with the costs of inflation.

“Instead, we’ve been forced to make painful cut after painful cut, classrooms are more crowded than ever. Support services are reduced, and many students have lost access to critical programs that once supported them,” he said. “These cuts are not a sign of inefficiencies, they’re symptoms of a system in crisis.” 
Meinert joined a group of superintendents, education advocates and students on the steps of the Capitol in Juneau on Friday to urge legislators to vote “yes” on the veto override on Saturday, and funding a $700 increase in per student funding for schools. 
Siena Farr, a rising senior at Juneau-Douglas High School: Yadaa.at Kalé, spoke about her experience last year when Juneau’s two high schools combining into just one, doubling class sizes and straining teachers. “In my first week of school, my AP US History class had 50 students,” she said, which would have violated fire safety limits. “This ultimately led to 10 students willingly devaluing their education and switching to a less challenging class. … Increased funding would mean more teachers to teach high demand classes and cover for other teachers who might need it.”

Ida Meyer, a recent high school graduate in Juneau, said the increasing cost burden on students ultimately leaves some out. “When students have to constantly fundraise and pay out of their own pockets to be able to participate and travel for sports and activities or even buy school supplies that were once paid for by school funding, the equity of education has been left behind, along with the students that are unable to participate and reap the benefits of school activities,” she said.
Dunleavy issued budget vetoes in June, axing $200 per student from the base student allocation, which is the core of the state’s funding formula. This reduced the annual increase to a $500 per student, which was less than a one-time boost last year. The governor cited declining state revenues, as well his position that his priorities for education policy changes should be enacted ahead of more state funding. 
On Friday, Dunleavy issued a statement calling the Legislature’s lack of attention on his policy changes “a shame.” He repeated his criticism of providing more funding without more progress on education outcomes. “Instead, the public discourse is all about money. They say if we only spent more of it, the scores would improve. That is the same excuse that has been made for decades. As soon as more money is approved, the special interest groups and unions get very quiet.”
After the governor’s veto, the amount of public-school funding through the base student allocation is 5.6% less than it was last year, a year-over-year funding cut, according to the Legislative Finance Division. That is due to the loss of the one-time funding.
The governor’s veto represented a $1.4 million loss in funding for Juneau schools and its more than 3,800 students, according to the district, roughly equal to the cost of employing 12 teachers. But district officials had budgeted for a $400 base student allocation increase, so were safeguarded against further cuts.
In an interview on Monday, Juneau School District Superintendent Frank Hauser said he supports the veto override, and noted that even a $700 per student increase does not cover Alaska schools’ costs of inflation. “What a lot of people don’t realize is, well, that’s one of the most significant increases to the base student allocation that public education has received since 2011. It’s still a cut from what was received as one-time funding the previous year,” he said. “Public education funding is not keeping up with inflationary pressures across the state.”
If funding is restored, Hauser said it will go toward classrooms. “It’s going to support, potentially, reducing the pupil-teacher ratio. It’s going to provide maybe those elective programs. Some school districts weren’t able to hire a music teacher or an art teacher, or some other language teacher. That is funding that will go directly to supporting students.”
Hauser added that hiring new teachers or previously laid-off teachers back this time of year is difficult. “The hiring season is December to February,” he said. “So you just don’t have the staff or the potential applicant pool.”
Kuspuk School District Superintendent Madeline Aguillard emphasized her district’s need for school building repairs and major maintenance, which has received national attention, as the Legislature and Dunleavy have approved minimal funding for maintenance.
“No school district should have to choose between replacing a 10-year-old curriculum or repairing fire sprinklers to keep schools safe. But that’s the impossible choice districts are facing every day because the state has failed to meet its constitutional obligation over the last 25 years,” she said. 
This year, the Legislature passed about $40 million for school maintenance and construction, about 5% of the nearly $800 million that districts say they need to operate safely. Dunleavy vetoed nearly $28 million. Aguillard says it forces rural districts to draw from base student allocation funding meant for classrooms. “When the governor’s budget is consistently zero for maintenance, and what little funding the Legislature secures gets vetoed, then crumbling schools become the norm, not the exception,” she said. “We’re now forced to pull from the BSA to make major repairs.”
It’s unclear whether the Legislature will take up a veto override vote on school maintenance funding on Saturday. 
The Anchorage School District is the state’s largest by population, serving more than 43,000 students. For the district, the governor’s veto represents $4.3 million. Earlier this year, the Anchorage district reduced its budget by $30 million in salaries, benefits and services, and cut 42 staff positions. 
In an interview on July 18, Superintendent Jharrett Bryantt said if the funding is restored, it would go toward a major priority for the district: lowering class sizes. 
“When I talk to families, they say that the best thing we can do for their kid is to lower their class sizes,” he said. “But the state has to remember, you can’t lower class size if your teachers don’t trust your state to fund their salaries. And salaries should only be funded from the base student allocation. You can’t fund that with a block grant. You can’t fund that with a promise, and you certainly can’t fund that with all of the negativity that we’ve been seeing from the state to date.”
Bryantt emphasized that the back and forth between the Legislature and Dunleavy on school funding, with vetoes and override votes over the last several months, has been challenging. “So I just want the legislators to understand how trust has been extremely eroded by state leaders,” Bryantt said. “And this is their moment to make it right. This is their moment to tell the governor, once again, that this is where our community stands on this issue.”
For the Valdez School District, Superintendent Jason Weber said the district was able to balance its budget this year, with some cuts and reserve funding, despite an unexpected $300,000 insurance premium increase. In an interview Friday, he said if the veto is overridden, he sees those funds going toward future costs. 
“Unfortunately, inflation will eat right back in, whether it’s employee salaries going up, which they are, you know, where we’re bound by negotiated agreements, as well as … rising cost of utilities and insurance,” he said.
“So even if we’re on fiscally this year, we will be off fiscally next year already, just because those costs escalations are beyond our control.”

Philip Chad Wilson was sentenced to a 99-year sentence after his conviction and argued that  under subsequent rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court and the Alaska Court of Appeals, his sentence was illegal because it amounted to a de facto sentence of life without parole.
On Friday, the Alaska Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that rejected his argument, noting that Wilson could receive discretionary parole by the time he turns 50 years old.
Alaska’s parole board granted only about one-third of requests for discretionary parole last year, and Wilson had argued that the parole board’s approval rate is so low that it doesn’t amount to a meaningful opportunity for release.
In 2020 and 2021, the appeals court approved fewer than one in five requests for discretionary parole. Those rates were significantly lower than historical standards; during the administrations of former Govs. Sean Parnell and Bill Walker, the parole board approved more than half of all discretionary parole requests each year.
“We conclude that Wilson’s challenges to the Alaska Parole Board’s procedures are premature because he has not yet gone through a parole hearing. And we hold that 33 years of incarceration is not a de facto life sentence,” wrote Judge Timothy Terrell, an appointee of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, on behalf of the court. 
In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment prohibits courts from sentencing children to life in prison without the possibility of parole, except in homicide cases.
Two years ago, the state appeals court ruled that the Alaska Constitution imposes further limits on top of those provided by the U.S. Constitution.
In that case, which involved a 14-year-old girl who pleaded no contest to three murders, the appeals court found that any sentence “that (requires) a juvenile offender to serve 45 years or more in prison before any type of parole release qualifies as a de facto life sentence.”
In Wilson’s case, a superior court judge ruled that because Wilson could receive parole after 33 years, his appeal fails the appeals court’s test.
Writing Friday, the appeals court said that multiple state supreme courts and legislatures have allowed children to be sentenced to 33 years or more in prison before parole. Wilson’s sentence is not unusual in that regard, it wrote.
With regard to the parole board’s performance, the court wrote, “Wilson’s statistics showing that the Board has granted parole to a minority of applicants in recent years does not prevent the Board from granting parole to any given applicant.”
Writing an amendment to the ruling, Terrell added that if the parole board were to postpone a parole hearing for Wilson and for similar child offenders, it “would be legally problematic … because this may extend their sentence to a length that could make it a de facto sentence of life without parole. I assume that the Parole Board will give full consideration to the applications of such offenders when they first apply for discretionary parole.”

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Aug. 28, 1963
As galling as it has been to watch a Jacksonville sheriff’s deputy break a car window and punch a non-combative man in the face, the feeble justification from the sheriff and a determination from the state attorney that cops did nothing wrong is just as infuriating.
The Feb. 19 videotape of an encounter with William McNeil, Jr. and a posse of rogue officers from the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, and their brutal response, is a searing reminder of everything wrong with policing in America.
These officers appear to have forgotten that they are supposed to “protect and serve” the communities they police. Rather than being respectful in their dealings with members of the community, too many times, those in uniform operate as if the people work for them. Because of their mindset, they operate as an occupying force that has to subdue a hostile populace.
In a recent press conference held to react to a videotape that captured the police assault of McNeil, Sheriff T.K. Waters was defensive. He refused to condemn his officers’ egregious behavior and, in a move right out of the victim-blaming handbook, had the temerity to question why McNeil released the video five months after the incident and concluded that he intended to inflame the public.
Waters was probably embarrassed because his men look like neanderthals who escalated a situation for no reason other than to show who was in control. I’m glad that the confrontation did not end with McNeil shot, injured, maybe dying on the street, because a cop “feared for his life.” This happens much more frequently than we are willing to admit.
 Troubled relationship
The relationship between African Americans and law enforcement has always been fraught with suspicion and hostility. America has never come to terms with policing’s slave origins and racially troubling past, their earlier role in controlling the movements of enslaved African Americans and the current role of monitoring the movements and activities of Black people, the poor, and working class.
The American Bar Association discusses the deep ties between chattel slavery and American law enforcement.
“American policing has deep historical roots in the system of slavery, with early forms of law enforcement in the Southern states, known as slave patrols, established to control enslaved populations and maintain the institution of slavery. These patrols were authorized to enforce slave codes, apprehend escaped slaves, and suppress potential revolts, using methods of terror and violence.
Waters claims there’s more to the story than the cellphone video that went viral. The sheriff warned against “a rush to judgment,” but McNeil’s lawyers, famed civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump and Harry Daniels, said the video captures a clear and compelling case of police brutality.
“He didn’t do anything but suffered tremendously. He suffered very significant injuries, including memory loss and closed head injuries,” said Daniels. “We’re seeking justice and legal redress. We’re planning on filing a lawsuit and doing everything to achieve justice in this matter.
“The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office is unhinged. We’re pursuing all actions to achieve accountability and responsibility for what these rogue cops did.”
Daniels told News4JAX that McNeil’s injuries included a chipped tooth and concussion, adding that he needed stitches.
“This is one of these days that we have echoed over and over that the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office is out of control. This is not a one-off. This is a systematic continuum of assault on folk in Jacksonville,”
 ‘Things we need to look at’
The police report of the traffic stop said McNeil was ‘verbally combative’ and reached towards a knife that was in the vehicle. Waters said McNeil was charged with resisting an officer without violence, driving on a suspended license, and possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana.
When asked by a reporter about the first punch that a cop standing by the door threw, Waters said it wasn’t a sucker punch.
“I’m not excusing it administratively. There are things we need to look at. The context of this video should tell you everything you need to know. It is what it is,” Waters said during the press conference. The video “provides a lot of information to the public. You’re not allowed to resist a police officer when he’s doing his lawful duties. It’s necessary to get you under control and take you into custody.”
According to ABC News, “in the video, officers with the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office say they pulled McNeil over because the vehicle’s headlights were not on. McNeil questioned the traffic stop because it wasn’t raining and it was still light outside.
“An officer, who cannot be seen in the video, is heard saying, ‘It doesn’t matter, you’re still required to have headlights on.’ An officer asks McNeil to step out of the car, and when McNeil asks for the officer’s supervisor, another officer punches the driver’s window until it shatters. The officer then punches McNeil in the head before unlocking the vehicle door, unbuckling his seatbelt and forcibly removing him from the driver’s seat.
“Once out of the vehicle, multiple officers then gather around McNeil. One officer is seen grabbing McNeil’s head and punching him in the chin before forcing him to the ground.
 Unenviable task
Daniels wrote in a news release on Sunday that this incident is “only the latest in a long line of excessive force incidents involving the JSO.”
“In September 2023, the department was the focus of a national outcry after a video of JSO officers violently beating 24-year-old Le’Keian Woods while he was unarmed went viral,” Daniels explained. “In 2019, JSO officers faced a federal lawsuit for killing 22-year-old Jamee Johnson after pulling him over for an alleged seat belt violation,” the attorney said.
It’s clear that if there were no video, Sheriff Waters would have leaned on the fact that an internal “investigation” cleared the officers involved.
Waters explained that he was “aware of a video circulating on social media showing a traffic stop represented to be from February 19, 2025. … We have launched an internal investigation into it and the circumstances surrounding this incident. We hold our officers to the highest standards and are committed to thoroughly determining exactly what occurred.”
Yeah, right.
Waters, police brass, and civic leaders have the unenviable task of rebuilding public trust. But we shouldn’t hold our breaths because we’ve seen this before. There is a critical need for oversight by the public and civil society to investigate and prosecute cases of racial profiling and widespread abuses of power including use of excessive force, brutalizing protesters, bystanders, and others exercising their constitutional right to free speech and dissent.
But that is not happening.
 Clear and present danger
Law enforcement in the 18,000 police departments and across history in America has proven to be a clear and present danger to African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and other non-white people. Given DeSantis’ his record, and past comments, Floridians shouldn’t be holding their breath for him to use the considerable power entrusted in him to attempt to level the playing field and hold law enforcement more accountable.
Asking law enforcement to police itself is like inviting wolves into the henhouse. It never ends well.
I interviewed retired Seattle Washington Police Chief Norm Stamper, a fierce critic of modern American policing, and he was clear about what’s needed.
Stamper argues that what the United States needs is to “reimagine a public safety system that has armed professionals working with citizens.”
“There is a way of imagining and constructing a system with a commitment to genuine partners — the community and elected officials,” he said. “We need to see it as a 50-50 partnership. Others who have a stake would help create a new system with [police] unions ceding and sharing power.”
That reform includes bringing an end to racial profiling, excessive force, police brutality, corruption, and other law enforcement problems.
The epidemic of police violence in this country is not an issue of “bad apples.” Modern policing is rotten at its core. This must change now. Real change will come when we make meaningful changes to how police are funded.
Stamper, author of two books on good policing, has been a persistent and vocal critic of existing police tactics and the way departments interact with Black communities. “The entire criminal justice system and policing is broken,” he said.
 ‘Tainted and toxic’
Stamper describes America’s police departments as “tainted and toxic,” institution, saying the way officers act is a function not just of the culture, but also the power they wield, which makes them feel as if they can do what they want with no consequences. It is that attitude — and the deadly consequences particularly for African Americans — that has so angered protesters.
“It’s an arrogance that afflicts too many officers,” he said. “It causes them to believe that they’re above the law. What we’re facing from institutions in Seattle, San Diego, the NYPD, is an undercurrent of racism and abusive practices that lead to excessive force, lethal force, and sexual predation.”
Stamper said resistance from police unions and rank-and-file officers has hampered the radical restructuring of public safety.
“The public safety mechanism must be reliable, effective, and aligned constitutionally. I think that we must have the capacity to fight violent crimes, but we have to hold individuals accountable,” he said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1920px-Jacksonville_Florida_2382086928-1024x417.jpg,,,2025-08-02 00:56:12.959301

A small coastal community in Kivalina, Alaska sued several major oil and gas companies, including Exxon Mobil, in 2008. Local representatives argued that greenhouse gas emissions from these companies were contributing to the erosion of the coastline and causing irreversible damage to their village by heating the climate.
But the U.S. Court of Appeals dismissed the claim, citing a lack of evidence linking the corporate emissions with coastal erosion.
In France, 2024, climate campaigners filed a criminal complaint against the major shareholders and the board of directors of TotalEnergies. They alleged that fossil fuels extracted by the company produced emissions that caused floods and storms that damaged property and irreversibly depleted biodiversity.
Despite acknowledging damage related to climate change generally, the Parisian criminal court also dismissed the case. Again, it said there was insufficient evidence to link the activities of TotalEnergies and damage from extreme weather.
Between 2008 and 2024, significant advances were made in climate science that enable us to understand how specific activities affect the climate, and contribute to wildfires, extreme heat and flash floods. The science linking these disasters to fossil fuel giants remains insufficient in the eyes of courts, however.
That’s because climate attribution science generally fails to meet the necessary standard of legal evidence to assign liability. For example, a recent advisory opinion published by the International Court of Justice acknowledged that states have a responsibility to address climate change, and that it is possible to establish a link between a state’s wrongful acts or omissions and the damage resulting from climate change. Despite this, claimants still sometimes fail to prove such a link in court.
However, a new study has demonstrated a computer model that can reduce scientific uncertainty around linking emissions from a particular source to outcomes related to climate change. This end-to-end attribution model, as it is called, could strengthen legal claims against entities damaging the climate.
Tracing emissions to damages
The end-to-end attribution model uses a three-step process to assign liability for climate damage.
First, using historical emissions data from online databases such as Carbon Major, the model simulates two scenarios: one with all historical emissions (the real world), and the other where the emissions from a particular company are excluded. The difference in emissions between these two scenarios is then paired with the concomitant increase in the global temperature, which shows how much warming can be directly attributed to that company.
Using statistical methods, the model can then connect the relevant global temperature increase to changes in the intensity of heatwaves in a particular region. It could, for instance, calculate how much hotter the five hottest days of the year have become in a given year because of the company’s emissions.
The model estimates the economic impact of these intensified heatwaves. It can do this using data on the consequences of reduced productivity and crop losses for growth, for example. It calculates how much money a region lost because of the heatwaves linked to the company’s emissions and gives a dollar value for the damages.
By combining these three steps, the model traces the path from a company’s emissions to specific economic losses, theoretically making it possible to hold emitters financially accountable for climate damages.
In doing so, the study estimated that emissions from Chevron alone caused between US$791 billion (£589 billion) and US$3.6 trillion (£2.7 trillion) in heat-related economic losses globally between 1991 and 2020, and that without emissions from 111 large oil, gas and coal producers (collectively referred to as “carbon majors”) such as ExxonMobil, BP, Saudi Aramco and Gazprom, the global economy would be US$28 trillion richer.
The advantages for claimants
Climate court cases in which claimants seek to assign liability to oil and gas companies are on the rise worldwide.
About 230 lawsuits have been filed against fossil fuel giants and trade associations since 2015. More than two-thirds of these were filed between 2020 and 2024, and many are awaiting a final decision. For such cases, end-to-end attribution could be helpful.
End-to-end attribution can assist claimants in meeting the commonly used “but for” test, by demonstrating that, but for a specific company’s emissions, certain climate-related damages would not have occurred. The method can also meet other liability tests. One is called proportional liability, and it attempts to quantify the extent to which a company’s emissions contributed to increased risk or the severity of damage. This flexibility strengthens the method’s applicability across different legal systems.
The end-to-end attribution method enables claimants to connect global warming to local disasters, such as the 2021 Pacific Northwest “heat dome”. This is crucial, as climate litigation focused on single, high-impact events is usually more successful.
It is well established that emissions from companies in the U.S. and Europe have caused significant harm which is disproportionately suffered in the global south. End-to-end attribution strengthens the evidence base for such climate justice arguments in courtrooms.
There are no established standards for how courts worldwide evaluate scientific evidence. Consequently, while the end-to-end attribution method can link fossil fuel companies and climate-related legal injuries, the courts, depending on differences between jurisdictions and the context of each case, may require higher thresholds to trigger criminal or civil liability.
Additionally, fossil fuel companies often argue that any harm caused by their activities should be weighed against the benefits their products also provide. However, the benefits of fossil fuels should not exempt companies from climate-related liability, because climate change is an existential threat.
End-to-end attribution provides a vital scientific tool for making fossil fuel companies accountable, and could reshape climate litigation globally.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court has expanded the scope of a Louisiana redistricting case that could weaken key provisions of the landmark Voting Rights Act. 
In a brief order released Friday afternoon, the court reframed the appeal in Callais v. Louisiana, a lawsuit that non-Black voters filed against the state over the creation of a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House. The justices intend to look at whether a state violates the U.S. Constitution when it seeks to remedy a violation of the Voting Rights Act. 
In the order, the court asked parties to the case to answer “Whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.” 
The 14th Amendment, in part, covers representation in Congress, and the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race.   
If the justices determine Louisiana violated the constitution with its latest congressional map, it could undermine the Voting Rights Act. The legislation was approved in 1965 to bolster the protections granted in the 14th and 15th Amendments. It has been amended five times since then to strengthen its provisions, though voting rights advocates note federal court rulings over the past decade have chipped away at the law.

At question in the Callais case is Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group.  
John Bisognano, president of the National Redistricting Foundation, a voting rights organization, said courts have never ruled there is a conflict between the Constitution and Section 2. The Supreme Court upheld Section 2 in its 2022 decision in Allen v. Milligan, the Alabama case that required lawmakers there to add a second majority-Black congressional district. 
“To comply with that law, Louisiana must have a congressional map that includes two Black opportunity districts,” Bisognano said in a statement. “If the Court decides to now undo that precedent, it would be a head-spinning reversal of itself.”
Bringing the Voting Rights Act into question makes the case among the most important the court will rule on in its upcoming term. The decision could have nationwide implications, as it could set the standard for the degree to which race can be considered during the election map-drawing process that must occur after each decennial census. 
In June, the Supreme Court punted a ruling in the Callais case, indicating it needed to hear additional arguments before reaching its decision. The rare move came with little explanation and essentially meant a new congressional map, if ultimately necessary, would not be in place until the 2028 election, when the 2030 census count would be underway. 
The court has given Louisiana until Aug. 27 to file a response to their question. White plaintiffs challenging the map will have until Sept. 17 to respond. 
Friday’s announcement complicated an already long and winding process in Louisiana that began with the 2020 census, which state lawmakers used in 2022 to redraw the state’s congressional districts. The original map, which did not add a Black district in Louisiana despite the state’s Black population increasing, was found to be unconstitutional, leading state lawmakers to redo the boundaries in 2024. 
The 2024 redistricting special session, called by Gov. Jeff Landry in his first days in office, brought together a set of strange bedfellows: Black Democrats, who wanted more minority representation; and white Republicans, who used the opportunity to unseat 6th District U.S. Rep. Garret Graves, who fell out of favor with fellow Republicans at home and in Washington, D.C. 
To unseat Graves, Republicans had to draw a map that complied with fewer traditional redistricting principles, creating district lines that run from Shreveport to Baton Rouge, slashing down the center of the state and veering to pick up clusters of Black voters along the way. 
During oral arguments in March, Chief Justice John Roberts described Louisiana’s 6th District as a “snake” and raised concerns it might violate the compactness standard typically expected in voting districts. 
In spring 2024, an appellate panel of three federal judges — one appointed by former President Bill Clinton and two by President Donald Trump — found the new lines for the 6th Congressional District were illegal, though it was allowed to be used for the 2024 election. They ruled the boundaries had been drawn based on race, rejecting the state’s argument that politics drove its boundaries. 
Black voters and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund preferred the map with the more condensed, northeast Louisiana-based district. Some of those Black voters have intervened as plaintiffs in the Callais case.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The author of the new map, state Sen. Glen Womack, R-Harrisonburg, was explicit during the 2024 redistricting special session that protecting U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R–Start, who sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Shreveport, and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, was his objective. 
Notably left off his list was Graves, who had ruffled feathers at home and in D.C. because he was widely viewed as insufficiently supportive of Scalise’s failed bid for U.S. House speaker. Graves also endorsed Stephen Waguespack, one of Landry’s opponents in the 2023 governor’s race, potentially putting him crosswise with a powerful incoming governor whose interests drove the special session. 
The appellate court panel disagreed that GOP politics was the driving force behind the map’s lines. 
“Given the slim majority Republicans hold in the United States House of Representatives, even if such personal or intra-party animosity did or does exist, it is difficult to fathom that Louisiana Republicans would intentionally concede a seat to a Democratic candidate on those bases,” a footnote from the majority opinion reads. 
“The Court finds that … District 6 does not satisfy the ‘geographically compact’ and ‘reasonably configured’ Gingles requirement,” the opinion continues.
The Gingles test arose from a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that set standards for determining whether election districts meet federal standards.

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Citing “credible allegations of fraud” and “exponential growth in spending,” the Department of Human Services asked the federal government for assistance in terminating a state  housing program, according to a letter signed by DHS Temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi and released Friday.
The end of the Housing Stabilization Services program — which resides under the umbrella of the federal-state Medicaid program — comes after Gov. Tim Walz on Monday said his administration halted payments to 50 of the largest providers. Federal investigators say the program has become the source of a massive fraud scheme.
Gandhi’s letter to the federal Centers for Medicaid and CHIP Services notes that “the DHS Office of Inspector General has suspended payment to 77 housing stabilization providers this year based on credible allegations of fraud.”
Earlier this month, the FBI raided five Minnesota businesses that have received millions in Medicaid money for services they didn’t provide, according to unsealed search warrants. The Housing Stabilization Services program is intended to help older adults and people with disabilities find and maintain housing.
Since its inception, the program’s growth has exploded. The Star Tribune reported recently that when the bill creating the program passed in 2017, analysts expected the cost to be  $2.6 million a year, but by 2024, the cost was $107 million. Meanwhile, DHS data showed more than 700 companies were paid for services in 2024.
Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson told KSTP recently that the “vast majority” of the Housing Stabilization Services program is fraudulent.
KARE 11 first reported on the program’s flaws last month, including widespread reports of payment for no actual services to people in need.
The failure of the program — in concert with the hundreds of millions lost via other programs — is sure to become political fodder, especially should Walz run for a third term.
Thompson said recently that when his current investigations are finished, fraud in programs administered by Minnesota could exceed $1 billion, stemming from a pandemic-era food aid program known as Feeding Our Future, the state’s autism program and rapidly increasing sums allegedly pilfered from other Medicaid programs.
Thompson says the problem is systemic.
“This fraud crisis didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s the result of widespread failure across nearly every level of leadership in Minnesota: Politicians who turned a blind eye. Agencies that failed to act. Prosecutors and law enforcement who didn’t push hard enough. Reporters who ignored the story. Community leaders who stayed silent,” he told the Star Tribune recently. “And a public that wanted to believe it couldn’t happen here.”
Walz will argue he took decisive action once evidence of fraud began to emerge in the housing stabilization program.
In the wake of the Feeding Our Future scandal, Walz and his administration faced years of criticism for being slow to act despite red flags about the program.
Even when the state Department Department of Education — which administered the food aid progam — sought to stop payment to some suspicious vendors, however, they sued the department and won in court.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3114-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 20:56:13.717626

The American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska announced Friday that it had filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against federal and local immigration authorities on behalf of a single mother arrested during the June 10 Glenn Valley Foods raid.

Maria Reynosa Jacinto remains in a North Platte jail despite an Omaha-based immigration judge ruling on July 15 that she could be released on a $9,000 bond. 
The lawsuit challenges her prolonged detention.
 “There is no due process when the government, who lost the argument in court, gets to do what they want anyway,” the ACLU wrote.
 Stolen IDs alleged

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. They’ve said repeatedly that the focus from the raid should be on U.S. citizen “victims” whose identities were allegedly stolen by undocumented immigrants to work at the Glenn Valley plant.
The Guatemalan worker’s 19-year-old daughter Andrea Rafael Reynosa is a U.S. citizen. The ACLU says the mother had been working in the U.S. for 20 years, has no criminal convictions and was her family’s primary earner.

Prairielands Freedom Fund tried posting the bond money on Reynosa Jacinto’s behalf, but learned that ICE officials had issued an automatic stay of her release. That blocked her from getting released on bond while her legal team works on building the case for her to stay in the U.S.
ACLU Nebraska argues that the automatic stay unlawfully violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and goes beyond ICE authority by overriding the judge’s decision on bond, making the judge’s determination that there was no danger or flight risk “meaningless.”
 Trump administration policy change

ACLU officials linked the automatic stay to new “interim guidance” issued by the Trump administration July 8, which asserts that nearly all detained immigrants in removal proceedings are ineligible for release on bond. The new no-bond practice is the subject of a class action lawsuit filed earlier this week by ACLU’s national organization and other immigrant rights advocates.
ACLU officials believe the practice is a tactic to drag out detention to the point that unauthorized immigrants choose to leave the country, basically deporting themselves.

ICE has said the change in approach “closes a loophole to our nation’s security” that the Biden administration and others had based on what it describes as an “inaccurate interpretation” of federal law. 
The July 8 memo was key to an earlier and similar ICE attempt to keep a different Glenn Valley worker behind bars after a judge had granted him a $10,000 bond. That man ultimately was released on the bond, also provided by Prairielands, but only after the ACLU stepped in and an ICE official reportedly admitted having made an “oversight.” 
ACLU representatives said that ICE in that case, unlike in Reynosa Jacinto’s situation, failed to file the automatic stay paperwork.
Jennifer Houlden, acting legal director at ACLU Nebraska, said the automatic stay provision was used for decades previously “only in the rarest of cases.”

“It halts an immigration court judge’s bond order instantly without any reason particular to the person and without any opportunity for them to be heard on the issue,” she said. 
Houlden said that everyone has a right to due process under the law, including immigrants.
“The use of an automatic stay in situations like our client’s clearly violates that right,” she said.
Reynosa Jacinto’s lawsuit seeks a court order for her release on bond, or that immigration authorities demonstrate that her continued detention is lawful.
About 23 others detained in the June 10 Glenn Valley raid also remain in custody at the North Platte jail. More than 70 workers in all were apprehended. Some have been removed from the country and others are out on bond, ICE has said.
Mindy Rush Chipman, ACLU executive director, said the no-bond situation is more broadly impacting ICE detainees in Nebraska and across the nation.
“It’s affecting Nebraskans from all over the state no matter how they were intercepted and detained initially,” she said, adding that the ACLU likely will be filing more lawsuits. 
In a statement provided by the ACLU, the worker’s daughter said the period since her mom’s June 10 arrest is the longest they’ve been apart.
“It’s just us two and she’s always been there for me, working hard to provide a better life for us both,” said Rafael Reynosa. “It really makes me emotional that she’s still where she is and I’m here by myself even though she should have been out weeks ago.”
  “I was in shock when my mom was detained,” Andrea Rafael Reynosa, 19, says of Maria Reynosa Jacint0. (Courtesy of American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska)

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on July 31.
Lamoille County’s new affordable housing nonprofit has spent the last seven months settling into its new role as some towns look for assistance in addressing the ongoing housing crisis.
Downstreet Housing and Community Development, the Washington County-based nonprofit has taken over an array of affordable housing properties previously overseen by Lamoille Housing Partnership in Cambridge, Johnson, Morrisville and Stowe, even as the full merger of the organizations is not yet completed.
The merger should be finalized in September, according to Downstreet executive director Angie Harbin. In anticipation of the resolution, the organization has added three seats to its board.
Even as the nonprofit sets up in the county, the need for its services have grown.
“Just like the entire state, Lamoille County needs more affordable housing,” Harbin said. “There’s probably not a community in Vermont right now where that’s not true.”
A statewide housing assessment conducted by the Vermont Housing Finance Agency published earlier this year said that 13% of the county’s rental stock was built with public funding, and 6% of that rental housing is available with income-sensitive rental assistance. That same report identified a third of Lamoille County occupied households as cost-burdened, where residents use more than 30% of their annual household income on housing.
Though no specific projects have been announced, towns particularly eager to expand or replace their affordable housing, like Johnson and Stowe, have begun identifying Downstreet as a potential partner in that effort.
Part of the incentive for the merger, outside of the leadership vacuum at Lamoille Housing Partnership, was Downstreet’s size — roughly double the Partnership — and thus capacity to access more federal funding and expand faster.
In Stowe, where committees are exploring potential solutions to the lack of accessible housing, town officials identified Downstreet as a potential partner that could operate and administer housing through a a community trust fund, according to a recently published housing needs assessment.
In Johnson, DEW Construction has proposed a project like the one it oversees in Barre by coordinating with Downstreet on the grant-funded construction of housing on town-owned land. The nonprofit and builder could potentially build a mix of housing types, including single-family, owner-occupied and mixed-use rentals.
The town is hoping to potentially move quickly to take advantage of $67 million in community development funds recently announced by the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, which are intended to assist communities hardest hit by the July 2023 flood. “A majority of funding will be focused on creating new housing units outside of flood plains and supporting infrastructure in the identified regions,” according to an agency press release.
“Not only are we operating existing affordable housing in Lamoille County but also making sure that we have the capacity to continue to develop there,” Harbin, the Downstreet executive director, said, noting that the group is currently exploring some properties in Johnson. “We are really committed to making sure that there’s at least one housing project that’s utilizing that (block grant) funding. We’re generally exploring real estate development opportunities in Lamoille County.”
Downstreet, like other affordable housing developers, is attempting to balance demand and funding. The Vermont Housing and Conservation Board is no longer replete with pandemic-era money, and there is now a great deal of uncertainty around federal funds amid the disruption of the Trump administration.
“We were seeing pretty significant cuts at the state level, because there has been so much Covid-era funding that was winding down, so we’re already looking at far fewer affordable housing projects developed across the state, and then there’s the federal funding,” Harbin said. “We don’t have a clear idea what’s going to happen or what’s going to be cut as at this point.”
Evictions avoided
The transfer of properties from the Lamoille Housing Partnership portfolio hasn’t been without its share of hiccups, particularly for a Jeffersonville property with a history of management issues.
Last October, just as Downstreet was about to take over management of the building, the Mann’s Meadow senior housing apartment complex was beset by a disabled elevator, stranding some of the less mobile residents on the upper floors of the building. At the time, Harbin requested patience as the nonprofit assessed each property and its maintenance needs.
Several residents at Mann’s Meadow recently received “notice to terminate tenancy” letters and warnings despite not owing any back rent. The notice was concerning enough to tenants that they reached out to the Cambridge Selectboard for help.
By the time selectboard members could inquire about the issue, according to a discussion at the board’s July 15 meeting, it had already been resolved. Downstreet had received incomplete information from the building’s former property management company, according to Harbin.
The former company abruptly ended its property management services at Mann’s Meadow, and transitioning to a new property management system quickly proved tricky.
“It’s a very alarming (notification) to receive, and we also weren’t aware that the previous property management company wasn’t using this type of notification, because it is typical all over the state,” Harbin said. “All of that has been straightened out, which is great, and we’ve been leasing up units right now, some at a bit of a clip, as we’ve been turning them over, getting them ready to lease up and then moving new folks in.”

Activists argue that immigration officials are using new tactics by moving detainees beyond traditional public access routes into the airport.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have begun quietly moving detainees through a nonpublic side entrance at the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, according to activists. The new tactic, activists say, bypasses public scrutiny and calls into question previous statements airport officials have made regarding their involvement in transfers.
Activists, who have been monitoring the airport for months and argue that ICE is carrying out illegal transfers of immigrant detainees, told VTDigger they observed ICE officials escorting a group of people through a side door early Thursday morning.  
A video taken by activists and shared with VTDigger shows a white 15-passenger van parked around 3:30 a.m. Thursday at a side entrance of the airport that appeared to lead to the security screening area. An unidentified man in a gray shirt at the back of the van is seen holding out both his hands and telling two activists, “Y’all need to stay right there.”
Unidentified people can also be seen walking through a heavy metal doorway.

Julie Macuga, a Burlington resident and activist who has helped surveil the airport, and Leif Taranta, a second activist, attempted to get information from the people moving inside the airport before they disappeared into the building, along with the man in the gray shirt. 
The video then shows the activists walking inside the airport to find that a metal gate closed off the Transportation Security Administration security screening area.
The activists said ICE’s 3:30 a.m. arrival was earlier than usual and before TSA opened for the day. It’s the second time in less than a week they’ve witnessed ICE officials move detainees through a side entrance, according to videos and emails the activists shared with VTDigger. 
Airport security later told the activists that they were aware of the activity, and that the people they had seen go through the door included ICE agents, one video showed.

Activists confront ICE agents using side door at Burlington airport in Vermont
An additional video reviewed by VTDigger, taken on July 25, shows unidentified men in masks moving people from a white van parked behind a BTV airport truck through a different side door and directly into the airport’s TSA security checkpoint line.
In response to criticism about the large number of detainees passing through the Burlington airport, airport officials have suggested in previous meetings and interviews that they don’t know when ICE transfers happen and that they have little interaction with the agency.
“We don’t get advised. We don’t get any communication,” said Nic Longo, the airport’s director of aviation, at a recent airport commission meeting. 
In an email response to VTDigger’s questions, David Carman, deputy director of aviation at the airport, said the use of the side door does not represent a change in airport policies. 
“Airport staff do not get involved with assisting with ICE/DHS detainee movements, nor does the airport have any communication with ICE on when or how the movements are taking place,” Carman said in the email. 
For years, federal law enforcement agencies “have had access to the secure areas of the airport for the purpose of law enforcement and supporting other federal law enforcement agencies,” he said. 
“Any actions pertaining to ICE detainee movements and how they bring detainees to the post-TSA checkpoint public spaces of the airport (where passengers board aircraft) are federal law enforcement and DHS decisions, and completely outside the purview of the airport,” he added. 
But activists say the apparent use of a nonpublic side door represents a change in the way ICE agents are using the airport. 
When pressed by activists at a recent airport commission meeting, Longo said airport staff have pushed back against ICE when agents parked in areas where parking wasn’t allowed — nearly towing the vehicles in some cases. At the time, Longo said the airport’s goal was to treat the agents like other law enforcement officials or members of the public. 
Almost two weeks later, Longo said it’s extremely rare for airport staff to interact with ICE, but because the airport receives federal grant funding through the Federal Aviation Administration, it was obligated to cooperate with the federal government.
Longo told VTDigger that airport officials allow ICE to transport detainees through the airport because it’s a public use facility, and he can’t pick or choose federal agencies or members of the public who can use the facility. 

A police officer in Burlington tells activists he won’t ask ICE officials questions
“Our obligation is to cooperate and not impede U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” Longo told VTDigger on July 15. 
When asked about federal agents using the side door at the Burlington airport, James Covington, a spokesperson for ICE’s Boston field office, told VTDigger that “ICE Boston does not wish to comment on security protocols.”
‘They’re in the custody of government agents’
One of the videos taken Thursday shows advocates going to the closed airport police office, which the Burlington Police Department operates, according to Carman. They called the airport police number and told the responder they had witnessed people being in through a side door. 
“I’m aware of what you’re referring to and those people have been identified as ICE agents,” the police officer responded. 
Taranta asked if police had reviewed legal documents. 
“I know that as police you’re allowed to ask them for documentation that the transport itself is legal,” Taranta said.
“Yeah I have no reason to ask them for that,” the officer said.
“So the fact that there have been past illegal transfers doesn’t make you as an airport security make you think you should ask that this one is legal?” Taranta asked. 
“Nope, I’m not doing that,” the officer said. “I’m aware of what’s going on here. I’m confident that they are who they say they are.” 
“Are you sure the detainees are legally being taken from this country?” Macuga asked. 
“They’re in the custody of government agents,” the officer said. 
Macuga told him that wasn’t an answer. 
“Well it is,” the officer said. “I’m not going to debate this any further with you. I’ve got other stuff going on.”
The Burlington Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.

‘I have to do my job right now’
ICE detentions and deportations have skyrocketed under the second Trump administration, with more than 36,700 people booked into ICE detention in June, and more than 56,800 held in ICE custody as of July 13, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization housed at New York’s Syracuse University. 
A study by the loose group of activists, which includes Macuga and Taranta, showed roughly 450 people detained by federal law enforcement in immigration cases have been transferred through Vermont’s largest airport since January.
The videos shared with VTDigger show the potential escalation by ICE officials in moving detainees beyond traditional public access routes into the airport to avoid detection as activists continue airport surveillance, according to Macuga.
The group of activists sent an email to the mayor’s office and Longo, Burlington airport aviation director, following the event. 
In the email, the group told officials that activists were in the public portion of the airport over the past week “as a stop gap measure while the airport and city improve their policies.” 
The mayor’s office did not respond to a request for comment. 
“We thought it was heading in a good direction,” Macuga said of prior conversations with city officials. “But then things really started to escalate in the past week to a point we haven’t seen the whole time we’ve been doing this work.”
Macuga said the activists’ work has led people across New England to reach out to them and that a network is forming of people who want to take on similar work at their own airports. 
They’ve also been training people to be bystander activists, including learning basic Spanish phrases. Over the last two weeks, someone in their advocacy network has stayed at the airport multiple days a week, Taranta said. 
“We want people to be safe, and to be told by TSA agents that investigating human trafficking in an airport is not their job is very chilling,” Taranta said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.)MADISON — Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and other Democratic governors said responding “in kind” to Republican mid-decade redistricting is necessary at a Friday Democratic Governors Association press conference.
Kelly said she thinks courts would rule that redrawn maps from Republicans and Democrats are unconstitutional. If Republicans take this path, however, Democratic governors must also pursue mid-decade redistricting to “protect the American people,” she said.
“It’s incumbent upon Democratic governors, if they have the opportunity, to respond in-kind,” Kelly said. “Things are bad enough in Washington right now. What it would look like if there’s even a greater majority that this President controls — God help the United States of America.”
Kelly and other Democratic governors were in Madison for the DGA’s summer policy conference. 
Discussion over redistricting ahead of midterm elections started in Texas, where President Donald Trump’s political team pressured state leaders to redraw its map to gain more seats in the U.S. House and help Republicans maintain their congressional majority in 2026. Trump said a “very simple redrawing” of the state’s maps could help pick up five seats. 
Redistricting, the process of redrawing state legislative and congressional district boundaries, typically happens every ten years after the U.S. Census. 
Other Republican-led states, including Florida and Ohio, also said they would look at redrawing their maps mid-decade.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was not at the press conference, was the first Democrat to float the idea of gerrymandering the Democratic state to have fewer Republican seats in response. Democrats in New York and Maryland have also been looking for a path to gain additional seats in their states as well. 
None of the governors at the press conference said they would pursue that route but said they supported those that had a path to use it. Kelly joked that she “could” do mid-decade redistricting. “But what would I do? I’d just give them another Republican.” 
Evers said the blatant direction from Trump to pursue redistricting is a “constant threat to our democracy.” 
“I’m really pissed frankly, and we’re going to do whatever we can do to stop this,” Evers said, adding that Wisconsin would not be changing its maps. He said the state has already worked hard to “get fair maps.”
The Republican-led Legislature and Evers adopted new maps for the state Legislature in 2024 following a state Supreme Court ruling. Some have been calling for new Congressional maps, though those efforts have so far been rejected by the state Supreme Court. 
Wisconsin’s current congressional maps were drawn in 2022 by Evers and selected by the state Supreme Court with a conservative majority at the time. Democrats and their allies filed a new challenge to the maps in Dane County Circuit Court in July, arguing they are unconstitutional because they’re anti-competitive. Republicans currently represent six of Wisconsin’s eight congressional districts. 
“Because of those fair [state legislative] maps that we had, we were able to pass a relatively bipartisan budget, and it was a good budget, and so, in my heart of hearts, this is where we have to be, but… when you have a gun up against your head, you gotta do something,” Evers said.
  “I’m really pissed quite frankly, and we’re going to do whatever we can do to stop this,” Gov. Tony Evers said about mid-decade redistricting. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)
“This move is unconstitutional. It’s again breaking the system. It’s, again, meant to game the system,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said. “Democrats are expected to have the decorum — we’re expected to protect the institutions, we’re expected to follow the rules on this.”
The times call for a different approach, however, he argued. 
“We’re not playing with a normal administration,” Walz said. “We’re playing with one that has thrown all the rules out of there… I think it is incumbent upon states that have the capacity or the ability to make sure that we are responding in kind.”
Governors criticize GOP over effects of the Republican megabill 
The Democratic governors also warned about the potential effects of Republicans’ federal reconciliation package. Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said government systems and programs being cut are not set up for states to operate on their own. 
“They were set up with the federal government as a very robust partner, and without them being a partner, there is no way that any of our states will be able to pick up the tail,” Kelly said. “The best we could do is perhaps mitigate the pain, but even that will be difficult.” 
The legislation, ” signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, made major changes to the federal Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Trump and Republicans in Congress are “trying to gut programs that Wisconsin families count on,” Evers said. “They’re willing to break our constitutional system to make that happen.” 
The megabill is just one tool, he suggested. “Whether it’s the Republican budget or the continued illegal action to fire Wisconsin workers, strip funds away from our state, damage public education, we have to fight.” 
A memo released this week by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau found that the exact effects of the federal reconciliation law on Medicaid and FoodShare in Wisconsin are uncertain, but will likely result in fewer enrollees.
Currently, about one in five Wisconsin residents rely on Medicaid for health care coverage. 
“The full impact of the Act’s Medicaid provisions on the state’s MA enrollment and costs remains uncertain,” the fiscal bureau memo states. “This is partly because some of the details of implementation requirements will depend upon forthcoming federal guidance, but also because the eligibility and enrollment requirements are new for the program and so little is known about their actual effects.” 
Starting in January 2027, childless adults will be required to complete 80 hours per month of paid work, school, employment training or community service per month to maintain their Medicaid eligibility. There are about 184,000 childless adults currently enrolled in Wisconsin. DHS estimates that 63,000 Wisconsinites will be at high risk of losing their coverage.
The LFB memo said that enrollment will likely drop due to the work requirement provisions. 
“Enrollment reductions could occur either because of the additional complexity of the application process or because the work requirements cause some individuals to increase their earnings to above the eligibility threshold. The magnitude of the program disenrollment, and associated reduction in [Medicaid] benefits costs, is uncertain,” the memo states. 
The governors warned that hospitals still face a difficult environment under the federal law. 
“Our rural hospitals in particular are extremely at risk,” Kelly of Kansas said. “We’ve already closed 10 of them in those 10 years and many more are on the brink, and this reconciliation bill is going to throw them over the edge.” 
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said 35 hospitals are at risk in his state, making it the state with the most hospitals at risk in the nation. 
“Donald Trump’s big ugly bill is the single worst, most devastating piece of legislation that I have seen in my lifetime. It is a direct attack on rural America,” Beshear said. 
Three hospitals in Wisconsin have been identified as at risk of closure. 
Costs for the SNAP program will increase in Wisconsin as the law reduces the federal share of the program — known as FoodShare in Wisconsin — from 50% to 25%. This will leave states responsible for 75% of the costs, a change that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services estimates will require an additional $51 million annually from the state. 
The FoodShare program currently helps nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites access food, and nearly 90,000 Wisconsinites will be at risk of losing their benefits due to the new federal provisions, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. 
Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee echoed concerns over the ability of the state  to pick up the gaps left by federal cuts in social programs.
“We’re not going to be able to absorb in funding what’s coming our way,” McKee said. “The taxpayers are going to pay for it in our states or the benefits are going to get reduced.” 
The law extends work requirements for SNAP recipients from the current top age of 54 to age 64. It narrows the work requirement exemption for caregivers and parents by changing the definition of “dependent child” from under 18 years of age to under 14, meaning that parents of 15- to 17-year-olds could now be required to have employment in return for their SNAP benefits. 
It provides an exception from work requirements for a married person responsible for a child under age 14 and residing with someone who complies with the work requirements. It also exempts individuals who are eligible for the Indian Health Services. 
“While Wisconsin just passed a Wisconsin budget that invests in our kids, cuts taxes for working families and supports our rural hospitals, Trump and Congressional Republicans are moving in just the opposite way,” Evers said. “Democratic governors aren’t going to just sit idly and watch it happen. When Trump tried to strip hospital funding, we moved real quickly to protect $1.5 billion dollars in health care funding for Wisconsin. When they threaten our schools, we stand up and fight back. When they attack programs that matter to working families, we find ways to fill the gaps.”
“Republican governors fall in line behind Trump’s agenda. Democratic governors are standing up for the people that we serve,” Evers said before mentioning 2026 elections. He said Wisconsinites will “make a choice about the future of our state when they elect our next governor. They’re going to choose a leader who will work together and expand health care, support working families and build an economy that works for everybody.”
Evers announced on July 24 that he would not be running for a third term in office, setting up the first open race for governor in Wisconsin since 2010.
“I know that [Evers’] leadership is not going to end just because the title might, and that he is going to be out there fighting for what he believes in moving into the future,” said Kentucky Gov Andy Beshear, who won’t be able to run for another term in 2027 due to term limits.
So far, Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez has announced her campaign, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley is planning on entering the race and other Democrats are still mulling a decision. There will likely be a crowded Democratic primary. Two Republicans have officially launched their campaigns for governor, while U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany has been teasing a run.

Weather stations across Vermont have reported higher than average — though not quite record-breaking — temperatures.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  You’re not imagining it: This summer is hot.","From Burlington to Bennington, Vermont is having a rather hot summer, according to National Weather Service data. 
The average high temperatures for June and July this year were above the 30-year average for at least four longstanding weather stations across the state: Burlington, Montpelier, St. Johnsbury and Bennington. 
To get a read on how the whole summer measures up, we’ll have to wait. The National Weather Service defines the “meteorological summer” as June, July and August.
It’s also been drier than average in Burlington, Montpelier and St. Johnsbury, although Bennington had more typical rainfall for June and July. 
None of those locations quite broke the record for average monthly temperature so far this year. But weather service meteorologist Matthew Clay said multiple one-day records were hit — like in Burlington on June 23, when the daily high hit a whopping 99 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Those instances are becoming more common. 
“If I could go and look at every record statement that we sent out for a year, the vast majority of those are going to be record highs compared to record lows,” he said. 
The Burlington weather station has records going back more than a century. They show that the city has experienced a gradual rise in the number of very hot days over the past 20 to 30 years. 
The weather service has also issued six heat advisories so far this summer, a reflection of the health and public safety dangers of extreme heat. But Clay said it was difficult to compare that with previous years because the weather service lowered its threshold for issuing advisories from 100 degrees to 95 degrees in 2018. 
Also, the weather service’s threshold for heat advisories is lower in Vermont than in hotter places in the country, in part because Vermonters may be less able to handle the heat when it arrives.
“If it’s your first 90-degree day right after 50-degree weather, your body’s not acclimated,” he said. 
There’s also fewer homes with air conditioning in this part of the country compared to, for example, Arizona, Clay noted. 
“We don’t have centralized air in a lot of places in New England, so we don’t have the ability to cool off like they do in the South, where the air conditioning is more prevalent,” he said. 
Emergency room visits for heat-related illnesses spiked the week of June 22, when temperatures rose in Burlington and elsewhere, according to the Vermont Department of Health. 
Heat-related illnesses have fluctuated year to year, but “rates have been trending upwards since 2003,” according to the health department website. The department also has recommendations on how to keep cool and prevent heat-related injuries on its website.  
The weather is expected to stay cooler — in the 70s and low 80s — over the weekend, but parts of the state could see temperatures rise to the mid-80s next week, according to weather service predictions. 
Clay said that heat does tend to come in “waves.” 
“Sometimes you have these warmer spells, you have cooler spells,” he said. “You can’t just say that it’s all related to one thing or another, but we are seeing that, overall, our temperatures are warming.”

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Board of Corrections shut down its live stream of its Friday meeting after a hacker twice began playing a racist video containing racial slurs and the Confederate flag, along with swastikas and sexual imagery.
Board of Corrections Chairman Benny Magness was irate over the hacks, standing from his seat and demanding staff cut off the individual playing the video. The online meeting room on Zoom was shut down, but later reopened — only for it to be interrupted again. The meeting room was then taken offline for the rest of the day-long meeting.
In a statement sent by Department of Corrections spokesperson Rand Champion, the board acknowledged the hack, calling it “unfortunate.”
“The Board wishes to convey an apology for those who were on the stream and were subjected to the content of the hack,” the emailed statement said. “It is a known issue affecting Zoom, and the Board will pursue other more secure options for future meetings.”
The hack was the loudest part of an otherwise hard-to-hear meeting, which was held at the Central Arkansas Community Corrections Center in Little Rock.
Another moment of contention came later in the meeting, when Department of Corrections Chief Financial Officer Chad Brown informed board members he had received invoices from an architecture firm for work on three projects he was not sure had been approved by the board.
“On the three projects, the cart was put before the horse,” Brown explained to the Advocate after the meeting. “We’re going to hold those over until the next board meeting” to look into “what went wrong.”
The projects are for roof repairs at the Wrightsville Unit, door controls at the Grimes and McPherson Units and fencing at the Pine Bluff Complex. The board opted not to vote on the invoices while DOC performs its review.
Board member Lona McCastlain expressed frustration about the unexpected invoices, noting that if the projects hadn’t been approved, then the firm shouldn’t have done the work it was invoicing for.
“I just really think this is a mess,” McCastlain said.
According to the invoices from Lockeby and Associates, the firm says DOC owes $13,125 for design work on the roof project, $40,500 for design work on the door control project and $16,406.25 for the fencing project.

Northfield Police Chief Pierre Gomez was dressed in his uniform and heading into the town office on Main Street on Tuesday morning, when he said he was accosted by a resident who “ranted and raved” at him using racist terms.
The man, whom Gomez later identified as Northfield resident Gary Allen Smith, proceeded to call him “boy,” “scumbag chief,” told him to “do your fucking job” and to “go back to Pennsylvania,” according to an audio recording of the encounter Gomez shared with VTDigger.
“He was cursing. He was getting in my face, pointing and referencing me as ‘boy’ several times,” said Gomez, a Black Latino man. 
He said he had never met the man before and did not provoke him.

Gomez said he encountered Smith in the vestibule of the office building, as Smith held the door open for him. Gomez said he thanked him but told him he was not exiting. 
That’s when the man yelled, “Get out of here,” he said.
Smith could not be contacted to comment for this story. Calls to phone numbers associated with someone with his name and age were not answered.
Scott Kerner, owner of the nearby Good Measure Pub and Brewery, said he was on his way to the bank next door when he witnessed the incident.
“I heard somebody yelling, and I looked up, and there was a guy with a tie-dye shirt yelling and pointing very close to Chief Gomez’s face in front of the town office,” he said. “It felt very threatening.”

Kerner said he walked up toward them because he was worried about the man’s tone and how aggressive he sounded. 
“I like Chief, and it just seemed like this guy was really out of hand,” Kerner said.
He said he heard the man call the chief “boy” and say “do your fucking job.” 
“The guy continued to yell at Chief, walked across Main Street yelling, then walked back and got back in his face and yelled at him again, all while I was standing right there,” Kerner said.
Through it all, he said, Gomez remained calm.
Trained in his past law enforcement work on how to react “as far as race-baiting is concerned,” Gomez said he was able to not react in a negative way. Although, as a person of color, he said he found the multiple “boy” comments racially charged.
Smith, who is 54 and was recorded as recently living in Northfield Falls, according to court documents, was convicted for assaulting a Northfield police officer in 2023.
Gomez said he reported the latest incident to Northfield Town Manager Jeff Schulz and others. Schulz said he is aware of the encounter and has the recording of the confrontation that occurred in front of the municipal building.
“The incident is very unfortunate and very disrespectful to the Chief,” he wrote in an email Wednesday. “Please note that as the Town Manager and a representative of the Town of Northfield, I strongly condemn all forms of racism and harassment.”
Mia Schultz, president of the Rutland Area NAACP, said Gomez has faced the everyday pressures that come with the job and has carried the weight of systemic racism since the day he arrived in Northfield. She said town leaders must publicly declare their support for the chief.
“Chief Gomez was verbally attacked in broad daylight,” Schultz wrote in an email. “He was repeatedly called ‘boy,’ a word with a long and violent history that has been used to strip Black and Brown men of their humanity and authority. This is not just a personnel matter. This is a moral failure.”
Merry Shernock, the co-chair of the Northfield Selectboard, has been the most vocal of the five board members — at the last meeting and via email — in her condemnation of the continued racism and harassment Gomez has faced.
“I have nothing except respect and admiration for Chief Gomez,” she wrote in an email this week, adding that the sentiment is shared by the majority of residents. She prefers not to pay attention to those who express hate, she wrote, “but I am aware, much to my dismay, that they are among us.”
The board has initiated an investigation related to Gomez that remains ongoing, she said. Schulz and Gomez said they are unable to discuss details of the investigation itself as it involves personnel issues, which fall under protected information.
Shernock said she has been charged with organizing the racial bias training that was started at the April 28 meeting by a member of the state Office of Racial Equity. She expects that training will resume in October. A Northfield resident has also requested community racial bias training, and she said she is hopeful she can look into it this fall.
While Schulz wrote he condemns racism and found the harassment Gomez faced this week “unfortunate,” the town manager has not responded to multiple rounds of emails from VTDigger asking if he explicitly supports the police chief and his work. 
A pattern of harassment
Originally from Pittsburgh and in law enforcement for about 20 years, Gomez, 58, was a Philadelphia police officer and, later, a detective in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office.
He was hired in September 2023 as chief of police in Northfield, a Washington County town of about 6,000 and home to Norwich University. Gomez told VTDigger he has faced multiple instances of harassment and discrimination in the overwhelmingly white town since he took the job in wake of former chief of police John Helfant retiring amid controversy in May 2023.
Vermont has had only three police chiefs of color — in Northfield, Montpelier and Brattleboro. Brian Peete became the capital’s first Black police chief in 2020 but left for a job in Kansas after two years. Norma Hardy has led the Brattleboro police department since 2021 and is the first Black woman police chief in Vermont.
Earlier this year, at an April 8 selectboard meeting — a YouTube recording of which now has 1,600 views —  Lynn Doney, a disgraced former selectboard member, took issue with Gomez wearing a gray hoodie on duty instead of his uniform: “so he looks like a police chief and not a gangster off the street that’s just driving our cruisers around,” Doney said.
On April 23, more than 60 residents packed the room at the following selectboard meeting, the majority in support of Gomez. Many of them denounced Doney’s racist remark at the earlier meeting and wore hoodies themselves in a show of solidarity.
Gomez said he sent a letter to Doney asking him to cease and desist from such personal attacks. “It is unlawful for an individual to make deliberate statements that intend to harm the reputation of another party without factual evidence or simply based upon hearsay,” the letter he shared read.
Doney did not respond to VTDigger’s requests for comment then or this week but responded to Gomez’s letter in April. The letter signed by Doney, shared by Gomez, reads, “I will not apology to you or anyone else as everything I have said is true.”
Since that incident, residents and racial justice leaders have pointed out that racism and retention issues are problems many predominantly white towns face when they hire people of color and urged Northfield officials to be better about calling out racism and in vocalizing support for the chief. 
“He’s an excellent leader for our town and I am well aware … of what he’s had to deal with here. So, you know, we support him,” Kerner said Thursday.

Starting Aug. 1, New York will offer free phone calls in state prisons, becoming the sixth state to do so — and the first to enact the policy without legislation. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)New York will offer free phone calls to people incarcerated in its state prisons starting Aug. 1, becoming the sixth state to do so. 
The change is projected to save roughly 30,000 families across the state an estimated $13.3 million per year in phone call fees, according to Worth Rises, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
New York joins California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons, though Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026. New York, however, is the first state to implement the change administratively, without any legislation.
Previously, incarcerated New Yorkers were charged $0.024 per minute for domestic calls under the state’s contract with Securus Technologies and received three free 15-minute calls per week, according to the department’s news release.
Cash assistance may curb recidivism among people leaving prison, study says

The new policy eliminates all charges for calls made from facility phones or tablets. The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will cover the costs through its operating budget and expects to spend $9 million this fiscal year.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The policy change also comes as the department continues to work to restore operations following a three-week correctional staff strike earlier this year, which has left thousands of officer positions unfilled and led to cutbacks in visitation, programming and recreation. Some facilities have extended officer shifts up to 12 hours and increased cell confinement to up to 20 hours a day.
“Understanding the value of family ties while in prison is crucial – not only for emotional support, but for improving an individual’s outcomes while incarcerated and when returning to society,” Daniel F. Martuscello III, the corrections department’s commissioner, said in a statement.
This latest initiative also aligns with the department’s goal of reducing New York’s recidivism rate to 17% by 2030. The state recently reported a historic low of 18.9%, according to the state corrections department’s news release.
The new phone policy also builds on other efforts to reduce financial strain on incarcerated people and their families. The department has increased the amount of “gate money” or money provided upon release from $40 to $200, eliminated work release program fees and expanded Wi-Fi access and secure messaging on tablets to improve communication beyond phone calls.
New York’s new policy change also comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing new rate caps for prison and jail phone calls. The rules, which passed unanimously last year under the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, aimed to significantly lower the cost of calls for incarcerated people.
Facilities that haven’t yet lowered their phone and video call rates — or that decide to roll back recent changes — can continue charging higher rates until at least April 2027. The FCC had approved rate caps of 6 cents per minute for phone calls in prisons and large jails, 16 cents per minute for video calls in prisons, and 11 cents per minute for video calls in large jails, though those rates may change again before the rules take effect.

Josh Shapiro visited Philadelphia’s Community Education Center on Aug. 1, 2025 to discuss funding for the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD)’s Violence Intervention and Prevention (VIP) program. (Commonwealth Media Services)As the calendar turned to August, the state budget in Pennsylvania is one month overdue. Gov. Josh Shapiro and leaders in the General Assembly have said they are continuing to make progress, but have not reached an agreement.
“We all understand the issues that need to be resolved in order to reach a final agreement,” Shapiro said to reporters in Philadelphia on Friday. “I think we’re working together respectfully to get that done.”
Shapiro said both sides know what the key issues are and it’s frustrating that they have yet to come to an agreement.
“But I also acknowledge that we’re working at a time where we not only have a divided legislature, we’ve got a lot of division in our society, and finding that common ground — that’s critically important,” Shapiro said. “It’s taken longer than I would like, but I think we’re going to get there and we understand the important issues that need to be resolved.”
On July 14, the Democratic-controlled state House advanced a $50.6 billion proposal to the GOP-led state Senate. Since then, House Democrats have maintained that it is up to the Senate for the next step in the process.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) wrote on social media on Wednesday, “We have different visions for the future of the Commonwealth, but we’re working together across the aisle to move this budget forward. Regardless of divided government or political philosophy, some of these issues are just extraordinarily complex & need to be done correctly.”
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) told Newstalk 103.7 FM on Friday that “it is moving very slowly,” but said the reason why leaders are saying it’s been positive is because “nothing has blown up to a point (that) sides aren’t talking yet.”
“The reason why this is so difficult is because the issues we’re talking about are so transformational in terms of our future, and the two sides simply see it so differently,” he added.
Topper said they want to work towards a compromise, but warned “if we don’t get some of the policy initiative changes in terms of parental empowerment and school choice reform, in terms of entitlement reform and benefit integrity, economic growth and changing our regulatory policy in Pennsylvania, then in three years, we’re going to be looking at either massive … cuts that will significantly affect a lot of people in their everyday lives, or a massive tax increase, which nobody’s going to want to see.”
One of the issues that has taken center stage during negotiations is funding for mass transit agencies, as service cuts and fare hikes loom the longer the impasse continues. In June, the House passed a transportation funding package that would provide nearly $300 million of new funding into mass transit and a half-billion dollars to repair roads and bridges.
Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny) said during an update on budget negotiations Friday that mass transit funding is “high” on the list of priorities.

“Our Senate Democratic Caucus stands ready with 23 votes to support Gov. Shapiro’s proposal with respect to mass transit funding for the whole commonwealth,” Costa said. 
Costa also highlighted funding for roads and bridges, education, and protecting social and human service programs as important.
At least two Republicans in the Senate would need to support funding for mass transit, even if every Democrat voted for the package.
On Thursday evening, Pittman said, “Our state is faced with a structural deficit just like SEPTA. Along with the discussion of any additional dollars for mass transit, this reality necessitates meaningful reforms and accountability measures must be implemented to ensure the long-term success of mass transit.”
Shapiro told reporters on Friday he understands “how critically important” mass transit funding is for the state, noting that he proposed it twice in his budget and that he previously flexed federal highway funds in November to stave off immediate fare hikes and increases for SEPTA.
“We’re going to keep working at that issue,” Shapiro said.
Last week, three Republican Senators introduced a package of bills that would provide additional oversight and new accountability measures over SEPTA. However, the package did not include funding.
When asked if he supported the proposals, Shapiro said he wants to “make sure that we fund mass transit, and we will have a broader dialogue of other legislation that may or may not accompany that.”
“I’m not going to get into that here in this setting,” Shapiro said.
SEPTA has been placing signs at bus stops throughout the Philadelphia area warning riders that if funding does not come to the agency, service cuts will begin on Aug. 24. 
“If that person lives in Northeast Philadelphia, call Senator (Joe) Picozzi, who’s a Republican in the state Senate, and tell him to go back to Harrisburg and vote to pass transit funding the way the House Democrats did,” Shapiro said.
Picozzi, who is one of the GOP authors of the SEPTA accountability package, has said he supports funding mass transit. Following Shapiro’s comments, the Republican lawmaker told NBC Philadelphia that “the people of the Great Northeast want to see a better SEPTA. We want funding and accountability for results on fare evasion, safety and cleanliness.”
On Tuesday, Spotlight PA reported Pennsylvania Secretary of the Budget Uri Monson warned that the state wouldn’t be able to make at least $2.5 billion in payments to schools, counties, and others amid the ongoing budget impasse.

Topper criticized that move, claiming that he thought it was “premature for the governor to send that message out,” arguing the state treasurer “can release funds to those, if needed.”
“But at the end of the day, it’s my responsibility and others to ensure that this budget is sustainable and that we’re doing everything we can to get a quality product,” Topper said. “And if the governor wants to try and use some of these tactics to push for any kind of an agenda of his, then I’d like to know…what that agenda is, other than being on TikTok.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) also seemed to ramp up the criticism of Shapiro on Friday, telling the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that those letters are an effort to “just trying to get people all riled up.” She added “this is the biggest gaslighting administration I have ever worked with.”
Costa, the Democratic leader in the Senate, seemed to echo Shapiro’s sentiment saying that “we are moving slowly, slower than I would like of course, but I think at the end of the day, we’re making progress, and I think that’s what’s important for the people of Pennsylvania.”
Shapiro said there is one thing both sides can agree on.
“We all have to compromise, and that’s what we’re doing right now,” he said.

Cindy Holscher, a Johnson County Democrat seeking the party's nomination for governor in 2026, said staff in the administration of Gov. Laura Kelly attempted to pressure Democratic lawmakers into idling their campaigns for governor so a preferred candidate could prevail. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — State Sen. Cindy Holscher expressed frustration Friday with behind-the-scene involvement of Gov. Laura Kelly’s staff in attempting to influence who launched a campaign for the Kansas Democratic Party’s nomination for governor in 2026.
Holscher, who announced her bid for governor in June, said she was among three Democrats in the Kansas Senate told by the Kelly administration to stand aside so Democratic primary voters would be more likely to nominate Lawrence attorney Chris Mann in the race to determine who would be the party’s choice to replace the term-limited Kelly.
Holscher said she as well as Sens. Dinah Sykes and Ethan Corson, also of Johnson County, were initially discouraged from impeding Mann’s path in the August 2026 primary for governor.
“All three of us were told basically ‘do not run’ because Chris Mann’s the guy,” Holscher said. “Why are insiders picking candidates? We’re being bullied, essentially.”
After the dust cleared at the end of July, Mann had chosen to launch another campaign for attorney general after narrowly losing to Republican Kris Kobach in 2022. Corson and Holscher had declared their campaigns for governor. Kelly threw her support to Corson. Lt. Gov. David Toland, at one point the presumed frontrunner in a Democratic gubernatorial race, said he wouldn’t run. Sykes remained on the sideline.
Will Lawrence, Kelly’s chief of staff, said the two-term governor met with potential Democratic candidates for governor and offered advice on how each could approach the 2026 election cycle.
“No one told them, ‘You can’t run.’ They can make their own decisions,” Lawrence said. “There’s a lot of give and take in those conversations. It was never forceful. Cindy was the one that kept coming to the governor trying to get her support. The governor kept saying, ‘I’m not going to support you in the governor’s race if that’s what you choose to do.’ The governor was very clear about that.”
Lawrence said Kelly would prefer Democrats didn’t set the stage for grueling primary battles in statewide races.
 
‘Gone backward’
In an interview, Holscher said it was disappointing Lawrence had participated in an effort to essentially anoint a Democratic nominee for governor.
Holscher also asserted Lawrence attempted to leverage future political support from the governor to secure Holscher’s vote for a bill altering regulation of child care facilities and exemptions to vaccination mandates. Holscher said it was concerning that Lawrence wielded financial influence over Democratic campaigns by controlling the governor’s Middle of the Road political action committee.
“This whole situation is what frustrates Democrats,” Holscher said.
She said Democrats suffered under Republican supermajorities in the House and Senate. In the Senate, the GOP edge stands at 31-9 — the same mix as in 2018. The House GOP majority is 88-37, representing the addition of three Republican representatives since 2018.
“If you take a look, you know, we’ve had the governor’s office the past seven years. We haven’t advanced in terms of growing our numbers. We’ve gone backward,” she said.
Lawrence, who has held a leadership role with the governor’s $2.3 million PAC, made a push during the 2024 elections to alter the balance of power in the Legislature. The Republican supermajority was targeted by Democrats because the GOP’s numerical advantage made it easier to override Kelly’s vetoes. Outcome of the 2024 election was a disappointment for Democrats up and down the ballot, Lawrence said.
 
‘Extremely disappointing’
Holscher notified Lawrence in mid-June about her views on the Kelly administration’s involvement in the development of Democratic campaigns for governor. Holscher sent a text to Lawrence, obtained by Kansas Reflector, that included a warning that Holscher would “swiftly hand over all the proof I have to the press” of the governor’s intervention in Democratic campaigns.
“I am so done with the games coming from you and the governor’s office,” Holscher’s message to Lawrence said. “I want to be very clear about something.”
Holscher vowed she would go to the media if anyone affiliated with the Kelly administration “says anything negative about me or my candidacy,” attempted to interfere with Holscher’s hiring of campaign staff or in signing  up volunteers, “does so much as attempt to put a thumb on the scale in any way to interfere with this election” or made use of the Democratic Governors Association, which is led by Kelly, to “impede or negatively influence” her Democratic primary.
In the interview, Lawrence said language used by Holscher in the text could be interpreted as an attempt to intentionally gain something of value from Lawrence or Kelly against their will.
“It would be worthwhile for Cindy to take a look at the statute and reassess how she communicates with people,” Lawrence said. “Extremely disappointing behavior. Questionable behavior. Not someone who has gubernatorial temperament, who has to compromise and negotiate on things every day in this building.”
In a July social media post after Kelly embraced Corson’s candidacy for governor, Holscher offered an explanation as to why Kelly chose to support Corson.
Holscher wrote pressure had been applied by Lawrence regarding an upcoming vote during the 2025 session on House Bill 2045. It rolled back child care safety standards and tinkered with exemptions to vaccination mandates. Holscher voted against the bill, which passed the House and Senate with bipartisan votes and was signed into law by Kelly.
“I had received tons of emails from constituents adamantly opposed to the bill,” Holscher’s post said. “The gov and Will (her chief of staff), told me that if I didn’t support it, the governor’s office wouldn’t be supportive of me in future races. I wasn’t going to go against my district and the people I represent, so I voted ‘no.’ So, it looks like they are holding true to that threat.”
Lawrence said he didn’t agree with Holscher’s analysis of meetings the senator had with the governor about the legislation.
“That vote has nothing to do with the gubernatorial election,” Lawrence said.
 
‘Haven’t paid attention’
Holscher, elected to the House in 2016 and to the Senate in 2020, has been endorsed by former Lt. Gov. Lynn Rogers. He served in Kelly’s first term before appointed to the job of Kansas state treasurer in 2021.
Corson, who entered the Senate in 2021, said in an interview at the Capitol that he appreciated Kelly’s expression of support. It was helpful to voters because Kansans wanted the kind of bipartisan, moderate leadership delivered by Kelly since sworn into office in 2019, Corson said.
He said he hadn’t taken notice of social media chatter about Holscher’s claims of how the Kelly administration handled legislators who declined to fall into line with the governor.
“I just haven’t seen any of that,” Corson said. “I haven’t paid attention to it. We’ve been out there talking to folks and trying to meet people in real life.”
Candidates lined up to take part in the Kansas Republican Party’s campaign for governor included Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, Senate President Ty Masterson, Secretary of State Scott Schwab and former Gov.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources reported Friday that air quality in Iowa will be at levels “unhealthy for sensitive groups” through Saturday, due to smoke from wildfires in Canada. 
The National Ambient Air Quality Standards advise that fine particulate matter should not exceed averages of 35 micrograms per cubic meter in a 24-hour period. 
Air quality monitoring from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow site shows a majority of the state in conditions “unhealthy for sensitive groups” with fine particulate measurements above 40 micrograms per cubic meter. A north-central portion of the state was in unhealthy air quality conditions Friday afternoon, with concentrations greater than 50 micrograms per cubic meter.

DNR said while continuous monitors showed exceedances across most of the state beginning on Thursday, final particulate values will not be available until reference monitors have been manually weighed. 
Older adults, people with heart or lung disease, children and outdoor workers are considered sensitive to particulate matter and are advised to limit their intense outdoor activities. 
The department expects the smoky conditions will remain over Iowa until around midnight on Saturday, though some residual impacts may persist Sunday. 
This is not the first time smoke from Canadian wildfires this summer have drifted down to Iowa. The last significant instance occurred in early June.

(Kate Russell)On Friday afternoon, the New Mexico Department of Health announced that a child from another state had visited New Mexico while infected with measles and might have exposed other people at a few locations in Santa Fe — including the popular interactive Meow Wolf installation: House of Eternal Return.



NMDOH says people may have been exposed during the following times and days at the following locations:
10:45 a.m. to 3:45 p.m., Saturday, July 26, Meow Wolf, 1352 Rufina Circle, Santa Fe
10:00 p.m. Friday, July 25 to 12:30 p.m. Saturday, July 26. The Hampton Inn, 3430 Cerrillos Road, Santa Fe



The department says people who have recently been at any location should check check their vaccination status and report any measles symptoms in the next 21 days to their health care providers.
The out-of-state resident’s infection does not count toward New Mexico’s total measles case count, which remains at 96.
“Summer travel can increase the risk of catching measles,” NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser said in a statement. “We urge New Mexicans to be sure they are up to date with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination before traveling.
According to the state, 46,145 New Mexicans received the MMR vaccination between Feb. 1 and July 31.
Measles, one of the most contagious airborne viruses, spreads through contact with droplets from an infected person’ coughs and sneezes. The virus can survive in the air for hours, and can spread days before and after symptoms appear. Additionally, patients can take one to three weeks to develop symptoms such as headache, fever, cough, red eyes and the spotty red rash.
Complications can include ear infections and pneumonia. Health officials urge people with measles to stay home to prevent further spread and contact either a health provider or the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) for further guidance.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)This week, Utah joined a growing list of states getting requests for confidential voter roll data from the federal Department of Justice. If these states say “no,” the law, federalism, and election security are on their side. That is exactly what they should do.
Back in March, the Trump administration issued an executive order on election integrity. This order sought to standardize some state election laws and security standards, citing federal laws such as the National Voter Registration Act and Help America Vote Act. Among other things, it criticized states for embracing various methods of voting and ballot counting.
Fast forward to today. In recent weeks, states from Maine to California (including my home state of Utah) have gotten letters from the federal Department of Justice requesting private voter information. It has been reported that the DOJ told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it intends to send these letters to all 50 states. These letters cite the Help America Vote Act and suggest that the DOJ is seeking to ensure compliance with this federal law.
The requested information includes descriptions of various state election processes and procedures, as well as a state’s “current statewide voter registration list.” The latter presents a serious problem that jeopardizes legal compliance and election integrity.
Some of the information on voter rolls is public information that is required to be public under federal law. On the other hand, some voter roll information is sensitive, private identifying information.
When it comes to disclosing confidential voter roll information, election officials in Utah and elsewhere should follow the wisdom taught to school children in dealing with people pushing harmful things on them: “Just say no.”
Sound legal analysis puts the law on the side of doing so. The federal Privacy Act of 1974 requires federal departments like the DOJ to provide public notice of any effort to collect data – even publicly available data – to allow public discussion and comment on the desired federal data gathering before it takes place. That hasn’t happened. Additionally, states that share voter roll information with the DOJ without entering into data-sharing agreements required by law may be subject to legal liability.
Just as problematic is how the DOJ request for voter roll information undermines election security by making it easier to commit election fraud.
The foundation of the integrity of American elections lies in our tendency to avoid centralizing authority and information regarding elections – prioritizing federalism over politics. Federal entities create voter equipment standards, states typically maintain voter rolls, local election officials handle and count ballots, and voters themselves ensure their ballot remains secure until it is cast.
In other words, widespread voter fraud in the United States under the current system requires the co-opting of all levels of government or society simultaneously. This is why there is so little concrete evidence of actual voter fraud in America, even with so many elections happening every year. There are anecdotal stories that raise the specter of possible fraud, such as when someone’s friend or relative is sent a ballot that they shouldn’t have gotten, but these stories primarily illustrate how the people themselves are preventing possible fraud.
It is federalism – the disbursed responsibilities and safeguards at every level of government across the nation — not top-down federal attempts like this latest DOJ compliance effort, that ensure election integrity.
How much easier would election fraud become if the DOJ collected all voter data in a central database? Potential fraudsters would breathe a sigh of relief if they only had to hack one federal voter database instead of 50 state voter databases.
Whether based on the law or election security principles, and regardless of which party controls the federal executive branch, states should say “no” to the federal DOJ request for private voter information. They will be protecting election integrity if they do.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110524_Election-Day_40-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 18:56:24.876573

(Photo by Twenty47studio/ Getty Images)Maine Public will “still be here for you tomorrow,” said the organization’s president and CEO, Rick Schneider, after news broke Friday that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be shuttering its doors due to a lack of federal funding.
The announcement came just one day after a major Senate appropriations bill omitted funding for the nonprofit that funds public media and a week after President Donald Trump signed a bill into law that yanked $1.1 billion in previously approved spending for CPB. 
Schneider said while the news is not a surprise, it is still “a very sad day to see that CPB is actually taking the steps to wind down.” 
He said after Congress voted to rescind previously approved public media funding, it was “inevitable, but it is still a blow to see it happening. That said, it’s not the end of PBS programming, or of NPR, or of Maine Public.” 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting to close its doors after loss of funding

 
Maine Public was slated to receive about $2.5 million in grants from CPB for the coming year and $5 million over the next two years, Schneider said, noting this amounts to 12% of its overall budget. Maine Public will now have to “figure out different ways” to plug that budget hole, he added. 
Since the Trump administration first announced its intentions to claw back public media funding, there has been “an outpouring of support for local public broadcasting stations” nationally and in Maine, Schneider said. 
“We are grateful for all the people stepping up now, and we will have to convince them and let them know that this is support that we will need on an ongoing basis,” he added. He also emphasized his gratitude for the listeners who contacted lawmakers in support of public media.
The state also contributes 9% of Maine Public’s budget, but Schenider explained that covers costs for the extensive network of transmitters across Maine. As the only statewide broadcaster, with seven FM stations, he said the organization is the “backbone” of Maine’s emergency alert system, coordinating with the Maine Emergency Management Agency to get alerts out that are then picked up by commercial broadcasters.
It is not yet clear what CPB’s closure will mean for the out-of-state public radio programming that is picked up by the local broadcaster. Schneider explained that local outlets pay dues to NPR, which make it possible to produce distributed programming, “but if there are less stations, or less stations that can pay those fees, we are all interconnected, and that will be hard.”

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Chris Jones, the unsuccessful 2022 Democratic candidate for Arkansas governor, will challenge Republican U.S. Rep. French Hill in the 2026 congressional election.
Jones filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on July 21. He has yet to make a formal campaign announcement.
Hill has represented Arkansas’ 2nd Congressional District since 2015, encompassing much of Central Arkansas. As of 2022, the district consists of most of Pulaski County and all of Saline, Faulkner, Perry, Van Buren, Cleburne and White counties. Hill and Jones both live in Little Rock, which is split between the 1st, 2nd and 4th congressional districts.

Chris Jones statement of candidacy 
Jones is a pastor and scientist who grew up in Pine Bluff. His first foray into politics was his 2022 gubernatorial candidacy, in which he defeated four Democratic primary opponents but lost the general election, receiving 35% of the vote compared to Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ 63%.
Since then, Jones has co-chaired the national Dirt Road Democrats political action committee. He ran for, but did not win, a vice chair position on the Democratic National Committee.
Hill is a banker and a former aide to Sanders’ father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Hill filed his 2026 statement of candidacy with the FEC in November 2024, shortly after winning reelection to his sixth term.
The Democratic Party of Arkansas called Hill “a rubber stamp to [President Donald] Trump’s extremely unpopular agenda” in a Friday statement on Jones’ anticipated run for Hill’s seat.
“It’s clear: Arkansans deserve better, and it’s no surprise that Democrats are stepping up to make their case to voters,” party spokesperson Micah Wallace said in the news release. “…We’re anticipating a robust primary, and we’re wishing all of the candidates the best on the trail.”
Jones will face Zackary Huffman in next year’s Democratic primary, while Hill will face Chase McDowell in the Republican primary, according to FEC documents.
Last year, Hill defeated Democratic retired Army Col. Marcus Jones, 59% to 41%. Hill also survived challenges from then-state Sen. Joyce Elliott in 2020 and then-Rep. Clarke Tucker in 2018.

Arkansas’ other three U.S. representatives — Rick Crawford of the 1st District, Steve Womack of the 3rd District and Bruce Westerman of the 4th District — also filed FEC statements of candidacy in November.

Without use of the town's water and sewer systems, Twin Pines Housing is prepared to walk away from the Upper Valley project, the nonprofit's executive director Andrew Winter said.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nonprofits say access to Hartford water is key to Norwich housing and farmers market projects.","Attendees listen to live music played under the gazebo at the Norwich Farmers’ Market in Norwich, Vt., on Saturday, June 14, 2025. (Valley News – Alex Driehaus)
This story by Emma-Roth Wells was first published in the Valley News on July 30, 2025.
HARTFORD — The Norwich Farmers’ Market and Twin Pines Housing both have big plans for a parcel in Norwich, but in order for those plans to come fruition, the nonprofits need access to Hartford’s water and sewer infrastructure.
Last week, the Hartford Selectboard voted unanimously (outgoing board member Brandon Smith and Chairwoman Mary Erdei were absent) to continue exploring the possibility of allowing the two nonprofits to hook up to Hartford’s infrastructure.
The town has the capacity to support these projects but a study needs to be done, at the nonprofits’ expense, to see whether there needs to be upgrades to the system downstream to ensure no current water and sewer customers would be negatively affected, Chris Holzwarth, Hartford’s assistant director of planning and permitting, said during the meeting.
Allowing Twin Pines and the market to hook-up to Hartford’s infrastructure could be a money maker for the town.
“This is essentially revenue in,” Holzwarth said.
The board’s vote came after it heard a presentation by Andrew Winter, executive director of Twin Pines Housing, and Peggy Allen, board member of the Upper Valley Agricultural Association and co-owner of Junction Fiber Mill.
“We were thrilled the Selectboard was willing to entertain this initial request,” Winter said in a phone interview.
The Upper Valley Agricultural Association, a nonprofit formed by the Norwich Farmers’ Market, has signed a purchase and sale agreement to buy a 35-acre parcel for $750,000 across Route 5 from the market’s current summer location. The aim of the purchase is to give the market a permanent location and more space.
Twin Pines Housing — a nonprofit that develops and manages affordable housing in the Upper Valley — hopes to build approximately 30 affordable rental units on land owned by the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the Upper Valley on Palmer Court adjacent to the farmers’ market’s new parcel.
The Unitarian Universalist church’s property is one of two lots in Norwich that is already served by Hartford water and sewer, John Haverstock, Hartford’s town manager, said. The other is The Family Place Parent Child Center, located across the street from the church.
Both nonprofits say access to to Hartford’s water and sewer infrastructure is important to allow the projects to move forward.
Without Hartford’s municipal water and sewer, Twin Pines is prepared to walk away from the Norwich project, Winter said.
“There’s a lot of risk without public water,” he said.
In 2023, Twin Pines applied for a permit to connect to the New London-Springfield Water Precinct system for a 60-unit workforce housing project on Country Road in New London. The precinct denied the project, citing a lack of capacity on the system.
After the denial, Twin Pines drilled five wells before getting one with sufficient water supply, only to find the ground water had been contaminated by a nearby dry cleaning business.
The project is still tied up over water access issues.
“It’s cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Winter said during the meeting. “It’s something that we’re not prepared to undertake again because you don’t know when you’re drilling for wells what you’re going to find.”
The Norwich rental units would be the first of their kind in the town. The town’s affordable housing is limited to Starlake Village, an affordable home ownership program with 14 houses managed by Twin Pines, and 24 units of affordable senior housing owned by the Norwich Housing Corporation, a nonprofit developed in the 1970s, Winter said.
“Folks have said to me frequently that Norwich really needs to do its part,” Winter said during the meeting referring to Norwich’s lack of affordable housing. “We need water and sewer to do that.”
Twin Pines has been discouraged from exploring housing development in Norwich because of the lack of infrastructure, Winter said.
Meanwhile the Farmers’ Market is committed to carrying out plans for a 7,000-square-foot building on the new parcel even without Hartford’s infrastructure. Still, a feasibility study found that building a septic system to support a building of that size on the property would be challenging, Allen said.
The farmers’ market currently leases property from Co-op Food Stores from May to October for its summer market and holds its winter market in Tracy Hall.
Overall, the Farmers’ Market “is an incredible success,” Allen said at the meeting.
The market, which will have its 50th anniversary next year, has up to 2,500 patrons each Saturday in the summer season, Allen said.
For some of the farms that have a regular spot, sales at the market represent 50-75% of their annual income, Allen said. “It is a vital outlet for the farms in our region,” she said.
But the market could be better. “A lot of locals are choosing not to go because the parking is abysmal,” she said. Flooding, cars getting stuck and vendors being “knee-deep in mud” at the summer market is also an issue.
In addition to addressing the parking situation, the plan aims to give vendors “a little more elbow room,” by constructing the building to host the market and agricultural education year-round, Allen said.
“We’re just incredibly excited about the potential to have an open space with parking,” she said.
Allen envisions workshops on how to preserve produce, seminars on invasive species and lessons on how to conserve land all held at the potential building.
“This market that represents the Upper Valley deserves a permanent home,” she said.
Hartford resident Linda Miller spoke out in support of the projects at last week’s meeting.
“This is the first time I’ve heard a proposal for a project from Twin Pines that I’m so excited about,” she said. “It’s answering the question I’ve been asking: Why aren’t other towns stepping forward? And this will be another town stepping forward.”
A former vendor at the Norwich Farmers’ Market, Miller said she has not been to the market this summer because of the lack of parking. “I miss it, so this would be huge if Norwich Farmers’ Market could move across the street and have a little elbow room,” she said.
While both projects are still in the preliminary stages and no final decisions about whether either will be able to use Hartford’s water and sewer have been made, Selectboard member Miranda Dupre expressed her excitement.

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA) A report from the Center for Rural Affairs found that funding from the Inflation Reduction Act had a “significant impact” on the adoption of conservation practices in Iowa. 
The report examined two popular programs that fund practices to improve soil health, water quality or conservation. The boost in funding to these programs from IRA was redirected by the recently enacted federal tax and spending bill, but the programs are set to persist through 2031 with an increased baseline.
The report focused on the Conservation Stewardship Program, or CSP, and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, both of which help farmers implement more sustainable practices by helping to cover some of the costs.

EQIP and CSP popular programs 
— Cover crops: A practice of seeding a crop between cash crops cycles to keep roots in the soil. This can improve soil health and keep nutrients and soil in a field rather than washing off.
— Rotational grazing: Ranchers move livestock between multiple pastures to prevent overgrazing. This allows healthy pastures and often a greater diversity of vegetation in the fields as cattle eat, defecate and move plant material around. 
— No till/reduced tillage: Farmers reduce or stop tilling the land which helps to keep nutrients and soil on the field and keeps sequestered carbon in the ground. 

EQIP funding is typically used to support one element, like supplementing the cost of seeding a cover crop on a field, or the cost of fencing for a rancher who wants to implement rotational grazing practices. 
CSP contracts are usually longer than EQIP contracts and require producers to implement multiple regenerative or conservation practices in their operations. 
According to the report, these programs have been historically oversubscribed, with only about 25% of applicants receiving contracts in 2022. 
The Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022, allocated $8.45 billion for EQIP and $3.25 billion for CSP through 2026. 
This allocation significantly increased the funding that was allocated under the 2018 Farm Bill. 
IRA funding meant Iowa had a 77% increase in CSP obligations and a 108% increase in EQIP obligations in 2024 compared to 2022, according to the report. 
“The underlying significance of this data is that Iowa was able to forward 100% of the funding they received for EQIP and CSP from the IRA on to Iowa’s farmers,” Kalee Olson, who authored the report,  said in a release. “It demonstrates the dedication of local (Natural Resources Conservation Service) staff and the willingness of producers to go the extra mile for their operations and our natural resources.”
Contracts funded by IRA had to employ “climate-smart agriculture practices” which the NRCS defined as those that respond “to climate change by reducing or removing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) and adapting and building resilience (adaptation), while sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes.” 
Practices included cover crops, planting pasture or hay, planting in critical areas, no till, prescribed grazing and more.

According to the report, cover cropping and tillage reduction were the most popular methods utilized by Iowa farmers with CSP or EQIP contracts. An analysis in the report shows eight of the top 10 practices implemented by farmers in these contracts in 2023 and 2024 were climate smart practices, regardless of if the project was funded by IRA or not. 
The report said there is “no indication” that interest in the programs will decline, and that the additional funding has made a “significant impact” on the implementation of practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state. 
“Moving forward, lawmakers and other federal decision makers must support policy and administrative action that continue to meet the demand of producers in Iowa and across the nation,” the report said. 
The IRA funding was set to stretch through 2031, but much of the law has since been scrapped since the change in administration. 
The tax and spending cuts package known as the “one big beautiful” law rescinded unobligated IRA funding for EQIP, CSP and several other conservation programs with USDA, but it increased the permanent farm bill baselines for the programs. 
Under law, which President Donald Trump signed July 4, EQIP is funded by fiscal year at $2.6 billion for 2026, $2.8 billion for 2027, and $3.2 billion annually from 2028-2031. CSP funding under the bill is at $1.3 billion for 2026, $1.3 billion for 2027, $1.3 billion for 2028, and $1.3 billion annually for 2029 through 2031.
An analysis of the bill from American Farm Bureau Federation said this funding represents a “redirection” of IRA funding rather than program expansions.

It came days after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier threatened the mayor and all six county commissioners that their failure to do so would result in their removal from office by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
“Yeah, we signed the damn thing because we really had to. We were put in a tough spot,” Demings said during a late afternoon press conference in Orlando. “I can’t let our entire board of county commissioners and myself be removed from office.”
Demings signed an addendum to modify the 287(g) Warrant Service Officer (WSO) Memorandum of Agreement that will allow county jail officials to transport immigration detainees to ICE facilities — although he said he still needs to assess the readiness of his corrections department staff to do so while keeping everyone safe at the county jail. He said that there are 212 vacancies within the Orange County corrections department right now, a vacancy rate of 24%.
Speaking in Orlando earlier on Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis said that local governments could apply for grants from the state to reimburse their costs for detaining and transporting detainees. “I think the detention transport, that’s something that would be appropriate to do, and we approved the guidelines for the grants to go out,” he said.
In his letter posted on X earlier this week (which Demings said his office had just received on Friday), Uthmeier wrote that 
	

	rohibiting your corrections officers from transporting arrested aliens to ICE-approved detention facilities squarely prevents your corrections officers from cooperating with ICE and participating in federal immigration operations.”
Failure to back down, he added, would result in removal from office by DeSantis.
Demings, the former chief of police for Orlando who has led Orange County since 2018, said earlier this week that he was not going to allow Uthmeier to “bully” him or other Orange County leaders. But he said on Friday that with the possibility that not signing the addendum would allow DeSantis to “insert his minions,” he really had no choice in the matter.
“I thought it was urgent that we had to take action now to preclude the possibility that the elected body here in Orange County could be removed from office,” he said. “I hope you understand that. That was a calculated risk that we had, obviously. People that had no elected responsibility to our county would be inserted or put in place. That would be catastrophic to the continuity of government here in Orange County. That is something that I certainly did not want to happen.”
Uthmeier and DeSantis have previously asserted that other local governments in Florida that do not fully cooperate with ICE would be defined as employing “sanctuary” policies, which are prohibited in Florida.
In doing so, they ensured that local governments in Fort Myers and Key West ultimately did sign 287(g) agreements with ICE, though in fact cities are not legally required to sign such agreements under Florida law — even if counties are.
Demings said he didn’t understand why state officials had to be so confrontational when it came to enforcing immigration policy in Florida.
“We’re not enemies,” he said. “Local governments are subdivisions of the state. Our state officials in government should act like it. They should remember that we are part of the state of Florida. The state of Florida works best when we work in collaboration, across political lines. The comments I’m making today have nothing to do with partisan politics. It has everything to do with public safety in our community.”
The Orange County Commission must still approve the addendum. Members are scheduled to meet next Tuesday.

(Photo by Daniel Sone/National Cancer Institute)The world’s leading manufacturer of DNA sequencing systems will pay $9.8 million to resolve allegations that it knowingly sold products with security vulnerabilities to federal agencies, Rhode Island’s Acting U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom announced Thursday.    
The settlement avoids a lengthy court battle for biotech manufacturer Illumina by ending a 2023 suit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island by whistleblower Erica Lenore, a former platform management director at the San Diego company who raised concerns about product security and was eventually let go. 
The $9.8 million settlement allocates $1.9 million to Lenore for initiating the suit and cooperating with federal agencies. Another $4.3 million is specifically labeled as restitution for the government. The company also needs to pay 4.33% interest on the settlement money, backdated to March 2025. 
The settlement text does not specify how the remaining funds are broken down. The court case, which has now been dismissed and unsealed, rested upon the False Claims Act, which allows for prosecution of people and companies who knowingly defraud the government. False Claims settlements typically include money for other penalties or court fees. 
The settlement resolves the government’s civil allegations, and the government has not filed any criminal charges against Illumina, although the settlement allows for future legal action. A separate agreement settles Lenore’s personal civil claims.  
According to the 2023 court filing, Rhode Island’s federal court was eligible for jurisdiction over the case because of a research initiative at the University of Rhode Island — the Rhode Island IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence — that is funded in part by National Institutes of Health grants and used Illumina equipment. 
The lawsuit says that university researchers used the company’s MiSeq line, which was recalled in 2023 over cybersecurity concerns.
Thursday’s settlement was obtained through a joint effort by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Rhode Island, and the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch and Fraud Section, with additional assistance from other federal investigators.
Among the federal agencies that purchased and used vulnerable Illumina products from 2016 to 2023 were the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, the Interior, Energy, Commerce and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Smithsonian, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
Since 2001, Illumina has received $530 million in direct federal funding, with $43 million in 2022 alone, according to court documents. It also receives pass-through money via Medicare reimbursements, as clinical labs use Illumina systems for genetic testing. 
The security issues in Illumina’s products “allowed thousands of Illumina insiders and everyday users of its products the ability to access and manipulate HIPAA-protected patient genomic data including test results and to do so without detection,” the suit argued. 
Christine Douglass, a spokesperson for Illumina, shared a statement via email Thursday that denied the allegations. The company settled, Douglass wrote, to forego “the uncertainty, expense, and distraction of litigation.” As part of the settlement, it did not admit any wrongdoing. 
“Government agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are important customers and Illumina values these relationships,” Douglass said. “Illumina takes data security seriously and has invested significantly in its programs to align with cybersecurity best practices for the development and deployment of our products. We are pleased to put this matter behind us.”
Douglass said that Illumina “successfully remediated” security issues for its customers from 2022 to 2024.

What the lawsuit says 
The 72-page lawsuit explains that Illumina is the only servicer for its products, like the MiniSeq and NextSeq, both of which are named in the suit. Because Illumina is the only servicer for its products across their lifecycle, the company needs to contract with government agencies to provide maintenance as needed. 
The lawsuit alleged these government contracts were violated when it was discovered that Illumina had been selling products with unaddressed security holes, such as human-readable passwords coded into software.
“Illumina improperly hard-coded credentials used to access confidential patient genomic data stored in the cloud, allowing everyday users to see the login information in plain text,” the lawsuit alleged.  
Another vulnerability involved software that was too liberal with elevated privileges for user accounts. That meant that “thousands of everyday users,” could exert considerable control over Illumina systems.
“Illumina has improperly allowed elevated privileges to users running genetic tests on Illumina products that are connected to an open network,” the suit reads. “These users include everyone — research assistants, third-party vendors, laboratory technicians, scientists, clinical investigators, engineers, and research and development staff — individuals who have no need for access to confidential and HIPAA-protected patient data including genomic test results.”
Federal prosecutors strengthened their case for False Claims Act liability with several eyebrow-raising examples that the company was verifying compliance with government standards while knowing otherwise. In 2022, Illumina initiated a product recall only after its customer, the pharmaceutical giant Roche, informed it of a vulnerability in its sequencing software. Roche routinely tests software and hardware it uses for security flaws, but according to prosecutors, Illumina had not performed its own testing on the product in question.     
The lawsuit says that, in another instance, an internal Illumina report noted that a product it was about to launch could most likely be hacked by “a disgruntled ex- or current staff member, with access to the [local] network.” Illumina launched the product three days later and did not disclose the security concerns to the feds.
Lumina did recall products multiple times, but the court complaint calls some of these efforts a “half-truth,” as Illumina allowed different products with the same vulnerabilities to stay on the market.
The company, which made $4.372 billion last year, accounts for about 80% market share of the genomic sequencing industry. Their products are used in research, medicine, and commercial gene testing.
“Illumina’s cybersecurity failures have been driven by its singular goal to maintain its dominant market presence,” the complaint reads. “When faced with customer complaints related to the accessibility of data in its products, Illumina took fatal shortcuts.” 
Whistleblower Lenore — described in the complaint as a “respected professional in the field of life sciences technologies and was hired by Illumina to oversee all of Illumina’s on-market products” — noticed some of these shortcuts during her time at the company, during which she balanced overlapping roles in product management. 
Lenore became concerned about security issues that popped up and repeatedly brought her concerns to higher-ups, but was “ignored, reprimanded, marginalized, and retaliated against by Illumina.” Lenore ultimately lost her job in what the company called a “restructuring,” the lawsuit reads.

Mennen Williams Building in Lansing, Mich., on May 15, 2025. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced Friday that she’s joined a multistate lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s effort to restrict access to medically-necessary care for transgender, intersex and nonbinary youth.
The lawsuit challenges recent federal action to deter doctors and medical providers from offering gender affirming care to youth under the age of 19 years old, including states like Michigan where that care is legal and protected.
Nessel and other attorneys general have asserted that President Donald Trump’s White House is overstepping its authority, using threats of criminal prosecution and federal investigations to pressure health care providers.
“The Trump Administration is attempting to strip away lawful, essential healthcare from vulnerable youth. These orders are illegal and dangerous and have no medical or scientific basis,” Nessel in a statement. “I will continue to protect families, defend doctors, and stop politicians from putting our kids’ lives at risk.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Trump in the beginning of this second administration signed an executive order stating that the U.S. would only recognize two sexes, and called for an end to what Trump labeled “gender ideology.” A second order focused on medical restrictions, directing the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue enforcement actions related to that care.
Since then, Nessel’s office said the Department of Justice has issued subpoenas to providers under the guise of criminal law enforcement, but the attorneys general filing the lawsuit Friday argue those efforts lack legal standing and are intended only to intimidate.
“Health care decisions for kids should be made by parents and doctors, not by politicians,” said Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan, a LGBTQ+ advocacy group, in a statement. “The federal government is using funding as a weapon to force providers to abandon their patients and override parents’ rights to make health care decisions for their own children.”
Patricia Wells, a doctor and the medical director of The Corner Health Center, said in a statement that she and her colleagues are distressed by new punitive changes to funding and regulations, which threaten to dismantle essential care.
As Trump admin axes LGBTQ+ crisis support, ally parents are offering support for trans youth

“These policies do not protect children; they endanger them,” Wells said. “They undermine trust in the medical system and place affirming providers in an impossible position, forcing hospitals to close clinics and providers to stop offering the very care that helps young people survive and thrive. The loss of these services would not simply be a policy failure; it would be a moral one.”
Wells said the nation must do better. 
“These young people deserve our compassion, our evidence-based care, and our unwavering commitment to their well-being,” she said. “I applaud the leadership of the state of Michigan for protecting transgender and gender nonconforming youth, their families, and the caregivers who are saving lives every day.”

(Providence City Council Photo)Providence City Councilor Helen Anthony announced Friday she will step down from her post Sept. 1, citing her continued recovery from injuries sustained in a serious accident in a California state park two years ago. 
The Ward 2 councilwoman, who chairs the council’s finance committee, announced her resignation in a letter to her constituents Friday.
“As I continue to heal from the traumatic injuries I suffered when I was struck by a van in June 2023, my neurologist has recommended that I devote more time to my recovery,” Anthony wrote. “I’m proud to have served Ward 2 and the City of Providence and to have chaired the council’s Finance Committee. Unfortunately, the demands of those roles is hindering my ability to heal.”
Anthony, who has served on the council since 2019, also submitted a formal resignation letter to the city clerk, which will be on the agenda for the City Council’s next meeting on Sept.4. The City Council is in recess for August.
The council will formally accept Anthony’s resignation at its September meeting, triggering a special election within 90 days, per the city charter. The Board of Canvassers will set the date once the seat is officially declared vacant. 
Ward 2 covers a portion of the capital city’s East Side and includes the neighborhoods of Blackstone, College Hill, and Wayland.
“The residents of Ward 2 have had a wonderful representative; residents of every neighborhood have had a steadfast advocate in Helen,” Council President Rachel Miller said in a Friday statement. “While I will miss her leadership on the council, and in particular her deft stewardship of the Finance Committee, I am proud of her decision to prioritize her health.” 
“As Helen’s colleague and friend, I was in awe of her resilience and tenacity as she recovered from the accident, and I am in awe of the grace with which she is making this difficult decision today,” Miller added.
Anthony was struck by a large, van-sized ATV in a crosswalk at Point Lobos State Natural Reserve, the Boston Globe reported in October 2023. The vehicle’s driver, an 82 year-old park volunteer, had mistakenly hit the gas pedal. Anthony’s extensive injuries — including a brain bleed, broken bones, and a bruised heart — required her to be hospitalized in California for more than two weeks, where she underwent multiple surgeries. She returned to the City Council in October 2023. 
“I take immense pride in the stands I have taken for transparency. It was not always easy, but I have done my best to communicate with you and to represent the city’s long-term interests,” Anthony wrote in her letter to constituents. “This year’s budget was particularly difficult given the financial challenges facing the city. While no single councilor can solve the city’s problems, I am proud that my team and I set a new bar for educating colleagues and residents about how the city’s budget and taxation processes work, and striving to encourage meaningful public input.”
During the transition period after Anthony leaves her post, the City Council Office encourages Ward 2 residents with concerns or questions to call constituent services at (401) 521-7477 or email council@providenceri.gov.

The dwellings would be a mix of rental, for-sale and rehabbed properties in a 770-block area around the streetcar’s initial downtown-midtown route, which is set to be up and running in 2027.
They’re to be targeted to people making under a certain income. And they’ll be built by developers selected by Front Porch Investments, the nonprofit partner the city chose to distribute the millions in the form of grants and low-interest loans.

Friday, Mayor John Ewing Jr. and Jody Holston, Front Porch’s executive director, laid out more details of the vision Ewing shared with the Nebraska Examiner earlier this week. 
It comes as Nebraska towns statewide continue to seek ways to tackle what a 2023 state report deemed a housing crisis. The report said the state’s economic future hinged on solutions, and called for goals including cutting the share of low- to- moderate-income households paying more than 30% of their earnings for rent from about 44% to 33%.
 It’s personal 

Streetcar supporters previously said that affordable housing, bike routes and other mobility improvements would be possible with the tax-increment financing stream the city is counting on to cover its streetcar cost. The city recently increased its estimate of how much the city’s portion of streetcar costs would be, to $421 million.
Ewing said his newly announced strategy — if approved by the necessary channels that include the Omaha City Council — would allow related housing production to start as soon as 2026, years before the 2031 or later that the project’s supporters previously envisioned.
Omaha mayor urges ‘single largest investment’ in affordable housing, with help from streetcar

Beefing up the city’s affordable housing options was an issue Ewing campaigned on, and one he described Friday as personal. He said his own parents weren’t able to buy their first home until he was 15, a sophomore in high school.
“I understand the importance of affordable housing and what it means … when it comes to providing stability for families and children, as well as the opportunity to begin to build generational wealth,” he said.
 Anonymous funder

City officials, during a news conference at City Hall, described the financing strategy this way:
An “anonymous funder” has offered to buy $40 million in city bonds, which the city would grant to Front Porch to start distributing to housing developers.
The city would guarantee payback from tax-increment financing (TIF), tied to the streetcar. TIF is a state-authorized tool that, upon city approval, essentially allows future property taxes generated on an improved site to go toward paying qualified redevelopment expenses.
Steve Jensen, an Omaha mayoral aide, said the city has anticipated that the streetcar will spur $4 billion in new development that’s expected to generate $980 million in new property taxes. He said the city council earlier approved total bond funding of $490 million, and specified that $440 million (and related interest) could go to streetcar construction.

When the private funder buys the $40 million in municipal bonds, it would generate immediate funds, accelerating the ability of the city to spend part of the money on affordable housing. The remaining $10 million would be available, he said, for later housing, biking or mobility projects.
“There will be no citywide property tax rate increase, no money diverted from other city projects and no money used from properties outside the streetcar corridor,” said a city statement. “Only revenue from new or redeveloped income-producing commercial and multi-family properties within the corridor will be used to fund the streetcar, affordable housing  bikeways or other mobility improvements.”
Critics of TIF point out, however, that new property taxes generated on TIF-related development are diverted for up to 20 years from other traditional property tax recipients such as schools and local governments.
 North and South Omaha? 

More specifically, city officials said, the boundaries in which this batch of housing units can be created is Cuming Street to the north, Woolworth/William Streets to the south, the Missouri River to the east and as far as 50th Avenue to the west.
While that does not cover the hearts of North and South Omaha, Holston said Front Porch’s ongoing program currently serves the North and South Omaha areas. Ewing said he hopes to expand farther into North and South Omaha later, but that the boundaries are limited currently to the current TIF streetcar zone and the Urban Core Housing and Mobility Redevelopment Plan that must be amended. 
Holston of Front Porch called the partnership a “perfect example” of what is possible when city leadership and community priorities align. Front Porch has a history with the city, as the former Mayor Jean Stothert administration in 2022 granted the nonprofit $20 million from the city’s share of federal ARPA funds to boost affordable housing options.
Results so far from that fund are the basis for the estimated number of housing units expected to come from the $40 million, 1,900 homes. 
As of July, the city’s ARPA funds, matched by $20 million from philanthropic sources, have led to 2,359 new or rehabbed units, nearly 1,700 of which are described as affordable. About $5 million from the original fund remains.

What is affordable? Holston said the projects Front Porch selects for funding typically are restricted for 20 years for people who make under a certain income.  Eligible income levels can vary, she said, but homes generally would be limited to households making 30% to 80% of the area’s median income, and others to those earning 80% to 120% of median income.
 ‘Uniquely positioned’

Holston said Front Porch is “uniquely positioned” to partner in the venture, as it has been working for four years to close the local affordable housing gap.
“The cost of building any type of housing continues to increase due to construction costs, labor, interest rates, insurance,” she said. Without gap funding, developers and housing advocates are hard-pressed to find ways to make homes available to lower-income and working families.
She said stable housing offers benefits including enhanced educational and health outcomes and worker retention.
“We have the opportunity to ensure that families can meet their basic needs while setting them on a course toward financial stability,” Ewing said. “I’m so excited we’ll be able to do it at this scale and at this time.”

(Dave Britton/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)This story originally published Thursday on Idaho Reports. 
Two-thirds of the way through summer, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture announced it has not yet detected any quagga mussels after two years of aggressive treatment in the Snake River.
However, the microscopic mussel veligers were not detected in the water near Twin Falls until late September in both 2023 and 2024. ISDA treated the infected river with a copper-based solution both years.
“Monitoring efforts in the Snake River are ongoing and remain a top priority. While early negative results are a good sign, long-term monitoring is essential to determine the full effectiveness of treatments,” according to an ISDA press release.
The department has collected over 200 negative samples from the affected area this season, the press release said.
The department said it has collected more than 2,500 water samples statewide this year to test for quagga mussels.
The Idaho Fish and Game Commission on April 15 rescinded their closure of the Snake River near Twin Falls to hunting, fishing, and trapping. The closure had been in place since September 29, 2023.
All watercraft entering or moving throughout the state must be clean, drained, and dry to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species.
All watercraft entering or exiting the section of the Snake River between Broken Bridge (Yingst Grade) and Hansen Bridge must undergo mandatory inspection prior to launch and decontamination upon exit.
According to ISDA, the Centennial Waterfront Park, Shoshone Falls, and Twin Falls Reservoir check stations have completed over 16,361 inspections so far this year.
“Our roadside watercraft inspection stations along with our roving crews have completed more than 112,479 inspections,” the department noted. “We are on track to break our record of 157,356 inspections from 2024.”

Five months after President Donald Trump announced he was nominating a former Wyoming game warden to lead the federal agency, the confirmation process is complete. 
The post Trump’s pick Nesvik confirmed as Fish and Wildlife director with some bipartisan support appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s former top wildlife official is now the nation’s top wildlife official.
It’s a post that puts Brian Nesvik in charge of achieving the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s mission, which is to “conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.”
Confirming Nesvik was a protracted process, not unusual for the Trump administration’s other political nominees in the opening half year of the administration. At around 1 p.m. Friday, however, a vote materialized and Congress’ upper chamber voted mostly along party lines 54-43 to confirm the nomination.  
Two western state Democrats defected from the pack and voted to confirm Nesvik: Sen. Jacky Rosen of  Nevada and Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.

All Republican senators who were present for the roll-call vote submitted an aye, which was not surprising. In many circles, and especially in Wyoming, Nesvik’s appointment was received favorably. 
“There simply has never been a more qualified Director for the agency,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement issued shortly after the Senate’s vote on Friday. “He brings decades of wildlife expertise, a collaborative approach to addressing complex issues, and exemplary leadership to the role.”

Gordon named Endangered Species Act reform and grizzly bear delisting as top issues he’s eager to take on with his former Game and Fish director at the helm of the federal agency. 
Sen. Cynthia Lummis, Wyoming’s junior senator, also broadcast her praise, calling Nesvik a “breath of fresh air.” 
“Brian brings a proven track record from Wyoming, where he effectively collaborated with federal, state and local partners to achieve important conservation goals,” Lummis said in a statement. 
Praise for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife’s new director isn’t universal. Around the time of his first confirmation hearing, where Nesvik fielded little criticism, a coalition of 125 organizations signed onto a letter opposing his nomination. The oppositional parties included the Wyoming-based organizations Wyoming Untrapped and Wyoming Wildlife Advocates.
“In 2024, Nesvik faced major national blowback after his agency failed to take strong action against a man who ran over a young female wolf with his snowmobile,” the letter stated. “Mr. Nesvik’s lackadaisical response to the tormenting of the young Wyoming wolf speaks volumes about his lack of care for wildlife and is a foreshadowing of the attitude he will bring to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.” 
A development in that case came just this week: Sublette County law enforcement officials are convening a grand jury to consider a felony animal cruelty indictment of the wolf captor, Cody Roberts.

A longtime member of the Wyoming Army National Guard, Nesvik rose through the ranks at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department after being hired as a warden in 1995. After wardening stints in Casper, Elk Mountain and Pinedale, he took a post supervising the state agency’s Cody Region in 2010. He also spent many years working as Game and Fish’s lead mounted horse patrol instructor. 
A promotion to chief warden brought Nesvik to Cheyenne in 2011, and in 2019, he was promoted by Gordon to direct Game and Fish. He retired last fall. 
The U.S. Senate delayed its summer recess this week to make progress on reducing a long list of appointees — more than 100 positions  — who lacked confirmation. The sluggishness of the approvals has been a source of frustration for the Republicans who hold the majority. 
Nesvik is joined by another Wyomingite at the Trump administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service. Josh Coursey, a co-founder of the Muley Fanatic Foundation, was named senior advisor to the director in April. That position did not require a Senate confirmation. 
The duo will have their work cut out for them in running a federal agency that struggled mightily with a lack of resources even before Trump’s friend-turned-foe, Elon Musk, slashed into the staff through his Department of Government Efficiency. A recent inventory from within the Fish and Wildlife Service found that out of 573 national wildlife refuges around the country, not a single property had adequate staff and funding to “fully achieve administration, management and mission goals and objectives.”

(Photo illustration via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing) A Cass County assisted living center is one of several care facilities recently fined by the state in the wake of medication errors, injuries and a death.
State records indicate that on July 8, a male resident of Allen Place, an assisted living center in Atlantic, was left unattended in the shower where he slipped and fell, suffering a head injury. He was taken to by ambulance to a hospital, where he died a short time later.
According to the state inspectors, a non-skid bathmat was not in place in the shower at the time of the incident, and the worker tasked with showering the man was not properly trained and wasn’t assisting the man in the shower.

The worker in question had been on the staff for roughly one month. In a written statement referenced by inspectors in their report, the worker indicated he didn’t understand that the resident needed physical assistance standing and showering and so he sat a few feet away from the bathroom while the resident showered. Within a minute of the resident entering the shower, the worker reportedly wrote, the man fell.
“I lacked the proper training on the proper stand-by procedure,” the worker allegedly wrote in his statement. “Due to this lack of training, I thought the shower mat that’s normally down — but was up that day — should remain up.” … and “once [Tenant C1’s] in the bathroom, I leave the bathroom as to what I was taught before and leave the door half open while I sit in a nearby chair … Around a minute into the shower he falls.”
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing fined Allen Place $10,000.
Other Iowa care facilities recently fined by the DIAL include:
— Hallmar Village, a Cedar Rapids nursing home where a resident sustained two broken legs while being transferred to bed in a mechanical lift, was fined $20,500 by the state. The resident was facing amputation of one leg before being assigned to hospice care a few days later, according to state records.
Inspectors reported that one employee of the home, a certified nursing assistant, indicated the staff at the home had been using a modified method of using the mechanical lift with the resident that involved the use of a pillow and avoided the use of leg straps intended for safe transfers. The CNA reportedly told inspectors she felt the modifications by the staff posed a risk to the resident and said she relayed her concerns to a nurse.
The CNA also told inspectors that because the transfer process looked unsafe, she asked to work a different floor at the home. A state review of training records indicated the nurse and two CNAs at the home “did not have training on the use of a mechanical lift,” according to inspectors.
— Bickford Cottage I, a Sioux City assisted living center, was fined $7,000 after a resident wandered from the facility on July 5 and wasn’t found for several hours. The resident was admitted to a local hospital due to acute kidney injury, dehydration and elevated creatine levels.
— Windsor Manor, a Grinnell assisted living center, was fined $5,000 after a male resident of the home was given seven separate medications intended for someone else. The resident who was mistakenly given the drugs became unresponsive and was admitted for a short time to a local hospital.
— Azria Health-Longview, a Missouri Valley nursing home, was fined $7,000 after a resident fell on June 30 and sustained a serious head injury. Inspectors noted the facility was to have placed non-skid strips near the resident’s bed, but the work order calling for that to be done included the wrong bed number. The resident suffered multiple facial fractures and had to be hospitalized. As of July 16, the resident was still hospitalized.
— Bickford Cottage, an Iowa City assisted living center, was fined $5,000 after a female resident wandered from the facility about 8 p.m. on June 1. About one hour later, an off-duty paramedic found the woman 1.3 miles from the facility.

This week, Montana added to that history by beginning the constitutional initiative process aimed at challenging dark money, corporate spending and the Citizens United ruling.
Leaders who have signed on the measure admit: They have a steep hill to climb. Citizens United, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, said that the power to spend money in elections is tantamount to free speech and so most attempts to thwart or limit it have run afoul of the U.S. Constitution and the nation’s highest courts.
However, the wording of the new initiative seeks to limit the amount of money corporations can spend – not through traditional campaign laws or limitations, but rather by limiting corporate charters.
The new and untested method would leverage the state’s inherent power to regulate corporates through the charter process. The language of the proposed state constitutional amendment would prohibit corporations from making political contributions, except in very specific circumstances. Meanwhile, individuals would be free to spend on candidates and causes.
The idea, said Jeff Mangan, a former Montana Commissioner of Political Practices, is conservative in nature: The state has the power to put limits on the corporations it charters to do business in the state; this one would simply not allow them the power to participate in elections directly, while still leaving a path for political action committees.
The key, Mangan said, is about transparency. He said the current system allows private corporations to be established and collect money, but to keep those donors and the amounts hidden from public view. Those corporations, which can consist with as few as one donor, can give to candidates and causes under the corporation name, although the people supporting that corporation and the amount of money donated are unknown, leading to the term “dark money.”
The change in Montana law would simply not grant the corporations the power to give to candidates or causes, but would allow individuals to give, but those donations would be tracked.
The proposed legislation is the first-of-its-kind and takes a different approach to the problem of campaign finance in spending. For example, last year’s U.S. Senate race in Montana, which saw Republican Tim Sheehy beat incumbent Democrat Jon Tester, had more than $275 million spent in a state of roughly 1.2 million people.
“Basically the only difference is that corporations won’t be able to spend in our elections,” Mangan said.
The specifics of the proposed constitutional amendment would carve out exceptions for organizations like political parties and even media organizations whose coverage could possibly run afoul of the amendment’s language.
“If a person wants to spend money, then they have to put their name on it. It’s full disclosure. That’s what this is all about,” Mangan said.
Constance Van Kley, an assistant professor at the University of Montana law school, said it’s unknown whether this idea will get around the Citizens United ruling, as well as clear the First Amendment, but she said it nonetheless attempts a new solution.
“There’s nothing that I am aware of that squarely forecloses it, though,” Van Kley said.
She teaches constitutional law in Missoula and said that since the United States Supreme Court has said that money equals political speech, and political speech is the most protected part of free speech. Many campaign finance laws have been evaluated in terms of whether they restrict, prohibit or curtail free speech. However, Van Kley said, this initiative is different and limits corporations using the power states have inherently in their power to issue a charter.
“The question that has not been decided to my knowledge is whether this can get by the First Amendment,” she said.
Mangan told the Daily Montanan it eliminates the vaguely named organizations, which often become nothing more than shields to hide where the money is coming from.
“This is not limiting anyone’s speech. They have the right to do whatever they want with their money, they just have to put their name to it,” Mangan said. “But it has to come from individuals. And, I think the individuals — the rank-and-file folks — they are tired of the money in politics and they’re just waiting for someone to do something about it.”
He said because of the Citizens United decision and its connection to free speech and the First Amendment, many believe the solution to the dark money in politics is insurmountable.
“Many citizens are just resigned. You know: It is what it is,” Mangan said. “People are born, but corporations are created with rights by a piece of paper and pen. That means that states can change corporate rules the same way. States have always had the right to change charters.”
Mangan said he expects opposition from corporations who like putting money into campaigns to protect their business interests. However, people who work for companies or corporations may not like or support their employer’s political decisions. This initiative, Mangan said, would stop that.
Van Kley said that this measure is different because not many politicians have been actively fighting against the Citizens United ruling because the decision has meant a tidal wave of money pouring into both parties, despite the public being opposed to the ruling. Van Kley said the movement to change campaign financing has not had state legislatures and politicians chipping away at it like the countless challenges to other issues, like abortion, which finally chiseled it away enough to lead to the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. She said that makes this particularly constitutional initiative a challenge to predict because so much of it has not been explored by the courts.
“Especially in Citizens United, most people have thought that the only pushback to it would be by an amendment (to the U.S. Constitution) because it involves freedom of speech,” Van Kley said. “Is it the first step to rethinking First Amendment and campaign finance law?
The initiative has several major hurdles to clear before it would even get in front of the voters. The language must first be approved and checked with the Attorney General’s Office. Then initiative supporters must collect signatures throughout the state, a daunting task because of the requirements. The initiative will take about 63,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, so Mangan said they’ll likely need to aim for double that amount just to ensure those signatures can all be verified.
“We trying to get things back to the way they were,” he said. “We tell them right up front, we’ll be transparent with our donors for anyone who ask. Montanans shouldn’t have to do this. It shouldn’t cost this much. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican, it just doesn’t make sense.”
Van Kley also sees this initiative as a bit of history repeating itself.
“Montana and Alaska,” she said. “They have been the places that have had incredibly rich natural resource and not a lot of people, which has made them victims of extraordinary political corruption, historically.”
 



 
 THE MONTANA PLAN PROPOSED BALLOT STATEMENT 


CI ____ would amend Article XIII of the Montana Constitution to redefine the powers of artificial “persons,” including corporations. It defines their powers as only those the constitution expressly grants and provides that artificial persons have no power to spend money or anything of value on elections or ballot issues. It affirms that the people of Montana never intended for artificial persons to have the power to spend on elections or ballot issues. CI ____ provides that actions beyond those expressly granted powers are void. The initiative permits political committees to be granted the power to spend on elections and ballot issues. It allows enforcement through forfeiture of state-conferred privileges. The initiative includes a clause that ensures that valid portions of the initiative remain effective even if other parts are invalidated.
 



 





 THE COMPLETE TEXT OF CONSTITUTIONAL INITIATIVE NO. *** (CI-***)


BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
NEW SECTION. Section 1. Article XIII of The Constitution of the State of Montana is amended by adding a new section 8 that reads:

Section 8. Powers of Artificial Persons.
(1) Artificial Persons exist only by grant of the state and shall have no powers or privileges except those this constitution expressly provides.

(2) (a) The legislature may by statute create Artificial Persons consistent with subsection (1).
(b) The people never did, and do not, intend the powers of Artificial Persons to include Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity. This section retracts all Artificial Persons’ powers and re-grants only those powers that the people deem necessary or convenient to carry out an Artificial Person’s lawful business or charitable purposes, as described in (3)(e). Powers related to Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity shall not be deemed necessary or convenient to those purposes.

(3) Definitions.


(a) “Artificial Person” means every entity whose existence or limited-liability shield is conferred by Montana law, including, without limitation:

(i) business corporations;
(ii) nonprofit corporations (public-benefit, mutual-benefit, religious);
(iii) limited-liability companies;
(iv) unincorporated associations, limited-liability partnerships, statutory trusts, professional corporations, cooperatives, and any successor form;
(v) Foreign Entities that are authorized to transact business, are otherwise transacting business, or hold property in Montana. Any Foreign Entity that directly or indirectly undertakes, finances, or directs Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity in the state of Montana is conclusively deemed to be transacting business in this state.


(b) “Election Activity” means paying, contributing, or expending money or anything of value to support or oppose a candidate, political party, or political committee.
(c) “Ballot-Issue Activity” means paying, contributing, or expending money or anything of value to support or oppose a ballot question or initiative.
(d) Election Activity and Ballot-Issue Activity do not include any bona fide news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, or of any print, online, or digital newspaper, magazine, blog, or other periodical publication, unless such broadcasting, print, online, or digital facilities are owned or controlled by a political party, political committee, or candidate.
(e) “Artificial Person Powers” means powers necessary or convenient to carry out lawful business or charitable purposes, excluding any power to directly or indirectly engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity.
(f) “Charter Privilege” means any benefit to Artificial Persons that exists only because the state of Montana confers it, such as, without limitation, limited liability, perpetual duration, succession in its corporate name, and tax credits and abatements.
(g) “Foreign Entity” means an Artificial Person organized or existing under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state of Montana.


(4) Total Revocation of Previous Power Grants.

(a) The creation and continued existence of an Artificial Person is not a right but a conditional grant of legal status by the state and remains subject to complete withdrawal at any time. All powers previously granted to any Artificial Person under Montana law are revoked in their entirety. No Artificial Person operating under the jurisdiction of this state shall possess any power unless specifically granted by this constitution. No provision of this constitution grants or recognizes any power of an Artificial Person to engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity, except as provided in (5)(c).
(b) Transitional Safe Harbor. Nothing in (4)(a) shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or modify any existing contract, debt instrument, security, or other legal obligation validly entered into before the effective date of [this act]; provided, however, that nothing herein authorizes any Election Activity or Ballot Issue Activity after the effective date.



(5) Selective Re-Grant of Artificial Person Powers.

(a) Each Artificial Person possesses the powers defined in (3)(e), unless its organizational documents limit the exercise of such powers, and no powers beyond those expressly granted. No provision of this constitution grants or recognizes any power of an Artificial Person to engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity, except as provided in (5)(c).
(b) Any language in articles of incorporation, organization, association, or other organizational documents purporting to directly or indirectly confer Election-Activity authority or Ballot-Issue-Activity authority to Artificial Persons is void.
(c) Political committees registered under Montana or federal law are entities created for the purpose of engaging in Election Activity and Ballot-Issue Activity. Such committees may be granted the power to engage in those activities provided that they exist solely for that purpose and claim no Charter Privilege other than limited liability. This constitution does not grant any other Artificial Person the power to engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity.
(d) No Charter Privilege shall be construed to authorize Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity. An Artificial Person that exercises Election-Activity authority or Ballot-Issue-Activity authority, unless expressly permitted to do so under (5)(c), initially forfeits all Charter Privileges as a matter of law. The legislature shall, during its first regular session following the effective date of [this act], enact procedures that allow reinstatement upon full disgorgement, certification of compliance, and payment of civil penalties.


(6) Ultra Vires Actions. Any Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity conducted by an Artificial Person is ultra vires and void. Such conduct results in the forfeiture of Charter Privileges as provided in (5)(d) and shall also be subject to civil action by a member, shareholder, or the attorney general for injunctive relief, disgorgement, and confirmation or enforcement of the forfeiture. The legislature shall, during its first regular session following the effective date of [this act], enact procedures for such civil actions.
(7) Severability. If any provision of [this act], or its application to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remaining provisions and applications that are severable shall remain in effect. In such event, no prior grant of corporate powers shall be revived or reinstated, nor shall any court construe [this act] to authorize broader powers than are expressly conferred in [this act].

NEW SECTION. Section 2. Effective date. [This act] is effective January 1, 2027.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dollar-wave.jpg,,,2025-08-01 17:57:02.864069

Blatchford (Diné) — a photographer, artist and activist — told Source New Mexico in an interview that the complicated and obscure world of uranium mining can make activism difficult, especially given that the legacy of uranium mining in Indigenous communities here started as a clandestine project. 
“It feels intimidating. And I think that was the intention of the federal government, to make it this censored thing, because it was a secret to begin with,” she said.

The Friday opening of the Anti-Uranium Mapping Project at CENTER in Santa Fe seeks to, among other objectives, counteract that censorship and intimidation. And it represents a grand unveiling of years of intense work and lifelong curiosity about Blatchford’s roots to the Navajo Nation and its landscape. 
While she’s given various presentations and held exhibits in other states, the homecoming to CENTER is the first time she’s had full creative control over how the project is displayed. And it’s in Santa Fe, where she has lived more than a decade.
The exhibit opens amid a renewed push for uranium mining in New Mexico and shortly after the Navajo Nation reached an agreement with Energy Fuels, a global mining company, to transport uranium across the nation from a mine near the Grand Canyon to a mill in Utah. 
On the New Mexico side of the Navajo Nation, the federal government has recently prioritized several uranium mine proposals here that have been pending for more than a decade. The projects are near Mount Taylor, a sacred mountain to several pueblos in New Mexico, as well as the Navajo people. 
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

Blatchford moved to Santa Fe from California more than a decade ago to attend the Santa Fe Institute of Art and Design. After her mother began a genealogical investigation into her birth parents in the early 1990s, Blatchford as a child visited Santa Fe and reconnected with her aunt and uncle on the Navajo Nation. 
Her interest in the hidden world of uranium mining began shortly after she moved here for college. Once settled, she began poring over satellite imagery of the Navajo Nation to find her aunt’s house, where she had idyllic memories of visiting as a kid. 
“I was just trying to get to my aunt’s house from memory without having to call my mom and get directions. And through that, I was on Google Earth, and that’s when I found this, like, weird black smear, and kind of, like, geometric shapes in the landscape beyond the hills where I remember going on that motorcycle ride with my uncle.”
The “smear” was a giant coal mine, she said. The horror of that discovery led her down a rabbit hole that eventually ended at uranium. Since at least 2011, she’s been gathering photos and maps and stories, along with compiling resources, for a website and in-person exhibit.
Navajo advocates say prez’s approval of uranium transport, Trump coal order feels like a betrayal

Part of her goal is to reclaim the maps used as a tool to plunder resources. Maps are central to the public’s understanding of uranium, she said, but they are also “top down” and “clinical,” showing enforced borders and sterile data. 
“But I feel like, once you come down to the 45-degree angle, and you see the landscape, you get this middle ground of information between the two worlds,” she said. “ And I feel like intuitively, you just have more of a connection and empathy is being instilled. As you’re gathering new information, you’re still kind of grounded somehow.”
Visitors can expect that immersive view of the landscape and people, including photos and videos, and educational material as part of the month-long exhibit. It will focus primarily on the Church Rock spill of 1979. 
On Aug. 14, Blatchford will also host a “counter mapping workshop.” As part of that, she asks participants to annotate top-down maps of the Four Corners region, with the boundaries of tribes and pueblo reservations outlined. 
Among the questions she asks:

,DC,2025-08-01 21:26:09+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,‘A gun to a knife fight’: Democrats' chief pledges a more pugnacious party in more states,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gun-knife-fight-democrats-chief-pledges-more-pugnacious-party-more-states,,"PORTLAND, Oregon — Democrats must be more aggressive organizers and campaigners to win back the working-class coalition they have increasingly lost to President Donald Trump, according to Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin.Too often in recent decades, the party has ceded ground to Republicans, Martin told States Newsroom in a one-on-one July 31 interview during a stop on a visit to community groups, activists and fundraisers in Oregon.Since 2009, the national party’s infrastructure has deteriorated, allowing the GOP to build organizational advantages across the country, define Democratic candidates before they can define themselves and put too many states out of reach, he said.In sometimes more pugnacious terms than might be expected from someone with Martin’s clean-cut corporate look and Midwestern demeanor, he said his task as party leader is to reverse that trend.“We’re not here to tie one of our hands behind our back,” Martin said. “In the past, I think our party would bring a pencil to a knife fight. We’re going to bring a gun to a knife fight.”The knife-fight analogy was an answer to a question about how Democrats should respond to Texas Republicans redrawing congressional district lines as the GOP struggles to keep its slim U.S. House majority, but it could apply to other aspects of Martin’s vision for the party.Martin, whom Democrats elected in February to lead them for the next four years, said Democrats should never turn off their messaging and campaigning apparatus, and work to build party infrastructure in regions, states and cities where they have not competed in decades.Over 45 minutes, he invoked the late U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, a liberal whose populist approach to campaigning and governing practically sanctified him among Democrats in Martin’s native Minnesota, several times and indicated Wellstone would be an effective model for Democrats in 2024 and beyond.“I think what the American people are looking for is people who are going to stand up and fight for what they believe in,” he said. “People didn’t always agree with Paul Wellstone all the time, but they still voted for him. They said … ‘He’s not one of these finger-in-the-wind politicians. He’s standing up for what he believes, and I’m going to give him credit for it even if I don’t agree with him on a particular issue.’ They want authenticity.”Texas redistrictingThe day after Texas Republicans released a map of proposed new congressional districts in a rare mid-decade redistricting effort that could net them five more U.S. House seats, Martin implied he would support blue-state leaders who retaliated with their own maps to give Democrats an advantage — even as he disparaged the move by Republicans.He called the redistricting effort “a craven power grab” by Trump and Republicans, accusing them of “trying to rig the system.”“If they can't win on their own merits, they're going to cheat and steal,” he said. “That's essentially what they're doing right now.”But, even as Martin condemned those moves, he said Democrats should feel empowered to respond in kind. “We can’t be the only party that’s playing by the rules,” he said.Leading Democrats in California, New York and Illinois have openly explored the possibility of emergency redistricting if the proposed Texas map becomes final, even though the issue has raised the ire of some usual allies who support less partisan election infrastructure.The national party would be “very involved” in challenging the Texas map, as well as working with governors seeking to change their own maps, Martin said.Never stop campaigningMartin brought up, unprompted, some of the challenges his party faces.Twice as many voters had an unfavorable view of Democrats as a favorable one in a July Wall Street Journal survey that showed the party with only 33% of support.Voters now see Republicans as the party of working-class voters and Democrats as representatives of the elite, Martin said. In the 2024 election, the party did worse with nearly every slice of the electorate other than college-educated voters and wealthy voters.Martin noted Trump made historic inroads with some traditional Democratic constituencies, earning a higher share of Latino, Black, Asian and Pacific Islander, young and working-class voters in 2024 than any Republican candidate in years.That result was part of an ongoing trend going back 20 years, Martin said, and represents an existential threat to the Democratic party.“We lost ground with every part of our coalition,” he said. “If we continue to lose ground with working people in this country, with all of the other parts of our coalition, we’re toast. We’ve got to reverse course.”Democrats’ slide with those constituencies is in part “a branding issue,” permitted by the party’s willingness to let Trump and other Republicans’ campaigning in off-years go unanswered and a lack of a positive message articulated to voters, said Martin.“We didn’t start our campaign until the spring of 2024 — way too late,” he said. “I would argue that they had already defined us before we ever had a chance to define ourselves. That can never happen again. Never, ever, ever. So that means we have to be campaigning all the time, year-round. Year-round organizing, year-round communications. We never stop talking to voters. We never stop campaigning.”‘We all do better’That campaigning should be focused on a positive view of what Democrats offer voters and include an appeal to “the vast majority of Americans, not just the people at the top.”“We have to fix our brand,” Martin said. “We have to give people a sense that we're fighting for them. We have to stand up and fight with everything we have right now, not just against Donald Trump, but for something. We have to give people a positive vision of what their lives would look like with Democrats in charge.”Democrats’ message should be about a rising tide lifting all boats, Martin said, quoting Wellstone, for whom Martin, 52, interned at the beginning of his career and still considers an inspiration.“Remember Paul’s famous slogan: ‘We all do better when we all do better,’” he said. “That should be the slogan of the Democratic Party.”He praised Zohran Mamdani, the winner of New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary, for running an energetic campaign that was focused on showing how he could improve New Yorkers’ lives.That should include a policy focus on affordability, health care access and a government that works for people beyond the elite.But even as Martin articulated the positive message he said Democrats should focus on, he slipped into slamming Trump and Republicans, saying the tax and spending cuts law Trump signed last month would take health care away from people. The law was among the least popular in decades, he noted.There was room for both a positive campaigning and highlighting Republicans’ unpopularity when appropriate, said Martin.“It’s a both/and,” he said. “Let’s tell folks what is happening and let’s tell folks what Democrats are going to do.”Senate in reach?The unpopularity of Republicans’ law, which is projected to cut more than $1 trillion over 10 years from Medicaid, food stamps and other programs while lowering taxes on high earners, gives Democrats an opening in a difficult cycle for U.S. Senate races, Martin said.Democrats — who control 47 seats, including two independents, compared to 53 for Republicans, who also hold a tie-breaking vote in Vice President JD Vance — need to net four additional seats in next year’s elections to win the majority in the chamber, which Martin said was possible under the right circumstances.That view is out of step with current projections, which show Democratic seats in Georgia and Michigan at least as likely to flip as Republican seats in North Carolina and Maine. Democrats would have to win all four of those most competitive races, plus two that would be further stretches, to gain a majority.Beyond North Carolina and Maine, Martin said the map to Democrats’ regaining the Senate would go through traditionally red states.Iowa, where incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst could be vulnerable, and Alaska, where former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola would be a strong challenger to incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan, could be Democrats’ 50th and 51st Senate seats, he said.Or, if right-wing primary challengers defeat more establishment incumbents in Louisiana and Texas, those states could turn into pickup opportunities, he said — though Trump won both states easily, by more than 20 points in the former.Growing the party, growing the mapTo win next year and beyond, Democrats must unify, he said.Elements of the party that would impose purity tests on others — whether that’s progressives excluding moderates or vice versa — make that harder, he said.“I believe you win elections by addition, not subtraction,” he said. “You win by bringing in people, new voices, and growing your coalition.”Martin also wants to grow the map and compete across the country, using a strategy pioneered by former DNC Chair Howard Dean, who was chair from 2005 to 2009.When President Barack Obama’s political team took control of the party apparatus in 2009, it “completely eviscerated” the state party infrastructure Dean had built, Martin said.Earlier this year, he announced an initiative to provide at least $1 million a month to all state parties. The goal is to expand the number of competitive states and districts, reversing a trend that has seen fewer presidential contests focused on fewer states.“There's no such thing as a perpetual red state or a perpetual blue state,” he said. Turning states from Republican strongholds to competitive, or from competitive to favoring Democrats — or even to maintain Democratic strength — takes investment of money and energy, he said.“It's critical, and it's something I firmly believe in,” he said. I've seen for so many years our national party and other party committees not making the investments to actually call themselves a national party,” he said. “You can't be a national party if you're just competing in seven states.”",,,,2025-08-01 17:57:02.864069

(Photo credit Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Tallahassee’s most famous prisoner is no longer here.
Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of notorious financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — and his  convicted co-conspirator — has been moved from the federal prison in Florida’s capital city to a minimum-security facility in Bryan, Texas.
David Oscar Markus, Maxwell’s Florida lawyer, confirmed in an email that Maxwell had been moved but declined all further comment. Maxwell’s relocation — which happened on Thursday — was first reported by the New York Sun.
It was just last week that Maxwell met with highly placed officials from the U.S. Department of Justice as calls have grown for the release of all files related to Epstein. Epstein died in his New York City jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges for sex trafficking minors. He pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida to procuring and soliciting minors for sex.
Before they entered office, several officials in the administration of President Donald Trump had vowed to open the Epstein files amid speculation about the true nature of his death and his associates. But then, in early July, Attorney General Pam Bondi and others insisted that he had killed himself and that there was no incriminating “client list.”
The uproar over that assertion eventually prompted Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to meet with Maxwell inside the federal courthouse located about four miles from the federal prison where she was incarcerated.
Last week Markus, who is with the firm Markus/Moss PLLC, told reporters that during that meeting that Blanche “asked a lot of questions, and Ms. Maxwell answered every single question. She never invoked a privilege, she never declined to answer.”
Members of Congress had also been pushing to talk to Maxwell but earlier this week it was reported that Maxwell’s attorney told Congress that she needed immunity or a reduction in her 20-year sentence. She also wanted to push her testimony until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on her pending appeal.
On Friday, POLITICO reported that Rep. James Comer, chair of the U.S. House Oversight Committee, had agreed to indefinitely postpone her testimony but said Congress would not offer her immunity.
Some Trump opponents lashed out at the decision to transfer Maxwell, saying her new home is a “cushy” location and questioned why a “registered sex offender” would be moved unless she has a deal pending with the Trump administration.
“They have put herself somewhere that is very, very comfortable,” said long-time Trump critic Rick Wilson on a video he put out on Friday afternoon. “Ghislaine Maxwell being moved to the cushiest federal prison that there is is not a coincidence. It is not a routine transfer. Something happened here that caused this to occur.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)South Dakota’s secretary of state is taking responsibility for the release of sensitive voter registration data, after her office published a spreadsheet that labeled thousands of residents as having registered to vote at government assistance agencies.
“As Secretary of State, I take full responsibility for the release of this information. My office is committed to both transparency and protecting voter privacy,” Secretary of State Monae Johnson said in a statement. “Upon discovering the issue, we acted immediately to remove the data and prevent further dissemination.”
The data was posted online following the passage of a new law requiring the state’s full voter registration list to be freely available to the public. But among the fields included in the data was “Source of Registration,” which publicly identified people who registered at offices for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or the Women, Infants and Children program. 
In all, 7,186 people were labeled as having registered to vote while applying for public assistance, according to a Searchlight analysis.

This drew criticism from lawmakers and the public alike.
“This is what happens when you put the wrong people in charge,” said state House Minority Leader Erin Healy, D-Sioux Falls, who voted against the bill. “We talk a lot about freedom and privacy in this state, so it’s a shame that this legislation led to this type of breach.”
The list contains the information of about 668,419 registered voters — their names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, party registrations and other personal information.
The South Dakota Secretary of State’s Office “apologizes for the disclosure of information,” according to the statement, and is committed to “restoring public trust following this error.”
While voter registration at a public assistance agency does not necessarily mean a person receives benefits, Johnson said her office will notify affected individuals by mail. She said county auditors have also been contacted, and individuals who accessed the original data will be asked to delete any copies.
The new law, which passed earlier this year with some bipartisan support and went into effect in July, was sold as increasing transparency in elections by making voter registration information accessible without a $2,500 fee. Activists who favor the hand-counting of ballots, oppose the use of vote-counting machines and deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election were among those who promoted the legislation as an “election integrity” measure.
The Secretary of State’s Office said voters with concerns are encouraged to contact the office directly.

While Stand With Trans’ Ally Parents Hotline is not a crisis line, Roz Gould Keith, the organization’s founder, said the group is looking to offer love at the other end of the line. 
“A lot of times people call and they just need someone to hear them, right? They just need someone to call them by their chosen name. They need someone to call them by the right pronouns and they don’t necessarily need more than that,” Keith said. 
Sometimes a caller might need advice on coming out to their parents or information like where to find a chest binder, Keith said, and the support person on the line can help them find those resources even if they are not immediately available. 
Stand With Trans’ mission is to support and empower trans youth and their loved ones, Keith explained, and one way to do that is to ensure parents are knowledgeable and have access to resources and support.

The organization’s Ally Parents program was initially put together in response to the death of Leelah Alcorn, a transgender girl who took her life in 2014 citing a lack of acceptance from her parents. Keith said she was in a Facebook group with other parents of transgender kids, when the idea first came together. 
“We started talking and commiserating, and our hearts were just breaking over this unnecessary tragedy, and we said we have to do something,” Keith said. 
Out of those conversations came Ally Moms, with the group publishing the first names of mothers of trans children, the state where they lived and a phone number where they invited young people to text them for support. 
“There was really nothing out there in the way of resources, and so it was really groundbreaking at the time, and we started getting a lot of texts, and then parents started calling and it kind of expanded,” Keith explained. 
The program became Ally Parents, and expanded to a network of 250 parents across the county in almost every state, Keith explained. 
However, the program became unwieldy, as the organization didn’t have a phone system or a way to process calls, Keith said, with Stand With Trans taking a pause in promoting the program. 

“It was still kind of there in the background. People could see the list on our website, but we didn’t promote it because we really wanted to figure out the best way to secure the calls,” Keith said. 
When Stand With Trans received a grant in 2024, that’s when the hotline came into play, Keith said. The group was able to hire two co-coordinators who Keith said found the perfect platform to host the hotline. 
“People can text or call the toll free number, and it’s for youth, it’s for adult caregivers, really anybody that needs to talk to an ally parent. And so this way it just kind of routes through to the next available person. So it just makes a lot more sense. We don’t have to put anyone’s name or phone number out on the internet,” Keith said. “It came at the best time, because now, with the trans hotline being eliminated, defunded, we’re offering this up.”
Tess Sokolis, one of the program’s co-coordinators, told the Michigan Advance in an email that she connected with Ally Moms in 2018 when her son was five years into his transition. 
“To have found those resources and to have had this community available to us when our son was starting his transition would have been an absolute godsend,” Sokolis said. 
Like many other ally parents in the program, Sokolis said her family faced several hurdles: working to find healthcare for her son after their family doctor refused to care for him; becoming estranged from family members; updating his name and gender on documents and accounts and seeking out colleges that not only offered gender affirming care, but also welcomed trans individuals. 
“We did all of this blindly and by the seats of our pants, but we did it,” Sokolis said.

Alongside her co-coordinator, Dani Jackson, Sokolis said she was brought in to revamp the Ally Parents program amid an increasingly anti-trans political climate. 
“Our process so far has been two-fold: one, contacting every Ally Parent in our database to reconfirm their commitment to the program as we worked to move it forward; and two, creating this hotline and learning it ourselves to then train our parents with the new phone system,” Sokolis said. 
The hotline soft launched at the end of June, Sokolis said, giving them the opportunity to work out any hiccups with the program. Now, there are 30 parents on board to help accept calls, with others working administratively and more being brought on board, Sokolis said. 
“We are saddened at the loss of other national LGBTQIA+ hotlines, but we are happy to give these kids and their loved ones a safe place to land as those are phased out,” Sokolis said. 
For many trans youths, having a service like this can be life changing, Keith said, as many trans kids can feel isolated, especially when they don’t know anyone who shares their identity.

While transgender and nonbinary youth are at a significantly higher risk of suicide than their cisgender peers, research published in Transgender Health found that acceptance by at least one adult or peer significantly reduced that risk. 
For parents, they face a very different journey when their child comes out as trans, Keith said. Even if they support their child unconditionally right out of the gate, they do not know how to find resources or what the next steps are, she said. 
“It truly is life changing when we can offer up that kind of support,” Keith said. “I have a trans son who’s now an adult, but when he came out 12 years ago, we really were alone. There were no resources. And so I know what that feels like, and it is just, when you find one person you can talk to, you will remember that forever.” 
In order for someone to volunteer as an ally parent, they must be the parent of a trans person, Keith explained. They must also fill out an application and undergo a background check. 
Assuming everything goes well, those parents are then given access to training as well as monthly meetings, Keith explained. 
“If answering the phone is not your thing – because some people don’t feel comfortable with that, right – then there are other ways that they can get involved,” Keith said. 
Individuals can call or text 833-435-7798 to connect with the Ally Parents Helpline. Volunteers are available from 8 a.m. to midnight EST.

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Employees at one of Washington state’s largest health agencies are bracing for layoffs due to ongoing funding challenges.
Though how many could lose their jobs and when aren’t known, the leader of the Washington Health Care Authority told workers in a Wednesday email that she “didn’t want to wait to let you know that layoffs will be part of our path forward.”
“Despite significant efforts to close our budget gap, we’ve reached a point where workforce reductions will be necessary,” wrote MaryAnne Lindeblad, the agency’s interim director who will hand the baton to a new executive this month. “These decisions are not a reflection of anyone’s performance or value; they’re driven by the size of our shortfall and the structure of our funding.”
With roughly 1,900 employees, the agency is responsible for purchasing and coordinating health care services, including behavioral health treatment, for 2.7 million residents.
It administers the state’s Medicaid program known as Apple Health and health benefits for public and school employees. As of June, more than 1.9 million Washington residents, including over 850,000 children, were enrolled in Apple Health, according to the state Health Care Authority. 
In June, Gov. Bob Ferguson hired Ryan Moran, Maryland’s deputy health secretary, to be the new Health Care Authority director. HIs first day is Aug. 18.
A Health Care Authority spokesperson did not say if Moran had been consulted on the email before Lindeblad sent it out. 
Nor did the spokesperson say if the layoffs are due to the agency receiving fewer dollars in the state budget or to the tangible threat posed by new federal rules for Medicaid funding.
“A reduction in force at HCA is deeply difficult news for employees and the communities we serve,” said Katie Pope, deputy chief communications director, in an email. “We are working to responsibly manage limited resources while continuing to meet our legal and programmatic commitments to Washington residents.”
Mike Yestramski, president of the Washington Federation of State Employees, said the union had not received formal notice of layoffs as required in collective bargaining agreements. The union represents 54,000 state government, higher education and public service workers including ones at the Health Care Authority.
“Folks are definitely concerned. They are definitely worried,” he said. “It is a combination. They wonder how long. ‘I survived this round. Will I be around for the next one?’”
What’s happening at the Health Care Authority isn’t an anomaly. State workers have lost jobs or been pressed into lower-paying positions in recent months as agencies comply with cost-cutting directives from the governor and reduced funding for some programs in the state budget.

One example is the Department of Health where layoffs totaled 44 as of June 30. Less state dollars and the loss of federal pandemic money were the reasons. Further layoffs are anticipated as a result of state and federal budget reductions, a spokesperson said.
According to the Office of Financial Management, 176 people lost their jobs in the fiscal year that ended June 30 with another 96 bumping into a different position. 
The figure could surge in the coming 12 months because lawmakers did not fund 1,385 full-time-equivalent positions in state government in the current fiscal year, according to the governor’s budget office.
“We knew there would be rounds of layoffs,” Yestramski said. 
Agency leaders seem to be trying to minimize the impacts on people, he said. In some places, positions are kept vacant and thus available for someone to bump into without bumping someone else out of their job, he said.
“But you can’t get away without some folks getting harmed,” Yestramski said.
In June, Washington’s Employment Security Department started hosting webinars to teach state workers who were laid off, facing a furlough or expecting a workforce reduction about available unemployment benefits and reemployment services.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) New Mexico United States senators introduced federal legislation Friday to expand tree nursery capacity for forest replanting and habitat restoration programs.
U.S. Sens.Ben Ray Luján and Martin Heinrich, both Democrats, joined John Cornyn (R-Texas) to sponsor the bill. The legislation, if passed, would allow funding allocated by the 2022 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support bigger facilities for seedling nurseries at state forestry, private organizations, nonprofits and higher education institutes.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed more $1.5 billion in state and private forestry, including hundreds of millions for reforestation, but cannot be used for building physical structures to increase the nurseries.
The funding would be available for expanding public forestry development, such as the John T. Harrington Forestry Research Center in Mora County.
“In New Mexico and across the country, our forests play a vital role in every community,” Luján said in a statement. “Tragically, over the last 20 years, our country has lost tree cover at an alarming rate, disrupting our ecosystem and the critical benefits it provides. That’s why I’m leading this bipartisan legislation that addresses this shortage by allowing funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to be used to support the development of seedling nurseries and the rapid expansion of crucial seedlings nationwide.”

New Mexico’s state forester estimated the state needs between 150 and 390 million seedlings to restore forests in burned areas. Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burn scar will require 26 million seedlings, researchers said.
The state previously received federal funding to increase the capacity of the nursery in Mora County to eventually grow 5 million seedlings per year. Currently, the center produces just 300,000 seedlings annually.
The center, jointly operated by University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, New Mexico Highlands University and the state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department would seek funds if the bill passes, officials said.
“This bill will provide New Mexico with much-needed support to develop our state nursery and increase the production of drought-tolerant tree seedlings,” said EMNRD Secretary Melanie Kenderdine in a statement. “This legislation will help us grow and plant trees that will stabilize burned watersheds and reduce damage from post-wildfire flooding.”

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)After Democratic state lawmakers and advocates said they feared Gregory Washington’s job as president of George Mason University was in jeopardy as the school faces multiple federal investigations, the governing board on Friday unanimously approved a state-appropriated 1.5% salary increase for him, signaling the security of his future at the institution.
George Mason professors say governing board failed to defend president, university

Attention on Washington and GMU has grown steadily over the past several weeks, after the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice launched four investigations against the school, two of which are related to alleged racial discrimination in employment practices and another that questions the school’s DEI practices.
State leaders also called for a stop to what they characterize as the politicization of Virginia’s colleges after the University of Virginia’s president resigned weeks before the GMU investigations launched, following downward pressure from federal education officials over the school’s DEI policies. 
The board had scheduled a closed session meeting on Friday to discuss Washington’s performance and goals. He presented his state-of-the-institution report, “Navigating Rough Waters,” during Thursday’s annual President’s Conference and Friday’s business meeting. Washington is the first Black president in the school’s history.
“Regardless of how one views the events unfolding at George Mason University, today’s display of unity by the Mason community is inspiring,” Washington said in a statement. “It is a reminder of how centrally important our university is to Northern Virginia’s families and economy. For now, the community can refocus on what really matters most: in just three weeks we will welcome the incoming class of 2025, which is once again the largest, most diverse and one of the most qualified freshman classes in the history of George Mason. Fellow Patriots, you are simply the best. Let’s get back to work.”
The board, which had recently been criticized by faculty members for failing to defend Washington and George Mason as they weathered the federal scrutiny, met for over three hours in closed session with Washington. 
The 1.5% salary bonus aligns with the action proposed by the General Assembly’s budget that was signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Washington’s salary will increase to $823,452.43.
Board of Visitors Rector Charles Stimson commented on the impending investigations and public concerns before leaving the business meeting.
“We’re gonna fulfill our fiduciary duty, and at George Mason University that means everybody at the university,” Stimson said, adding that the board will “get through this” and “move onto the next level.”
 Alumni and supporters speak out 

Just ahead of Friday’s meeting, Stand With Mason, a group of alumni and GMU supporters publicly stated their opposition to removing Washington from office. Students, faculty and other supporters also stood in the drizzling rain to protest against removing Washington.
In Stand With Mason’s statement, 75% of respondents said they would be concerned about the institution’s reputation if political interference led to the president’s removal. The group surveyed 411 registered voters from Northern Virginia.
“This data could not be clearer: Northern Virginia voters want their public universities focused on education — not politics,” said Brian Drummond, former George Mason Alumni Association President, in a statement. “The Board of Visitors’ actions are not just unpopular — they are dangerously out of step with public opinion, especially as we approach the November elections.”
Jimmy Hazel, former rector on the board, said before the board’s vote on Washington’s that he wouldn’t be surprised if they voted to pause on the matter, considering the outpouring of support and potential negative impact on George Mason. Hazel was part of the search committee that ultimately found Washington.
“They’re realizing there is more at stake than they thought, than just removing somebody from their job,” Hazel said. “From a realistic point of view, the federal investigations aren’t finished yet to take action against the president while the investigations are still ongoing; that just doesn’t make sense.”

Students and faculty members also feared that Washington’s removal could eliminate more initiatives and programs the president has championed. Washington said the institution has paused or terminated 50 projects due to the federal government’s restructuring. 
Savannah Scott and Annabelle Spencer, PhD students in the history department, stood outside for around two hours before the meeting to bring awareness about what’s at stake.
“These things that we’ve seen either get surrendered to the federal government or given up entirely at other universities (are) highly possible here, and I think that’s really concerning to me and us,” Spencer said.
Scott added that Washington has remained “steadfast” in his support for university policies at the cost of upsetting others at higher levels that wish to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. She voiced her concern that Washington might be succeeded by someone who would excessively accommodate the Trump administration.
DEI has been a lightning rod between political parties dating back to the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, when these types of programs were created to assist formerly enslaved Black Americans and give them a fairer chance at educational, financial and social success in American society. 
Public demand for corporate and institutional commitments to treat all Americans fairly emerged during the pandemic in 2020 when Washington was hired. Beginning in 2020, America faced two high-profile examples of racial injustice and unequal opportunity for people of color — the murder of Black Minnesota man George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer, and the Supreme Court’s recission of affirmative action policies on college campuses in 2023.

Republicans argue that DEI initiatives present cultural, ideological and political problems. Chief among the concerns is the threat of placing a person’s identity over achievements when determining their qualifications, and “reverse discrimination,” which they say puts the majority, white Americans, at a disadvantage.
During the board’s hours-long review of Washington’s performance, students and faculty members also raised signs and chanted in support of Washington and in opposition to any overreach by Trump and Youngkin, who is responsible for appointing members to the governing board.
On Tuesday, a circuit court judge temporarily suspended four members from serving on GMU’s board after the Virginia Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections rejected the appointees, signaling that the legislature wasn’t willing to confirm the new additions. An additional four were suspended at the University of Virginia and Virginia Military Institute. The case is expected to continue with appeals from Youngkin’s administration.
Tehama Lopez, a faculty member at George Mason, said on Friday she’s been following the investigations in Virginia including one that led to the departure of former UVA President Jim Ryan. Lopez said it hit home for her as a UVA graduate.
“It’s devastating to see what’s happened,” Lopez said. “I wish that President Ryan had not stepped down. I’m sympathetic to what he did, but I believe we need to stand firm and not acquiesce.”
 How Washington made the case for staying

On Thursday, Washington spoke publicly to the senior leadership at George Mason, presenting the institution’s current state highlighted by the school retiring $100 million in debt and earning the designation “higher access, higher earnings” for its top-rated admissions access for Pell Grant recipients and students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and the number of students receiving high earnings eight years after graduation. 
The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, which assigns the ratings, manages the measurement tool to recognize and describe institutional diversity.
“We’re fulfilling the mission that I believe the individuals who founded this institution had in mind, to have an institution that was going to produce a workforce that could fund their needs and their growth,” Washington said on Thursday. “That mission is being fulfilled here, and we’re reaching people wherever you are. … We don’t care if you’re Black, white, Asian, or other. We put systems in place to support you no matter where you are, and it gets you to the point where you want to be. That’s why students are flocking here because they actually know it.”
Stimson said Thursday that the institution has worked hard to build its successful reputation, and parents considering universities should choose Mason if they want their children to succeed without significant debt.

“Mason isn’t going anywhere,” Stimson said on Thursday. “We are the best university for the best value, for the best outcomes in Virginia, in the DMV.”
Washington also talked about the school’s challenges including multiple investigations by Trump‘s administration and the federal government’s restructuring, which has cut funds for research and financial aid, economic challenges that are projected to result in job, wage, and output losses and enrollment challenges, with some non-U.S. born students prohibited from receiving visas to attend school.
The U.S. House Committee on Judiciary is also investigating Mason for potentially violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and President Donald Trump’s executive order for institutions to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, according to a July 29 letter.
Despite the challenges, Washington said Mason is one of the most efficient institutions in reducing the cost of attendance and graduating a significant portion of Virginia’s workforce.
Washington also presented details on the institution’s fundraising efforts and programs to support students who had dreamed of working for the federal government, as well as displaced federal workers amid the significant workforce changes.
“Why would we do this? Because we are an integral part of the region,” Washington said. “We want the region to be successful, we care about the region and we need it to be successful if we are going to be successful.”

(Photo by Vanesa Brashier/Bluebonnetnews.com)Hispanic, Asian and multiracial residents drove population growth in the United States last year,  and 16 states would have lost population without gains in those groups, according to a new analysis published this week by the Brookings Institution.
In three states where the number of residents declined — Mississippi, Vermont and West Virginia — growth in those communities prevented even greater population loss, according to the analysis.
Immigration drives nation’s population growth

Nationwide, the 1% population growth for the year was mostly fueled by immigration, representing “a much-needed uptick from the historically low population growth of the COVID-19 period, along with the diminishing growth of recent decades,” the Brookings report said.
Recent Census Bureau data breaking down changes by race and Hispanic status show that Hispanic, Asian and multiracial categories made up 93% of the nation’s population growth. The number of Black and Native people also grew but at a much slower rate, while the white population declined.
Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people made up 86% of the growth in Texas, which had the largest population growth for the year at almost 563,000, and 78% of the growth in Florida, which ranked second for growth at about 467,000. California, which grew by about 233,000, would have lost population without growth in those groups.
In addition to California, 15 other states would have lost population, but grew instead, because of larger numbers of Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington.

Frank of the National Park Service | Public domain via Flickr). The state of Montana has reached an agreement with an exclusive golf club for water usage, after the club was found to be illegally diverting water for its course and trucking in water from nearby communities.
The Department of Natural Resources and Conservation reached an agreement late last month with how Crazy Mountain Ranch was using water. 
The state filed suit against Crazy Mountain Ranch, a Delaware corporation that owns 18,000 acres near Big Timber, in mid-July over an irrigation system it was using for its golf course. The company is a subsidiary of the Yellowstone Club’s parent organization, CrossHarbor Capital Partners. The resort did not have the proper water rights to divert from Rock Creek for irrigation of its golf course.
The agreement, called a “consent decree,” avoided a court battle.
“(This is)  a litigation tool for judicial enforcement signed by the district court judge and used to remedy the violation and ensure future compliance,” Patricia Spencer, a spokesperson in the DNRC’s water division wrote in an email. “The decree requires CMR to stop illegally using water on its golf course.  If CMR purchases water to irrigate, it is required to report the source of the water purchased to DNRC to ensure it complies with the Water Use Act. CMR must also continue to pursue a new permit or change authorization.”
Crazy Mountain Ranch did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“(The ranch) does not have a valid water right that authorizes beneficial use of water for irrigation on the 112 acres of the proposed golf course,” the suit alleged.
In May, court documents said the company told local water users, “the ranch intended to irrigate the golf course regardless of department authorization.” The DNRC then got 12 complaints between its field offices in Bozeman and Helena.
On June 17, water users on Rock Creek and Hammond Creek submitted a “Petition to Enforce Water Court Decree and Appoint Water Commissioner” to the Park County District Court. 
An official with the DNRC was dispatched to investigate the complaints and issued a report in early July. A lawsuit was then filed.
Crazy Mountain Ranch has a permit in process for changes in water usage, court documents stated. 
While the dispute was going, the Livingston Enterprise reported the company was buying 80,000 to 100,000 gallons per day from the city.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/49945863331_bcd4562ef1_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 16:56:28.844556

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The overdue assessment of the operations and finances of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) is complete and confirms what advocates and agency administrators have been saying for months: There’s no way to save costs without cutting service.
The 119-page report released Friday morning deems RIPTA “an essential service for the region” with a fixed-route service that performs well, especially within urban corridors.
But what can RIPTA do about its $10 million budget shortfall?
“Given the size of the projected operating deficit for FY 2026, RIPTA will likely need to make reductions to fixed-route service,” the report states. 
A sweeping number of cuts are proposed — with plans to eliminate or reduce 58 of RIPTA’s 67 routes — the largest service reduction in the agency’s 59-year history. The agency’s board of directors is scheduled to vote on the cuts on Thursday, Aug. 7, after the last two of 12 public hearings wrap up in Barrington on Wednesday, Aug. 6.
Should the agency’s board of directors move forward with the recommendations, cuts would take effect Sept. 13.
 
The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority‘s public hearings on proposed service reductions and a possible bus fare increase in 2027 continue Monday, Aug. 4, with two sessions at the Providence Foundation, from noon to 1:30 p.m and from 5-6:30 p.m.
The final two hearings will be held Wednesday, Aug. 6, at the Barrington Public Library from noon to 1:30 p.m and from 5-6:30 p.m. 
You can submit comments through Aug. 6 by emailing marketing@ripta.com or (401) 784-9500 x1101.


The efficiency study was requested to be completed by March 1 by Gov. Dan McKee and the General Assembly as a condition in last year’s state budget as a condition to plug a $15 million deficit. But the agency’s board of directors was focused on finding a permanent CEO and didn’t commission Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP to conduct the study until March 27.
WSP was paid $412,346 to complete the report.
RIPTA released three draft sections in the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session in order to inform the state’s final budget, which ultimately left RIPTA with a $17.6 million gap to fill.
The deficit was originally $32.6 million when McKee unveiled his recommended fiscal 2026 budget in January, but lawmakers eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase on the state’s gas tax and by upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account. 
RIPTA administrators managed to reduce the shortfall to $10 million, thanks to what RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand called a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan. 
WSP’s report does provide a few recommendations: try to secure more ads, upping third party service contracts, and in one case, the sale of station naming rights. But those ideas are meant to be implemented over the course of several years.
With the multimillion dollar gap left by state leaders, the study’s primary suggestion is to slash service — primarily to low-scoring routes.
Those routes in the report include the 88 bus, which travels in the morning and afternoon from Simmons Village in Cranston to the Walmart off Plainfield Pike; Route 69, which connects the University of Rhode Island to the Port of Galilee; and the 59X express route in North Smithfield and Lincoln.
All of them are slated for elimination under RIPTA’s proposed service changes.
But even the report stated that low-scoring routes may still serve important functions by connecting specific transit-oriented populations to essential goods and services 
“In such cases, maintaining the current service may be warranted despite lower performance metrics,” the report states.
Instead, WSP suggests folding the lower-performing routes with the more popular ones or converting them into “microtransit zones” that feed into the larger fixed-route system.

Bus fare has remained $2 for 15 years
The report also floats the idea of bumping up RIPTA’s $2 single ride fare, which has been in place since 2010. WSP suggests increasing trip costs could generate around $1 million to $2 million annually. 
But the report states a price hike could discourage some riders from continuing to use transit, “such that it diminishes the total revenue increase that would have occurred if all riders continued using transit.” 
“Some estimates suggest travel demand reduces by roughly half the fare increase, such that a 10% fare increase would result in [a] 5% decrease in travel demand,” according to the report. It cited a 2021 study that found riders in Stockholm County in Sweden who took longer trips or had higher incomes were more likely to stop riding after fares increased in 2017, while metro users were  least affected.
Agency leaders have previously said they want to conduct an analysis of the impacts of a potential fare increase on “ridership, revenue, and equity.” Fare increases may be considered for 2027, according to the presentation RIPTA is giving at its public hearings on proposed service changes.
RIPTA and its board of directors are in the process of reviewing the suggestions and incorporating them into the agency’s daily operations, agency spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry said in a statement.
The Save RIPTA campaign, an offshoot of the Providence Streets Coalition, saw no surprises in the report in a statement Friday afternoon.
“The study told us exactly what we’ve known all along: that RIPTA runs efficiently compared to similar sized agencies, and that there is no way to prevent catastrophic cuts to service,” the coalition wrote. “There is no hidden money in any couch cushions, that will prevent tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders from losing access to employment, education, economic mobility, medical services, and more,” the campaign wrote in a statement.
The Providence Streets Coalition launched the Save RIPTA campaign in 2023 to lobby state leaders to fully fund the agency in the face of looming budget deficits caused by federal pandemic aid drying up.
And with proposed cuts now up for consideration, the campaign is looking to get riders to push McKee and other state leaders to shift any funding that can keep the agency’s existing service afloat.
“$10 million out of a $14 billion budget is so minimal compared to the harm and economic consequences of these cuts,” the campaign wrote.
But McKee has stood firm against flexing any state funds, pointing to the efficiency study as a way to find savings. Spokesperson Olivia DaRocha said Friday the full study “identifies both efficiencies and revenue enhancements to close RIPTA’s remaining deficit responsibly.”
“Combined, these strategies provide RIPTA with viable options to balance the budget without making service reductions to higher-performing routes,” DaRocha said in an emailed statement.










Given the size of the projected operating deficit for FY 2026, RIPTA will likely need to make reductions to fixed-route service.


– Rhode Island Public Transit Authority Operational Efficiency Study Final Report July 31st, 2025


In a joint statement, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson said they were in the midst of reviewing the final efficiency study.
“Our state needs a strong and sustainable public transit system, because it is so important for the health of our economy and for the quality of life of thousands of Rhode Islanders,” they said. “We will continue working with RIPTA’s leadership, and all our partners, to help RIPTA meet the needs of Rhode Islanders.”
Political leaders are already putting pressure on the state to halt RIPTA’s proposed cuts.
Less service will mean more cars on the road and fewer available parking spaces, Democratic Rep. Teresa Tanzi said Wednesday at a public hearing in South Kingstown where she lives.
“The efficiency that we’re going to lose if these cuts do in fact go through is exponential,” she said. “We won’t be able to recover from this overnight.”
In a joint statement Thursday, Pawtucket Mayor Donald Grebien and the city’s General Assembly delegation said the proposed cuts “will have devastating consequences for our most vulnerable citizens.”
“It is unfair for the working class to shoulder the burden of budget shortfalls,” Pawtucket leaders said. “Our community members deserve the same inalienable rights provided to all members of society, regardless of class, to provide for themselves and their families, and for many, public transit is their only option.”

A real estate developer is suing the City of Bondurant, alleging changes in plans for streets could cost the company millions of dollars.
Hubbell Realty Company Bondurant, also known as HRC, is suing the city in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
HRC claims that in 2021, it purchased land in the city near Highway 65 for $2.3 million. Its city-approved plans for the land allegedly preserved for future development two multifamily lots on which HRC planned to build apartments. The preliminary plat specified the location of roadways and was allegedly approved by the Bondurant City Council.

In August 2022, HRC began construction on the development, including the construction of roadways as previously approved by the city. At some point later that summer, the lawsuit claims, city officials decided the planned 16th Street NE should be relocated in such a way as to run through the center of the land where the HRC planned to build the Featherstone Apartments.
As a result, the lawsuit alleges, “HRC will be forced to redesign the subdivision, and HRC will lose millions of dollars. Put another way, had HRC been made aware of the modified roadway in 2021, then it would have structured the entire development in a different way.”
The company claims the modification to the roadway plans also creates a safety risk.
“Imagine a residential thoroughfare running directly through an apartment complex to separate its playground, pool, or other amenities from the residences,” the lawsuit states, adding that new design moves the intersection of 16th Street NE and Highway 65 “dangerously close” to the intersection of 14th Street NE and Highway 65.
“There has been no safety review by the Department of Transportation or anyone else to compare the safety of the proposed intersections contained in the preliminary plat versus the safety of the new concept approved in July 2024,” the lawsuit claims. It alleges city officials say the reason for the change is to assist with a new commercial development that is planned for the other side of Highway 65 in 2028.
HRC argues that the total loss of acreage from the planned changes, and the resulting increase in costs, is the “equivalent to a loss of nearly $2 million to HRC.” The company is seeking a court judgment finding that the Bondurant City Council’s actions constitute violations of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
The city has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)The Republican National Committee and the Montana Republican Party last week filed a motion to intervene in a lawsuit challenging two “commonsense” election laws passed during the 2025 Legislature.
The Montana Federation of Public Employees filed a suit in May before Lewis and Clark County District Court, challenging the constitutionality of Senate Bill 490, which changed voter registration opportunities, and Senate Bill 276, which strengthened voter ID laws.
The Republican groups’ brief in support of the motion to intervene said the lawsuit would “impact the Republican Party’s distinct interests in an efficient and reliable 2026 election that voters trust.”
“Voter ID and accurate voter registration are essential to secure elections,” RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement. “Democrat extremists are attacking Montana’s voter ID requirements and registration safeguards. The RNC and MTGOP are stepping in to protect the integrity of Montana’s elections and ensure only eligible Montana voters can cast a ballot.”
Both bills were sponsored by state Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka.
SB 490 tightened the deadline for voters to register to vote to noon on Election Day and eliminates registration on the Monday before an election, but opens it on the prior Saturday, which previously was not a day voters could register.
Under previous Montana law, anyone in line at the ballot box by 8 p.m. on Election Day could register to vote, which has occasionally led to long lines at voting locations.
Last November, some voters waited in line at the Gallatin County Courthouse until the early hours of the morning in order to register and cast their ballot.
Cuffe, in an opinion piece published by Lee Newspapers, cited that example — when votes were cast as late as 4 a.m. — as a reason for passing his bill.

The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Blackfeet Nation, the Fort Belknap Indian Community, and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, as well as tribal advocacy nonprofit Western Native Voice, filed to join the lawsuit as intervenors last month, saying the Legislature was insisting on “making it more difficult for Native Americans in Montana to vote,” by restricting registration opportunities.
In the Republican groups’ brief, they cited several reasons for inclusion in the lawsuit, including that declaring the laws unconstitutional would “undermine Republican voter confidence in the electoral system and create administrative problems that could undermine Republican turnout.”
It would also force the state and federal political party to “divert resources from other mission-critical activities toward get-out-the-vote activities to reinspire Republican voter trust in Montana’s electoral system, to independently verify the accuracy of Montana’s voter registration rolls, and to educate voters and candidates concerning Montana’s changed registration requirements.”

Article Summary

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and other Democratic attorneys general are suing the Trump administration over policies to limit gender-affirming care for youths.
The lawsuit argues the policies violate states’ 10th Amendment right to regulate health care.
Many Illinois health care providers have stopped providing gender-affirming care to comply with federal orders.
Raoul declined to say whether health care providers should continue providing gender-affirming care while a federal judge considers the lawsuit.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is joining a multi-state lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from limiting gender-affirming care.
The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts district court by 17 states, argues an executive order signed in January by President Donald Trump that directs federal agencies to take “appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving federal research and education grants end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children” violates states’ 10th Amendment right to regulate medical care.
The order defines “children” as people under age 19, which the attorneys general say conflicts with many states such as Illinois, where people are generally considered adults when they turn 18. A separate executive order by the president established that the federal government only recognizes two genders.
It also seeks to block two Department of Justice orders that direct the DOJ to investigate and enforce legal action against doctors, hospitals and other medical professionals that provide gender-affirming care to youths.
The orders use “cruel, demeaning language” to “undermine the legitimacy” of medical care, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference Friday.
“This administration is driving a wedge between patients and health care providers from providing patients the health care that they need,” Raoul said.
Also troubling to the attorneys general is the prospect of criminal prosecution against doctors who provide care.
“The Department of Justice is diverting valuable law enforcement resources away from catching criminals and predators who are actually harming children,” Raoul said. “How does any of this keep our children or our communities safer?”
Guidance to Illinois doctors
The orders have also caused Illinois health care providers to stop providing types of gender-affirming care, including University of Chicago Medical Center, UI Health, Rush, Northwestern Medicine and Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago.
Though Raoul said he opposes the Trump administration’s policies and believes they are illegal, he declined to give legal advice about whether Illinois health care providers should continue following the federal directives while the lawsuit proceeds.
“I am not a health care administrator; I am not the head of a hospital that’s being threatened with potential criminal investigation or prosecution or removal of funding that goes toward saving the lives of various patients,” Raoul said. “And so I am not in the position of either advising what administrative decisions should be made at hospitals.”
Raoul said his role is to “remove” legal threats against the state and its residents.
Medical providers that decide to stop providing gender-affirming care are likely not guilty of discrimination under Illinois law, Raoul said, “particularly if the federal government is threatening you with criminal prosecution.” He added Illinois laws don’t require doctors to provide a full range of gender-affirming care.
Illinois has numerous laws on the books establishing legal gender-affirming care, including protections for Illinois health care providers from prosecution and other disciplinary action in other states for giving legal health care to patients in Illinois that might be considered illegal in another state.

(Photo: NPS / Jacob W. Frank)In a 1968 speech made while signing a series of conservation bills, President Lyndon B. Johnson expounded on the wonders of a free-flowing river. 
“An unspoiled river is a very rare thing in this nation today,” he said. “Their flow and vitality have been harnessed by dams and too often they have been turned into open sewers by communities and by industries. It makes us all very fearful that all rivers will go this way unless somebody acts now to try to balance our river development.”
Johnson signed the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to protect free-flowing waterways with “extraordinary natural, cultural and recreational qualities.”
The original National Wild and Scenic Rivers system comprised eight rivers and included more than two dozen more to study for future protections, including Montana’s Flathead River.
Just eight years later, Congress amended the act to include the three forks of the Flathead River, and a stretch of the Missouri River. 
Today, more than 13,467 miles of 228 rivers are protected by the national system, but according to the Department of the Interior, this represents less than one half of one percent of the nation’s rivers.
Montana’s western Rep. Ryan Zinke hopes to bolster Montana’s wild and scenic river mileage by roughly 25%.
At a press conference in Bozeman on Tuesday, Zinke announced new legislation to designate an additional nearly 100 miles of river in Madison and Gallatin counties as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
“Striking the right balance between conservation and multiple use of our resources is the Montana way. These rivers support everything from family farms to fly shops, ranchers to rafters, and literally power our community,” Zinke, a former Interior Secretary during President Trump’s first term, said in a press statement. “Madison and Gallatin Counties both rely on these waters for irrigation and energy, but also for the outdoor recreation economy that fuels small businesses and draws visitors from around the world. This bill strikes the right balance between preserving what we treasure, maintaining access for recreation, and ensuring continued operation of the existing dams on the river.”
The Greater Yellowstone Recreation Enhancement and Tourism Act would add protections to 98 miles of the Madison River and Gallatin River. 
The designations include:

42 miles of the Madison River, from the Cabin Creek confluence to Cherry Gulch 
39.6 miles of the Gallatin River, from the Yellowstone National Park boundary to Spanish Creek 
4.6 miles of Hyalite Creek, from its headwaters to Grotto Falls Trailhead 
7.3 miles of Cabin Creek, beginning at its headwaters 
5.1 miles of the Middle Fork Cabin Creek, from its headwaters to its confluence with Cabin Creek

Support for protecting these stretches of river comes from multiple conservation groups and both the Madison and Gallatin county commissions. Both commissions submitted letters of support to Congress.  
“This effort enjoys broad, bipartisan support across Montana—from farmers and ranchers to business owners, conservationists, sportsmen, and local governments—reflecting a shared understanding that safeguarding our rivers is not a partisan issue, but a Montana value,” said Gallatin County commissioners Scott MacFarlane, Zach Brown, and Jennifer Boyer.

Under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, rivers are classified in three types: wild, scenic and recreational. A single river, or river segment, may be given multiple classifications depending on the level of development along the river at the time of designation. 
For federally administered rivers, the designated corridor generally averages a quarter mile on either side for waterways in the contiguous U.S., in order to protect river-related values. 
The last, and only, additional Montana river to receive such protections was East Rosebud Creek in 2018. The legislation for East Rosebud Creek was sponsored by Sen. Steve Daines and then Sen. Jon Tester, as well as the state’s only representative at the time, then-Rep. Greg Gianforte.
Tester had also sought to pass the Montana Headwaters Legacy Act which would have added 19 rivers and 327 river miles in the Missouri and Yellowstone River systems to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. That bill was put on the legislative calendar in November 2024, but never received a formal vote or was included in a larger legislative package. 
In a committee markup, Sen. Daines voted against the Headwaters Act, which included the sections of the Madison and Gallatin rivers in Zinke’s new legislation.
While the Greater Yellowstone bill contains a more targeted section of Montana waterways to pass, many conservation groups that pushed for added protections over the years cheered the announcement as a step forward. 
“From fishing for world-class trout and rafting through rapids to hunting river bottom whitetails and migrating ducks and geese, the Madison and Gallatin Rivers are a hunter’s and angler’s dream,” Ryan Chapin, Montana field manager for the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership said in a statement, “These waters breathe lifeblood into southwest Montana, and this proposed legislation will benefit more than sportsmen. Ranchers, farmers, and local businesses depend on the health of these watersheds to thrive.”
Charles Drimal, director of conservation at the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, wrote in a blog post that the legislation builds on “years of community conversations, scientific study, and broad coalition input led by GYC and our partners.”
“Protecting these rivers means sustaining outdoor recreation economies built on tourism, fishing, and floating; securing clean, reliable water for communities, agriculture, and ecosystems; protecting wildlife habitat and biodiversity along rivers; and preserving the character of Montana’s communities and landscapes,” Drimal wrote.
Zinke’s bill also drew statements of support from the American Rivers Action Fund, the Gallatin River Task Force and American Whitewater.

President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans have criticized NPR and PBS of left-leaning bias, an accusation the public media organizations have rejected.“Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of CPB, said in a statement Friday.“CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care,” Harrison said.She added that “public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country.”CPB said employees were notified Friday that the majority of staff positions “will conclude with the close of the fiscal year on September 30, 2025,” and a small transition team will stay through January 2026.The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday approved the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education spending bill for fiscal year 2026, which did not include any CPB funding.Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the panel, expressed her disappointment over the lack of a CPB allocation in the bill during a committee markup. “It is a shameful reality and now communities across the country will suffer the consequences as over 1,500 stations lose critical funding,” Murray said.In a win for the Trump administration, Congress passed a rescissions package in July that clawed back $9 billion in previously approved spending for public broadcasting and foreign aid, including $1.1 billion for CPB.Trump signed the measure into law just days later.",,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

The federal government has determined the potential multibillion-dollar investment to construct the proposed Baltimore-Washington Superconducting Magnetic Levitation (SCMAGLEV), known as maglev, “is no longer feasible,” according to the Federal Railroad Administration.
An upcoming notice in the Federal Register, scheduled to be published Monday, highlights a few of the federal properties along the route between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore that would be affected, such as Fort George G. Meade in Anne Arundel County.
“Following extensive consultation with these agencies, the railroad administration determined the direct effects would have substantial negative effects to agency operations or to important resources managed by federal agencies,” according to the notice. “In addition, indirect effects would also significantly impair critical infrastructure and operations and ongoing agency missions.”
However, the decision does not preclude future deployment of the SCMAGLEV technology in the U.S., according to the notice.
The U.S. Department of Transportation has estimated the capital cost to build the project at nearly $20 billion.
“We want big, beautiful projects worthy of taxpayer dollars — including high-speed rail,” U.S. DOT Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a statement Friday. “This project lacked everything needed to be a success from planning to execution. This project did not have the means to go the distance, and I can’t in good conscience keep taxpayers on the hook for it.”
Some Prince George’s County residents such as Susan McCutchen were ecstatic with the decision.
“It’s a huge deal and it feels a bit overwhelming, almost to the point that you can’t quite believe it,” she said Friday. “We’re optimistic, but we’re keeping an eye out still.”
That cautious optimism surfaced late Thursday night after a letter was circulated from Drew Feeley, acting administrator for the Federal Railroad Administration.
Feeley’s letter sent to Maryland Department of Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld, who’s scheduled to leave the position Friday, summarizes that the administration will rescind a notice of intent to not prepare an environmental impact statement.
“Since the award was obligated in 2016, the environmental review process has been paused twice on the Federal Permitting Dashboard. It remains on pause today, where it has been since August 24, 2021,” Feeley wrote Thursday. “Given the substantial delay and cost overruns associated with the Project, FRA does not see a viable path to continue investment in the Project.”
Wiedefeld responded in a letter Thursday that the state will comply with the administration’s request to submit final reports to terminate and close out a cooperative agreement on the project. The railroad administration first awarded the state Department of Transportation $27 million in 2016 for preliminary engineering and environmental review.
“MDOT understands that FRA’s decision reflects the significant challenges posed by the project, including substantial impacts to federal agencies and federal properties,” he wrote. “MDOT appreciates FRA’s partnership in advancing rail infrastructure and safety improvements in the State of Maryland.”
One major supporter of the project was Gov. Wes Moore (D), who watched a high-speed maglev train in April during a trade mission to Japan.
Moore spokesperson Carter Elliott said in a statement: “In order for this to be Maryland’s decade we must continue to investigate innovative technologies that better connect people from where they live to where they work. Although this project had challenges that were insurmountable, we look forward to working with FRA to advance transportation solutions that improve the safety, reliability, and efficacy of our transportation system.”
Baltimore Washington Rapid Rail is the company that was slated to develop the project labeled Northeast Maglev. The train was proposed to connect between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore in 15 minutes at a speed of 311 mile per hour; and a trip between Washington and New York in an hour.
The company said in a statement Friday afternoon the administration’s decision represents a “missed opportunity.”
“The SCMAGLEV would have resulted in over $6 billion in private investment, created more than 160,000 jobs, and replaced 16 million car trips,” the company said. “With cars being the largest source of pollution in Maryland, significant air quality benefits would have been realized. Instead, the Washington, DC metro area will remain number one in the country for the worst traffic, delays, and congestion.”
Besides the company highlighting private investments of nearly $158 million, Northeast Maglev received representation from two of the state’s biggest lobbying firms: Evans and Associates and Manis Canning and Associates, both based in Annapolis.
However, several state lawmakers have expressed displeasure with the project.
In 2023, Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s) and state Sens. Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) and Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s) and former state Sen. Paul Pinsky (D-Prince George’s) sponsored legislation that would prohibit state funds from being used toward the maglev project. The legislation didn’t advance out of the respective committees.
Before Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s) was elected to the House of Delegates, he opposed the project back in 2017.
“This result is a culmination of years of advocacy,” Martinez said Friday. “To be here in 2025 and finally have a decision that speaks to what we’ve said the from start, and that this particular project for this particular community doesn’t work from the environmental impacts to the lack of economic development to the impacts of people’s homes. I’m just really appreciative that we can now put this train to bed.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/day1_067-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)State and labor officials unveiled diverging proposals to cut costs for New Jersey’s distressed state worker health plan by $200 million each calendar year.
Proposals from Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration focus mainly on reducing health plans’ share of medical costs, while union proposals lean mostly on controlling the cost of medical services, whether through caps that would tie rates to Medicare and Medicaid or expanded billing reviews.
Language in this year’s state budget requires both sides to identify potential savings for the State Health Benefits Program, and allows the state’s plan design committee — which sets plan coverage rules — to select which savings options to pursue. The state’s actuaries must agree that the changes will reduce costs by at least $100 million in the first six months of 2026.
But apart from proposals that would tie prescriptions of certain weight-loss drugs to participation in lifestyle management or anti-obesity counseling programs and allow more procedures at center of excellence facilities — a pilot program caps prices there — the two sides’ plans have little in common.
Billy Gallagher, assistant to the vice president of Communications Workers of America District 1, called the state’s proposals “outrageous and unacceptable.” The CWA is the largest union of state workers.
“For years, this administration, like the administration before it, has made cuts on our members’ backs and asked the very workers who keep this state open and running to sacrifice, to cut back more and more,” Gallagher said.
State officials, meanwhile, say their proposals could achieve “significantly” more savings than the $100 million target for the first half of next year.
“These plan design proposals will maintain the SHBP members’ access to high-quality, affordable health care, while incentivizing more cost-effective health care decisions by members and bolstering the sustainability of the SHBP now and for years to come,” state officials said in a letter attached to their plan.

New Jersey’s public worker health plans are in trouble after years of escalating premiums driven by broad use of expensive weight-loss drugs, growing utilization of high-cost services, and inflation.
The two sides’ proposals seek cost savings within state workers’ part of the plan, which is insulated from some of the dynamics that Treasury officials say have put local government workers’ public plan into an actuarial death spiral. Escalating costs on the local plan have pushed out more and more towns to private options, driving premiums yet higher.
The state’s proposals include multiple options that would eliminate existing plans within the State Health Benefit Program and replace them with ones that make workers responsible for a greater share of their health care expenses.
State plans under the program carry actuarial values — the share of medical spending paid for by the health plan instead of workers — of between 93% and 98%, according to a Treasury report released in May. The state’s proposals include plans with actuarial values between 88% and 94.5% (a 2023 comparison of plan designs conducted by the state’s actuaries found comparable large public employee health plans in the mid-Atlantic region had actuarial values between 93.6% and 96.9%).
The state’s proposed plans typically feature higher deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums compared to existing plans. In many cases, these plans also include higher copays across a range of services, though some are at or below levels offered under some existing plans. 
Some of the state’s options recommend sunsetting certain high-cost plans to drive workers to extant plans with lower costs for the state.
Other proposals include keeping existing plans and raising all deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums by $1,000, limiting or ending coverage for weight-loss drugs in most circumstances, capping annual chiropractic and physical therapy visits, and imposing a $50 monthly surcharge on subscribers whose spouses could get health care through their employer.
There’s little indication that union officials will support those proposals.

The unions’ cost savings proposals mostly aim at reducing medical expenses. They urge officials to review at least 50% of state claims each year to spot payment errors that can be clawed back by the state.
They said the state should bar medical providers from billing workers for costs not reimbursed by their health plan and cap reimbursements to 200% of the rates set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a practice called reference-based pricing.
It’s not clear whether the state’s actuaries will accept that recommendation. Administration members on New Jersey’s plan design committees who have previously voted down reference-based pricing proposals have said the bodies lack the authority to enact the practice. 
Labor proposals include a recommendation that New Jersey negotiate its own drug prices rather than contracting out to a third party and audit prices for the 100 most-billed drugs, arguing prescription drug discounts have been too slow to reach the state.
They also said the state should offer incentives for workers to voluntarily join plans with higher deductibles.
“There are solutions here, but our elected leaders must be willing to act. There are over 400,000 voters covered by the State Health Benefits Plan and health care is going to be a major concern as they submit their ballots or head to the ballot box this fall. We cannot afford continued stalling and delaying here,” Gallagher said.
Murphy, who is in the closing months of his second term, cannot seek a third term in November. Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, are vying to succeed him.
The differences between proposals — and the plan design committee’s even split between administration and labor members — could create a deadlocked panel. If they’re still deadlocked by Sept. 30, budget language requires them to enter mediation under a super conciliator to bridge the impasse.
If the conciliator does not push the board to a resolution by Oct. 31, budget language requires the Legislature to pass a bill to secure the savings by Dec. 1. If no bill is passed, negotiations would relaunch between single representatives of the two sides. The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services would appoint a tiebreaker if no agreement is reached by Dec. 15.

Kevin Stitt speaks at his weekly media availability on May 28, 2025. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma’s governor this week directed all state agencies to cease providing public funding to individuals or organizations “affiliated with abortion providers.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt said he ordered the Oklahoma Health Care Authority to terminate and refuse to renew any Medicaid contracts to doctors or entities that “performs, refers for, or is affiliated with the performance of abortions not permitted under state law.” He said the agency must also implement enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance and require Medicaid providers to sign a document attesting to whether they’re connected to anyone providing “abortion-related activities.” 
He said only providers who are “fully aligned with Oklahoma’s public policy objectives, including the protection of unborn life” will be eligible to participate in Medicaid, which is funded jointly by state and federal money.
“We won’t allow tax dollars to indirectly subsidize and flow into the abortion industry under the guise of women’s health,” he said in a statement. “My order makes sure every public dollar aligns with our values and supports providers who respect life at every stage.”
Stitt said his executive order follows a June U.S. Supreme Court decision affirming that states can determine who takes part in their Medicaid programs. That includes the right to ban any affiliated individuals or organizations with ties to abortion providers, he said. 
Oklahoma currently has no licensed abortion providers. State law bars all abortions except to save the life of the mother.
An Oklahoma Health Care Authority spokesperson did not know Friday how many providers were expected to be impacted by the order. She wrote in an email that the agency was still analyzing the impact on provider counts and the order “to determine next steps as we ensure compliance and maintain services for our members.”
Nearly 1 in 4 Oklahomans are enrolled in Medicaid, also known as SoonerCare.
Under Stitt’s order, the Health Care Authority must implement the revised standards within 120 days and report back to Stitt’s office on the number of impacted providers.

The health system and the health insurer failed to negotiate a new agreement due to disputes over reimbursement rates — a point of contention between insurance companies and providers nationwide. This, in turn, meant thousands of Rhode Islanders were suddenly considered “out of network” for most treatments and physician visits at Rhode Island Hospital, Hasbro Children’s Hospital, The Miriam Hospital, and Newport Hospital. 
Medicare contract talks between Brown Health and United are over. Uncertainty is just beginning.

Mailers and online information pages sought to alert affected patients ahead of the July 1 termination date for coverage. But conflicting narratives about when coverage ended left some plan participants surprised to find their surgeries suddenly canceled, according to news reports. Losing insurance coverage could also force affected patients to pay more for the same treatments.
“This is important news for seniors in Rhode Island whose coverage was disrupted earlier this month,” McKee said in a statement Thursday. “Without this special election period, every impacted individual had to submit an individual waiver request to change carriers—with no guarantee that they would be granted. Our team at the Office of Healthy Aging stands ready to assist impacted Rhode Islanders.”
UnitedHealthcare and Brown University Health each did not respond to inquiries for comment Friday.
The special enrollment period was triggered by United’s notice to federal regulators of the end to its contract with Brown University Health. The Rhode Island Office of Healthy Aging and the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General also submitted letters to CMS asking for a special window for plan participants to change insurance plans or carriers.
“We were primarily concerned about the impact on our senior population,” Steven Boudreau, a spokesperson for the Office of Healthy Aging, said in an interview Friday.

Federally reported data estimates 129,000 Rhode Islanders are enrolled in Medicare Advantage health insurance plans available for people 65 and older, or with disabilities or chronic conditions like end-stage kidney failure or ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.) The commercial alternative to government-run traditional Medicare has grown in popularity nationwide and in Rhode Island with the promise of additional benefits and cost savings to participants. Participation in United’s Medicare Advantage program in Rhode Island grew 10.1%, to 37,000 plan participants, in 2023, according to the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner’s (OHIC) 2025 annual report.
However, private providers have faced backlash for inflating testing and diagnostics as a means to increase their bottom lines. 
Complaints are ‘very few’
The Office of Healthy Aging continues to field inquiries — though “very few” complaints — from affected plan participants, Boudreau said.
“We certainly prepared ourselves for a heck of a lot more,” he said.
The most common question Boudreau’s office has gotten: “What are my options?” 
The Attorney General’s office also continues to receive consumer questions, Timothy Rondeau, an office spokesperson, said in a text. The AG has updated its webpage about the insurance coverage change to include information about the new special enrollment period.
Once UnitedHealth mails notices to affected patients, they have 60 days to switch to a different Medicare Advantage plan, or return to government-run Medicare. Other commercial insurers that offer Medicare Advantage in all or parts of Rhode Island include Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, Aetna, Humana, WellCare, and Cigna.
Terms of the special enrollment period are set by CMS, including a one-month delay between when coverage ended and the new enrollment begins to give affected enrollees enough time to make informed decisions about changing their coverage, Boudreau said.
Eligible individuals can get help deciding which insurance option is right for them by contacting the State Health Insurance Assistance Program hotline at 1-888-884-8721.
The regular open enrollment period for changing health insurance runs from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7.
The end to the contract between Brown University Health and United did not affect dual Medicare and Medicaid recipients, nor did it affect coverage at Brown University Health’s Massachusetts hospitals. There are also assurances for continuity of care in certain cases, including patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed cancer, or those in active cancer treatment. United Medicare Advantage plan participants whose insurance is covered through a former employer under a group plan may also continue to receive care at Brown University Health hospitals.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)While legal battles  over federal funding to Planned Parenthood after Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in early July have paused efforts to defund the organization, three Planned Parenthood clinics in Virginia had already lost Title X family planning funding this past April, forcing thousands to pay more for reproductive health care, or lose access to it altogether. 
“That funding is still frozen sadly,” said Virginia League for Planned Parenthood CEO Paulette McElwain. 
Established in 1970, the federal program helps low and extremely low-income people access family planning care like contraception, sexually transmitted disease screenings and treatment as well as cancer screenings at little or no cost. 
McElwain said this past spring that clinics became aware of a freeze on Title X funding by President Donald Trump’s administration on March 31, which means that about 11,000 Virginian patients have had to pay higher costs for services or forgo them since then. 
Affected health centers are in Richmond, Hampton, and Virginia Beach. 
The initial freeze to the grants stemmed from the Trump administration’s crackdown on organizations that include Diversity, Equity and Inclusion practices in their work or mission statements. The pause affected nine Planned Parenthood grantees and seven nonprofit grantees that included clinics, health departments and federally qualified health centers. 
While Title X grants have been restored to some recipients, like a health nonprofit that disburses the funding to clinics in Missouri, that hasn’t been the case for Virginia’s Planned Parenthood clinics. 
Planned Parenthood clinics provide a variety of reproductive health care, but their name has become synonymous mainly with the abortion procedures it also provides and drawn ire from abortion opponents. 
The freeze wasn’t the first time Trump has used the family planning funding to also crack down on abortion providers. Regulations during his first term disqualified clinics from receiving Title X funds that had co-located abortion services or who provided abortion referrals. President Joe Biden’s subsequent administration reversed those actions. 
Planned Parenthood continues to exist under a microscope of scrutiny by the Trump administration and Republican members of Congress, whose reconciliation bill this summer seeks to defund the organization by restricting Medicaid reimbursements. Though the organization is not specifically named in the bill, its leaders claim it was meant to affect their nearly 600 centers across 48 states. A federal judge recently blocked the effort for the time being.  
Likewise, a lawsuit is in progress concerning the Title X funding freeze that hit some clinics this spring. Filed in the District Court of Columbia, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association and the American Civil Liberties Union suit argues that about 842,000 people across the affected states faced reduced access to care.

(Photo by Marisa Demarco / KUNM)Operating hours at New Mexico’s busiest courthouse remained limited on Thursday because of what state judicial officials say is a potentially dangerous decision by the local sheriff’s office to limit how many deputies work security there.
The dispute over security staffing at the Bernalillo County Courthouse comes as judges and court administrators are telling lawmakers they feel unsafe doing their jobs across the state.
The interim legislative Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee invited county and state court officials to meet with them July 31, a week after the New Mexico Supreme Court limited how many people can enter three court buildings in downtown Albuquerque. Court officials described the operational change as a precautionary safety measure in response to Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office staffing reductions, a characterization the sheriff’s office disputes.
On Thursday, Second Judicial District Court Chief Judge Marie Ward told the committee the number of Bernalillo County Sheriff’s deputies working security at the courthouse started to decrease in January, and by July 10 stood at roughly half of what it was normally. The sheriff’s office, in a news release, has said it restructured staffing “to identify inefficiencies” and “achieve the same level of security and service with fewer deputies.”
The situation remained unresolved on Thursday, despite ongoing negotiations between Ward, Bernalillo County Sheriff John Allen, County Manager Cindy Chavez and county commissioners.
The Administrative Office of the Courts last month pointed to examples of violent threats against judges and court staff across the state as reasons for state lawmakers to consider allocating more funding for court security and creating an internal security force for the courts rather than relying on local police.
NM judiciary suggests lawmakers create state court marshals service

Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Peter Golden told the committee the Legislature could solve court staffing problems by allowing more retired police officers to return to work as court security specialists while keeping their pensions.
New Mexico last year allowed police who retired by the end of 2024 and who haven’t worked for at least three months to return to certain public safety jobs. However, Golden said the new law limits his recruitment pool because it only allows retired cops to receive their pensions for three consecutive years while working, and they must be hired by the end of June 2027.
“I have individuals right now that are willing to rehire as court security specialists, but they will not forgo a continuous full-time position in retirement for one that only has a limit of 36 months,” he said.
The Legislature could consider changing the criteria, but won’t be able to for months, said Committee Vice Chair Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos). Lawmakers’ next regular session is in January; the governor is expected to call a special session later this month or in early September, but agenda items will be limited to the governor’s discretion.
A short-term solution, Golden said, would be for the Legislature to provide $1 million to pay for deputies’ overtime working court security.
Chandler called that idea a “non-starter.”
“That’s something that needs to be brought up to the county commission,” she said.

Andy Beshear speaks with reporters outside an event at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 20, 2024. (Photo by Jacob Fischler/States Newsroom)FRANKFORT, Ky. — Gov. Andy Beshear’s super PAC In This Together reported raising $618,200 during the first half of this year to the Federal Election Commission late Thursday.
The super PAC was founded soon after the governor’s reelection in 2023 and funds his ongoing political activity and aspirations as he explores a possible run for president in 2028.
In This Together is the type of political committee that can accept contributions of unlimited amounts. And it got three big ones earlier this year. The report filed with the FEC discloses:

TDA Properties of Elizabethtown contributed $100,000 on March 25. Kentucky Secretary of State records list Tim Aulbach as president of TDA Properties.
Ullico Management Co. gave $90,000 on June 2. The Washington, D.C.-based  insurance and investment company serves trade union members.
ECL Entertainment of Las Vegas, gave $75,000 on March 21. ECL Entertainment owns Kentucky Downs race track in Franklin and four gambling parlors where players bet on so-called “historic horseracing” machines.

But the report filed with the FEC this week reveals only a part — perhaps only half, or less — of the details of In This Together’s financial condition because the PAC also reports part of its contributions and expenses to the Internal Revenue Service. The report it must file with the IRS is not due until later this month.
While no final conclusions about the super PAC’s fundraising and spending can be drawn until that disclosure with the IRS is posted, nearly all of the spending listed in the report filed Thursday with the FEC went for operating expenses.
The report lists only one disbursement that follows the purported purpose of the super PAC, which is to help political candidates and causes that share Beshear’s political beliefs and goals. That was a $2,200 contribution to the political committee of Michael Mueller, the Franklin County judge executive.
The largest expenses by far were paid to GPS Impact, of Des Moines, Iowa. They totaled $129,000 and paid for list acquisition, digital consulting and digital ads.
Other big expenses were: $43,800 to Outperform Strategies, the Louisville political consulting firm headed by Beshear’s longtime political strategist Eric Hyers; $30,000 to Elias Law of Washington, D.C., for legal services; $25,000 to the fundraising consulting firm headed by Beshear’s longtime fundraiser Lucas Johnson; $18,000 to Public Policy Polling of Raleigh, North Carolina; $17,500 to CFO Compliance of Providence Rhode Island, for compliance consulting; $15,000 to Capital Strategies of Marina Del Rey, California, for strategic consulting; and $12,000 to Lauren Hitt of Washington DC, for communications consulting.
in a response to emailed questions from Kentucky Lantern, Hyers suggested the pending report to be filed with the IRS will list much more direct spending by In This Together to help  Beshear-supported candidates, including a “six figure” expense for targeted mail that helped Susan Crawford win election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the spring.
Big donors during the period other than the three listed above include several state contractors, companies closely regulated by state government, lobbyists and appointees of Beshear to important state boards. These other big donors include:

Morgan Collins Yeast and Salyer, of London, $25,000. Lawyers in the firm have been large and consistent donors to Beshear. Beshear appointed partner McKinnley Morgan to chair the Kentucky Personnel Board.
State highway contracting companies headed by the Cleary family of Tompkinsville, $15,000.
LG&E of Louisville, $10,000.
McGhee Engineering of Guthrie, $10,000
Nine engineers with state engineering contractor GRW each gave $1,000 to total $9,000.

Donors listed as giving $5,000 during the period include: Beshear’s father, former Gov. Steve Beshear; Nachiketa Bhatt of Prospect, who heads Freedom Adult Day Healthcare; Joe Ellis, a Benton optometrist appointed to the Board of Optometry by Beshear; David Figg of Beaver Dam, an appointee of Beshear’s to the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees; Hal McCoy of Hopkinsville, husband of Elizabeth McCoy who was appointed to the UK Board by Beshear; Frank Shoop, the Georgetown car dealer who recently stepped down as a UK trustee; Leslie Haney, a Lexington engineer with EA Partners, which has long held state contracts; and lobbyists Sherman Brown and Bob Babbage.

Fire restrictions are now in place across Utah, amid what Gov. Spencer Cox called “terrible conditions” fueling a number of blazes, including the 48,000-acre Monroe Canyon Fire.  
Speaking from Richfield on Friday near the fire, Cox said the entire state is a tinder box. 
“These terrible conditions that are making it impossible for us to get ahead of this fire exist in every corner of the state right now,” Cox said. “It would be very easy to have more fires like this one, so we need people to be incredibly cautious.”

Burning east of Interstate 70 near Richfield, the Monroe Canyon Fire is the largest blaze in Utah this year. It’s grown by more than 10,000 acres in recent days, and is just 7% contained. More than 1,000 firefighters are working around the clock, with a focus on protecting structures. 
“You’re getting 60-mile-per-hour winds and we’ve had a few near misses with firefighters who had to cut their way out of the trees with a chainsaw. Fortunately, we’ve had no real serious accidents and the firefighters can go home to their families,” said state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican from Richfield, speaking to reporters alongside Cox on Friday. 
A number of transmission lines have been burned, causing periodic power outages in the area, and at least seven structures have been destroyed. Residents in Burrville, Monroe Canyon, and parts of Poverty Flat are under evacuation orders. 
“This is a big one. It’s been a long time since we’ve had a big one like this. The odds of us putting it out anytime soon are pretty low, just to be honest. We know that the forecast is not great right now. We’ve seen erratic fire behavior all day long, even at night,” Cox said. “We’ve seen a fire make a five-mile run. You can’t stop a fire when it’s making a run like that.” 
The temperature and precipitation outlook for the rest of the month, according to the National Weather Service, calls for below average rain and above average temperatures. It’s been exceptionally dry around the state, with humidity as low as 4% in the Monroe Canyon area. 
Cox declares state of emergency as intense wildfires burn in Utah

“It’s August and we’re not in good shape right now. And we’re not seeing any moisture in sight,” said Jamie Barnes, director of the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands.  
To that end, state officials imposed stage two fire restrictions on Thursday. That means the following is prohibited: 

Fires and campfires, even in developed camping or picnic areas.  
Smoking, except in an enclosed vehicle or building, at a developed recreation site, or on a paved area. 
Fireworks, tracer ammunition, exploding targets or other pyrotechnic devices. 
Cutting, welding or grinding metal near vegetation. 
Operating a motorcycle, chainsaw, ATV or other small internal combustion engine without a working spark arrestor. 

These restrictions apply to all state and private, unincorporated land, including state trust land, state parks and wildlife management areas. They also apply to the following federal lands: 

The Color Country, Canyon Country, Green River, Paria River and West Desert districts, managed by the Bureau of Land Management. 
Dixie, Fishlake and Manti-La Sal national forests, managed by the U.S. Forest Service. 

Violating the restrictions is a class B misdemeanor, punishable by six months in jail and a fine up to $1,000. 
There are a number of other fires burning throughout Utah:

The Forsyth Fire, discovered on June 19, has burned almost 16,000 acres, destroyed more than a dozen homes and is now 99% contained. It’s located near the Pine Valley community, about 15 miles north of St. George. 
The Deer Creek Fire is burning along the Colorado-Utah border near the La Sal Mountains, outside of Moab. It is 17,700 acres and, as of Friday morning, 88% contained. 
Discovered Thursday, the Little Pole Fire in northern Box Elder County near the Idaho border is now 487 acres and 0% contained. 

Cox declared a 30-day state of emergency on Thursday related to wildfires. The order allows the government to use all available state resources “to protect lives, homes, livestock and drinking-water supplies threatened by this year’s severe fire season,” according to the governor’s office. It also allows for the deployment of the Utah National Guard if needed.

The department has sent letters to Pennsylvania and at least eight other states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.

Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

(Photo courtesy of the Woodbury County Sheriff's Office)A building contractor is suing the Woodbury County Law Enforcement Center Authority, alleging it publicly disclosed false and defamatory information about the company.
Hausmann Construction Inc. of Lincoln, Nebraska, is suing the authority, Woodbury County, the architectural firms Introba Inc. and Goldberg Group Architects (GGA), and construction manager The Baker Group in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit stems from a long-running dispute over the design and construction of the $70 million Woodbury County Law Enforcement Center on 28th Street in Sioux City. The authority was created to facilitate the completion of the design and construction of the center, and Hausmann served as the prime or general contractor for the project.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit alleges the $43 million center that was initially contemplated by the parties in June 2021 is not the $70 million center that was constructed and exists today. “Throughout the life of the project, a multitude of issues have plagued the construction and completion of the Law Enforcement Center, stemming from certain design errors and omissions as put forth by GGA as the lead architect for the project,” the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit claims the alleged design errors brought the project “to a screeching halt in June 2023, which in turn has delayed almost every subsequent aspect of the project, increasing the ultimate cost of the project, and thereby bringing about” the current lawsuit.
According to the lawsuit, Hausmann unfairly “bears the brunt of many of the accusations for the overall delay in completion.” As recently as July 2, 2025, the lawsuit alleges, the authority acknowledged that the delay in completion of the project stemmed from the design errors. Despite that, the lawsuit claims, the authority has continued to “craft its own narrative of the issues plaguing the project to save GGA, Introba, and Baker Group from incurring additional expenses.”
On July 3, 2025, the authority, along with Woodbury County, allegedly sent a “confidential” 22-page demand letter to Hausmann, GGA, and Introba to facilitate settlement discussions. Despite knowing that the confidential letter was subject to disclosure under Iowa’s Open Records Law, the authority and county crafted the letter to include “various false and defamatory statements against Hausmann regarding Hausmann’s performance on the project,” the lawsuit claims.
Hausmann’s other projects and future projects have allegedly “been impacted by the authority’s release” of the letter, as “numerous news outlets have created damaging articles about Hausmann based on untrue and unsubstantiated allegations” within the letter, the lawsuit states.
“It is apparent that the authority, GGA, Introba, and Baker Group have very close outside relationships with each other, demonstrating a clear conflict of interest,” the lawsuit alleges, asserting that Baker Group hired the son of one authority member to oversee and manage the construction of the project.
“Given the cozy relationship between the authority, GGA, Introba, and Baker Group, it has been easiest for the authority to blame Hausmann for delays and refuse to pay Hausmann for its completion of the project,” the lawsuit claims.
In June 2023, for example, it was discovered that that design plans had failed to include fire and smoke dampers in the building’s heating, cooling and ventilation systems.  “The omission of the dampers was a clear design error and a life-safety threat where occupants could not be evacuated in the event of a fire at the authority’s facility,” the lawsuit alleges.
Construction of the building was completed last year and it is now occupied and operational. But as a result of the various delays, the authority has allegedly refused to pay Hausmann for $5.7 million that the company says it is owed for its work.
The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and unjust enrichment by the authority, professional negligence by Introba and GGA, and tortious interference with business relationships by each of the defendants.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Woodbury County attorney could not be reached for comment Friday.

(Getty Images)Two new Louisiana abortion restriction laws took effect Friday, including one that allows Louisianians to sue out-of-state providers of abortion-inducing medications. 
House Bill 575 by Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, was dubbed the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act.” It extends the window for abortion lawsuits to be filed from three to five years after the abortion occurs and allows out-of-state doctors and activists to be sued.
The legislation is part of an effort from anti-abortion advocates to crack down on doctors who ship abortion-inducing medication to states where the procedure is illegal. In nearly all instances, abortion has been illegal in Louisiana since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. 
Also taking effect is House Bill 425 by Rep. Josh Carlson, R-Lafayette, which expands the definition of coerced abortion. It is now defined in state law as the “use or threatened use of force, control, or intimidation” against a pregnant woman to compel her to undergo an abortion against her will, regardless of whether the procedure has been attempted or completed.
Carlson’s legislation originally sought to expand the definition of coerced abortion to include the pregnant person’s actions. It was substantially trimmed back in committee to add battery, assault, simple kidnapping, false imprisonment and extortion involving another person. 
The two bills easily passed the Republican-supermajority legislature earlier this year, although both were whittled down from their original, far-sweeping versions. 
Ventrella’s law has the support of Attorney General Liz Murrill, who is currently prosecuting a New York doctor accused of providing abortion-inducing medication to the mother of a pregnant minor in West Baton Rouge Parish. Gov. Kathy Hochul has refused to extradite the doctor to Louisiana to face the charges, citing New York’s shield laws. 
The doctor and the minor’s mother were both indicted. Murrill has alleged the minor was coerced to take the medication, though her mother was not charged with that crime.
Murrill and other attorneys general called on Congress this week to prevent states where abortion is legal from shielding doctors who prescribe abortion-inducing medication for people in states where the procedure is banned.

,DC,2025-08-01 19:14:11+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump levies a host of new tariffs on U.S. trading partners,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-levies-host-new-tariffs-us-trading-partners,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump pushed ahead with his promise to raise tariffs on foreign goods by Aug. 1, signing an order late Thursday increasing import taxes on products from nearly every U.S. trading partner.Trump’s directive, and new data on weaker job growth, sent markets tumbling Friday.The president imposed a 15% base tariff on products imported from nearly three dozen nations across five continents, plus the 27 trading nations that comprise the European Union. Trump slapped higher rates on select other countries, ranging from 18% on goods from Nicaragua to 30% on South Africa and 50% on Brazil.The White House hailed the “reciprocal” tariffs as “a necessary and powerful tool to put America First after many years of unsustainable trade deficits that threaten our economy and national security,” according to a press release accompanying the executive order.Trump describes the tariffs as “reciprocal” because they are his response to countries that have trade deficits with the U.S. — meaning that country sells more products to the U.S. than it buys.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer called the new rates “historic.”“Over the past few months, the President’s tariff program and the ensuing 'Trump Round' of trade negotiations have accomplished what the World Trade Organization and multilateral negotiations have not been able to achieve at scale: expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical American industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments and purchases of goods that will create great American jobs and help reassert American leadership in key strategic sectors,” Greer said in a statement Wednesday.The tariff announcement, combined with a weaker-than-expected jobs report Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, caused sell-offs Friday from the three major U.S. stock indexes, according to financial media reports.Trump fumed Friday afternoon about report adjustments that significantly decreased jobs numbers for May and June, even calling for the commissioner for labor statistics to be fired.Tariffs and lawsuitsTrump made history earlier this year when he became the first president to trigger tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.The move sparked legal challenges from small businesses and Democratic-led states, and the plaintiffs faced the Trump administration Thursday in federal appeals court.Tariffs are taxes on imported products that U.S. companies and other buyers pay to the U.S. government.Trump announced staggering tariffs under an emergency declaration on April 2, what he referred to as “Liberation Day,” but delayed the new import taxes after global markets plummeted in response to the shock announcement.Trump also separately announced Thursday a 35% levy on imported products from Canada that fall outside the bounds of an already established trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.Trump continued a 25% tariff on certain Mexican goods, but paused any rate increases to allow for 90 days of negotiations, according to media reports. The U.S. is continuing negotiations with China, whose products face a base import tax rate of 30%.Marc Noland, executive vice president and director of studies for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Trump’s latest tariff rates are “unfortunate.”“It will contribute to higher prices and slower growth here in the United States,” Noland said, adding there’s “a question about how sustainable they are legally here in the U.S.”“And it's particularly unfortunate, because I'm looking at the entire list of countries and see that the countries with the highest rates are the countries that are in the worst shape — Laos gets 40%, Syria got 41%,  Myanmar gets 40%. It's the poorest, most desperate countries that are getting hit with the highest tariffs. So it's bad for us and it's bad for the world,” Noland told States Newsroom in an interview Friday.The 15% rate on imports from dozens of countries mirrors the deals Trump announced in recent weeks with Japan, South Korea and European Union — though many details remain unknown.“There are real questions about what exactly did anybody agree to,” Noland said. “And you know this, these don't have the force of law that a treaty negotiated and passed by our Congress and somebody else's national legislature have like, say, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, which, as we see, was unilaterally abrogated.”‘Predictable’ trade agenda urgedTrade and industry advocates have also reacted to the new tariffs.Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of the Consumer Technology Association, issued a statement Thursday saying Trump’s new rates “highlight the uncertainty American innovators face in today’s trade environment.”“CTA continues to urge the Administration and Congress to pursue a predictable, forward-looking trade agenda rooted in fairness and collaboration with trusted partners,” said Shapiro, whose organization hosts the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada. “American innovation thrives when markets are open, trade rules are clear, and businesses are free to focus on creating jobs and bringing groundbreaking technologies to market.”The National Foreign Trade Council warned that “Whatever progress that’s ultimately achieved as part of these new trade deals will come at the steep price of significant U.S. tariff increases and the erosion of trust with America’s key partners.”The statement Thursday from the industry group’s president, Jake Colvin, continued: “Institutionalizing the highest U.S. duties since the Great Depression, coupled with ongoing uncertainty, will ultimately make American businesses less competitive globally and consumers worse off while harming relationships with close geopolitical allies and trading partners.”",,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

On June 30, the Trump administration informed states it would put $6.8 billion in federal K-12 school funding on hold. This funding, for migrant education and English Language Learning (ELL) programs, as well as before- and after-school services, had already received approval from Congress. But the administration said it paused disbursement of the money, which typically occurred July 1, while it conducted a review of the programs receiving funding.
The administration announced plans to release these funds to states July 25, after having completed the review. Though the funding is set to be available as schools start the academic year, some programs throughout the country have said the pause meant they had to stop programs during the summer and may face issues returning.

In Iowa, there have not been reports of any programs stopping service because of the federal funding freeze. With funding restored, programs at many school districts are proceeding as planned — but the federal government’s decision to conduct this review in July put some schools in a precarious position heading into the 2025-2026 school year.
Stacey Cole, superintendent of Storm Lake Community School District, said the district is “cautiously entering the school year with status quo” on funding these programs — but that the funding freeze will impact budget discussions in future years.
“I am concerned about this happening again,” Cole said.
The Storm Lake school district has a large ELL and immigrant student population. The funding would have impacted both after-school and English learning programming, she said. Other services the school district offers also would have been affected, such as those that help immigrant families navigate the U.S. school system with assistance filing needed paperwork, getting insurance and other ways to adjust to their new community.
The funding for these programs had been approved earlier in 2025, largely going toward staff, Cole said, before the freeze was even announced. But the federal government action means the district will likely have to view the future of these programs differently moving forward, she said.
“When we enter this school year, we still have those people in place, the programs will be in place, all the things. But as we navigate the waters this year, anytime there’s an opportunity to think, ‘well, is that something that we could live without?’ We’re going to be thinking about that. Because I’m not confident that we won’t have a similar message next July, and I’m going to have to be prepared for that.”
Theron Schutte, superintendent of the Marshalltown Community School District, said his district had faced a nearly $600,000 shortfall because of the funding pause. These federal dollars went toward historically underserved communities, he said, like low-income, English Second Language (ESL) and migrant students and their families, he said, as well as some students with special education needs, through programs like after-school tutoring for migrant students, swim lessons and summer school lessons.
As more than one-third of the Marshalltown school district’s student population are English language learners, the funding freeze was a major concern as the district looked at how it could continue to provide support for the families that rely on these programs, he said.
“It would have a huge impact, because we have a very large immigrant population in Marshalltown,” Schutte said. “Some of those services that would have been significantly reduced and jobs lost would have been in our Welcome Center, where we have staff that are devoted to helping orientate and register new families into the district, and to be able to accommodate families that speak different languages.”
The Marshalltown school district did not have to stop any programs from the funding pause this year. But during the pause, the school district was considering having to close or reduce services in the following year, Schutte said.
Even though the funding was restored, there are still questions about whether federal education funding pauses or cuts are on the horizon, he said. Combined with lower K-12 education funding from the Iowa state government in the past decade, he said, school districts are left in an unstable position when these funds are not provided.
Cole said the federal freeze for ELL and migrant programs will have an impact on how school districts will evaluate other programs and areas that receive funding from the U.S. government.
“This felt like it came out of nowhere, and so it was something that we were extremely unprepared for,” Cole said. “I was not thinking in March that there would be an announcement that a significant portion of our federal dollars would not be coming. And so, as we think about that, I’m also cautious with funding streams that weren’t talked about, right? And so it’s really difficult for us to plan.”
Other Trump administration directives target education funding for migrant students
Though the funding for migrant and English Second Language K-12 students was restored, the Trump administration has also pursued other efforts focused on education funding that goes toward migrant families. In July, the U.S. Department of Education released a memo saying adult students without legal status must be banned from federally-funded classes, including English language, technical education and high school equivalency courses.
People taking these courses will be citizenship and immigration verification requirements, according to the guidance. But many impacted institutions, including some K-12 schools that offer career education courses, said they are unsure about the implementation of verification steps, as students are not required to provide citizenship paperwork or other documents.
Many immigrant students legally in the country also do not have access to documents needed to verify their status, advocates say.
Des Moines Area Community College will receive necessary funding for its adult education programming as a result of federal funding being released, with a new caveat that officials say could make administrative burdens even heavier and result in a chilling effect among potential participants.
Erica Spiller, DMACC vice president for student affairs, said the community college received a memo saying it will see the same amount of funding as in past years for these programs, coming in at $741,600. Just under $3.5 million in adult basic education funding will be awarded to community colleges across Iowa.
However, these dollars come with the new requirement that the colleges verify citizenship of those who take advantage of the programming, Spiller said. As an open access institution, Spiller said DMACC doesn’t have the systems in place to easily take on this task, so departments across the college would feel hit hard by the extent of the new work.
When DMACC opens registration for its noncredit English Language Learner classes and high school equivalency tests, both of which Spiller said receive federal dollars, lines long enough to wrap around the building form, filled with people hoping to get a seat. If the citizenship of each of these people will need to be checked before they sign up for a class, the college will have to figure out how the process is going to work and how complicated it will be.
“It’s going to take more staff, it’s going to take more time,” Spiller said.
Based on feedback Spiller has heard from the communities that utilize these services, she said the new rules will have a chilling effect on attendance. Programs focused on adult education are an important workforce driver, she said, and both Iowans and those who move here in the future need to be able to access them in order to gain skills that will make them more employable in the state.
“I’m concerned that if it does have a chilling effect, if people can’t access this, or don’t access this, it’s going to have an impact on our economy,” Spiller said.
A similar directive requiring citizenship verification has been issued for participation in Head Start, the federally funded preschool program, as well as for other Title X programs related to family planning.
Cole said it is unclear how these directives will impact the Storm Lake school district, or whether there will be new requirements on checking students’ or families’ documents for participation in other programs.
When thinking about these federal funding streams, she said, people may not realize the impact these services and programs have on their lives and their community, even if they do not directly interact with these programs. For example, Cole said, a child may not be in a program working with migrant students — but without that program, they may get less attention in class, as a teacher will have to focus more on catching other students up on certain material, or have to spend more time on classroom management.
“It’s easy to look at these funding streams and to push them off and make them someone else’s issue,” she said. “But the reality is, is that the loss of these funds are going to impact all kids. And I just want to make sure that people are thinking about that, and that the unintended consequences might be very detrimental to kids in our own lives that we really love and care about.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-01 19:04:24+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘On and on’: Jackson again gives its two cents on Pearl River flood study,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/01/on-and-on-jackson-again-gives-its-two-cents-on-pearl-river-flood-study/,Corps of Engineers draws mixed reaction and criticism to its latest Pearl River flood control study,"Throughout a fittingly stormy Thursday in Jackson, dozens of residents and public officials again lined up in front of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in what has felt like, to some, a never-ending cycle of hundred-page studies and hours-long town halls. 
In stereotypically bureaucratic fashion, the Corps’ July draft study for a flood control project on the Pearl River is the latest in a process that’s now lasted roughly 40 years.
At least one resident decided that, whichever proposal the agency moves forward with, if any, they’ve had enough. 
“I’m interested in a buyout, I want out,” said Thia Walker, a resident of the Canton Club neighborhood in northeast Jackson, adding her street had flooded that very afternoon. “It’s taken a long time for all these plans and alternatives and it seems like there’s never going to be plan that’s suitable for the masses.
“This will go on and on forever and I’m ready to get out.”

The Corps, in its July publication, narrowed its project selection to two options: “Alternative D1” and “Alternative E1.”
D1 is a scaled back version of the controversial “One Lake” plan that the project’s local sponsor — the Rankin-Hinds Flood Control District, or the levee board — had pushed for years before the Corps decided against the idea. The proposal would dam the Pearl River and lower its banks, allowing water to pool between a stretch starting just north of Lakeland Drive to just below Interstate 20. The project would also include four sets of levees, including one for the Canton Club neighborhood.
Several residents and public officials, including recently elected Mayor John Horhn, gave their support to D1, praising its potential to deliver economic and recreational opportunities to a poor city facing a declining population. 
“This flood control project can be the spark that ignites that rebirth in our city,” Horhn said during the afternoon session at St. Philip’s Episcopal Church.

The proposal E1 copies D1 except for including a dam, meaning it wouldn’t include the colloquial “lake” people associate with D1. Not having a dam also makes E1 the cheaper option. The Corps estimates D1 could cost as much as $960 million, versus $788 million for E1. 
Some, though, criticized the Corps for already ruling out a third option, “Alternative A1,” which the agency says would only cost up to $22 million. A1, which is the only one of the three that wouldn’t alter the river or its banks, would include elevating and floodproofing structures as well as offering buyouts. But compared to the other two plans, the agency limits the scope of A1, including just one levee and only offering elevation and buyouts for certain structures. 
“Once more, we urge the Corps to expand A1 because it doesn’t go far enough,” said Jill Mastrototaro of Audubon Delta. 
The benefits in that option, the Corps says, is limited by how many property owners choose to participate. But Mastrototaro and others argued that A1 could produce more benefits if the agency simply expands its scope. The agency’s study shows that of the three proposals, A1 is the only one with positive net benefits.

Tributaries and drainage in Jackson
While Thursday’s conversation focused on the river itself, several residents brought up more immediate causes of flooding, such as clogged creeks and storm water drains. 
“I live in (the Mcleod neighborhood), and I know personally that our storm drains are failing,” said Greta Mack Harris. “I’m nervous to go home after I leave here. Our clogged and collapsing culverts cause flooding and damage our foundation, walls and plumbing.”
Others pointed to tributary flooding as more regular issue than Pearl River flooding. While the Corps’ study doesn’t address the river’s tributaries in Jackson, it does mention other ongoing efforts.
The Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation Commission has three projects in the design phase, using U.S. Department of Agriculture funding, to reduce flooding along Hanging Moss Creek, Lynch Creek and Lake Ridgelea in Byram. The construction for those, however, isn’t set to begin until December 2028. The city of Jackson is also in the design phase of a flood reduction project along Eubanks Creek.
Downstream impacts
While the Corps maintains that neither D1 nor E1 would affect the river’s flow once it reaches Monticello, residents in Louisiana, where the Pearl River reaches downstream, are unconvinced. Brandon Davis, environmental planning chief for the agency’s Vicksburg district, admitted at a meeting in Slidell, Louisiana, on Wednesday that the Corps didn’t have the authority nor funding to fully study what would happen to the river south of Jackson, NOLA.com reported.

Davis clarified to Mississippi Today that other rivers impact the Pearl River once it reaches those places. 
“Those areas down in Monticello, Slidell have their own issues with bank caving and erosion,” he said. “But it’s not necessarily tied to what’s going on up here. You have the Strong River, Copiah Creek, other tributaries that are causing most of the issues you’re seeing there.”
The study notes that D1 and E1 would “likely adversely affect” several endangered or threatened species along the Pearl River, including three different types of turtles. D1, the Corps wrote, would impact a wider range of species, including the Gulf sturgeon, than E1. 
When asked what that impact could look like, Davis said those habitats included anywhere the project may “temporarily” affect. But as far as how affected the habitats would be, he said only that they wouldn’t be “completely eradicated.”
Comment period and next steps
The public comment period is still ongoing and ends on Aug. 18. The Corps encourages the public to visit its project website to see how to submit feedback.
Vicksburg District commander Col. Jeremiah Gipson said the process is on schedule to send a final study and recommendation to the assistant secretary of the Army for Civil Works by the end of 2025. Some residents asked the Corps to extend the ongoing comment period, which Gipson said would be his decision.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/31182154/Pearl-River-flooding-public-meeting-4.jpg,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

(Photo by Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho lost more than a third of its practicing obstetrician doctors after the state’s near-total abortion ban took effect, a new study published in a peer-reviewed academic journal confirms.
The study — published Thursday in the JAMA Network Open, a division of the Journal of the American Medical Association — found that Idaho lost 35% of its doctors who practiced in obstetrics. In total, Idaho lost 94 of those doctors out of 268 between August 2022 and December 2024, the study found.
Idaho’s abortion ban took effect in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned national abortion protections. Some OB-GYNs, including maternal-fetal medicine specialists, said publicly that they were leaving because of the ban.
“These results provide a stark picture of a rapidly declining maternal health workforce in our state,” the study’s lead author, Dr. Edward McEachern, said in a statement.
The study appears to confirm findings from a report in February 2024 by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative that found Idaho lost 22% of its practicing obstetricians since the state’s abortion bans took effect.
Despite calls for change in the three years Idaho’s ban has been in place, including by the state’s top medical association, Idaho lawmakers have largely refused to modify Idaho’s strict abortion laws. Organizers are collecting signatures to qualify a ballot initiative in November 2026 that could end Idaho’s strict abortion bans and establish reproductive freedom rights.
“Since Idaho’s abortion ban went into effect, (the Idaho Medical Association) has raised the alarm about the unintended consequences of criminalizing medically necessary care for pregnant women,” Idaho Medical Association CEO Susie Keller said in a statement. “This study clearly shows how our legal environment is causing physicians to leave the state and making it more difficult to recruit new ones to take their place. Idaho is digging a physician workforce hole that will take years, if not decades, to fill.”
Over 40% of the obstetrics doctors Idaho lost since its abortion bans took effect moved out of state, the study found. More than a fifth retired, but some narrowed their medical practice focus to gynecology or stopped practicing in rural areas, the study found.
The study pulled information from publicly available professional credentialing sources, physician websites, national registries and confirmation from the doctors.
The vast majority of Idaho’s remaining OB/GYN doctors are practicing in the state’s seven most populated counties, the study found. Just 23 OB/GYN doctors practice in Idaho’s other 37 counties that are home to nearly a quarter of the state’s population, compared to 151 in Idaho’s seven most populated counties, according to the study.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)With most jobs, you have to give your boss an idea of where you are and what you are doing during the workday. Gov. Bob Ferguson, who works for the people of Washington state, has not been doing this consistently during his first seven months in office.
Ferguson has mostly abandoned the practice of sending out advisories, letting the press know where he will be and when. The rare calendar updates that do go out are typically incomplete and sometimes arrive after the fact.
Take, for example, the advisory his office sent for “the week of July 14-20.” It landed in our inboxes around 1 p.m. on Monday, July 14, and contained information about the governor’s schedule for one day: Monday, July 14, “Orcas Island Day.” 
The governor was scheduled to attend four meetings and events on the island between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. By the time we received the advisory, start times for three of the four had passed.
Most weeks this summer, the press has received no calendar updates at all.
This was the case last week, when Ferguson attended the Washington State Labor Council convention in Vancouver. His office did not send notice that he’d be there. We learned from the Labor Council that he’d be making remarks on the main stage.
A schedule for the governor we later obtained through a public records request showed he also met with union officials representing machinists, Teamsters and electrical workers.
That schedule also included meetings last week with the Quileute and Quinault tribal councils. He posted on social media about attending the opening of a new Quinault Indian Nation building that received funding from the state’s Climate Commitment Act.
Why does this matter? Washingtonians pay Ferguson’s $218,744 a year salary. It’s not unreasonable to think they should have some window into what he’s doing during the week — the events he’s turning out for, who he’s meeting with. It’s a reflection of his priorities.
The handful of public appearances Ferguson has given notice about since the legislative session, and its subsequent flurry of bill signings, wrapped up have often focused on criticizing the president or congressional Republicans.
We’ve covered these events. But the governor’s responsibilities extend beyond reacting to federal policy.
Even the basics of his whereabouts are often a mystery. Is he working at his office at the Capitol in Olympia, or spending most of his time in Seattle? Has he traveled out of state, leaving the lieutenant governor in charge for a day or two? Much of the time, it’s difficult to know.
This is why, going forward, we’ll include a new section in our Saturday newsletter, called “Where’s the governor?” Our goal is to recap some of what we do know each week about what Ferguson has been up to. (You can subscribe to our newsletter here.)
If Ferguson resumes sending out weekly calendars and more frequent advisories about where he will be and when, we’ll distill highlights. If his lack of transparency continues, we’ll keep doing our best to piece together how he’s spending his time.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 18:57:14+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge sends English Station cleanup dispute back to DEEP,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/english-station-power-plant-united-illuminating-new-haven/,The ruling came just days after officials in New Haven announced ambitious plans to tear down the dilapidated power plant.,"A Connecticut judge on Thursday ordered state officials to go back to their deliberations in a long-running dispute with United Illuminating over the cleanup of one of the utility’s former power plants, English Station.
The ruling — which is almost certain to add further delays to the remediation effort — came just days after officials in New Haven announced ambitious plans to tear down the dilapidated plant and develop the site into a waterfront park complete with walking trails and a public pool.
“While this is not the only dispute that has interfered with the remediation of the English Station site, originally contemplated to have been completed years ago, the parties’ dispute over the applicable cleanup standard inside the buildings is a significant impediment to completing that project,” Superior Court Judge John B. Farley wrote in his decision.
United Illuminating operated the plant for more than a half century, burning coal and later oil to produce electricity for its customers, before the plant was finally powered down in 1992.  During its run, the site became heavily contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, resulting in a complex and costly remediation effort. 
Over the years, the plant fell into disrepair and was subject to vandalism and thefts of leftover metal. As part of a deal with regulators to approve UI’s merger with Spanish utility giant Iberdrola in 2015, the company agreed to spend $30 million to clean up the site.
That agreement, however, quickly became subject to a dispute over the standard to which the property should be cleared of contaminants and made ready for development.
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, led by Commissioner Katie Dykes, argued that the consent decree signed by both parties required UI to remediate PCB levels in the plant building to below 1 part per million, which would allow for a wider range of future uses, such as housing, businesses or recreation. Utility officials balked, arguing that doing so would require the complete demolition of the building — something they had not agreed to do during negotiations over the agreement.
Last year, Dykes issued a ruling requiring UI to abide by the higher remediation standard. UI promptly sued, arguing that Dykes had overstepped her authority and misconstrued the language in the consent decree to suit the state’s desire for a more robust cleanup.
In his decision on Thursday, however, Judge Farley opted not to side with either party’s interpretation of the consent decree, which he said was ambiguous as to the required level of cleanup.
Instead, Farley remanded the case back to DEEP for further proceedings. At the same time, he found that Dykes had not abused her authority by issuing a declaratory ruling, thus allowing her to make further decisions regarding the consent decree.
In a statement Friday, United Illuminating spokesperson Sarah Wall Fliotsos said the company appreciated the decision to sustain their appeal and send the case back to DEEP. 
“In this case, DEEP wrongfully changed the standard for clean-up that was agreed upon nearly a decade ago,” Fliotsos said. “It is clear DEEP was wrong to try to enforce a standard that was not part of the original agreement, and they are wrong to continue to blame UI for delays.”
“Ultimately, clean-up of this site cannot be achieved without clarity on the standard we are working towards,” she added. “As this issue is remanded for further proceedings, we hope to be able to work in good faith with state officials to chart a clear path forward for UI’s role in the future of English Station.”

DEEP officials referred comment to Attorney General William Tong’s office, which represented the agency in the lawsuit. Tong told the CT Mirror on Friday that his office is still reviewing the judge’s decision and its impact on the cleanup process.
“We’re gonna keep fighting,” Tong said. “UI owes whatever it takes to remediate English Station, and I’m never going to come off that position.”
A spokesman for New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker said Thursday that the ruling would not impact the city’s plans to move ahead with the proposed redevelopment of English Station.
“As the City advances its proposal for Mill River Park, it’s critical that UI stop dragging its feet and complete the remediation of English Station so that this land can finally be put to good public use, and we’re confident the Attorney General and CT DEEP will continue to hold UI accountable for its longstanding failure to clean up this site,” the spokesman, Lenny Speiller, said in a statement.
“We hope the City’s proposal and intended use of the site brings a new focus and urgency on what needs to be done to help make this vision a reality,” he added.
The city’s proposal is part of a larger plan to redevelop former industrial areas along the Mill River, which surrounds the small island on which the power plant sits. 
In order to make the land safe for walking, playing and swimming, the site would have to be cleaned to the 1 ppm level being sought by DEEP, Speiller said. Even then, the city has estimated it will cost at least another $25 million to develop its park proposal.
“After bearing the costs of industrial pollution and blight from the English Station power plant for decades, our community deserves a true treasure in its place,” Elicker said in his announcement of the city’s plans on Monday. “By replacing it with a new waterfront public park and recreation area, we will transform this site into an amazing public asset that will benefit our residents, improve our environment and strengthen our community for generations to come.”
Beyond the initial cleanup, however, other hurdles exist that could complicate the city’s plans. 
New Haven still has to acquire the English Station property, which has changed hands several times over the last two decades. On Monday, city officials sent letters to the current owners of the island expressing their desire to “negotiate a fair purchase price” for the property. If the owners do not respond, Speiller said, the city will consider using eminent domain to acquire the property.
The owners are a pair of limited liability corporations tied to three people — George Goldstein, Esther Schiller and David Tropper — with business addresses listed in Brooklyn, Queens and Israel.
When reached for comment earlier this week, Goldstein at first denied being one of the owners of English Station before saying he had received the city’s letter and was reviewing it. “I have to get back to you on that,” Goldstein said when asked if he was interested in selling the property.
Schiller and Tropper could not be reached for comment. Goldstein hung up after being reached for comment a second time on Friday.
Local advocates have also questioned the need to tear down the hulking, brick-clad structure of English Station, which many argue carries historic and aesthetic significance to the city.
Anstress Farwell, the president of the New Haven Urban Design League, said this week that she supported the city’s efforts to take control of the power plant property, though she called its plans to raze the remaining buildings “premature” until further studies can be done to determine whether they are salvageable.
“In all of my talks with the city, it’s been about ‘the building is an asset,'” Farwell said. “It’s 110,000 square feet that city officials have said that they could never rebuild on the site but could use if it could be renovated.”
Nor did Thursday’s ruling put an end to the state’s ongoing legal battle against UI over English Station.
Tong filed a separate lawsuit last year, accusing the utility of failing to uphold its agreement to spend $30 million on the remediation effort. In response, UI officials have argued that the company has already spent millions toward the remediation of the site, including removal of asbestos, but that its efforts have been hampered by the ongoing dispute with DEEP.
That case is also assigned to Judge Farley, who issued a separate ruling on Thursday dismissing four out of the five defenses that the utility had raised. That case is currently set for trial in October 2026.
Lastly, there is the case involving the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s decision in 2023 to begin fining United Illuminating $2 million a year over what regulators called a failure to abide by the utility’s agreement to remediate English Station. Earlier this year, a judge upheld the legality of that penalty — a decision that the utility is appealing.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ENGLISH-STATION-01-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana state Rep. Rashid Young, D-Homer, created and leads a new task force that will study name, image and likeness issues for college and high school athletes. 
You can also listen to a version of this interview on the latest episode of our podcast, “The Light Switch.”

Piper Hutchinson: NIL is such a fun topic, but I think some people don’t know what it is. Can you kind of explain what NIL is? 
Rep. Rashid Young:  NIL is an acronym for name, image and likeness, and it’s something that came about around 2020, 2021. It’s where athletes, college and or high school athletes are able to be paid off of their name, image and likeness. It’s very similar to the endorsement deals that professional athletes have been able to get for a while, and it started as players being able to use their name, image and likeness to get endorsement deals, and it has since morphed into something much more. 
Now we’re having conversations about revenue sharing. We’re having conversations about student athletes potentially becoming employees, but at its core, it is about the name, image and likeness of student athletes. 
  Rep. Rashid Young (Louisiana Legislature)
Hutchinson: You’re interested in this because you yourself were a student athlete. Is that right?
Young: Yeah, I was a student athlete for a while, and always loved sports from the time I was a little kid. Played it, I enjoyed it. And then after undergrad, I started doing some coaching and teaching as well. So I was really able to get into the development of other young players and then, you know, I later started practicing law. 
So now my passions are sort of intertwined between sports and law and legislating, and so this NIL space just seems to fit really well with my skill set and my passions.
Hutchinson: And you played football at Grambling back before NIL times? 
Young: I did. I played ball, that was before NIL was even thought of, and it’s funny because we would see our name on, like, the NCAA sports games, and we would be so excited, “Oh, look, I’m on the roster. I’m in the game.” But had we been able to capitalize and be paid off of it, that would have been great.
Hutchinson: It has been kind of a game changer. So you’ve got this task force. You just had your first meeting last week, but this started with some legislation. Tell me about the legislation and why it didn’t move forward.
Young:  Last session, I brought a piece of legislation that would have exempted the first $12,500 from being taxed by Louisiana for all NIL deals. And there was another colleague that brought legislation where he tried to exempt the entirety of NIL payments to students, both in the same spirit. Neither piece of legislation moved forward. 
My piece of legislation, it was my choice to not move it forward. I decided not to bring it for a committee vote after speaking with several members in the body, and I think the general consensus was that our body needed to be more informed on what NIL is, how that particular legislation could benefit the state and benefit the universities. 
So this task force is sort of one of those fact-seeking, information-finding initiatives where we’ll be able to go back to the legislature and say, “Hey, this is what our higher ed athletic directors and coaches are saying. This is how we can be competitive as a state and hopefully to be able to move some legislation like that forward in 2026.”
Hutchinson: What topics do you think the task force is going to cover and make recommendations on?
Young: We are looking at evaluating the effectiveness of the current NIL frameworks and university compliance. We’re looking at protecting student athletes from exploitation or inequitable agreements. Then we’re looking at recommending best practices that support the financial stability and competitive integrity of higher education athletic departments. 
I think that’s a huge undertaking. I think to be able to get some meaningful recommendations after five or six meetings is going to be really tough, but I think we have a good working group. I’m hopeful that we’ll walk away from the task force with some meaningful recommendations. 
Hutchinson: One of the big topics at the first meeting was the issue of international athletes and NIL. Why is that so tricky?
Young: I don’t claim to be the expert in international law. But from my understanding, there are work restrictions that the international students have. Their visas have certain work restrictions. I’m understanding that it’s going to come down to how we define income for international athletes. So are we defining it as passive income, which wouldn’t be violating the work requirements? Or are we define it as active income, which could potentially violate the terms of their visas? 
It’s a huge issue. We heard from quite a few athletic directors from across the state that are saying that a large portion of their athletic base is, in fact, international students, and so that’s something that we’re going to be looking to address. 
And look, it is a complex issue because you’re dealing with visas, you’re dealing with tax code definitions. All of that is something that I’m confident that this legislature can start to address and if we need to partner with folks on a federal level, I think we can do that.
Hutchinson: One of the things that surprised me from that first meeting was that there’s nothing in Louisiana law about NIL for high school athletes. We’ve got these kids running around making these NIL deals. Do you think regulating that is going to come up in the legislation?
Young: I think we are certainly going to propose something. I think we heard from a couple of representatives from the high school level, and one in particular, our legendary coach, JT Curtis. He was very passionate about what he’s seeing. He talked about predatory agents and marketing representation environment for high schools. 
I think it’s incumbent upon us as a state to step in and say, “Hey, how can we support our high school athletes?” So that’s certainly something that we’re looking at, and hopefully something we can move forward in 2026. 
Hutchinson: At the end of the day, we’re talking about young kids and pretty big sums of money. So there’s a need to protect them, right? 
Young: Absolutely, yeah, we’re talking about young kids, pretty big sums of money. We’re talking about their parents. We’re talking about their parents being able to understand what their kids are signing? And look, I’m a lawyer in my time when I’m not here in the legislature, and we know that you have to be 18 to be able to legally contract. There are some exceptions to the law, but we want to make sure that the parents and the kids understand from the beginning that if you’re not legally able to contract, then you shouldn’t be subjected to certain predatory suggestions from agents or people that claim to be agents. So that’s one of the areas that we want to look at. 
But at the end of day, it’s about protecting our babies. It’s about protecting our kids. And one of the things that the coach said that I thought was great, he talked about their mental health. That’s really important because we don’t want our most vulnerable in our population, our youth, to take hits to their mental health because we fail to regulate a particular area of law, so we want to step in and see how we can help.

Article Summary



The Chicago Cubs will host the 2027 MLB All-Star Game, the team’s fourth time hosting the event.
The announcement comes amid state- and city-backed security upgrades surrounding Wrigley Field being approved.
The 2027 season could be impacted by labor disputes between MLB players and owners.



This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

CHICAGO — The Chicago Cubs will host their fourth Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 2027.
The announcement, made Friday by MLB and Cubs officials, was attended by a cadre of elected officials, including Chicago’s mayor and several Chicago alderpeople, Gov. JB Pritzker, several state lawmakers and MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred.
The 2027 game would give Wrigley Field the record for most games hosted by an active ballpark. Wrigley Field previously hosted the All-Star Game in 1947, 1962 and 1990.
Illinois Senate President Don Harmon, a “congenital Sox fan who grew up watching the Cubs on television,” said the news is “terrific.”
“I think any opportunity we have to showcase the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois to a national or international audience — whether its NASCAR or the President’s Cup or the 2027 All-Star Game — is good for all of us,” Harmon, of Oak Park, said.
Wrigley Field, which opened in 1914, underwent a $1 billion renovation project throughout the 2010’s in connection to its efforts to someday host another All-Star Game, according to Cubs executive Crane Kenney.

Further upgrades to the security infrastructure around Wrigley are likely coming, with the current plan including $12 million from the state and up to $10 million from the city to install new bollards designed to stop vehicles and move some of the infrastructure in front of Wrigley Field.
“I’m very proud to have worked with the General Assembly to provide security enhancements to bolster public safety around the park,” Pritzker said. “I’m also a proud Cubs fan, so that made it especially easy.”
Cubs chairman and part-owner Tom Ricketts said the state and city have been involved in renovations for longer. Wrigley, nicknamed the Friendly Confines, is located on the city’s North Side, bounded by Clark and Addison streets and Waveland and Sheffield avenues.
“People don’t know this, but Addison is actually a state road,” Ricketts said. “We needed cooperation from the city to move some sidewalks and to help with security efforts. I just really appreciate the governor and the mayor stepping up to make this happen.”
Ricketts emphasized the All-Star Game and other associated events will bring people to the city.
“We’ll have events at Navy Pier, we’ll do the Home Run Derby on the night before, we’ll have other games, and they also bring the Major League Baseball draft,” Ricketts said. “So it’ll be an incredible week for Chicago.”

That’s if the game happens at all. There is increasing tension between MLB players and owners as they approach the end of the current collective bargaining agreement in December 2026.
Once that contract ends, it could result in a lockout and potentially the first canceled regular-season games since a player strike in the mid-90s, not counting games that were canceled during the pandemic. If the season is impacted severely enough, the All-Star Game may be canceled altogether.
The game is scheduled for July 13, 2027.

(Provided by US Army Corps of Engineers)A food or beverage company is eyeing Orangeburg County for a possible new packaging and distribution facility.
Little else is known about the company, referred to by the code name, “Project Panther,” as economic development officials negotiate a deal to bring the facility to the county in the center of the state.
The county and state economic development agency have filed for a permit with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking to fill in more than seven acres of wetlands on the 918-acre site south of the town of Orangeburg.
Those plans do not include any information on how much the company may invest or how many people it may hire. County economic development officials did not immediately respond to messages left by the SC Daily Gazette.
The application says the company has a need for access to rail and the interstate. Plans show an initial phase on the south end of the site with future phases expanding to the north and east.
The massive site is near Orangeburg’s municipal airport as well as existing industry, including a Hill’s pet food plant, cable maker The Okonite Company, Indevco plastics, metal powder supplier Ecka Granules and paving materials company Walker Emulsions.
The public has until Aug. 14 to comment on the application.
Electric vehicle battery-related company plans to build $1B plant in Orangeburg

The permit application follows another code-named deal, “Project Rhino,” under consideration by the county since March. That project, The Times and Democrat reported, could bring more than 600 new jobs to the area.
Last year, Orangeburg County netted its largest economic deal ever: a $1 billion dollar battery materials manufacturer.

Janet Mills gives her state of the budget address in January 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Amid uncertainty over federal funding and the impact of steeper tariffs announced by the Trump administration Friday, Maine ended the fiscal year with a $152.2 million general fund surplus, nearly $60 million more than in 2024. 
The Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services reported this figure on Friday, following the end of the fiscal year on June 30. The state’s Budget Stabilization Fund, also known as the rainy day fund, has also reached a record $1.03 billion, the maximum prescribed in statute.
Also this week, Fitch Ratings, a top international credit rating agency, upgraded its bond credit for Maine, Gov. Janet Mills and State Treasurer Joe Perry announced Friday. The agency increased Maine’s rating from “AA” to “AA+” — its second highest rating — noting the state’s “proven ability to maintain significantly improved dedicated operating reserves through a challenging budget cycle.” 
“Governor Mills’ and the Legislature’s fiscal policies have allowed us to build significant cash reserves, creating flexibility and security for the state,” said Perry, who was a former Democratic state representative. “This ratings upgrade from Fitch affirms that we are on a good path.”
The news comes after Mills and the state financial office have repeatedly warned about a projected overall revenue shortfall in the coming years, arguing that the state needs to tighten its belt and avoid new major spending commitments.
In a statement to Maine Morning Star, Sharon Huntley, director of communications for DAFS, explained that the surplus comes from the current fiscal year and is not related to the biennial budget that was set in June. 
Gov. Mills vows lean budget in light of projected revenue shortfall

Maine was facing a projected $450 million deficit, as well as an immediate funding gap to cover the cost of MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, when crafting that budget this year. 
The Maine Legislature failed to pass emergency spending to address the short-term deficit after Senate Republicans held out support, leading to delayed payments to providers. 
The Democratic majority of the Legislature then pushed through a two-year budget in March without Republican support that continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing some one-time funding for urgent needs, such as Medicaid, and in June passed a budget addition. That addition did not make as many program cuts or tax hikes as Mills requested.
One of the ways lawmakers managed to reject some of those cost-saving measures was by making use of unanticipated agency surpluses. For example, the budget paid for Medicaid in part by adding surplus cash at the end of the 2025 fiscal year into what’s called the “cascade,” a legislative authorization transferring available surplus funds at the close of the fiscal year after all statutory and financial commitments are met.  
After transfers to Medicaid and other statutory priorities, Maine law requires the remaining surplus to be divided, with 80% going to the budget stabilization fund and 20% to the highway and bridge capital fund. This year’s cascade resulted in $79.4 million added to the budget stabilization fund and $33.8 million to the highway fund.
“The nearly $34 million will be used to ensure this year’s construction as defined in our three-year work plan is adequately funded,” said Bruce Van Note, commissioner of the Maine Department of Transportation, who is retiring this month. “The plan includes projects that will improve roads and bridges, enhance safety, and increase economic opportunity through upgraded transportation infrastructure across the state.”
While celebrating the savings and upgraded credit rating, Mills highlighted in a statement that uncertainty with federal funding remains.
“Over the past six years, my administration has worked hard to invest in Maine people, improve our economy, and produce responsible, balanced state budgets,” Mills said. “I look forward to maintaining this progress for Maine people, despite the needless economic challenges and uncertainty coming from Washington.”
Maine has faced funding cuts under President Donald Trump’s administration, as have other states, in addition to what’s widely been considered retribution from the Trump administration over the state’s protections for transgender people. 
The administration also went ahead with implementing its sweeping tariffs that had been postponed until Friday. Now amounting to import taxes at levels not seen since the 1930s, these tariffs are expected to hurt Maine’s economy, notably due to Canada as the state’s largest trading partner and major source of tourism.
Because of uncertainty with federal funding and the economy, specifically impacts from tariffs, Maine’s Revenue Forecasting Committee discussed this spring possibly revising projections ahead of its next scheduled update on Nov. 1 but has so far made no such plans. 
As the end of the federal fiscal year approaches on September 30, U.S. Congress is also facing a possible government shutdown if it fails to pass appropriations bills by then, indicating the likelihood of another stop gap funding bill to avoid that.

(Photo courtesy pf DMACC)A former Des Moines Area Community College administrator, fired after making a comment about having “pulled a knife” on someone, is now suing the school, alleging age and racial discrimination.
Kim Jackson of Des Moines, who ran DMACC’s Upward Bound program for 20 years, is suing the school in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Jackson alleges she was employed by DMACC for a total of 26 years until she was abruptly and wrongfully terminated on July 2, 2024. She alleges she filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and that the EEOC subsequently issued her a formal notice of her right to sue, clearing the way for her lawsuit.

Jackson alleges the school fired her for the pretextual reasons of gross misconduct and conduct unbecoming a supervisor.
The lawsuit notes that in November 2024, an administrative law judge with the Iowa Unemployment Insurance Appeals Bureau conducted a hearing on Jackson’s unemployment benefits claim and later ruled that, contrary to what DMACC had claimed, Jackson had not engaged in workplace misconduct.
According to the findings of the judge in that case, Jackson had raised her voice during a discussion with other Upward Bound employees in June 2024. Jackson had “a family connection” to two students who were being discussed and the other Upward Bound employees felt Jackson had been favoring the two and treating them differently than the other students in the program.
After being told the two students were rude and behaving in an “entitled” manner, Jackson allegedly responded that if one of the two had made the comments attributed to him it was not appropriate, stating loudly, “If he spoke to you like that, he needs to be corrected. He did not come from a family where that is okay.”
The judge found that Jackson “did not yell at the other employees, use profanity, threaten anyone, or disagree with the premise of the conversation.”
The judge noted that two days later, Jackson apologized to her colleagues for having raised her voice. While explaining that she tried to control her anger, Jackson referenced an incident from her youth when she pulled a knife on someone when she was angry — a comment some of her DMACC colleagues allegedly took as a threat, the judge found.
She was later fired for her conduct.
As a result of the unemployment hearing, Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Johnson awarded Jackson jobless benefits, finding there was no workplace misconduct that would disqualify her.
“I do not believe Ms. Jackson referencing ‘pulling a knife’ on someone in her youth was a threat, but an explanation of why she no longer acts on her anger today,” Johnson ruled. “I do not think anyone in that meeting reasonably believed it was a threat, given that they all remained in the meeting and did not flee or call 911 or Campus Security.”
The lawsuit alleges the school’s stated reasons for firing Jackson were pretextual and that that DMACC’s Human Resources Department had been trying to get her to take early retirement since 2020, when she was roughly 60 years old.
“When Jackson was terminated, she was the only Black DMACC employee at a director-level position,” the lawsuit alleges. “Jackson’s responsibilities and roles were replaced by two white females who were more than 10 years younger than Jackson.”
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including back pay and punitive damages, for discrimination and retaliation.
DMACC has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The school’s spokesperson could not be reached for comment late Thursday.

Briner said he did not consider artificial intelligence to be a replacement for people but to be used as a tool to help with their work. 
Workers comfortable with technology used it most, according to a report from the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Research at NC Central University. A few rarely used it. 
Workers felt best about using ChatGPT to write emails and letters, summarize meeting transcripts, find hidden or outdated information, and help with legal or compliance phrasing and documentation, according to the report. 
The report described 37% of the workers who participated in the pilot project as “super users” who used ChatGPT several times a day. Forty-eight percent were called “sporadic, general users” who deployed ChatGPT as needed for specific challenges. 
Seventy-one percent of ChatGPT users were positive about it, said Siobahn Day Grady, director of NCCU’s AI institute.
ChatGTP users found it did sometimes “hallucinate” or produce inaccurate information. It didn’t do well with coding, math-heavy, or legal work, the report said. 
“The technology is not perfect,” but neither are people, Grady said. 
“We always need to do our due diligence, and when using the technology, making sure that things are factual and not rely 100 percent on it to do our jobs, because we are the subject matter experts.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4464-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 14:56:52.139248

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis is questioning the federal government’s recruitment of Florida’s local and state police who are focused on enforcing immigration laws.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been recruiting officers with specialized training to work for the federal agency, ABC news reported Thursday.
“I know that there’s some sheriffs that have some strong feelings about it,” DeSantis said Friday during a news conference in Orlando, flanked by Florida Highway Patrol troopers and the members of the Florida Cabinet. 
ICE is “dangling like a lot of bonus money and all this other stuff,” as the governor put it, to local and state officers who’ve received partial or full training in enforcing immigration laws and participating in 287(g) agreements. 
“Why not recruit additional people to be supplementing that instead of just kind of displacing?” DeSantis said. 
He bragged that Florida has made a stronger effort than any other state in deputizing state and local law enforcement officers to act on behalf of ICE. According to data released this week from that agency, approximately 320 of the nearly 900 agencies in the United States that have signed agreements with ICE are in Florida. 
“That’s been a huge help to ICE right? Let’s just be clear, that’s been a huge benefit to those federal agencies. And so now, if you’re in a situation where those folks are being poached off of that mission, well it’s like, wait a minute, how is that? Why don’t you bring in new people to supplement a mission going forward?” DeSantis said. 
The agency has offered willing officers up to a $50,000 bonus, paid over five years, ABC reported. 
“I think we want to continue doing what we’re doing. But sheriffs losing deputies who are in this fight to just go wear a different jersey, basically, but still be in the fight, that doesn’t necessarily add to what we’re doing. It’s just moving someone over. And so I think there is frustration from that, and so, we’ll see,” DeSantis said. 
Also in the ABC report, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri called ICE’s outreach “wrong.”
“We have partnered with ICE like no other state to help ICE do its job of illegal immigration enforcement,” Gualtieri told the news organization. “ICE actively trying to use our partnership to recruit our personnel is wrong and we have expressed our concern to ICE leadership.”
DeSantis said he told sheriffs it’s up to them to “fight for what you think is right” and that he’s “heard a lot of static coming out of our sheriff’s departments” about the recruitment letters.

Everglades detention center
The news conference, nearly an hour and a half in length, featured the governor reciting the state’s record on immigration enforcement, including talking extensively about the Everglades deportation center that’s garnered national attention. 
The governor referenced news reports about the conditions inside the temporary facility. NBC reported “torturous conditions in cage-like units full of mosquitoes, where fluorescent lights shine bright on them at all times.”
“Phony narratives,” DeSantis called them but suggested: “Maybe they will have the intent, the effect, of deterring people from going there and choosing this option.”
State Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando, responded to the governor’s news conference in a written statement.
“Ron DeSantis and his hand-picked Cabinet didn’t come to Orlando to solve problems — they came to peddle a half-billion-dollar anti-immigrant grift. While everyday Floridians are struggling with the cost of living, DeSantis is using taxpayer dollars to fund a secretive detention camp, rip families apart, and divert our public safety officials away from real community needs,” she said in a written statement.
“They talk about enforcing the law while breaking it — hiding contracts, denying people due process, and using an appointed Attorney General who was just found in contempt of court. They intimidate local elected officials and ignore home rule, not based on laws but on political agendas. This isn’t leadership. It’s lawlessness.
“Floridians deserve better than political theater. Shut down the Everglades camp, restore transparency, and start putting people before politics.”
In addition to the Attorney General James Uthmeir, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, and Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson, DeSantis was joined by Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Director Dave Kerner, FHP Director Gary Howze II, and State Board of Immigration Enforcement Director Larry Keefe. 
Republican leaders will gather in Orlando this weekend for the Florida Freedom Forum, a fundraiser for the Republican Party of Florida.

,California,2025-08-01 18:11:43+00:00,CalMatters,A Trump order targets gender-affirming care for youth. California is suing to block it,Ana B. Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/08/gender-affirming-care-lawsuit/,California Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed suit seeking to overturn an executive order targeting gender-affirming care for people under 19.,"In summary
California Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed suit seeking to overturn an executive order targeting gender-affirming care for people under 19. 


Trump administration restrictions on gender-affirming care for transgender and nonbinary youth violate the Constitution and undermine state laws that require equal access to medical treatment, according to a lawsuit filed today by Attorney General Rob Bonta and 14 other states and the District of Columbia. 
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, targets a January executive order that makes it U.S. policy not to “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support” gender transition for people under 19. The order threatens to pull federal funding from medical institutions that provide this type of care. 
“The result is an atmosphere of fear and intimidation experienced by transgender individuals, their families and caregivers, and the medical professionals who seek only to provide necessary, lawful care to their patients,” the attorneys general wrote in the suit.
This marks the 37th lawsuit California has filed against the Trump administration.
Gender-affirming care is legal and protected for people 18 years old and older in California. Certain treatments are also available to younger people with parental consent. The lawsuit comes as some of the largest medical providers in the state halt gender-affirming services.
The Trump administration has “trampled over state rights, overstepped their constitutional authority and endangered vulnerable minors and 18-year-olds,” Bonta said in a Friday press conference announcing the lawsuit alongside the attorneys general of Illinois and Connecticut. 
U.S. Department of Justice officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.
Providers scale back care
Following Trump’s executive order, the Justice Department directed employees to investigate doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies that provided gender-affirming care. In July, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced in a statement that her department had issued more than 20 subpoenas to medical providers as it investigates “healthcare fraud, false statements and more.”
Fearing prosecution, providers have scaled back on providing this type of care, which has left many patients without critical medical care, Bonta said. The care includes hormone therapy, puberty blockers and surgical procedures. Research shows that gender-affirming care can positively impact the mental health of transgender youth. Forcing young people to wait until they are 19 or older to start care allows symptoms of gender dysphoria to worsen, Bonta said.
The state attorneys general argue that acceding to Trump’s orders puts providers at odds with states’ anti-discrimination and age-of-majority laws. In California, it is illegal to deny care on the basis of gender identity and gender expression. At the same time, many medical providers rely heavily on federal funding in the form of research and education grants, as well as reimbursements from public payer programs like Medi-Cal.
The directives from the Trump administration have already forced several providers to suspend services. Last month, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles closed its gender-affirming care center, forcing about 3,000 patients under 21 to look elsewhere for care. 
“The shutdown came despite efforts my office took over recent months to assure (Children’s Hospital Los Angeles) that they were protected and required to provide gender-affirming care,” Bonta said.
Stanford Medicine has also paused surgical procedures for people under 19. And this week, Kaiser Permanente announced that it too would pause gender-affirming surgeries starting Aug. 29, noting that hormone therapies would still be available. 
The executive order being challenged is just one of several that Trump has issued targeting transgender people. Others include one that recognizes only two biological sexes, a second that prevents transgender girls and women from participating in women’s sports, and a third that threatens federal funds for schools that support transgender youth.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021325_CHLA-Gender-Affirming-Care-Demo_JWH_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-01 14:56:52.139248

(Provided/Discover South Carolina)Faster internet could be coming to some South Carolina state parks.
Officials with the state parks department are evaluating parks with existing internet connections to determine which locations might benefit from higher-speed fiber optic cable, said spokeswoman Jayne Baker.
“This initiative aims to improve internet connectivity, support digital services and provide better experiences for visitors,” Baker said.
Visitors can access free Wi-Fi at 15 of the state’s 48 parks.
First on the docket for upgrades is Lake Greenwood State Park in Greenwood County. The parks department plans to pay internet company Upcountry Fiber nearly $100,000 to install high-speed internet at the park, according to a recent public notice.
Free Wi-Fi is already available at the 914-acre park’s office area and Drummond Center event space, according to its website.
A list of other parks that might get faster Wi-Fi was not available. Neither was a timeline for installation, Baker said.
Department staff are still evaluating which parks may or may not need upgrades, she said.
The need for faster internet has grown with increases in park attendance in recent years, department officials wrote in a request for state funding.
Wi-Fi at state parks helps staff stay connected, including during natural disasters and other emergencies, and also allows visitors to “have quick access to the information they need to make travel plans and decisions,” according to the agency budget request.
The Legislature set aside $200,000 to help improve information technology systems at park department-owned properties in the 2024-2025 budget, but no money was specifically designated for technology upgrades in the current fiscal year budget.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 18:06:40+00:00,CT Mirror,CT among states suing Trump over gender-affirming care,Associated Press and Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/ct-among-states-suing-trump-over-gender-affirming-care/,The lawsuit comes after at least eight hospital systems — including two in CT — said they were stopping or restricting gender-affirming care.,"Seventeen Democratic officials accused President Donald Trump’s administration of unlawfully intimidating health care providers into stopping gender-affirming care for transgender youth in a lawsuit filed Friday.
The complaint comes after a month in which at least eight major hospitals and hospital systems — all in states, including Connecticut, where the care is allowed under state law — announced they were stopping or restricting the care. The latest announcement came Thursday from UI Health in Chicago.
Trump’s administration announced in July that it was sending subpoenas to providers and focusing on investigating them for fraud. It later boasted in a news release that hospitals are halting treatments.
The Democratic officials say Trump’s policies are an attempt to impose a nationwide ban on the treatment for people under 19 — and that’s unlawful because there’s no federal statute that bans providing the care to minors. The suit was filed by attorneys general from 15 states, including Connecticut, and the District of Columbia, plus the governor of Pennsylvania, in U.S. District Court in Boston.
“The federal government is running a cruel and targeted harassment campaign against providers who offer lawful, lifesaving care to children,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
Trump and others who oppose the care say that it makes permanent changes that people who receive it could come to regret — and maintain that it’s being driven by questionable science.
Since 2021, 28 states with Republican-controlled legislatures have adopted policies to ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have a right to enforce those laws.
For families with transgender children, the state laws and medical center policy changes have sparked urgent scrambles for treatment.
Medical centers are responding to political and legal pressure
At a press conference in Hartford on Friday afternoon, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong criticized Yale New Haven Health and Connecticut Children’s Medical Center for recent announcements that they would stop providing medication treatment as part of their youth gender-affirming care services.
“I have expressed to them not just my disappointment, but the state’s profound disappointment, in their actions. And the state’s position is that the actions they have taken are wrong,” Tong said, though he added that the facilities are “between a rock and a hard place.”
Tong said senior leadership of both institutions told him they would provide gender-affirming care to patients under 19 if not for the threats from the federal government. However, he confirmed that, to his knowledge, none of the federal actions currently in effect directly threaten the hospitals’ Medicaid funding for providing such care. But that might not be true for long, he added.
“I’m not aware of a specific action at this moment,” Tong said. “But obviously we’re looking down the barrel at it.”
Heather Page, a parent of a trans child, said Yale New Haven Health’s decision sends the message that trans people do not deserve the same standard of care as everyone else. 
“It sends the message that they don’t matter and that they aren’t worth fighting for. This isn’t just about one program. It’s about the right to exist safely and access the care needed to thrive,” Page said.
Page said she’s made an appointment for her daughter at Boston Children’s Hospital, roughly an hour drive from the family’s home in Bethel.
The Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, the biggest public provider of gender-affirming care for children in teens in the U.S., closed in July.
At least seven other major hospitals and health systems have made similar announcements, including Children’s National in Washington D.C., UChicago Medicine and Yale New Haven Health.
Kaiser Permanente, which operates in California and several other states, said it would pause gender-affirming surgeries for those under 19 as of the end of August but would continue hormone therapy.
Connecticut Children’s Medical Center cited “an increasingly complex and evolving landscape” for winding down care.
Other hospitals, including Penn State, had already made similar decisions since Trump returned to office in January.
Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, an organization that advocates for health care equity for LGBTQ+ people, said the health systems have pulled back the services for legal reasons, not medical ones.
“Not once has a hospital said they are ending care because it is not medically sound,” Sheldon said.
Trump’s administration has targeted the care in multiple ways
Trump devoted a lot of attention to transgender people in his campaign last year as part of a growing pushback from conservatives as transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance on some fronts. Trump criticized gender-affirming care, transgender women in women’s sports, and transgender women’s use of women’s facilities such as restrooms.
On his inauguration day in January, Trump signed an executive order defining the sexes as only male and female for government purposes, setting the tone for a cascade of actions that affect transgender people. About a week later, Trump called to stop using federal money, including from Medicaid, for gender-affirming care for those under 19.
About half of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s handling of transgender issues, an AP-NORC poll found. But the American Medical Association says that gender is on a spectrum, and the group opposes policies that restrict access to gender-affirming health care.
Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person’s gender identity, including when it’s different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It includes counseling and treatment with medications that block puberty, and hormone therapy to produce physical changes, as well as surgery, which is rare for minors.
In March, a judge paused enforcement of the ban on government spending for care.
The court ruling didn’t stop other federal government action
In April, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed government investigators to focus on providers who continue to offer gender-affirming care for transgender youth. “Under my leadership, the Department of Justice will bring these practices to an end,” she wrote.
In May, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report discouraging medical interventions for transgender youth and instead focusing solely on talk therapy. The report questions adolescents’ capacity to consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility. The administration has not said who wrote the report, which has been deeply criticized by LGBTQ+ advocates.
In June, a Justice Department memo called for prioritizing civil investigations of those who provide the treatment.
In July, Justice Department announced it had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics involved in gender-affirming care for youth, saying they were part of investigations of health care fraud, false statements and other possible wrongdoing.
And in a statement last week, the White House celebrated decisions to end gender-affirming care, which it called a “barbaric, pseudoscientific practice”
Families worry about accessing care
Kristen Salvatore’s 15-year-old child started hormone therapy late last year at Penn State Health. Salvatore said in an interview with The Associated Press before the lawsuit was announced that it was a major factor in reduced signs of anxiety and depression. Last month, the family received official notice from the health system that it would no longer offer the hormones for patients under 19 after July 31, though talk therapy can continue.
Salvatore has been struggling to find a place that’s not hours away from their Mechanicsburg, Pa., home that would provide the hormones and accept Medicaid coverage.
“I’m walking around blind with no guidance, and whatever breadcrumbs I was given are to a dead-end alleyway,” she said.
The family has enough testosterone stockpiled to last until January. But if they can’t find a new provider by then, Salvatore’s child could risk detransitioning, she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/yale-new-haven-hospital-3-e1608677205753.jpg,,,2025-08-01 14:56:52.139248

Mike Braun, flanked by Indiana State Police personnel, holds a news conference in his Statehouse office on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A trio of Indiana agencies have signed up for federal immigration enforcement powers, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun announced Friday.
“Indiana is not a safe haven for illegal immigration,” Braun said in a news release. “Indiana will fully partner with federal immigration authorities as they enforce the most fundamental laws of our country.”
If U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement approves the agreements, the Indiana State Police, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Correction would join four local Hoosier agencies — and nearly 900 others from across the nation — that have inked similar deals.
The formal partnerships are authorized in Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and let ICE delegate certain immigration enforcement powers to state or local officers.
There are three active program models: task force, warrant service officer and jail enforcement.
The Indiana State Police has submitted a memorandum of agreement for the task force model, according to an ICE list of pending deals that was updated Friday morning. So did the Department of Homeland Security.
Indiana immigration arrests surge despite stalled ICE partnerships

The Department of Correction asked for a warrant service officer deal. The agency is “working with ICE to make available up to 1,000 beds at Miami Correctional Facility,” the news release said.
The announcement follows an executive order Braun issued in January directing Hoosier law enforcement agencies to “fully cooperate with ICE, and, to the maximum extent permitted, enter into (287(g)) agreements.”
If ICE approves the deals, the agencies will be moved to a separate list of enacted deals. But that doesn’t mean they’re active.
The agencies will nominate specific personnel to take on federal powers. However, the officer nominees must undergo ICE training and pass examinations to be deputized.
Nominees from at least two of the four local Indiana agencies that have finalized 287(g) agreements with ICE still have not been trained — and therefore, haven’t been tapped in the national deportation effort, the Capital Chronicle found.
Braun is “also anticipating further partnership” between the Indiana National Guard and federal immigration authorities, it continued. That will not be a 287(g) agreement, according to the Braun administration.
Camp Atterbury — a federally owned military installation that is licensed to and operated by the guard — will be used to hold immigrant detainees.
It will be “available for temporary use by the (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security to house illegal aliens subject to deportation, with safety in mind for staff, detainees, and surrounding communities,” the news release said.
The plan was revealed last month in a letter from U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to congressional members.

(Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico’s nuclear victims waited 80 years for recognition and the right for compensation under the federal Radiation and Exposure Compensation Act.
It took less than a month for scams to develop targeting those victims.
RECA — created in 1990 to provide restitution to people sickened by exposure to radiation and uranium — excluded New Mexico’s downwinders and post-1971 uranium miners, expired last year after years of lobbying for expansion by victims and New Mexico’s elected leaders.
But President Donald Trump signed a two-year expansion and extension into law earlier this month as part of Republicans so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.”
‘The beginning of justice’

On Tuesday, both the New Mexico Department of Justice and the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium issued a warning that RECA scams have already developed. According to an NMDOJ news release, “organizations and attorneys are soliciting people to file claims with them for a fee, despite the fact that New Mexico will have a legitimate claim submission process and guidance forthcoming.”
The U.S. Department of Justice has not yet announced an official claims process for qualifying New Mexicans. Both U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) last week recently sent letters to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer urging them to issue guidance quickly for RECA given the short two-year timeline for compensation.
“We are grateful to our Congressional Delegation who tirelessly advocated for the expansion of these critical compensation efforts,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “New Mexicans who have been affected by these exposures deserve compensation — and they deserve to get that compensation free from bad actors attempting to take advantage of them. We encourage New Mexicans to file claims through legitimate entities to ensure they receive the maximum compensation they are entitled to through RECA, and also to file any reports of suspected fraudulent activity with our office.”
The news release notes that any entity that files a RECA claim on behalf of residents will charge a fee, which is capped at 2% by law, but can increase to 10% if that claim is rejected. Moreover, the state will have official RECA clinics to assist people.
The Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium said it will have official updates online.
“The people of New Mexico have waited 80 years for acknowledgement of the harm they suffered as a result of being overexposed to radiation from the Trinity bomb,” TBDC co-founder Tina Cordova said in a statement. “We hope everyone will be patient a little longer as details of the claim process are developed. Please don’t allow someone to take part of your claim out of fear or some sense of urgency. We will do all we can to assist with the claims process once the guidelines are released.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 17:22:43+00:00,CT Mirror,CT agrees to borrow $155 million to offset cost of electric bills,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/ct-public-benefits-charge-electric-billslls/,The CT Bond Commission voted to borrow $155M to help offset the cost of electric bills by paying off a portion of the public benefits charge.,"The State Bond Commission on Friday agreed to borrow $155 million to help offset the cost of residents’ electric bills, at least partially delivering on a promise of savings made by lawmakers during the most recent legislative session.
The bonds were issued to pay off a portion of the public benefits charge, which is used to fund state-mandated programs that have become subject to intense scrutiny in the larger debate over Connecticut’s high cost of electricity. 
By borrowing money to pay for some of those programs, officials estimated customers could see an average of between $5 and $10 savings on their monthly electric bills starting in September, depending on usage and which utility customers get their electricity from.
The commission, which is led by Gov. Ned Lamont, voted unanimously to approve the borrowing at its Friday meeting. 
“I know how upset everybody is with electric rates,” Lamont told reporters afterward. “We didn’t make a big difference, but we made a difference… at least by reduced rates. I can’t promise you what your bill is going to do, it depends what you do with the air conditioner.”
The authorization to borrow money to provide direct relief to ratepayers came from Senate Bill 4, the omnibus energy savings legislation that lawmakers spent months crafting earlier this year. Lamont signed the bill after it passed both chambers with bipartisan support in early June.
The initial estimates from proponents of that bill were that it would save customers in Connecticut between $325 million and $350 million annually off of their electric bills — or about $100 a year for the typical customer.
The bulk of that savings, at least initially, is expected to come from the state bonds. 
The initial tranche of borrowing approved by the Bond Commission on Friday included $125 million to pay off unpaid bills that accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with $30 million to cover the costs associated with the state’s electric vehicle charging program. Both costs were previously included as part of the public benefits charge.
An additional round of borrowing is expected next year, according to Lamont’s office. If approved, the associated savings will last through early 2027.
During the negotiations over S.B. 4, Republicans pushed for an even bigger package of savings by removing the public benefits charge altogether from customers’ bills, and instead paying for those programs through the state budget.
While that could have resulted in savings of up to 20% off customers’ bill, the cost — estimated at around $1 billion annually — proved to be unpalatable for Democrats, including Gov. Lamont, who argued they would have had to cut spending in other areas.
 Still, some Republicans on Friday bemoaned the level of savings even as they joined with Democrats to approve the bonds. 
“It doesn’t go far enough,” said Rep. Joe Polletta, R-Watertown, who is a member of the Bond Commission. “It’s a good first start, I think I credit both sides of the aisle for negotiating the bill, but Republicans have been calling for reducing that public benefits charge even further and getting a lot of those items into the general fund, where we can debate them, have a public hearing and we can vote on them.”
The savings attached to the bonds come on top of earlier rate relief that most customers already experienced in July as a result of a drop in standard supply rates at both of the state’s largest utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating. In May, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority also approved rate adjustments lowering the public benefits charge portion of customers’ bills. 
“There’s stuff that’s happening organically anyways, and then there’s stuff happening as a result of our bill getting passed,” said Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, who was one of the principal authors of S.B. 4.
“Hopefully, this piece hits in September and brings the bill down more,” he added.  
In addition to public borrowing, S.B. 4 also authorized utilities to securitize their storm costs and the rollout of advanced metering technology. Those bonds, which were not a part of the Bond Commission’s agenda on Friday, will be paid back by utility customers through the public benefits charge, but over a longer period of time and at lower interest rates than under the current law.
In its other business Friday, the bond commission approved:

Nearly $1.6 billion in transportation bonding to finance a wide array of upgrades to Connecticut’s aging network of highways, bridges and rail lines. Two of the largest initiatives involve $157.5 million to replace the Norwalk River Rail Bridge, a four-track span that serves the Metro-North commuter line and Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor lines, and $50 million for continued rehabilitation of the Gold Star Memorial Bridge, which carries Interstate 95 across the Thames River between New London and Groton.
$40 million to cover the first half of the $80 million Town Aid Road grant due to Connecticut municipalities this fiscal year. Communities use those funds to cover repaving, drainage work and other routine road maintenance and to purchase sand, salt and other materials to support winter snow removal. The state is expected to deliver the remaining $40 million due cities and towns after Jan. 1.

Donavan McKinney, Macomb County Commissioner Michael Howard, and State Rep. Mai Xiong. July 31, 2025 | Photo courtesy of Michigan Families for Fair CareMichigan residents living in the 7th and 10th Congressional Districts had choice words for Republican U.S. Reps. Tom Barrett and John James during two townhalls held this week focused on the impact of federal Medicaid cuts – but neither of the congressmen were there to hear them.
Michigan Families for Fair Care, a left-of-center nonprofit dedicated to highlighting the voting records of the representatives, hosted the rallies in Lansing and Warren on Wednesday and Thursday evening. Each event targeted Barrett’s and James’ districts with attendance from Democratic Party activists, community members and those running for office against them on the Democratic sides of the races.
The future of health care and food assistance following federal cuts in the Republican “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” were among the primary concerns at both town halls. The cuts are expected to impact hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, including $6 billion to hospitals in Michigan’s Medicaid program and the 1.5 million people who are likely to be affected by cuts to Michigan’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
More than 2.6 million Michiganders rely on Medicaid access for affordable health care.
In Warren on Thursday, the panel included Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, state Rep. Mai Xiong of Warren and state Rep. Donavan McKinney of Detroit. Gilchrist is seeking the Michigan Democratic Party nomination for governor in 2026, while McKinney is seeking to primary U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar of Detroit, a Democrat who currently represents the 13th Congressional District. Macomb County Commissioner Michael Howard, also a Democrat, was on the panel as well.
Gilchrist that it was up to community members to stand up when their elected officials don’t show up for them. To that end, he said that James was absent from the community he served, and was more interested in running “to Washington to vote for this bill that guts Medicaid.”
“Do you know that 182,000 in this district are living with Medicaid? That there are 41,000 veterans in the state of Michigan who are getting services from Medicaid?” Gilchrist asked the crowd, and by proxy an absent James. “These are the people he voted to strip and rip health care from. These are the people who he has voted to kill faster than they otherwise would have passed away. His absent leadership is dangerous.”
McKinney said that the community he serves and is seeking to serve in Congress has a medium income of $13,000 a year. With multiple children, McKinney said he also struggles balancing child care and other vital expenses to keep his family healthy and secure, and that was on a state representative’s salary. He said that someone earning less than $14,000 a year, which equates to about just $1,000 a month in take home pay, would face even greater hardships now that programs like Medicaid and SNAP are being slashed at the federal level.
“They do not need elected officials to cut one single resource, but that’s what this man, so-called Congressman John James, just did,” McKinney said, before adding that the congressmen on either side of 8 Mile Road at the border of Wayne and Macomb counties were absent from their districts, referring to James and Thanedar.
For Xiong, everything happening at the federal level is now touching all of her constituents’ lives.
“No matter if you are a Republican or a Democrat or independent,” Xiong said. “What’s happening at the federal level is hurting so many families. It’s devastating. We’re in unprecedented times. In all my 40 years that I’ve been alive, I don’t think that we’ve ever faced as many obstacles as we have this year.”
The trio took questions throughout the night on the state of Medicaid and SNAP in the fallout of the bill, and on the ways Democrats could strategize in order to talk about the cuts with their friends and neighbors, including Republicans who might be feeling buyers remorse.
One question focused on James’ joining the Republican stated goal of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse and using that as a guise to finally cut areas of the federal budget that GOP hawks have salivated over ripping apart for decades.
Gilchrist said what they’re actually going after is people’s ability to live and thrive.
“When they say they want to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, and then the action they take is getting rid of services and health care and food assistance, it means they think that the people are the waste,” Gilchrist said. “So maybe they weren’t lying when they said they want to get rid of waste, because instead, they are harming and killing, in this case, the people in the state of Michigan. … It’s inhumane. It’s cruel.”
He noted that was the major difference between Republicans and Democrats in the modern age. Gilchrist also touched on the billion-dollar Michigan budget hole that will be created in the fallout from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s cuts and provisions.
“That’s something John James did to us on purpose,” Gilchrist said. “It wasn’t an accident. It was intentional. What we have to do [now] is triage. How do we take care of the pregnant women who are more likely to die because their health care just got cut? … We need to be a little more creative.”
With those new holes in the budget and the current stalemate over the process going nowhere between the Republican-controlled Michigan House and the Democratic-led state Senate, McKinney said it could be possible that Michigan’s government shuts down on Oct. 1. He also said he believes that’s what the Republicans in the House want.
“We’re fighting like hell to figure it out, but these Republicans are playing hardball,” McKinney said. “They really don’t care. Whatever Trump is doing, they’re just following the federal protocol in D.C.”
Byrum leads panel in Lansing
The Lansing event featured Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for secretary of state, state Rep. Kara Hope of Holt and Ingham County Commissioner Ryan Sebolt.
Like the panel in Macomb County on Thursday, Byrum on Wednesday said that it was up to constituents to fight for their needs and resources when their elected leaders don’t show up for them, noting that Barrett has avoided town halls just like the ones held this week.

Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte). Not pictured: Tom Barrett. July 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan Advance
She also counseled those in attendance to reach out to their friends and neighbors to explain how these cuts will affect their lives, but cautioned to do it with empathy, deep listening and to avoid saying, “I told you so.”
“Be reflective,” Byrum said. “I think if we have those conversations, I think that will also help. It’s imperative, and it’s so fitting that we’re sitting in the AFL-CIO building, that we remember that we are stronger together. We need to lean on each other.”
Although no candidate who might face Barrett was on the panel, several of his Democratic challengers were in the audience, including Michigan State University professor Josh Cowen, former NAVY Seal Matt Maasdam and Elyon Badger.

New Hampshire has become the first state to require doctors and medical staff to sterilize patients who request it.
The measure focuses on adults who have medical conditions for which sterilization may be a treatment option. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed the bipartisan bill into law on July 15.
The law says physicians can’t deny sterilization based on a patient’s age, number of children, marital status, or if the physician has views on fertility that run contrary to the patient’s wishes.

It’s the first law of its kind. And it comes at a time when state legislators across the country have enacted laws restricting women’s reproductive choices.
“A doctor should not withhold your needed treatment because the doctor doesn’t like the idea that you decided not to have kids or don’t want any more kids,” New Hampshire Democratic state Rep. Ellen Read, who sponsored the bill, said earlier this month during a panel at the National Foundation for Women Legislators.
Her cosponsors included two Democrats and two Republicans.

Read said her own medical experience led her to sponsor the bill. She was diagnosed at 26 with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that can cause painful periods, infertility, ovarian cysts and an increased risk of other diseases, such as diabetes. As Read’s health worsened over the years, she said, her doctors continued pushing her to wait to get a hysterectomy, in case she wanted a child in the future, even though she and her husband — who had already gotten a vasectomy — had decided they didn’t want children.
Sterilization, or permanent contraception, is the most common method of contraception among U.S. women of reproductive age, and it’s one of the most straightforward surgical procedures an OB-GYN can perform, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
In women this is a tubal ligation, where the fallopian tubes are closed off or removed; in men it is a vasectomy, where a portion of the tube that carries sperm is removed. A hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, also renders a woman sterile.
But in the United States, sterilization has a fraught history. Vulnerable groups have been sterilized without their knowledge or consent, including people with disabilities, Indigenous women and Black women. In the past, many have been sterilized as the result of state laws.
Meanwhile, others who desire sterilization have been unable to access it. One survey of 1,800 obstetrician-gynecologists found that while most OB-GYNs said they would help a patient obtain a tubal ligation, up to 70% would try to dissuade her, depending on characteristics such as how many children she had or whether her husband agreed.
Surgical sterilization rates among women have increased since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturned the constitutional right to abortion, according to a study published last September by researchers at Columbia University.

“ What that does is just feed into the notion of disrupting filial and familiar relationships. And that’s intentional,” he told The Connecticut Mirror. 
Collins likened strip-searching, which he first experienced at age 13, to sexual assault, and said it was traumatizing. Collins, who is now 40, said the aftereffects are something he still deals with through therapy, even after having been released from DOC custody seven months ago. 
On Friday, the State Bond Commission approved funding for four body scanners as part of a pilot program with the aim of ending strip searches in the state’s prison facilities. 
State lawmakers have been discussing the purchase of body scanners for correctional facilities since at least 2023, when they asked Department of Correction Commissioner Angel Quiros to study the cost of implementing the scanners at each of the prisons.
Quiros told lawmakers in a March meeting that the cost of installing 26 body scanners for visiting rooms and intake units would cost about $4 million. An additional 15 for the lobby areas, plus 12 more for the Restrictive Housing Units, or solitary confinement, brings the cost up to $8.1 million. 
Earlier this session, lawmakers brought forward a bill that would have put aside $500,000 to purchase at least two body scanners for York Correctional Institution, which houses the state’s women, and Manson Youth Institution. The bill passed out of the Government Oversight Committee and the Finance Committee with bipartisan support, but never made it to a vote on the floor. 
The funding approved by the bond commission Friday will be used for scanners at the two facilities as part of a larger capital funds package instead. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, told CT Mirror that he believed the body scanners provided a more humane alternative to strip searches, which he called “dehumanizing” and “degrading,” particularly for women. He said the idea that the Department of Correction was doing hundreds of thousands of strip searches in a year “seems excessive.” 
“When you have the ability to do something different, which we do, we should avail ourselves of that,” he said. 
Advocates have been decrying the use of strip searches for years. In February, advocates reiterated their call at a press conference memorializing the 2018 death of J’Allen Jones, who died after being pepper sprayed, restrained, struck and forcibly moved by as many as nine correction workers. Jones had refused to submit to a strip search. 
Data showed that the department conducted about 355,000 strip searches on incarcerated people in 2024.
In meetings with the legislature’s budget committee in February and March, Quiros said he believed the body scanners were “100% better” than strip searches at identifying contraband. He said he supported the use of body scanners for department staff as well as the incarcerated population.
But Rudy Demiraj, a corrections officer and representative for the Cheshire Correctional Complex Employees AFSCME Local 387, the local union, said he wasn’t sure that body scanners would be as efficient in picking up contraband coming into the prison as strip searches. 
“ The officers are highly trained on how to conduct these strip searches, what it is they’re actually targeting and looking for,” said Demiraj. “And I don’t know of any technology with scanners that could detect or pick up every type of contraband that could potentially be picked up through a strip search.”
Demiraj said he understood that while some inmates might feel the strip searches were degrading, they were necessary for the security of the facility. 
And Demiraj said that the corrections officers union did not support having staff go through the body scanners. He said the majority of contraband came into the facility during social visits or through the mail, and not from corrections officers. 
Barbara Fair, the executive director of Stop Solitary, told CT Mirror that she doesn’t have a lot of faith that the body scanners will be installed. She also said having the body scanners would not be a big victory unless there was a requirement that staff, and not just incarcerated individuals or visitors, also had to pass through the scanners to enter the facilities. 
“I’m just really discouraged,” she said. 
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, a top Republican on the state’s Judiciary Committee, called the promise for four scanners “a start, but a weak one.” He told CT Mirror in an email that if the state was really committed to the safety of the incarcerated and the corrections officers, it would invest in scanners in prisons other than the women’s prison and the juvenile prison. 
“We do see possession of contraband in our prisons, whether it be weapons or drugs, and they are getting in there somehow. One way to address this is through the use of these machines — an initiative that is supported by both the incarcerated as well as those in charge of them,” he said. 
Winfield said he knew the state wasn’t going to be able to purchase all the body cameras at once. He said that once the scanners were placed in the prisons, and the benefits became obvious, he didn’t see how the state wouldn’t continue installing scanners in other facilities.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/York-CI-sign02.jpg,,,2025-08-01 12:56:38.344718

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)AGENCY VILLAGE — If a Sisseton police officer gets punched on state land in Sisseton, Roberts County State’s Attorney Dylan Kirchmeier can charge the assailant with a felony for assaulting a police officer.
If that assailant also punches a tribal police officer who’s there to assist, Kirchmeier doesn’t have that option.
South Dakota law doesn’t include tribal police in its definition of a law enforcement officer, Kirchmeier told members of the State-Tribal Relations Committee on Thursday. But in Roberts County, tribal police work alongside sheriff’s deputies and city officers on a regular basis, sometimes as backup, sometimes as first responders when they’re closer to the scene when a call comes in. 
“I feel like that is doing a disservice to the tribal officers, because they’re doing the same job that any state law enforcement officer is,” Kirchmeier said. “It’s a bad loophole.”

Roberts County includes parts of the Lake Traverse Reservation, where the Sisseton-Wahpeton Police Department and tribal courts have jurisdiction. But the checkerboard nature of tribal land – one side of the road can be tribal, the other state – means that policing agencies wind up interwoven, for the safety of their officers and residents alike.
It’s not uncommon for suspects to cross tribal and state lines in the course of committing a crime, Kirchmeier said, particularly in vehicle pursuits.
Gary Gaikowski, the tribal police captain for the past 20 years and a longtime member of South Dakota’s Law Enforcement Standards and Training Commission, said the working relationships benefit both sides and public safety. 
“Everything that affects the state, Roberts County, the city of Sisseton, affects us,” Gaikowski told the committee. “And most of the time, it’s the same individuals that we’re arresting.”
That should move the Legislature to change the law to recognize tribal officers as law enforcement. 
“It does kind of, excuse my language, suck, to not be recognized as law enforcement officers,” he said.
Both men urged the committee to explore changes to the law to protect tribal police who aid their stateside counterparts.
Mutual aid agreements: Thorny territory
Gaikowski said he understands the thorny nature of cooperation between tribes and outside law enforcement. Attempts to push for more formal mutual aid agreements have met political resistance at the tribal council level, he told the committee.
Algin Young, South Dakota’s secretary of tribal affairs, told the committee he faced some of the same resistance during his stint as chief of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Police Department in Pine Ridge. 
Tribal governments don’t want state officials arresting their citizens, Young said, but might nonetheless see value in outside help. Working with the tribe and Pennington County eventually led to a setup in 2022 that opened the door to mutual aid between the county and the tribe, Young said, without giving the county the power to enforce state law on tribal land.
That should be the model for a state agency like the Highway Patrol, Young said.

“We have to be sensitive to what the tribes want,” he said. “We’ll go when they want, and we’ll leave when they ask us to.”
Bob Perry, secretary of the Department of Public Safety, told the lawmakers on the State-Tribal Relations Committee that the state is working with tribes to convince them to allow more agreements like that. He recently traveled to the Yankton Sioux Tribe to meet with leadership on the possibility of agreements with the Highway Patrol. 
The state’s closest formal partnership is with the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, which uses state troopers for law enforcement only during its annual powwow, but Perry said there are other signs of progress on public safety cooperation.
There’s currently a Highway Patrol saturation operation taking place on the Standing Rock Reservation. Highway Patrol captains meet quarterly with officials on that reservation, and on the Cheyenne River Reservation.
“All law enforcement understands this is a good, good thing,” Perry said of mutual aid. “But there’s still some mistrust in the tribal communities that we have to overcome.”
Possible model: Missing people and violent crime
Perry pointed out that the Highway Patrol does accident reconstruction in fatal crashes on tribal land, and it doesn’t hesitate to put helicopters in the air if a child goes missing on tribal lands and tribal officials reach out for help.
Mark Van Norman, a special counsel for the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, told the committee that the prevalence of missing and murdered Indigenous people and the widespread hunger to address the issue among tribal governments could serve as a  building block for trust. 
President Donald Trump signed an executive order to address the MMIP issue, Van Norman pointed out, so there’s a willingness at the federal level to improve cooperation. 
“We’ve been thinking that when we have missing people, that we would like to get an immediate response so that we can try and rescue the people within 72 hours,” Van Norman said.

Agreements for mutual aid in missing people cases could naturally extend, Van Norman said, to cooperation on cases involving violent crime. 
Concerns about jurisdictional challenges aren’t especially pronounced for Gaikowski, Kirchmeier and Roberts County Sheriff Tyler Appel, the sheriff said. Appel’s jail holds adult and juvenile inmates for the tribe, he said, and major cases like homicides are all-hands-on-deck situations.
“Perceptions from community members tend to be more of a challenge than us working together,” Appel said. “Captain Gaikowski’s department and I work very well together. Gary and I share phone calls and text messages on a pretty frequent basis.”
Pierre Republican Rep. Will Mortenson, the committee’s chair, said he was encouraged to hear that, and said he hopes the state can make more progress in allowing police to help each other across tribal lines.
“It seems like what we need is for the politicians to have the trust in law enforcement that law enforcement has in each other,” said Mortenson, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. “The more I think about this issue, the more I think we’ve got a politician problem, not a law enforcement problem.”
After the meeting, Mortenson said his comments were a reference to politicians “on any side” who might monkeywrench mutual aid. 
The committee’s next meeting will take place in mid-September, he said, and will be hosted jointly by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana political candidates and campaigns can post signs at public school athletic fields and gymnasiums starting Friday after being prohibited from doing so.

Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers carved out the school athletic facility exception from a more sweeping ban on political signs on government property in state law. 

Act 89, sponsored by Sen. Eddie Lambert, R-Gonzales, will allow the signage so long as it complies with local school board policies. 
If the school is used as a voting site, rules against political advertising during an election will still apply. Any area within 600 feet of a voting booth area becomes a campaign-free zone.

“In that case, a sign would have to be taken down during a political election,” Lambert said. 
Lambert offered the proposal in response to a letter Attorney General Liz Murrill’s office sent to high schools in his district last year telling them to take down political signs on display. It cost the school’s athletic programs a lot of money in refunds when the signs came down, he said. 

The president of the St. Amant High School athletic boosters, James LeBlanc, said his school lost $20,000. Before the letter from the attorney general, the athletic boosters had been selling advertising space to politicians for 25 years, he said during a hearing on the bill earlier this year.

Lambert said he spends between $3,000 and $5,000 on high school signs every year from his campaign account. 
“It came as a shock to me and the school systems in Ascension Parish” when the political signs were taken down, Lambert said. 

The proposal overwhelmingly passed the Legislature with a 38-0 vote in the Senate and 92-1 in the House of Representatives. State Rep. Beryl Amedee, R-Gray, was the only lawmaker to vote against the bill.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 12:56:38.344718

WILMINGTON— The Wilmington Fire Department graduated its largest-ever recruit class on Friday, with 36 new Firefighter/EMTs officially joining the ranks during a ceremony at the Chase Bank Conference Center.
The graduates of the department’s 44th Recruit Academy were celebrated by family, friends, city officials, and fire department leadership for completing 14 weeks of intensive training. Their addition brings the department’s authorized strength to 186, supporting Wilmington’s recently expanded emergency services that now include primary 911 ambulance response.
“I’m proud to welcome this outstanding class of Wilmington Firefighters to public service,” said Mayor John Carney. 
“This is the largest group ever hired by the Wilmington Fire Department, and their commitment reflects the strength and spirit of our city. These men and women have trained with focus and discipline, and they’re ready to serve with courage, compassion, and professionalism. Our residents will be safer because of the work they’ve put in, and because of the work they will do every day moving forward.”
The 14-week academy began May 2, 2025, and included a six-week National Emergency Medical Technician course and eight weeks of National Firefighter I & II curriculum, combining classroom instruction with hands-on training.
“We are honored to welcome this historic class into the Wilmington Fire Department,” said Fire Chief John Looney. 
“Their dedication and commitment have been evident from day one. These men and women have successfully completed an extremely rigorous training program and are now prepared to protect life and property throughout our city. We look forward to the leadership and service they will bring to every emergency they respond to.”

(Eakin Howard/Getty Images)Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.










It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community.


– Angeline Close Scheinbaum, Clemson University sports marketing professor


After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.

In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

The pipeline, called the “Mississippi Crossing Project,” would start in Greenville, cross through Humphreys, Holmes, Attala, Leake, Neshoba, Newton, Lauderdale and Clarke counties and end near Butler, Alabama, stretching a total of nearly 208 miles.
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan, sent an application for the project to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on June 30. The company hopes the pipeline, which would transfer up to 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, will address a rising energy demand by increasing its transportation capacity.

Kinder Morgan says on its website that, should it receive approval, construction would begin at the end of 2027 and the pipeline would begin service in November, 2028. The company says the project would cost $1.7 billion and create 750 temporary jobs as well as 15 permanent positions.
As shown in the map above, the project would also include new compressor stations in Humphreys, Attala and Lauderdale counties, although exact locations haven’t been set.
Singleton Schreiber, a national law firm that focuses on environmental justice, is looking to spread awareness of the public’s ability to participate in the approval process, whether or not they support the proposal.  
“We’re just trying to raise awareness to make sure that people know this is happening,” said Laura Singleton, an attorney with the firm. “They’re going to have to dig and construct new pipelines, so it’s going to pass through sensitive ecosystems like wetlands, private property, farmland, things like that. So you can have issues that come up like soil degradation, water contamination, and then after the pipeline is built you could potentially have leaks, spills.”
Singleton added while such issues with pipelines are rare, when “things go bad, they go pretty bad.” 
To comment, protest, or file a motion to intervene, the public can go to FERC’s website (new users have to create an account, and then use the docket number “CP25-514-000”). The exact deadline is 4 p.m. on Aug. 5. More instructions can also be found here.
In addition to FERC, the proposal will also face review from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and the state environmental agencies in Mississippi and Alabama. 
Mississippians have seen multiple incidents related to gas leaks in recent years. In March, three workers were injured after accidentally rupturing an Atmos Energy pipeline doing routine maintenance in Lee County, leaving thousands without service. Then last year, the National Transportation Safety Board found that Atmos discovered gas leaks over a month prior to two explosions in Jackson, one of which claimed the life of an 82-year-old woman.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/01090732/MSX-12-19-24.jpg,,,2025-08-01 11:56:51.725879

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Missouri utility regulators on Thursday approved Evergy’s request to build three natural gas plants and two solar farms, freeing the company to move forward with infrastructure projects that will cost more than $2.75 billion.
The four-member Missouri Public Service Commission board approved the facilities after hearing presentations about the facilities two weeks ago and despite worries about investing in solar energy.
“Personally, the solar case is concerning,” said MPSC chairwoman Kayla Hahn. “I recognize that we need more generation, and in particular, Evergy West needs more generation. However, intermittent resources such as solar as standalone projects seem to make little sense and may not be the best choice in terms of resource planning and the best use of ratepayer dollars.”
Hahn said her concerns were pertinent in light of federal changes to green energy tax credits, among other issues. The state faces conflicting issues with the need to build replacement and additional generation and the need to keep rates affordable, she said. 
“It’s increasingly important that a critical view is taken of any request for new generation,” Hahn said. “Because we are in a situation where the need for additional generation for Evergy West, who has been and continues to be short on its own generation, is so great, I’m not going to stand in the way of allowing more generation resources to be added.” 
Evergy announced last year its intent to build the gas plants — two in Kansas and one in Missouri — and the solar plants, one in each state. The company sought pre-approval for the projects through Kansas and Missouri regulators. 
They received approval from the Kansas Corporation Commission in early July. 
Evergy Missouri West, the Evergy subsidiary serving Missouri customers, and Evergy Kansas Central, which serves Kansas customers, will own 50% each of the two Kansas gas plants. The two 710-megawatt facilities, located in Sumner and Reno counties, are expected to cost $788.75 million and $800.52 million, respectively. 
Evergy Missouri West will own 100% of a 440-megawatt natural gas facility in Nodaway County, Missouri, with a price tag of $835 million. It will also own Foxtrot Solar Energy, a 107 megawatt solar farm in Jasper County, Missouri, estimated to cost $213.8 million.
Evergy Kansas Central will own 100% of a 75-megawatt solar farm, Sunflower Sky Solar Project, in Wilson County, Kansas, estimated to cost $128.8 million.  
Darrin Ives, Evergy vice president of regulatory affairs, told MPSC commissioners Thursday there had been “a lot of movement” about tax credits and tariffs at the federal level.
“At this stage, we still need some information from the Treasury,” he said. “But by and large, with the budget reconciliation bill, they’ve set up a path and a plan that, while it’s scaled back significantly the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) subsidies around carbon-free generation, it has left a pathway for these projects.
Ives said there’s also a pathway to complete the project by the end of 2027 and still qualify for tax credits. Ives said the issues were part of settlement discussions, and Evergy will be required to give updates on any changes with tax credit availability, among other reporting requirements.
In a press release after the MPSC decision Thursday, the Sierra Club said it opposed Evergy’s proposal. The nonprofit intervened in the MPSC case. 
“No party, except Evergy, argued that the gas plant proposals are economically feasible, a critical factor in the MIssouri approval process,” the release said.  
““If Evergy’s application is approved as submitted, Missouri ratepayers will be on the hook for gas plants that are likely to be unprofitable, operate less than expected and incur high maintenance costs or even premature failure due to excessive generator starts and cycling,” testified Michael Goggin, a Sierra Club expert witness, before MPSC. 
Billy Davies, Sierra Club’s Missouri chapter organizer based in Kansas City, said in the press release that Evergy shareholders, rather than ratepayers, should shoulder the costs of generation expansion. 
“Sadly, the PSC is enabling utilities and multi-billion dollar tech companies to use average Missouri families as piggy banks to power new data centers,” Davies said. “The last hope for the commission to protect Missouri families from utility bill shock is to have a strong large user fee that ensures multi-billion dollar tech companies pay their fair share of these new power plants being built in the name of their data centers.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said the company was pleased the MPSC approved the plants. 
“Current construction schedules should allow the solar plants to benefit from federal tax credits, and those benefits will be passed to customers served by the plants,” she said. 
Tariff levels are changing frequently, so it is difficult to quantify their effect on the projects, she said. 
“If they stay in place over a long term, the cost of capital projects like new generation would increase,” Penzig said. “As we negotiate contracts with suppliers, we are always focused on keeping our costs low because that impacts our customers’ rates. Some aspects of the new generation projects are already under contract.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1090642-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-01 11:56:51.725879

ChristianaCare is set to open its first neighborhood hospital in its 188-year history this month, bringing around-the-clock emergency and acute care directly to southern Chester County. 
ChristianaCare Hospital, West Grove, located at 1015 West Baltimore Pike, will officially open following final inspection by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, expected in the first week of August.
The 20,000-square-foot facility marks a milestone for ChristianaCare, which partnered with Emerus Holdings, Inc. to develop the new hospital. The site will operate 24/7 and be staffed by board-certified emergency physicians, nurses, and clinical specialists providing patient-first care.

“It’s an honor and privilege to expand access to high-quality care for our neighbors in southern Chester County,” said Janice Nevin, M.D., MPH, president and CEO of ChristianaCare.
“We will be opening our doors for the families in this community with a steadfast commitment to being their trusted health care partner. We’re grateful for the opportunity to bring love and excellence to those we will serve.”
The hospital features a full-service emergency department with 10 treatment rooms, a 10-bed inpatient unit, and advanced imaging and lab services such as ultrasound, CT scan, and X-ray.

Virtual access to specialty care in cardiology, critical care, and infectious disease will also be available. While equipped to handle emergencies like falls, strokes, and heart attacks, patients requiring more complex care will be stabilized and transferred elsewhere as needed.
“This neighborhood hospital brings the right mix of services to support the health and well-being of our neighbors,” said Pauline Corso, president of ambulatory network continuity and growth at ChristianaCare. 
“We’re excited to bring care close to home to meet the needs of the community. We’re here to stay and grow alongside this community.”

Local support, including grants from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Chester County Board of Commissioners, led by Josh Maxwell, Marian Moskowitz, and Eric Roe, helped lead the project. 
ChristianaCare has also purchased the building at 900 W. Baltimore Pike, directly across the street, which currently houses a primary care practice and imaging services. The facility offers walk-in X-rays and scheduled mammography and ultrasound appointments and is expected to expand its services over time.
The West Grove hospital is part of a broader regional strategy by ChristianaCare to address healthcare gaps in southeastern Pennsylvania. Neighborhood hospitals are also planned for Aston and Springfield Townships in Delaware County, with Aston projected to open in late 2026.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/West-Grove-_-Ribbon-Cutting-2048x1152-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-01 11:56:51.725879

The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program has officially ended and is canceling all grants from 2020 to 2023 that have not already been distributed. For Connecticut, only 22% of all BRIC projects have been funded. The rest will remain unfunded.
While some projects did not receive funding for other reasons before the grant program was cancelled, many of the more recent projects from 2023 are affected by the cancellation.
One of the projects confirmed to have been affected by the grant cancellation is the a coastal flood defense project in Bridgeport. This project was a part of the Resilient Bridgeport infrastructure initiative.
The Flood Mitigation Assistance program also has been removed from the 2025 grant cycle, halting new grant applications. As of now, the federal government has not made any announcement regarding funding of current projects.
Connecticut had 35 ongoing projects from 2020 to 2023 that were in various stages of receiving BRIC and FMA funding. Of these, 23 were projects funded under BRIC to address hazards ranging from flooding and severe storm impact to infrastructure failures. As of July 29, only $25.9 million of $120 million that was selected for federal grants had been obligated to the 35 BRIC and FMA projects.
Many federal funds are allocated under FEMA’s hazard mitigation assistance projects where spending and projects tend to peak following a natural disaster. Some BRIC and FMA grants fall under this category. 
While the BRIC grant was cancelled because it was “a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,” according to a since-deleted press release from FEMA, many are concerned about what could happen without the federal funds.
“The FEMA funds, through BRIC and also through the hazard mitigation grant program, have been pretty critical at helping the towns do the legwork and the planning and design work and move these things forward,” said John Truscinski, the director for resilience planning at the Connecticut Institute for Resilience and Climate Adaptation. “And they do take a long time for a variety of reasons, and so cutting back on the commitment of funds after several years of work has gone into those projects, it has a big impact in setting things back for the state.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/of9eE-where-were-the-bric-grants-being-spent--1024x856.png,,,2025-08-01 11:56:51.725879

I write as a two-time graduate of Southeastern Louisiana University (Class of 2001 and 2005) to express my outrage and deep disappointment over the university’s treatment of Dr. Fereshteh Emami, as detailed in the Louisiana Illuminator.
Dr. Emami, who led a major research project on Lake Maurepas, was abruptly removed after exposing dangerous levels of toxic metals, including arsenic and lead. Her research identified serious environmental threats, yet instead of being supported by her institution, she was removed from the project, excluded from a documentary, and reassigned to teaching-only duties without explanation.
This is nothing short of shameful. Southeastern appears more concerned with protecting political and corporate interests than upholding scientific integrity or safeguarding public health. The university’s silence, complicity, or worse, its cooperation with those trying to bury this research, is a betrayal of its mission and of the public trust.
As an alumnus, I am ashamed of my university. The administration’s actions send a chilling message to all researchers: tell the truth, and you’ll be punished. That is not education. That is cowardice.
Southeastern must be held accountable — for Dr. Emami, for the truth, and for the people who deserve to know what’s in their water.

This such blatant corruption – and the fact that these Air Product corporate bullies and Southeastern evidently think we’re to stupid to see the connection of how their money connections to the university clearly strong-armed this decision – is an insult to educated people!
This blatant biased decision also clearly shows the intentions of this Air Products project is obviously not in the best interest of the environment, wildlife or people of Lake Maurepas or the surrounding waters! She needs to be reinstated as a researcher immediately.

The private membership association, called Return to the Land, owns 160 acres in northeast Arkansas, according to its website. Jews and non-whites are explicitly banned from membership.
The group’s leader recently said it is exploring the idea of expanding north and building a new enclave in the Springfield area.
“We have the God-given right to form communities according to whatever values we hold dear,” Eric Orwoll, co-founder of Return to the Land, said in a recent social media post, “and the government does not have the right to tell free American citizens what values they have to live according to in their own private lives.”
The idea of a segregated community coming to southwest Missouri was greeted with scorn by both Democratic and Republican legislative leaders from the area.
“Racism in any form is evil and reprehensible,” said House Majority Leader Alex Riley, a Springfield Republican. “Groups engaging in racist conduct are not welcome in Springfield.”
State Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, said history has been “very clear on what happens when you stay silent as groups discriminate based on race and discriminate based on whether or not someone is of the Jewish faith. I cannot believe that in 2025 we are retreading this ground.”
In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said racial discrimination “has no place in Missouri.”
“Attorney General Bailey is committed to protecting the constitutional rights of all citizens,” the statement said. “The landmark Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kraemer, which originated in St. Louis, made clear that government cannot enforce racially discriminatory housing practices, and Missouri will not tolerate efforts to revive them.”
The Springfield City Council and City Manager David Cameron issued a joint statement this week declaring that “there is no place in Springfield, or anywhere, for such a divisive and discriminatory vision.”
“While it is improbable that such a project could legally or practically occur within city limits, silence is not an option,” the statement said. “As a regional leader, we will not stand idly by in the face of attempts to revive outdated, harmful ideologies.”
On its website, Return to the Land its mission is to “separate ourselves from a failing modern society, and we will make positive cultural changes in ourselves and in our ancestral communities.”
It also includes a disclaimer that the group does not engage in the sale or rental of real estate.
Orwoll responded to criticism from Springfield elected officials in his social media post, denying that excluding people of color and Jews should be considered racist.
“We are not a hate group,” he said. “We have never expressed hate towards any ethnic group, racial group or religious group.”
He took umbrage with Fogle calling the group racist, saying: “She wants to call us racists because we prefer being among our own people.”
“It’s not a supremacist group. It’s not a hate group. It’s not even a white nationalist group,” he said. “We are white identitarians. We value our identity and want to preserve it. That’s not hate. That is love for your own people.”
Fogle, who was among the first public officials to condemn Return to the Land’s possible expansion to Missouri, said she has been inundated with “pretty horrific messages and pretty horrific responses” on social media.
But she said she has no intention of being silent.
“It’s my job to make sure I’m using my platform to communicate that there’s no place in Springfield, no place in Missouri, no place in this country for a group who is intentionally leaving behind people who have a different skin color or intentionally leaving behind people of the Jewish faith,” she said. “And I would expect every elected official at every level to use their platform to see the same things.”
Across the state line, the group also drew the ire of Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin.
The Republican announced his office would open an investigation of the group to ensure its activities didn’t violate state or federal law. That probe, Griffin said in an email to The Independent, has not turned up any illegal activity.
“Racism has no place in a free society,” he said, “but from a legal perspective, we have not seen anything that would indicate any state or federal laws have been broken.”

(Photo: Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.

“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, including Maine, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
Maine decreased its unfunded pension liability during that period by more than 20 percentage points, the Pew analysis found.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in the last legislative session supported a bill that would tie the state employee pension system to the Consumer Price Index to help retirement accounts keep pace with inflation. However, that bill didn’t end up passing before the Legislature adjourned in June because of a sizable fiscal note topping more than $1.6 billion. Lawmakers will have a chance to revisit it in the next session that starts in January.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019. In Maine, unfunded retiree health care liabilities decreased by nearly 7.5 percentage points.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 14:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"For some, Bridgeport scholarship helps open doors to higher ed",Reginald David,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/university-bridgeport-brightest-scholarship-ct/,The Bridgeport’s Brightest scholarship reduces the cost of attending the University of Bridgeport for local students.,"For Chamique Brown, the road to college seemed like it’d be a tough one.
After emigrating from Jamaica during high school and spending her senior year at Warren Harding High School in Bridgeport, Brown found herself facing the same question many high school seniors do: What’s next?
But unlike many of her classmates, she didn’t qualify for federal financial aid at the time because of her visa status.
“I was trying really hard to go to college and was met with the disappointing news that I couldn’t go because I didn’t qualify for financial aid,” Brown said. “I was really bummed out at the time.”
With her dreams seemingly on hold, Brown started preparing to attend a local community college instead. But then came an unexpected call from the University of Bridgeport about Bridgeport’s Brightest — a new initiative launched in 2024 to provide local high school graduates with a fully funded path to higher education.
“I got a call from UB, and they said I would be eligible for the scholarship. At first, I didn’t believe it. I thought it was too good to be true,” Brown said with a laugh.
Brown had applied to UB earlier but wasn’t very optimistic because of the cost and how little she knew about the school. That call changed everything.
The program was created in partnership with Bridgeport Public Schools and in response to a growing crisis in college access. During the early years of the COVID pandemic, FAFSA completions in Connecticut dropped nearly 15% year-over-year, with low-income and first-generation students among the most affected.
The result? Dozens of students like Brown were left reconsidering whether college was even possible.
“This gave me another chance at life,” Brown said. “I was very demotivated at the time. I didn’t know what I wanted to become or what I wanted to do. This college was a big push to achieve something.”
Brown is now entering her sophomore year at UB as a mechanical engineering major. She is the first in her family to attend college.

The Bridgeport’s Brightest scholarship reduces the cost of attending the University of Bridgeport for local students. It offers a flat rate of $7,000 for commuters and $12,500 for residential students — a discount from the university’s standard tuition of $35,760 per year plus fees for full-time undergraduates before any financial aid or scholarships.
For students who also qualify for Pell Grants or Connecticut state aid, the scholarship often helps covers most, if not all, out-of-pocket costs. The program is renewable for up to four years and is capped at 50 students annually to ensure its long-term sustainability.
University of Bridgeport President Danielle Wilken said the program is part of the university’s broader mission to serve its home city.
“We are deeply committed to investing in our local community and fostering the next generation of lifelong learners,” Wilken said. “By partnering with Bridgeport Public Schools, we aim to provide more students with the resources and support they need to pursue higher education.”
She added, “This scholarship is not just an investment in individual futures, but in the future of our community as a whole.”
Since the program’s launch, Wilken said it has been met with overwhelming support from students, parents, and school counselors alike. “Even this year, our high school recruiters said the first question they got from students and families was, ‘Are you going to continue the program?'”
Although it’s too early to analyze long-term data, early trends are promising. Of the students in the first cohort, the majority are pursuing high-impact fields like engineering, nursing, and criminal justice.
For many students, the scholarship provides more than just financial support. It also offers a sense of belonging.
“This program allows students to experience a global university in their backyard,” said Allison Garris, dean of admissions. “They have access to varsity sports, on-campus living, research opportunities, and an international community, while still being supported by their local community and family.”
That proximity, Garris said, is especially important for students juggling work, caregiving, and other family responsibilities.
“When students are thinking about college, they’re wondering, ‘How could I go to class and still make dinner? How can I be here and still be the babysitter?'” she said. “Our job is to show them that it is possible.”
To that end, the university offers a wide array of wraparound services. Communications with families are translated into more than 50 languages. Students receive ongoing support through UB’s Student Support Services, scholarship coaching through a platform called Scholarship Universe, and consistent outreach through local guidance counselors.
“We’re not just handing off students,” Garris said. “We’re building a holistic support system that follows them through their entire educational journey.”
That support was vital for Brown.

“The Student Support Services has provided help since my first day and hasn’t stopped,” she said.
Brown said she also appreciates that UB is exploring ways to improve student access to transportation, especially for those commuting to campus.
“Transportation is important,” she said. “Sometimes public transit isn’t reliable, and that affects students’ ability to participate in clubs or events. I think if UB adds more support for that, it would help students get more involved.”
The scholarship was born in response to a nationwide FAFSA crisis, but university leaders say it reflects a deeper, ongoing need.
“Access to quality higher education ensures more underrepresented groups can succeed academically and professionally,” said Wilken. “It’s the key to realizing equity and breaking the cycles of generational poverty.”
Still, the program’s future depends heavily on donor support. While the university has already secured funding from a small group of local philanthropists, Wilken said sustaining and expanding the program will require long-term investment.
“If you want to invest in the city, and you’re not sure how, this is a great opportunity,” she said. “You’re investing in a student’s education, but the impact that has on the global community is much larger than that.”
Brown says she still has moments where she feels the pressure of being the first in her family to go to college, but she’s learning to take it one step at a time.
“I feel motivated, but I remind myself to be gentle,” she said. “This is part of my journey.”
In five years, she hopes to have a job in engineering, ideally in the structural or civil fields. Her ultimate goal is to help her mother with bills, earn her master’s degree, and give back to the family that encouraged her every step of the way.
“My mom always said, ‘Go to school, go to school.’ That’s it.”
“I really appreciate what everyone has done for me,” Brown adds. “It’s a really good thing to feel supported and to be given an opportunity that wasn’t available to me before.”

(Photo by Eakin Howard/Getty Images)Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
They include York’s WellSpan Park, Lancaster’s Penn Medicine Park, and Erie’s UPMC Park.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
‘Pure emotion’ frequently drives debates on sports stadium deals

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.

After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
Kansas v. Missouri stadium battle shows how states are reigniting border wars

In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”

For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

“Indigenous designers and architects are so important to creating the future of our communities that we decided to find a way to introduce the profession to youth,” said Olbekson, the founder of Full Circle Indigenous Planning + Design.  
Olbekson created the camp with fellow architect Mike Laverdure to show Native youth that architecture can be an accessible career path. Seven junior high and high school students participated in its second year.

In a classroom on the third floor of the Dunwoody College of Technology, students showed off their final projects to their parents, wearing the name of the camp on laser-cut wooden medallions strung with brightly colored ribbons. It was the culmination of a week spent touring Indigenous architecture projects, learning about design concepts and building their own creations. 
Jessica Garcia Fritz, an assistant professor of architecture at the University of Minnesota, helped plan the curriculum — titled “At Home in the Homelands.” Students drew and modelled their own scale sleeping spaces with cardboard, combining them to form a communal space.

In a project called “Smudge Ring,” Garcia Fritz said, “individual spaces are talking to each other. And it allows for a certain sequence, movements. But it also has Indigenous iconography as well.” 
Olbekson said architecture is a vital way of communicating cultural identity. 
“It’s just underscoring the importance of Indigenous people designing for Indigenous communities. For too long, architecture and planning has been something that has been imposed on us, rather than coming from within. And so we have wonderful cultures, beautiful design, arts, histories that can all impact how we design for our communities,” Olbekson said. 
Olbekson has worked on projects like the Minneapolis American Indian Center and Wakan Tipi Center in St. Paul.

For now, the one-week camp is mostly limited to students in the Twin Cities area, but the organizers are seeking to include younger students, Indigenous nations and schools. For Garcia Fritz, a citizen of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the camp is about giving Indigenous kids the opportunities she didn’t have. 
“For many of us, we were the only Indigenous people in our architecture classes. And so this was a way to show that, yeah, there is a collective of Indigenous designers, and to make that something that’s much larger,” Garcia Fritz said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NN250726_0062-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 10:58:13.889811

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Problems linger in a Kansas federal prison holding immigrant detainees, even after altering some practices that a coalition of lawyers, civil rights groups and advocates revealed were harmful to those inside.
The Federal Correction Institution at Leavenworth is one of two places in Kansas where Immigration and Customs Enforcement can detain people long term, and the coalition wrote to the prison warden in June about unsanitary, inequitable and unhealthy conditions. 
Warden Crystal Carter wrote in a June 20 response letter that the prison had eliminated medical fees, added law library resources that ICE failed to provide, implemented new recreation hours and expanded Spanish-language communications.
But concerns about lockdowns and adequate phone call time remain, said Kyle Virgien, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project.
“We see a lot of problems across ICE’s detention network,” Virgien said. “Detention is difficult. It rips people from their communities. It isolates them from their families. This is a constant.”
Virgien began speaking with people inside Leavenworth in April and continues to monitor conditions.
What he heard was troubling, he said.
The coalition wrote in a pair of letters in May that detained immigrants faced unsanitary and crowded living quarters, extended lockdowns, delayed and costly medical treatment, restricted contact with their families, and no access to religious services.
Some had attempted suicide, the letter said.
Carter, the warden, said things have changed.
After reviewing its procedures, the prison eliminated a $2 fee that people in ICE custody were charged for certain health visits. Staff were told to stop those charges and reverse all previous ones. To boost access for medical services, the prison created request slips written in Spanish for ICE detainees, Carter said. However, it is unclear how quickly officials respond to Spanish medical requests. 
Carter said capacity concerns did not exist at the time of writing, and, according to the coalition, people inside have said what once were crowded cells have become less so. 
According to July data from ICE, estimating average daily populations from the past year, about 35 people are held daily in Leavenworth for immigration reasons. Most pose little to no threat, according to ICE threat level classifications. On average, around 21 people were associated with criminal cases, and 12 were not. All are male and stay an average of 25 days.
During those 25 days, people in ICE custody now are afforded at least one hour of outdoor recreation time daily and a maximum of 300 minutes of phone calls per month, with no call lasting longer than 15 minutes.
People in ICE custody at Leavenworth are subject to the rules and policies of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which oversees operations. Some of the rules and policies are a departure from typical conditions in ICE detention facilities, Virgien said.
He has heard stories of mistreatment from guards and retaliatory lockdowns that punish many for the actions of few, he said. Lockdowns mean people are in cells for 23 hours a day and must “pack all of their life tasks into that one hour outside the cell,” Virgien said, which can include recreation, showers, legal research, religious practices and phone calls.
Carter said one instance of a lockdown has occurred in Leavenworth’s ICE detention unit for 72 hours, and another more than eight hours.
“Except for the limited and infrequent instances, all ICE detainees have time outside of their cell each day and have access to exercise, the electronic law library and phone systems,” Carter said.
The people ICE detains in Leavenworth are imprisoned alongside people awaiting criminal trials or serving criminal sentences.
Benjamin O’Cone, a spokesman for the bureau, said in an emailed statement that it’s the mission of the bureau and Leavenworth to “operate facilities that are safe, secure and humane.”
“We take seriously our duty to protect the individuals entrusted in our custody, as well as maintaining the safety of our employees and the community,” O’Cone said. “Humane treatment of the men and women in our custody is a top priority.”
ICE did not respond to a request for comment. ICE also has not responded to the coalition’s letter, according to ACLU of Kansas spokeswoman Esmie Tseng.
Virgien said the coalition is glad the prison addressed some of the issues they raised, but concerns remain.
“Many of the people at the facility have already won their immigration cases, and ICE is still detaining them,” Virgien said.
The coalition believes ICE should release people as soon as their immigration cases are won.
In at least one case, an immigration judge determined a man could not return to his country of origin without risking torture. Others include people who have spoken out against authoritarian governments in their countries of origin or fled persecution. Some have young children. Many have come from Chicago, and a small number from Kentucky, Virgien said.
When asked about the possibility of pursuing legal action, Virgien said, “all options are on the table.”
Now, with major Congressional budget increases for ICE, Virgien fears problems will only multiply.
Congress approved more than $175 billion for ICE in its most recent budget bill, making it what the Brennan Center for Justice classified as the largest federal law enforcement agency. The funds expand ICE’s ability to bring people into custody while capping the number of immigration judges in the country.
Also in Leavenworth, private prison company CoreCivic is battling the city government to reopen a shuttered prison to use as its Midwest Regional Reception Center, which would detain as many as 1,000 people. A judge temporarily blocked the company in July from housing people at its facility until the matter is worked out in court.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/U.S.-Penitentiary-Leavenworth-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 10:58:13.889811

Attorney General Raúl Torrez joined other Democratic attorneys general in March town hall in Phoenix, speaking to the litigation strategy a Democratic AG coalition has deployed against the Trump administration.

“Since January of 2025, much of the Impact Litigation Division’s work has focused on protecting the interests of the State of New Mexico and our residents against federal funding cuts and agency reorganizations that have or would have impaired our state government’s ability to serve our population,” Anjana Samant, deputy counsel for impact litigation at NMDOJ, told the New Mexico Legislature’s interim Federal Funding Stabilization Subcommittee.
Judges have granted temporary wins to the state, often restoring cut funds in several of the suits. This included $12 billion dollars in federal grants and loans already promised to New Mexico frozen by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget; just over $50 million for the state’s education department across several different lawsuits; $59 million for pandemic-era public health funding stripped out of New Mexico Department of Health and Health Care Authority budgets; and $18 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation for electric vehicle infrastructure.

Samant noted that the division, beyond its lawsuits against the federal government, also pursued litigation against social media owners Meta and Snap Inc, which owns Snapchat alleging the company’s policies fail to protect children.
Samant requested lawmakers provide $3.2 million in additional funding in the 2026 session to hire more staff.“To say that we are at capacity is an understatement,” Samant said of the division’s five attorneys. “We want to continue to do the amazing work that we are doing, but we also want to expand our impact.”
Sen. William Soules (D-Las Cruces), the committee’s co-chair, said he supported that request.“For a few million dollars, you all with an office of four or five, have saved a several billion dollars — that seems like a pretty good deal,” Soules said. “And I hope that in the next budget that we’re able to make sure that there is that funding.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9541-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-01 09:59:32.350582

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska lawmakers are scheduled to meet at 10 a.m. in Juneau for a special session of the Alaska Legislature. You can watch live online on Gavel Alaska. 
Why is the Legislature meeting in a special session?
Gov. Mike Dunleavy called the special session. The official agenda says that it will involve legislation about education policy and a proposed Alaska Department of Agriculture.
Will legislators actually do that?
No.
What are they doing instead?
They’re going to vote on overriding at least some of the vetoes the governor has made since the regular legislative session ended in May. 
No. 1 on the list is the governor’s decision to veto about $51 million in funding for public schools. The No. 2 item is the bill that would require the Alaska Department of Revenue to provide lawmakers with additional information about tax settlements between oil companies and the state. Lawmakers believe the state may be settling tax disputes for far less than they’re worth, costing the state millions.
Some legislators are interested in taking up other vetoes as well, including the governor’s decision to cancel a ban on payday loan lending, his decision to veto money for transportation projects, and his vetoes of bills affecting police dogs and teacher housing, among others.
Will those overrides succeed?
It’s too close to call. The Alaska Constitution says votes from 45 of 60 legislators are needed to override a budget veto. In May, 46 legislators voted in favor of overriding the governor’s decision to veto a bill that increases the state’s public school funding formula. 
That was the first time since 2002 that legislators voted to override the veto of a sitting governor.
It isn’t clear whether everyone who voted in favor of that first override will vote in favor of the second. 
Overriding a policy bill veto, like the one dealing with the tax settlements, takes 40 votes.
Will everyone be there?
Probably not. Some conservative Republicans had said they would stay away from the session in a show of support for the governor’s vetoes. Immediately after calling the special session, Dunleavy asked them to be absent for the first five days because an absence is as good as a “no” vote when it comes to a veto override.
He later changed his position, asking lawmakers to begin meetings about his stated agenda on Sunday, and some Republicans changed course and said they will attend the session, after all. It wasn’t clear whether all have done so, but it isn’t likely to affect the vote total on the potential override.
Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, is in favor of an override and had been expected to be unavailable because of military service overseas. He ended up getting a special leave of absence and is flying back from Europe. Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, is flying back from Vietnam to attend. Other legislators have canceled family plans and postponed business trips.
How long will this take?
On the low end, a few hours. On the high end, a few days. Officially, the special session can last for up to 30 days, but legislators have said they won’t use all that time. 
In some previous special sessions, legislators have left Juneau without formally closing the special session, just in case they need to come back. Those special sessions ended after the 30th day.
How much will this special session cost?
Based on historical costs, the estimated cost for a special session is $30,000 per day, according to the Legislative Affairs Agency, the Legislature’s nonpartisan support agency. But that cost depends on the duration and scope of the special session, said Jessica Geary, the agency’s executive director, by email on Tuesday. 
“Many legislators had to change summer travel plans to attend the special session, and many of them purchase their own travel and submit for reimbursement. At this point we don’t have any concrete cost estimates and won’t know until the special session concludes,” she said.
Geary said legislators have up to 60 days to submit reimbursements for expenses like hotel lodging, transportation and airfare, staffing, expenses, and so the agency will have a total cost by October. 
Legislators receive an annual salary of $84,000 per year. The 57 members that live outside of Juneau are entitled to receive a “per diem” amount of $332 per day to cover expenses. 
If lawmakers don’t take up the governor’s ideas, are they dead?
No. Legislators have created a task force to consider education policy changes, including those from the governor. One idea supported by the governor is open enrollment — allowing a student to move between different schools and school districts, regardless of where they live. That will be considered by the task force, which meets Aug. 25.
Legislators are also considering a bill that would create the Alaska Department of Agriculture. That bill is broader than the governor’s initial plans; for example, it would include sea farms (formally known as aquaculture), which are the fastest-growing agricultural sector in Alaska.

The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
North Dakota bill takes aim at crypto fraud with new consumer protections

Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

Elissa Slotkin says she supported a pair of Senate resolutions aimed at cutting off arms sales to Israel despite missing both to appear on a late-night talk show.
Michigan’s junior Democratic senator issued a statement late Thursday following her absence from recent Senate votes regarding two Joint Resolutions of Disapproval aimed at blocking arms sales to Israel in reaction to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Slotkin’s trip to New York City Wednesday to appear on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” resulted in her missing eight Senate votes including the two sponsored by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont).SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I owe it to my state to make clear where I stand: Had I made it back for the vote yesterday, I would have voted yes to block offensive weapons to Israel based on my concerns over lack of food and medicine getting to civilians in Gaza,” Slotkin said in the statement.
While reiterating her strong support for Israel, she said “images of emaciated children are hard to turn away from,” and emphasized that the U.S. needed to hold the Israeli government accountable for its actions.
The United Nation’s Human Rights Council said those actions include a blockade of food, fuel and lifesaving aid, as well as the “systematic destruction of local food production,” that has left the Gaza Strip on the verge of famine.
“But it appears today that the Netanyahu government thinks that there are no limits to what they can do while still receiving U.S. support. And so, I believe a message has to be sent. Should similar votes on offensive weapons come up in the future, I will take them on a case-by-case basis, with the hope of important humanitarian course corrections,” Slotkin said.
Her statement follows a letter sent Tuesday to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, calling for the immediate opening of all checkpoints into Gaza.
Slotkin joins Muslim and Jewish leaders urging immediate humanitarian aid to save children in Gaza

Israel’s offensive in Gaza — launched in retaliation to the militant group Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 attack in southern Israel — has killed more than 60,000 people according to Gaza’s health ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government.
While both of the resolutions were voted down Wednesday in the Republican-led Senate, for the first time ever, a majority of Democrats in the upper chamber voted in favor of cutting off arms sales to Israel.
Slotkin finds herself caught in a political conundrum between progressive activists who have sharply criticized her ongoing support for Israel, accusing her of turning a blind eye to what they describe as a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, and centrist and pro-Israel elements pressuring her to more forcefully condemn rising antisemitism. 
While Slotkin’s efforts at navigating that divide have threatened her standing as a Democratic Party leader amidst a deeply polarized electorate, she said that her votes have not been driven by ideology, but instead based on the facts as they existed at the time.
“[O]ver these last two years, few issues have been as raw as this one. I have therefore worked very hard to call balls and strikes based on my experience and the facts on the ground, even as most people fall firmly into one side or another, and are often reluctant to consider new information,” Slotkin said in her statement.
She said that she felt compelled to issue the statement out of her “deep concern and conviction” for Israel’s long-term security,” and its right to demand the immediate release of all hostages, but that the Netanyahu government actions threaten to unravel the bipartisan consensus that has helped keep Israel safe.  
“No one leader should so significantly threaten the long-term security of the state of Israel. I urge the Trump Administration and the Israeli Prime Minister to get aid in as soon as possible and save lives,” Slotkin said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2222293549-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 09:59:32.350582

California gun owners are eager to get their hands on ammunition after a federal appeals court struck down a state law requiring background checks for ammunition purchases, reports CalMatters’ Joe Garcia.
Last week the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals dealt a blow to gun control advocates and California’s own policy framework when it ruled that the state’s first-in-the-nation law “meaningfully constrains California residents’ right to keep and bear arms.”
Voters approved the law in 2016, which required buyers to undergo background checks, and effectively banned online sales of ammunition by requiring in-person transactions with a licensed dealer. Out-of-state ammunition purchases must also be delivered from that state to a licensed seller in California.

J.R. Young, a San Jose gun owner: “Is this freedom week? … The way we live in society now — when we want to buy something, we don’t want to go and take a trip to the store.”

But changes aren’t happening just yet. Citing “a number of procedural steps that must take place,” the California Department of Justice notified gun and ammunition dealers days after the court ruling that background check requirements remain in effect until further notice.
This isn’t the first time the 2016 law has been held in a state of limbo: In 2020 a federal judge also struck down the legislation, only for the state to successfully appeal the decision afterward. Last week’s court decision follows a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that expanded some gun rights and limited state and local governments’ abilities to regulate guns. 
California Attorney General Rob Bonta has not said whether the state would appeal the most recent ruling.
Meanwhile, the state Senate is currently considering a bill that would ban the sale of new Glock-brand handguns in California, after the measure advanced through the Assembly in June.

CA Uber and Lyft drivers push to unionize


Supporters gather at a rally at the state Capitol in Sacramento, announcing new legislation allowing ride-hail drivers to unionize, on April 8, 2025. Photo by Louis Bryant III for CalMatters




Five years after voters passed Proposition 22 — which granted California ride-hailing drivers some employee benefits while classifying them as independent contractors — drivers for Uber, Lyft and other companies are pushing legislation that would grant them the right to form and join a union.
As CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay explains, the bill would enable drivers the right to collectively bargain, and gig companies would be required to bargain in good faith. These companies would also be required to regularly submit lists of drivers and other driver information to the state’s Public Employment Relations Board.
Bill proponents say that the ability to unionize is essential for drivers to address issues related to wages, working conditions and the lack of company communication. 
But ride-hailing companies argue that unionizing would disrupt their business model, increase the cost of rides and affect the availability of rides. The bill’s reporting requirements, they say, also violate driver privacy.

A plan to curtail medical debt

With about 4 in 10 Californians saddled with medical debt, the Legislature is considering a measure that would require hospitals to check whether patients can qualify for discounted payments before billing them, writes CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.
If passed, hospitals beginning July 2027 must presume people enrolled in certain social welfare programs, such as food stamps, are eligible for financial aid. Hospitals would also be required to check whether patients are eligible if they are uninsured; enrolled in Medi-Cal but pay some share of medical costs; or enrolled in a Covered California health plan.
The California Hospital Association currently opposes the bill, arguing that hospitals already promote their financial assistance programs.
But surveys and research show that many patients aren’t well informed about these programs. Sierra Freeman, a Stockton resident who is prone to aneurysms, amassed medical bills totaling $4 million after undergoing multiple surgeries at Stanford Medical Center.
Though her employee health insurance covered the majority of the costs, Freeman researched for months on charity care to get most of the remaining sum waived. 

Freeman: “I feel like I now have the knowledge and power to apply for this the next time it happens. But I wish more people knew about it.”

Ellis A. Jacobson, age 72 passed away peacefully at home with his family in Montpelier, VT on July 19, 2025 after a brief, fierce battle with pancreatic cancer. Ellis was born in Portland, Maine on August 28, 1952 to Nellie (Levin) and Myer Jacobson.
Ellis was an artist, sculptor, mask maker, educator, curator, director, writer, actor, clown, comic and musician. His career in the arts began when he won the Best Actor award for the Children’s Theater of Maine in 1966, and from there he was hooked. He went on to get his Bachelor of the Arts in theater and his teacher’s certification at Goddard College in Plainfield, VT. In the late 60’s and early 70’s, he performed with Blackbird Theater, Two Penney Circus, and Bread and Puppet Theater. Throughout the 70’s and 80’s he wrote and performed numerous comedy shows with Barney Carlson; he juggled with Peter Youngbaer as Mister Blister and Fatman; and he created his own mask theater company, “The Regular Theater”. He toured to Oaxaca, Mexico with Dragon Dance Theater in 1994, where he created a giant mask in the town square, which was used in their performance at Monte Alban. His paper mache masks were also featured in a performance by the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera in Brooklyn in the 1990’s.
In the 2000’s he turned his energy to arts education and curation. In 2000 his masks were displayed in a one-man-show at the University of Montana. He worked in numerous Vermont schools as a theater teacher, director and artist-in-residence. He founded and curated the Artpath Gallery in Burlington, Vermont, and served as a Trustee for the T.W. Wood Art Gallery. For the past 10 plus years he has developed, run and taught after school arts programs for elementary aged children in central Vermont; most recently his own program, 3 O’Clock Art, at the Greenway campus in Montpelier. Providing an environment for his students to be able to play and create freely in whatever medium and subject matter inspired them was the most important to him, and he loved his students dearly.
Ellis loved the coast of Maine, spending time every summer body surfing and eating fried clams with family and friends in Ocean Park. He loved his chosen home of Cabot, Vermont, where he bought his first home while in college. He lived there until 2023, when he permanently moved to Montpelier. He loved making people laugh, and continued to do so even in his frequent hospital stays during his last weeks of life, cracking jokes with each person who walked into the hospital room. He loved all things and collected many, such as art, coins and antique toys, but he loved nothing better than the smile on the face of a child. He loved the extended non-traditional family that he shared with his partner of 42 years, Marilyn Nasuta, whom he married in 2012. He was a devoted grandfather to Cooper and Nellie Lamb, a step father to Rosemary Leach and a step-father-in-law to Ted Lamb. He is survived by his brother Alan Jacobson and sister-in-law Rose of Miami, FL; his nephews Brian Jacobson of Homestead FL and Mark Jacobson of Ann Arbor, MI; his brother-in-law Stephen Nasuta and sister-in-law Molly Backup of Saint Albans, VT; his niece Ditra Backup of Washington DC; as well as grand nieces, grand nephews and cousins.
Ellis was so grateful to everyone who shared their love, support, and medical expertise over the last 10 weeks including his family, his friends, his students and their families, and the staff at Greenway Institute, UVM Medical Center (especially Miller 5), Central Vermont Medical Center, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Central Vermont Home Health and Hospice.

AB 1340 would let California ride-hailing drivers collectively bargain for improved pay and benefits. Uber and Lyft say it could drive ride prices up and availability down.


Uber and Lyft drivers in California have been fighting for years for higher wages and better working conditions — in the streets, before state lawmakers, in court and at the ballot. 
Now, a bill making its way through the state Legislature would allow ride-hailing drivers to unionize. 
If Assembly Bill 1340 passes, California would become the second state to give ride-hailing drivers the right to collectively bargain. Massachusetts was the first to do so after voters there approved a ballot measure last year.
The ride-hailing companies oppose the California legislation, saying it goes against the “spirit” of Proposition 22, the ballot initiative they bankrolled that voters approved in 2020. It cemented gig workers’ status as independent contractors in the state. The law also limited state lawmakers’ ability to establish collective-bargaining rights for gig workers, but an appeals court struck down that provision.
Drivers and other gig workers gained some benefits when Prop. 22 passed, but their complaints continue, many of them tied to the fact that they are not considered employees. And since the law effectively leaves no state agency in charge of enforcement, many gig workers don’t know where to turn to claim unpaid wages or health care stipends, to contest getting kicked off the apps, or to get help with other problems.
Some drivers and advocates say being able to collectively bargain could address those issues. But the gig-work industry warns that would mean big changes to their business model, which would push ride prices higher and affect the availability of rides.
“We can benefit a lot from being unionized,” said Hector Lopez, who has driven for Lyft in the Bay Area for the past several years and is involved with the group Gig Workers Rising. “It might be the only way to get fair wages.”
A group that represents Uber and Lyft has said drivers in California earn an average of $37 per “active” hour, while research from the UC Berkeley Labor Center found that the average pay for drivers, including tips and taking their entire working shifts and expenses into account, was $9.09 per hour.
Another common driver frustration is limited communication when they need help. Drivers have to use the Uber or Lyft app to message back and forth with a company representative, or in some cases talk with them on the phone. But Lopez remembers being able to get help at a Lyft Hub, a physical location staffed with human beings he could talk to. Those hubs closed down a few years ago.
“We could have a union, which would have an office, where we could get help face to face,” Lopez said. “That’s something that’s really big that they took away from us.”
Not all drivers will be on board. There is “a healthy suspicion” around unionizing among California drivers who say they value their status as independent contractors, said Sergio Avedian, senior contributor for the Rideshare Guy, a YouTube channel popular with gig workers. 
But he said many drivers also “often express frustration about a lack of representation and leverage, especially when it comes to deactivations, rate cuts and algorithmic transparency.”
What the bill would do
The proposal before the Legislature would give ride-hailing drivers the right to form and join a union with which the gig companies would be required to bargain in good faith.
It would also require ride-hailing companies to submit lists of drivers and other driver information to the state’s Public Employment Relations Board every three months starting in 2026. 
The Protect App-Based Drivers & Services Coalition, an industry group that includes Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart, opposes the legislation, as do various chambers of commerce and business groups. 
In a letter to lawmakers in July, the group said the bill’s requirement that companies submit driver information to the state — which would give a potential union a way to directly reach a dispersed group of workers — is “a dangerous violation of driver privacy” and could result in unwanted texts, phone calls and even visits to drivers. 
Different drivers groups are expected to vie to be the sole bargaining union of ride-hailing drivers statewide. But provided a group can get 10% of active drivers to approve it as a representative, it would be able to access driver lists, according to analyses of the bill by legislative committees. Each group would be prohibited from sharing that list with third parties. 
Nicole Moore, president of Los Angeles-based Rideshare Drivers United, supports the bill’s disclosure requirements. “Right now the state has no idea how badly we’re being paid,” she said. “We could tell you, but that’s anecdotal. We need data.”

Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab said the bill would mean increased costs because of administrative and compliance burdens, and the fact that the company would have to negotiate with a union over pay and benefits. The industry group said if drivers get the right to unionize, it could lead to higher costs for rides.
A Lyft spokesperson would not comment on the legislation. 
The bill, co-authored by Assemblymembers Buffy Wicks of Oakland and Marc Berman of Palo Alto, both Democrats, is set for a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Aug. 18. 
What’s happening in Massachusetts
In Massachusetts, Uber and Lyft drivers won the right to unionize months ago and are now working to make a union a reality.
Chiem Klot, who has been driving for Uber for a decade, is trying to organize Boston-area drivers. He says his pay “gets worse and worse every year.” He said he used to be able to make $300 or $400 a day, and is now driving for 12 hours a day and making about $200 a day.
“There are over 80,000 (ride-hail) drivers in Massachusetts,” Klot said. “They all work so hard to make very little money. A lot of them still don’t know they’re allowed to unionize. Some of them are also scared to — that Uber might retaliate.”
The Massachusetts App Drivers Union is a joint effort of Service Employees International Union 32BJ and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
Gabe Morgan, executive vice president of SEIU 32BJ, said through a spokesperson that thousands of drivers in Massachusetts have already signed unionization cards, and that besides fair compensation, drivers deserve transparency. 
Will sectoral bargaining work?
Sectoral bargaining, or negotiating as a group within a certain occupation, has worked in certain places and industries, such as in Los Angeles, where hospitality workers have won wage standards and benefits, said Katie Wells, a tech and labor expert who co-wrote “Disrupting D.C.: The Rise of Uber and the Fall of the City.” But Wells said she’s concerned that in the ride-hailing industry, sectoral bargaining may not lead to real change. 
That’s because the big players in the gig economy have fought to keep change “superficial,” Wells said. She pointed to Prop. 22, which among other things promised California gig workers health care stipends. But a union-backed survey showed few gig workers actually qualify for or use the stipends, which are not extended to those who get public health benefits. The survey also found that 29% of gig workers surveyed were on Medi-Cal, California’s health insurance program for low-income people and those with disabilities. The companies have not released exact numbers about how many workers receive the stipends.
Sectoral bargaining “could work, but it has to be done well,” said Laura Padin of the National Employment Law Project, a research and advocacy group for low-wage workers. She said drivers “are subject to a lot of control of the companies” and should be covered under the National Labor Relations Act, but they are not because they’re not considered employees. “In this political environment, it may be the best we can hope for,” Padin said.
Federal lawmakers have been trying for years to improve gig workers’ working conditions. The most recent proposal was introduced last week by Sens. Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, both Democrats. It would require gig companies to disclose more detailed information about wages and fares to drivers and consumers; cap companies’ cut of each ride’s fare at 25%, meaning 75% would go to drivers; and more. Other proposed federal legislation that would help strengthen workers’ right to organize has languished for years. So other governments are trying to step in. At the state level, besides California, Minnesota and Illinois are also considering bills to give drivers collective-bargaining power. 
But even if drivers are able to band together and unionize, they would still likely have to deal with more obstacles, experts say. 
“When drivers are able to organize and win labor standards through public policy directly, Uber tries to fight it,” said Mariah Montgomery, national campaigns director for PowerSwitch Action, a network of advocacy groups. She mentioned what has happened in New York City, where drivers won minimum pay rates that began in 2019. 
Last year, Bloomberg reported that Uber and Lyft were using a loophole in the law and systematically locking drivers out — preventing them from finding work on the apps — during certain periods. Last month, the city’s taxi commission established new rules ordering the companies to give drivers 72 hours notice before locking them out.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/040825_Gig-Workers-Rally_LB3_CM_30.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-01 08:56:17.283976

California gun owners raced to take advantage of a new federal appeals court ruling against a law that required background checks for ammunition purchases. Some expect Gov. Gavin Newsom to appeal.


Lifelong hunter J.R. Young of San Jose rushed to an online ammunition dealer last week after a federal court decision overturned a California gun law that required background checks in person at every point of sale.
“Is this freedom week?” he said. “I was just curious to see if this striking down of the law is allowing companies to ship into the state again.
“The way we live in society now — when we want to buy something, we don’t want to go and take a trip to the store.”
Many bullet junkies, hunters and gun enthusiasts like Young quietly celebrated the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that may or may not ultimately put a dent in the state’s strict policies for purchasing ammunition.
For now, they can’t avoid the background checks. Four days after the decision, gun and ammunition dealers received notice that the in-state background check law still holds until the Department of Justice processes the ruling and issues an official mandate. 
It’s unclear what will happen to the online ammunition orders Californians tried to make before that notice.
Second Amendment advocates have been here before. They have challenged the constitutionality of the measure that restricted gun ownership, Proposition 63, ever since voters approved it in 2016 and have seen a mix of rulings for and against them.
This time, the case is unfolding after a landmark 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down a New York City concealed carry law and generally limited how cities and states can restrict access to firearms.
Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the 9th Circuit ruling that curbed the California background checks, but neither he nor Attorney General Rob Bonta have said whether the state would appeal it. Newsom was the primary advocate for Prop. 63, and he has defended the state’s restrictions on the sale of guns and ammunition as meaningful in reducing gun violence.
Under the measure, consumers pay a fee for the background check, which just last month rose from $1 to $5 per sale. But more costly than that, an additional 11% excise tax went into effect in 2024 for the Gun Violence Prevention and School Safety Fund — money allocated for prevention, education, research, response, and investigation programs. That tax won’t change under the new ruling.
“Being in a one-party state, they’re going to continue to push and regulate,” said Patrick Jones, a gun store owner in Redding. “And while this may be a victory, it’s hard to get really excited about it because it’s just one in a sea of court battles that are coming.”
Jones’ Fort continues to stay in business after 60 years, but the family-owned store has seen better days.
“It’s a dying industry,” he said. “It’s not a friendly or fun business anymore. When you regulate and regulate and regulate, you kill an industry. And that’s what they want to do in California.”
Gun rights proponents are anticipating an appeal that will keep the background checks in place.
“I’m not sure why they’ve been so quiet about it,” said Kostas Moros of the Second Amendment Foundation. “You’d think they’d want to be the first to say, ‘No, no — we think this is still in effect.’ But that’s led to the confusing scenario where out of state ammo dealers had no way to know this.”
Aside from the sheer question of the background checks’ constitutionality, Moros pointed to a high rate of erroneous denials that emerged in the course of the lawsuit.
“We’re not dealing here with some reasonable version of this law,” said Moros. “It wrongfully denies, by the state’s own admission, 11% of people who try and use it. And the ratio of mistaken denials versus actual prohibited people, by the state’s own data, was 411 to 1.
“I don’t think we’d tolerate this if voter registration erroneously rejected you one out of 10 times. I don’t think that would stand for very long.”
Meanwhile in San Jose, Young kept an eye on his ammunition shipment’s tracking information from Missouri to Kansas on July 26. He’d already been charged for the purchase, but MidwayUSA had updated its website and discontinued sales to California after the justice department’s July 28 notice to dealers.
The two boxes of bullets he ordered arrived at his home on July 30. “LOL, impulsiveness paid off,” said Young, who’d previously expressed a fear of missing out on the chance at lower prices.
“To be honest, I do prefer to support my local businesses,” he said. “I run a small business myself, so I want to buy in my neighborhood. But this one, the ruling just really had me curious as to where it stands.”
Not all California gun owners and ammunition buyers feel the same as Young, however.
“We’re so close to Oregon and Reno that people are just buying out of state,” said Jones, in Redding. Besides watching his sales steadily decline over the years, he’s also seen a noticeable migration to states with more gun-friendly legislation.
“I have had a ton of customers that have left California — whether it’s Tennessee, or Utah, Idaho, Texas, all over. Often, within one day’s drive, they pick up a lot of freedom.”
But despite his political animosity, Jones said he’s not leaving his home state. “They can escape the tyranny for now, but I think you have to fight it like a disease. If you don’t fight it where it’s at, it’s going to catch you.”

(Boulder City Council meeting screengrab)Boulder City is the latest community in Nevada to enact an anti-homeless camping ban, which took effect in June.
Susan Reams, a Boulder City resident who is currently experiencing homelessness, filed a lawsuit in late July seeking to make the ordinance “more humane” and prevent the law from being enforced, especially in the triple digit heat. 
“Because of rising rent costs and (the) unemployment rate, a lot of people, including myself, are unhoused,” Reams said. “I just think there’s more that Boulder City could be doing. There’s nowhere for people to go. Boulder City doesn’t have safe camping zones or even a shelter.”
In an email to Nevada Current, a city spokesperson said it couldn’t comment on the lawsuit because it had not yet been served with it.
The council unanimously passed the ordinance May 27 that prohibits camping, sleeping, and storing personal property in a public place. Violating the ordinance is a misdemeanor and people could face up to six months in jail. 
City Attorney Brittany Walker told council members in May that the bill would “provide the city with the tools it needs in order to ensure that individuals aren’t camping in the public places and are seeking services.”
Boulder City joined Reno, Las Vegas, Henderson and Sparks along with Clark, Washoe and Nye counties in being among localities across the state that have passed or expanded various punitive measures in recent years to restrict where those experiencing homelessness can sleep or camp. 
Multiple decisions out of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction includes Nevada, ruled in recent years that ordinances were unconstitutional if cities didn’t have adequate shelter space for people who were sleeping in public places. 
Some cities, including the City of Las Vegas, tried to circumvent the federal court’s ruling by adopting bans on sleeping and sitting in public rights of way that would only go into effect if shelter space was available. 
The legal landscape changed in June 2024, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled local governments are not violating the 8th Amendment’s restriction on cruel and unusual punishment if they criminalize people experiencing homelessness for sleeping outside, even if there aren’t other adequate accommodations. 
More than 200 municipalities across the country have adopted anti-homeless camping bans since last year’s high court ruling, according to the National Homelessness Law Center. 
Increased statutory criminalization comes as homelessness has spiked across the country, including in Nevada.
The state saw a 17% increase in homelessness last year, according to a December report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Southern Nevada’s 2024 Point-in-Time Count, an annual snapshot of homelessness on one particular night, showed a 13-year high in the number of people experiencing homelessness. 
The data is likely an undercount. 
Among the number of those entering into homelessness is Reams, who was evicted last year. 
“I didn’t realize that you could be evicted even though your rent was paid,” she said, adding that her eviction stemmed from having two dogs in the apartment.
Though she has been able to get an occasional room at weekly motels, most of the time she has been finding discreet spots to sleep around Boulder City.
“There is a Boulder City emergency aid, but their hours are limited along with their finances,” Reams said. 
Though she has signed up to be on waitlist for housing assistance through Boulder City and other nonprofits, she hasn’t had any luck. 
In an email to the Current, the city said in 2022 it created a community resources liaison position at the Boulder City Hospital to help address needs of unhoused individuals.  
The liaison declined to be interviewed.
In the email the city said the liaison has connected unhoused individuals to services, including recently several unhoused people who were reunited with families out of town. 
“Our first response will be referrals to the Community Resources Liaison rather than issuing a citation,” the city said in an email. “The new ordinance provides a legal mechanism for the city to approach unhoused people in our parks and help connect them with available resources.” 
The city told the Current they have tallied 12 unhoused people in the city. 
In a staff report from the May 27 council meeting, officials said that “a growing number of individuals are occupying public places in Boulder City and storing personal property and belongings in public places in a manner causing concern for City staff.”
Speaking to council members at the May meeting, Boulder City Police Chief Tim Shea said some of the unhoused people officers have talked with have said they were told by law enforcement in the Las Vegas area to come to Boulder City.
Boulder City Councilwoman Denise Ashurst said she believed the city needed an ordinance “because if you don’t have something in place, then you don’t have anything to lean on if you do need something.”
Camping will still be allowed with a permit, said Walker, the city attorney. 
Walker also said it was her understanding that “there has never been a conviction under Las Vegas or Henderson ordinance for such a violation.”
However, data previously reported on by the Current showed that the Henderson Police Department issued 150 citations or arrests among 99 people for camping or sleeping in a public right of way from August 2023 to September 2024.
Shea said his department would use discretion before issuing a citation or making an arrest.
In the meantime, Reams said she is making repeated appeals to get the council to make the ordinance more humane, and has called for a town hall in order for city officials to better understand the homeless crisis. 
“I find this is a big issue in Boulder City, and I don’t think it’s going to get any better,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-7-31-25-at-3.00 PM-e1753999629889-1024x597.jpeg,,,2025-08-01 08:56:17.283976

(Copyright Mark Hertzberg/for Racine County Eye)ELKHORN — At a raucous listening session in a high school auditorium Thursday evening, U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Janesville) defended the immigration and tariff policies of  President Donald Trump and the Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed on July 4.
From the roars of the crowd, critics of the congressman appeared to account for the majority of the group that filled nearly two-thirds of the 600-seat Elkhorn High School auditorium. But there were also recurring cheers, shouts and applause at key moments from a smaller coterie of supporters in the room.
Steil represents the 1st District in Congress, which covers Southeastern Wisconsin from Janesville and Beloit east to Racine and Kenosha on the shores of Lake Michigan.
Over the last several months, Republican members of Congress have been counseled not to hold in-person events with constituents after publicity about angry crowds turning up at some GOP town halls.
Steil’s constituents have been protesting weekly outside his office in Racine for months, calling on him to hold an in-person meeting rather than telephone ones.

Taking the stage shortly after 5 p.m. and lasting for about 80 minutes there, Steil stuck with a cheerful, breezy tone. He treated the loud, impassioned and often angry audience cries as mostly a difference of opinion.
When an audience member asked Steil how he might take a stand against other congressional Republicans “who lie to the American public and malign the dignity of 70 million people on Medicaid by suggesting that they are lazy,” Steil lamented the tone of political discourse and vowed not to denigrate anyone. Then he turned the subject back to the boisterous auditorium.
“I’d say the overall majority of people here want to learn and understand my perspective, want to hear the question,” he said. “And then there’s a small group of people that are challenging.”
It was left to the moderator of the session, Janesville radio host Tim Bremel, to lecture the crowd to refrain from shouting over Steil’s answers during a Q&A period.
During one interruption, the radio host scolded, “Ladies and gentlemen, we will never get questions if we can’t keep the auditorium quiet. And please do the person who asked the question the respect of allowing his question to be answered.”
Pledge of Allegiance
Steil kicked off the session with the Pledge of Allegiance, inviting the audience to join him. They did so, some shouting the final words “and justice for all” with vehemence.
He followed with a short talk offering “just kind of an overview of where we’re at in this country to get ourselves back on track” — words that prompted more angry taunts.
Steil said that the nation’s spending is about “$1.8 trillion more than on the revenue side,” a comment that prompted scattered shouts scoffing at “tax breaks.”
He defended the expansion in the budget reconciliation law of work requirements for SNAP food aid, saying the change followed a model that Wisconsin had already instituted for the program in the 1990s.
When he switched to immigration and a graph that Steil said showed “the dramatic drop, the decrease that we have seen in border apprehensions,” a cry of “We are all immigrants!” came up from several rows of seats.
Nine minutes in, Steil made a pitch for his office’s constituent services, then appealed for restraint from the crowd.
“The more civil we are with each other — there’s people that have different views in here, we heard applause and boos on the border security issue, we’ve heard it a couple of times,” he said. “We have people on all sides, it’s great, that’s what makes us so great.”
Tariffs, ICE and deportation
The questions that followed came from members of the audience who filled out forms at tables in the school lobby.
Bremel told the crowd that the questioners would be chosen at random. Some greeted that claim with loud skeptical scoffs. Over the course of the hour, however, the vast majority of people who were chosen asked questions sharply critical of Steil, Trump, the Republican congressional majority, or all three.
Criticizing Trump’s tariffs, Tom Burke asked Steil “what dire economic circumstances” justified the president’s executive orders to impose them.
“What we need to do is make sure that we’re having other countries treat the United States fairly,” Steil replied, adding that the U.S. should “work collectively with our allies to address the real culprit, which is China.”
Burke wasn’t satisfied with the answer. U.S. allies, “seem to be alienated beyond belief,” he told Steil, adding that until he got a satisfactory answer to his question about their rationale, “I’m going to be totally opposed to these tariffs — period.”
Specifying that her question was about “not politics, but morality,” Jean Henderson of Elkhorn told Steil, “What I see happening to our immigrant population embarrasses me, terrifies me.”
Henderson criticized the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel, their faces hidden by masks, against immigrants “who are doing the right thing by going to the immigration office,” only to be taken into custody. “It is a trap,” she said. “Why is this happening and why aren’t you stopping it?”
Steil began in reply, “What I view is the moral hazard created by the Biden administration…,” prompting a roar of disapproval from the crowd, then a shout of “Joe Biden sucks!” from someone perhaps more sympathetic to the congressman.
The rest of Steil’s response was largely drowned out.
When it was her turn at the microphone, Kelly Neuens connected the experiences of her grandparents and great aunt and great uncle, who were held in U.S. internment camps during World War II as U.S. citizens of Japanese descent, to the conditions in the El Salvador prison where the Trump administration has sent some immigrants taken into custody.
“President Trump said, ‘Homegrowns are next’ when he was speaking to the El Salvador president,” Neuens told Steil. “My worry is that we are repeating history here.”
A plea for the climate
In his answer, which was repeatedly interrupted, Steil described the World War II internment as “one of the more darker chapters of American history,” then added, “As we look at the engagement that law enforcement is doing now against immigrants who are in the country illegally, I don’t see the  exact parallel.”
Another questioner asked Steil to explain “why you support Linda McMahon and defunding the Department of Education?”
Congress, Steil said, is still “analyzing what the spending will be for the upcoming fiscal year.” He added that the department “has burdened a lot of our local school districts with unnecessary red tape” in the course of distributing funds to the states. “I think what we will see as we negotiate this going forward is a way to make sure that those funds are there” for local schools, he said.
When it was her turn to ask a question, Sharna Ahern of Fontana thanked Steil and his staff “for answering all the contacts I’ve made with you over the years.”
She enumerated a wide range of concerns she has had — about the Department of Education, about the treatment of immigrants, “about the rule of law and civil rights” — and then turned her focus on the environment.
“Extreme weather conditions are happening more frequently as we experience them,” she told Steil. “The EPA is deregulating the standards that are in place to fight climate change, to protect the citizens. Where do you stand on this issue? And how can you be an advocate for us to initiate legislation to restore our safeguards?”
Steil praised Wisconsin as “one of the most beautiful states in the country” and asserted that “making sure that we’re protecting our air and water and soil is absolutely essential.” He said that on the issue of climate change, “what we need to be doing is focused on addressing that global aspect. But again, make sure other countries are doing their fair share of it.”
The crowd largely jeered at the response. When another audience member asked about Trump’s executive orders rolling back Biden administration measures to address climate change, Steil said that action was necessary to “correct … the overreach in the previous administration.”
It was after 6 p.m. when Bremel called for the final question.
A few minutes earlier, someone had shouted a question about “children starving in Gaza,” and the woman whose turn it was asked Steil to address that topic as well as to defend the SNAP cuts.
“I can do them both,” Steil said. He started with SNAP, reiterating his earlier assertion that Wisconsin would not be affected by the program’s changes to work requirements because of policies the state had in place already.
Turning to Gaza, Steil said, “To me the easy answer to address this crisis is for Hamas to surrender and release the hostages. Release them. Israel was unfairly, unjustly attacked.”
His comments gave rise to another brief demonstration, punctuated by repeated chants of “60,000 people are dead!”
By the time the chanting ended, Steil had left the stage.

Nevada Health Link, formally known as the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, is the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. The Nevada Division of Insurance on Thursday announced that carriers offering individual market plans through the exchange have proposed an average premium rate increase of 17.5%.
That is a significantly higher rate hike than recent years. This time last year, the Nevada Division of Insurance announced a proposed average rate increase of 7.11% for 2025.
The proposed rate hikes in Nevada are on track with national expectations. KFF reported that, among the 19 states whose proposed rate changes were available in mid-July, the median for premium increase requests was 15%. Insurers have cited the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits and the impact of tariffs as reasons for the hike, according to KFF.
The enhanced premium tax credits were enacted in 2021 as part of pandemic relief measures, and increased the dollar amount of credit ACA enrollees received while also relaxing eligibility requirements. The enhanced credit was extended under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, but will expire at the end of this year.
Nevada’s 17.5% proposed increase rate only reflects adjustments to plans currently being offered. It does not take into account rates for new plans, such as the Nevada public option plans scheduled to be available this fall for coverage starting next year.
Named Battle Born State Plans, these public-option plans must cover the same essential benefits as other exchange plans but “must meet specific premium reduction targets, meaning more Nevadans may have access to affordable coverage, regardless of income,” according to a Nevada State Health Authority statement that accompanied the announcement about proposed rate hikes.
Nevada’s public option was greenlit during the 2021 Legislative Session through a bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and supported only by Democrats. It was approved by the federal government early this year. Analyses estimated that public option plans could offer plans 15% cheaper than average over the next four years.
It’s not clear whether the new plans will provide any relief for consumers in the upcoming year. The Nevada State Health Authority was not available for comment Thursday.
A spokesperson for the Nevada Division of Insurance on Thursday said they were unable to provide additional information about how the forthcoming public options plans will compare to plans currently on the exchange because rates have not been finalized.
Approved rates for all plans will be available Oct. 1.
In the meantime, the Division of Insurance is inviting consumers to weigh in on proposed rate changes by submitting comments on its website. The website includes proposed rate hikes by carrier.
Open enrollment will begin Nov. 1 for coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2026. The open enrollment period ends Jan. 15, 2026.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner told an interim committee made up of Idaho legislators that President Donald Trump and his administration are ushering in a nuclear renaissance that Idaho will lead.
“I have been a nuclear engineer for over 30 years now, and during the majority of my career, we’ve been shutting down perfectly good operational nuclear power plants for economic reasons,” Wagner said Wednesday during the Idaho Legislature’s Interim Committee on Federalism at the State Capitol in Boise.
But Trump and the new U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright are changing the game for nuclear energy and research, Wagner said.
“I can’t even … emphasize properly how significantly different this is than any other action by an administration on nuclear energy in my lifetime,” Wagner said.
Building new nuclear reactors in Idaho and beyond
Idaho National Laboratory is one of 17 U.S. Department of Energy national labs, and is considered the nation’s leading nuclear energy research and development national lab.
‘The West will lead’: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming team up on nuclear energy development

Now, for the first time in 50 years, Idaho National Laboratory is in the process of building and permitting new nuclear reactors, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
During his presentation, Wagner highlighted four executive orders that Trump issued in May regarding nuclear energy.
The executive orders calls for reinvigorating the nuclear industrial base, reforming nuclear reactor testing, deploying advanced nuclear technology for national security and reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that was created by Congress to ensure the safe use of radioactive materials, Wagner told legislators.
Wagner said the executive orders enable up to 10 gigawatts of new nuclear reactors to be under construction by the end of this decade.
Overall, the executive orders include at least 30 direct tasks and aggressive timelines, Wagner said.
“Other than the two reactors in Georgia, we have not been building new reactors over the last three decades,” Wagner said “And so this is about reinvigorating that nuclear industrial base to enable the nuclear renaissance.”
This is the second time since spring that a committee of legislators has been briefed on Idaho National Laboratory ramping up its operations. In May, members of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee toured the Hot Fuel Examination Facility and other buildings at Idaho National Laboratory’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)Alabama lawmakers are preparing to reintroduce a bill that would make the rape or sodomy of a child a capital offense, punishable by death, state officials said in a press conference Thursday.
Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, one of the bill’s sponsors, said that while it is “unfortunate” that such a bill is “necessary,” the rape of a child is “the worst of the worst of offenses” and therefore “deserves the worst of the worst punishments.”
HB 29, sponsored by Simpson in the 2024 legislative session, would have given adults who rape or commit sodomy against a child under six the death penalty or life in prison without parole, while those under 18 would receive a life sentence. The bill was amended in House committee to extend the punishment to those who commit such crimes against children under 12 and passed the House on an 86-5 vote, but did not make it to the Senate floor for a vote.
Sen. April Weaver, R-Alabaster, who plans to file a similar bill in the Senate, said that the death penalty is meant as a deterrent.
“The death penalty is meant to be a deterrent, and if passing this bill keeps one innocent child from suffering, it will have done its job, and if it sends even one child predator to an early grave, well, that works too,” Weaver said at the press conference.
This legislative push comes after seven people were arrested in Bibb County for their alleged involvement in a child sex trafficking ring. Jody Wade, sheriff in Bibb County, who has been briefed on the bill but had not had a chance to review it, said at the press conference that he wanted to show support for the bill.
“As we work to give a voice to these victims that haven’t been able to have their say as of yet, we just want to take time out to come here and voice our support for this legislation,” Wade said.
Both Simpson and Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, who also attended the press conference, said the legislation is in part a direct challenge to a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision, known as Kennedy v. Louisiana, that declared the death penalty unconstitutional for crimes against individuals that do not result in the victim’s death. Both said that the legal landscape has changed enough since the 5-4 ruling. Supporters of the bill think the current  ourt will be more supportive
“The Supreme Court acted back in 2008 to invalidate the efforts of states to be able to engage in capital punishment for a case in which there was no death, but there’s a time to reevaluate the analysis that the Supreme Court used, as well as the importance that states have placed upon this issue moving forward,” Marshall said.
Simpson added that the court’s decision in 2008 was based on a lack of states with similar laws, a situation he believes is now changing.
“There is a push now to change that, that narrative. There are states that are trying to do it. So, it’s not going to be unusual because others try to do it,” Simpson said.
Simpson pointed to recent legislation in other states, including Florida and Tennessee in 2023 and 2024, and Idaho, Oklahoma, and Arkansas in 2025, as a reason that the Supreme Court might reconsider its 2008 decision. Simpson believes that if Alabama’s bill passes and an individual is charged under it, other states could file amicus briefs in support, which could convince the Supreme Court to reconsider its previous decision.
Marshall said his office is prepared to defend the law and would support other states with similar laws.
“We prepared to do it the moment we have that opportunity,” Marshall said.
Potential effects
Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said in a phone interview after the press conference that such legislation may be counterproductive. She noted the Kennedy decision rested in part on testimony from experts who work with child sexual assault victims. Such a policy, they said, would worsen the problem of underreporting sexual abuse, increase the incentives for child molesters to kill their victims and heighten the trauma that child victims experience in the criminal justice process.
“Those experts said that making this crime death-eligible would only increase the danger to children and result in reduced reporting of child sex abuse by family members,” Maher said.
An amicus brief filed by the National Association of Social Workers and other organizations in the Kennedy case states that the majority of child sexual abuse is committed by family members or close friends. Victims and their families may be hesitant to report abuse due to fear of the consequences for the abuser, a fear that would be significantly increased by a threat of the death penalty, the brief said. 
The brief also argued that allowing the death penalty for child rape might lead to more victims being killed, since offenders might be more likely to murder the child to prevent them from testifying, since the punishment for rape and murder would both be death.
“If an offender believes that he will be sentenced to death if convicted of either raping a child or murdering that child, the offender will have every incentive to kill his victim and thus eliminate the primary witness to the crime. The offender will as a result also be more likely to remain free to abuse additional children, in Louisiana and elsewhere,” the amicus brief stated.
Simpson countered that claim in the press conference, saying that perpetrators keep victims alive and commit “that offense repeatedly, multiple times over a length of period of time.”
“They don’t just stop,” Simpson said.
The brief also states that death penalty trials would force child victims to “relive painful events repeatedly.” A study cited in the brief found that testifying repeatedly was associated with “poorer later mental health, including more trauma-related symptoms”. The appeals process can last for years, with one study finding the average time between sentencing and execution to be over 12 years.
Marshall countered those concerns, saying that “kids are strong” and that forcing them to testify is “sadly, what we have to do in a criminal justice system.”
“We’re not creating additional stress for victims because it’s a death-eligible case, those that offend children have created that problem, and the criminal justice system becomes the only vehicle for which we can provide them with relief,” Marshall said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PXL_20250731_1606042462-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 08:56:17.283976

(Photo provided by the U.S. Geological Survey's Alaska Science Center)A management overhaul is needed to address the faltering salmon runs in the Yukon River and the widespread harms that have resulted from shortages of fish along the river’s basin, according to a report by Indigenous leaders and Alaska scientists.
The report, a peer-reviewed policy brief published in the journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, proposes an independent review of Yukon River Chinook and chum salmon issues by an entity like the National Academy of Sciences. It also recommends bigger management and science roles for Indigenous residents who live along the river, which flows nearly 2,000 miles from Canada’s Yukon Territory to the Bering Sea.
Building relationships between tribal members and government managers will likely require long-term effort, says the report, which has co-authors from various organizations, including the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
“Trust between Indigenous communities and fisheries scientists and managers needs to be enhanced by continuously, transparently, and equitably combining quantitative fisheries analyses with Indigenous Knowledge,” the report says.
The report recommends a “cultural exemption” for small-scale personal harvests by river residents to help address inequities between commercial and subsistence fishers.
And it recommends more at-sea safeguards, including new or expanded protected areas.
The recommendations are intended to address factors that the report identifies as hurting Yukon River salmon. Those include climate change and acidification in the Bering Sea; warming temperatures and streamflow changes in the river and its tributaries; competition for ocean resources from increasing volumes of hatchery fish; and accidental netting of salmon, known as bycatch, by trawl vessels targeting pollock and other species.
Some of the recommendations clash with Trump administration policies.

	The administration has slashed research on federal fisheries and climate change. Additionally, an April 17 executive order by President Donald Trump pushes for bigger commercial seafood harvests and revocation of marine protection designations.
One of the report’s Indigenous authors said Trump administration policies should not prevent the reforms.
“I would say that it’s not a question of optimism. It’s a question of being pragmatic and practical,” said Ed Alexander, co-chair of the U.S-Canada Gwich’in Council International.
An example of a scientific subject that he said needs further exploration – and for which local Indigenous knowledge would be useful – is the effects on salmon of the decades-old hydroelectric dam in Whitehorse, the Yukon Territory’s main city. It is the only dam on the river.
The idea of protected marine areas is not new, Alexander added. He cited the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area that was established in 2016 by then-President Barack Obama, abolished by Trump in his first term, resurrected by President Joe Biden and then abolished by Trump in his second term.
Legislation at the state and federal levels is already pending that would address one of the recommendations: establishment of tribal representation on the North Pacific Fishery Management Council and the Alaska Board of Fisheries.
Former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, included a North Pacific council tribal provision in a bill she sponsored to reauthorize the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management. That bill did not pass before she lost her seat in the U.S. House. A similar bill, with the tribal seat provision, has been reintroduced by one of her bill’s co-sponsors, Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California.
A state bill sponsored by Rep. Nellie Jimmie, D-Toksook Bay, would designate two of the seven seats on the Alaska Board of Fisheries for subsistence users. It would also designate seats for commercial, sport and science representatives.
The measure, House Bill 125, passed the House on May 17 and is now pending in the state Senate.

Of course, the retired ear, nose and throat doctor is concerned about federal cuts to Medicaid spending, which could leave millions of Americans without insurance and strain hospitals, nursing homes and home-based care programs that senior citizens rely on.
But Singleton, 85, who now lives in a retirement community in Overland Park and was recently elected to the Kansas Silver-Haired Legislature, is also concerned about cuts to food assistance programs and economic policies like tariffs and tax cuts that he fears will push up prices.
“Everything has ramifications on aging individuals,” he said, “and those individuals who are on fixed incomes get hurt the worst.”
Singleton is not alone. Many advocates working to help senior citizens in the Kansas City area worry, too. A growing population of older low-income adults, they said, already struggles to find health care, pay rent and afford food.
In Missouri, almost 10% of the state’s 1.1 million residents 65 years old or older live below the poverty level and 22% receive food assistance. In Kansas, 8.5% of the state’s 510,000 seniors live below the poverty level.
“We do not have the infrastructure to meet the needs of the region’s aging population at this moment,” said Jeron Ravin, president and CEO of Swope Health, a safety-net health clinic in Kansas City that has made improving that infrastructure one of its priorities.
And that’s the situation before provisions in new federal legislation, President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” go into effect.
That legislation will cut $911 billion in spending on Medicaid over the next decade and trim $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), causing an estimated 22 million households to lose all or part of their food assistance.
All of that will hurt low-income seniors and the long-term care facilities, health care providers and community organizations that they rely on, senior advocates said.
“We’re in crisis now,” said Janet Baker, executive director of KC Shepherd’s Center, which provides meals and other support to older, mainly low-income adults. “We can’t meet the need that we already have, and that need is just going to grow.”
 Growing older populations

In both Missouri and Kansas, older adults make up a growing portion of the populations.
A recent survey of older Missourians found that almost one-third of respondents couldn’t access the health care they needed, often because it cost too much or they couldn’t find a provider in their area. And at least three in 10 said they didn’t have enough money to afford healthy meals.
“We’ve seen this coming for a long time based on demographics and population shift,” said Rachel Ohlhausen, director of program partnerships with Jewish Family Services, “and we haven’t seen federal dollar investments that match.”
In fact, since Trump returned to office in January, the opposite has happened.
Funding has been slashed for safety-net programs like Meals on Wheels and transportation services to help older adults get to the doctor or the grocery store. Area agencies like KC Shepherd’s Center and Jewish Family Services have been forced to turn down requests for help from seniors and their families.
Food pantries and meal sites, meanwhile, also are struggling to help food-insecure seniors as federal food aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture also experiences steep cuts. And affordable housing for seniors is a growing need.
According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, people 50 years or older represent the fastest-growing group experiencing homelessness. The organization predicts that that group will triple in size by 2030.
In Kansas City, Swope Health will break ground Aug. 7 on a development at 5900 Swope Parkway designed to include 200 units of senior affordable housing, along with senior health and dental clinics.
But Ravin said plans for the project, called Swope Health Village, may be curtailed by federal funding cuts, which will likely take money away from community health clinics like Swope by reducing the number of patients covered by Medicaid and potentially increasing the number who need free care.
In addition, he said, the donations required to complete future phases of the project will be harder to come by.
“The question is, due to these cuts, will the project, instead of being completed within five years, take 10 years or 15 years?” Ravin said. “All safety-net providers are likely to be less financially secure. Philanthropy is going to have more of us asking them for support than ever. And, you know, the well is only so big.”
 Impact on care for seniors

Across the spectrum, health providers are expecting to feel the effect of cuts to Medicaid funding.
The new federal law will reduce the number of people who can receive Medicaid, the government-funded health insurance program, by adding work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks. Some of those requirements could be especially burdensome for seniors, advocates said.
The law also shifts more of the program’s costs, which have always been jointly funded by state and federal taxes, to states. Finding those dollars in Missouri and Kansas will probably be difficult.
In addition to federally qualified health clinics like Swope that rely heavily on revenue from patients covered by Medicaid, safety-net hospitals like University Health in Kansas City expect to lose revenue. And so will long-term care facilities like nursing homes, which already have faced headwinds in recent years.
Medicaid covers 65% of residents in Missouri nursing homes and 58% in Kansas nursing homes.
During the COVID pandemic, long-term care facilities became ground zero for deaths because the virus so easily spread in close quarters and residents’ health and age made them more vulnerable.
Many patients moved out of the facilities as well, resulting in empty beds and, in some cases, closed doors.
Kansas once had at least one skilled nursing home option in all 105 counties in the state. Now nine counties have none, said Linda MowBray, president and CEO of the Kansas Health Care Association and Kansas Center for Assisted Living, which represents long-term care facilities in the state.
MowBray praised the Kansas legislature for adding funding to the Medicaid program to increase reimbursement rates for long-term care facilities. But reimbursements still don’t meet the actual cost, she said, and many facilities continue to struggle financially. The new federal law won’t help, she said.
Most concerning to her members, MowBray said, is a reduction in the amount of time people have to qualify for Medicaid coverage once they’ve moved into a long-term care facility.
Currently, if a person enters with a Medicaid application pending, they get 90 days to complete the cumbersome process. The facility will be reimbursed for the time the patient’s application was pending as long as approval comes within that 90-day window.
But the new law shortens that window to 60 days, which may not be long enough for many older patients to complete the process, MowBray said. That means nursing homes won’t be reimbursed for all of the days that the application process requires.
“This will force providers to take a serious look at how much risk they can take,” MowBray said.
Some small facilities may not be able to afford the risk, she said.
“The concern is … where are these people going to go?” MowBray said. “Are they just parked in the hospital while the application is going through? And if it doesn’t go through, and they’re beyond 60 days and the hospital doesn’t get paid, that’s an even bigger bill that’s going to have to get written off.”
Marie Dunham, an owner of Blue Hills Rest Home in Independence, is not ready to panic. After four decades in this business, she said, she’s seen this play out before when people have worried about government benefits being reduced but then everything turned out to be fine.
“Every time we get a new president, a new governor, everybody always gets this fear factor,” Dunham said. “Everybody needs to take a big breath.”
Blue Hills, an assisted living facility, serves senior citizens and people with disabilities. The vast majority of them receive Medicaid. Dunham doesn’t believe the state of Missouri will abandon this population.
“There’s got to be homes to take care of our people — our elderly and disabled,” Dunham said. “They’re not going to put our people out on the streets.”
 Ripple effects

Baker, who, in addition to her role with KC Shepherd’s Center, serves in Missouri’s Silver-Haired Legislature, is less optimistic. She expects to see more nursing homes close and more seniors left at greater risk.
“More hunger, more hardship and more homeless seniors,” she said. “I don’t believe the state is prepared from the standpoint that senior services are inadequately funded in the first place.”


In 2023, then-Missouri Gov. Mike Parson launched a study to develop a master plan on aging for the state. Officials are holding town hall meetings across the state before the report is finalized later this year.


Low-income older adults will almost certainly feel the ripple effects that follow cuts to federal funding, health leaders said. Even before those cuts passed Congress, states were expecting increased needs among the growing senior population. And both Missouri and Kansas have been planning.
In 2023, then-Missouri Gov. Mike Parson launched a study to develop a master plan on aging for the state. Officials are holding town hall meetings across the state before the report is finalized later this year. A Kansas City event is scheduled at 9 a.m. Aug. 1 at the Kauffman Foundation at 4801 Rockhill Road.
And the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services has drafted a state plan on aging that makes several recommendations for improving care for older Kansans.
Now the question becomes whether the current political landscape will allow priorities laid out in the state plans to be implemented. Observers fear that fiscal and political realities make that unlikely.
Missouri has shifted its own tax policy, including eliminating the state’s capital gains tax earlier this year, which will mean less tax revenue coming in. And federal changes to Medicaid and SNAP will force both states to carry a greater portion of the costs of those programs, meaning less money for other priorities.
Stacy Morse, executive director of the Missouri Council on Aging, said she hopes state legislators will understand that priorities included in the master plan on aging, which her organization supports, are recommendations from people around the state.
After tax cuts, “it’s going to be really hard … to fund these services and support that people across Missouri are saying they need,” Morse said. “There’s a complete disconnect between what we want and what Missouri is willing to pay for.”
Even if big financial investments are not possible in the current environment, small changes could still help, said Mindy Ulstad, who has led the master plan process from her post with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
For example, the master plan will recommend that the state work on a “no wrong door” policy for seniors in the state, so one call to a single agency will let them get all their questions answered. And the state can work on outreach, so seniors have a better idea of what services are available to help them.
“There may be things that are harder to enact over the next few years,” she said. But the state can work on “getting information out about what’s available and helping people navigate those systems.”
Ulstad also said that the information gathered during the process of writing the master plan will be available to local governments and community organizations so they can learn from it and perhaps implement some of its recommendations.
“We are letting people know that the plan will be out there and they can use it for their own strategic planning,” she said.
Increasingly, support for older adult services is falling to county taxpayers. In November, for example, Jackson County voters passed a tax levy that will raise $8 million annually to support senior services beginning sometime next year. Across the state, 55 other counties have similar taxes.
But as state legislators look at limiting property taxes, Morse fears that this source of revenue could be at risk, too. In testimony before a Missouri House committee on the issue, she urged legislators to remember that those taxes are helping seniors.
“We recognize that there is this need to reduce the property tax burden,” she said. “Also that the assessments may have increased too quickly, and it took a lot of people by surprise. But what we want to remind you is that the property taxes are providing really necessary services. For the older adults, it’s helping them age in place.”
More patients are likely to need support to stay at home. Many people can’t afford long-term care or would prefer to be in a familiar place.
Swope Health started a program a year ago called PACE KC, which relies on Medicaid and Medicare payments to provide health care and social support like transportation to Jackson County residents who are 55 or older.
But the reality is that more people will need more help, especially after federal and state cuts are absorbed.
“It will get worse before it gets better,” Ohlhausen said, “and my hope is that we learn and we really try to hold on to what we want to build back on the other side.”
She is also still holding out hope that lawmakers will reconsider and reverse some of the funding cuts before they take effect.
“I don’t know if that’s possible, but whatever is possible should be pursued.”

Bill Finch was bumping along in a muddy four-wheel utility vehicle on a rocky road near the Paint Rock Forest Research Center when a research assistant in another four-wheeler rumbled up next to him.
“Are you going to check the Hawthorn? Has it leafed out yet?” Nathan Paris called out to him that spring morning.
Finch, whose gray beret, wire-rim glasses and full white beard lend him a professorial air, turned off his engine and shook his head. “Be patient,” he said.
Longtime conservationist Finch has spent a lifetime practicing patience in his study of forest dynamics, genetic diversity and how this lush landscape of northeast Alabama will be affected by changing environmental conditions. His quest is to understand the trees and their prospects. What he shares from his wanderings in one of the richest biodiverse regions in North America will likely inform conservation methods for generations and influence future strategies to adapt to a changing climate.
Finch is the co-founder of a research center in Paint Rock Valley, 4,000 wild acres edged by mountains and laced with clear springs and streams. The center is perched within The Nature Conservancy’s Sharp Bingham Preserve, not far from Huntsville.
The Hawthorn tree that prompted the early morning exchange is a once-thought extinct species—not seen since 1914 and a most satisfying surprise for Finch a couple years ago. He had noticed on daily treks in the forest an unusual patch of some Hawthorn under a canopy of mature tall trees. Finch identified two species, was uncertain about the third type of the thorny branched deciduous and was stumped by the other foliage.
Finch reached out to Brian Keener, a professor of biological sciences and founder of the digital compendium Alabama Plant Atlas at the University of West Alabama, who raised the possibility that the mysterious tree was the extinct Hawthorn.
Finch and Keener called Ron Lance, a Hawthorn expert from South Carolina and author of a definitive book on the Crataegus genus, a family of trees related to apples and pears. They compared the unknown species to the official botanical reference dating from 1914, which includes dried leaf, fruit and flower collections known as a herbarium specimen. Their epiphany? They rediscovered a species native to a few counties in the Cumberland region of Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia with its distinctive large and hairy leaves and stems.

Finch collected seeds for DNA analysis and seed propagation, part of Finch’s ongoing endeavor to document species survival and adaptation. The nonprofit HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville and the University of Georgia also contributed significant help.
“Biodiversity is a tool” to deal with a rapidly changing world, Finch said. “We don’t know what the future is going to look like in 2075, and biodiversity represents our choices for the future. And if we don’t have that biodiversity, we’ve lost our choices to adapt to all the changes we know about and all the changes we still can’t predict.”
Finch’s career spans five decades of great change. He studied forestry as a student at Warren Wilson College, located in the shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina. His first job out of college was writing about herb gardens for Mother Earth News, a bimonthly launched in 1970 and rooted in respect for ecology and back-to-the-land sensibilities. His wife, Beth Maynor Finch, a renowned photographer, has chronicled the wild places of the South for several decades.They initially met collaborating on a book about the longleaf pine forest and later reconnected through their mutual interest in conservation.
Finch joined the Mobile Press Register as an editor and environmental writer from 1993 to 2005 and crossed paths with E.O. Wilson, American biologist and naturalist who became a friend and colleague. By 2006, Finch was named director of conservation at The Nature Conservancy.

In 2007, he joined with Wilson, a native of Alabama who had retired from Harvard University in 1996 after 40 years of teaching but remained as professor emeritus, and Stephen Hubbell and Patricia Adair Gowaty, distinguished biologists and professors emeritus from University of California who are married, to consider how to create a research plot in a diverse, temperate and mature forest.
While the group dreamed and planned, Wilson and Hubbell engaged in heated philosophical debates rooted in intellectual curiosity and determining what the limits could or should be. “Ed would say, ‘I want to know everything,’ and Steve would say, ‘That’s just unknowable,’” Finch recalled.
Wilson, who asserted “80 percent of the species out there, we don’t know,” wanted to understand each individual species. Hubbell wanted to investigate the broader impacts on ecosystems, Finch added.
It took a decade of searching for land and raising funds, but in 2017, their vision, encompassing both approaches, came to fruition at Paint Rock Forest Research Center.


They were fortuitous to land in this Alabama valley at the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains on the Cumberland Plateau because “this is one of the last great wild places in the eastern U.S.,” Finch said.
The Paint Rock Forest Research Center includes a house and a barn, built by a former private owner, now used for seed processing. The property sits atop a natural cave system with an underground water supply from cave pools and waterfalls and covers a diverse terrain, including sandstone plateaus, wetlands and thickets of bamboo.
The research plot is a dynamic, thriving expanse with 150 acres mapped into 1,600 survey plots, each 20 by 20 meters (65 by 65 feet). So far, 86,000 trees, including seedlings as thin as a pencil and seasoned timbers three feet in diameter and pushing up to 130 feet in the sky, have been measured, tagged and identified.

Annually, there are dozens of researchers and fellows—including students and faculty from University of Alabama, Jacksonville State University, University of Georgia, University of West Alabama and national institutes—who visit to collect genetic material to document new species and understand how species interact, survive, evolve and adapt to a changing environment.
The forest will serve this generation and the next as a potential genetic reservoir for climate-resistant tree species, Finch said. And it will help answer a critical and monumental question.
“What is the future of species, and what is our future with those species?” Finch said.
“Both survivals are interlinked.”

‘Keys to the future’

Standing in the forest that has existed as long as 100 years and surrounded by towering trees about to leaf out, Finch picks up a large, brown leaf with black spots. While some foresters in the past have suggested the unusual leaves are a hybrid oak leaf, Finch believes they are evidence of a new species and his team is investigating. Other potential new species on the preserve include violets, maples, elms, and Robinia (a legume-like tree).
“As climate changes, we have the keys to the future,” Finch said about his effort to understand how species and ecosystems interact and survive in order to protect Alabama’s irreplaceable natural heritage and safeguard it as a critical national resource for ecological understanding and adaptation
Alabama served as a “refugia” during the ice ages. Here many species survived and diversified, making it a global hotspot of biodiversity. Its varied geology, including limestone habitats, and its high rainfall levels—up to 70 inches per year—have also contributed to its biodiversity.
Today, Alabama has 40 native oak species compared to only 12 along the entire Appalachian trail. Alabama is the national center of magnolia and buckeye diversity and accounts for 80 percent of all hickory trees in the world, Finch said.
Alabama is also the center of freshwater aquatic diversity in the United States—its waters have the nation’s greatest number of mollusks and fish—and has more species of mussels than all of South America, making it a global center of such diversity, according to Finch.
Its inherent riches provide a natural cleansing of air and water, moderate the temperature, help to limit flooding, cycle nutrients to crops and spur pollinations for flower and agriculture, said Noah Greenwald, endangered species co-director of The National Center for Biodiversity. Most modern-day medications also come from species that thrive in the forest, he said.

Species are the building blocks of ecosystems that support our way of life, he said. But beyond the practical considerations, “we’re making our world a less interesting and more lonely place as we lose more and more species,” Greenwald said. “We lose some of the beauty and the magic of the world every day.”
The center, with four full-time and three part-time employees and an annual operating budget over $300,000, isn’t involved in forest genetics research alone. The center has about equal funds for fellowship and scholarships. Researchers are exploring cave ecosystems, monitoring aquatic species, restoring shortleaf pine and bamboo ecosystems, studying wildflowers and conducting bird and insect surveys in partnership with a variety of state, national and international research institutions.
Alabama contains populations and genetic resources that can be used to repopulate and restore degraded ecosystems in other parts of the country, acting as a “storehouse” and “warehouse” of species diversity, Finch said.
“Diversity helps us weather change, and the more diversity you have, the more choices you have to deal with those changes.”
But ecosystem restoration isn’t simple. “You can’t just move a tree here, you have to understand why trees have survived here and what’s happening in the soil,” Finch said. Understanding soil and respecting the pathogens within helps drive diversity, he said.
Finch drops the unidentified oak leaf, which flutters to the ground. Then he points to the small silver tag, attached by his research team, that hangs like a necklace and identifies one of the almost 100,000 trees that his center monitors.
“We’re here for a special reason. Understanding heat-tolerant species and heat-tolerant genetics within species. What happens for New England forests—as things change—is they will have to borrow from Alabama.
“Our diversity will be their diversity.”

When forests are reduced

While a 4,000-acre preserve might seem expansive, it’s quite small in terms of preserving a complete ecosystem. When forests are cut off and reduced in size, they fit what E.O. Wilson described as “island biogeography,” where small isolated areas become less diverse with more species loss.
“If we’re going to have any chance of a future on this Earth, we’re going to have to do more than have places where we walk our dogs,” Finch said. According to estimates by Greenwald’s National Center for Biodiversity, one third of all species—a million species in all—are at risk if climate change proceeds unchecked. Studying individual species and forest preservation in isolated patches without considering the broader context would be “like studying the sea worthiness of the Titanic while it was sinking,” Finch added.
At the Paint Rock Forest Research Center, researchers have sought to expand their methods and horizons.
In the past, researchers collected fresh young green leaves from the tree canopy by taking strategic shots at the top of the trees. Using a 12-gauge shotgun, researchers would pepper #4 lead shot at specific branches. The tumbling leaves were immediately preserved in liquid nitrogen for genetic tests and molecular study back at the center’s labs.
This spring, in collaboration with HudsonAlpha, the center’s researchers cast unwieldy 35-foot lineman’s poles into the upper branches of the trees to “fish” fresh leaves from the top of the canopy. Leaves from more than a hundred trees will be examined this way in an attempt to better understand how trees age, thrive and survive.
Researchers luckily beat nature by a matter of days during their leaf mission. They collected leaf samples just before 185 mile-an-hour high winds splintered 200 acres of the mature forest, cutting off access to that area for further research for now. They may, in the future, consider whether drones could be used to help document the ancient forest.
Researchers from the University of Alabama are currently pursuing another project to reconstruct 300 years of forest history, counting tree rings and conducting core sampling of trees to understand the forest’s historical composition and changes.

‘One last wild place’

During the 20th century, the building of dams contributed to the largest mass extinction event in North America. The Tennessee Valley Authority completed the Wilson Dam in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, in 1924, and Alabama Power built seven hydroelectric dams over the course of the century.
The dams destroyed habitats and disrupted migration, resulting in the extinction or eradication of 40 species of freshwater snails and mussels, according to the Alabama Rivers Alliance. Human activity played prominently in sculpting the current environment.
Finch stood in an area of the forest that he refers to as a “sink,” where the ground dips from a cave system that collapsed centuries ago. The entire Paint Rock Valley is essentially a collapsed cave system, where rainfall has been absorbed by the karst or limestone in the ground, which may have played an important role in preserving tree species. Humans have always interacted with the land, but they didn’t always have the tools to wipe out everything and make it a golf course, Finch said a bit wryly.
Homesteaders lived in this section of the forest, he said. The trees tell the story, revealing different growth patterns in open areas, specifically a big white oak nearby that he points out.
Finch sees what he calls a “wolf-like” pattern in the tree’s profile—it stands as a lone wolf, larger and older with spreading branches indicative of growing in an open, sunlit area. The time the homesteaders left 120 years ago can be measured by the age of the pines growing in what was a field or pasture, Finch said.
In May, Finch had a chance to observe the ravages of nature and consider, once again, his own reverence for its immense power. On May 20, a tornado tore through the forest’s deep ravines, reshaping the landscape.
The day Finch stood and surveyed the damage he couldn’t look away from the “ugly, broken, sun-burned tangle of trunks” of trees that had shaded the forest floor for centuries. “Awesome” was the word he kept repeating.
Later, Finch offered this insight: “If life gives you a tornado, you make tornado research.”
So he made plans. His teams would repair roads, figure out how to remove downed trees if dangerous, and observe the long-term recovery processes hidden in the forest. The research, he said, could provide insights into forest resilience, species adaptation, and the role of natural disturbances in ecosystem dynamics.
The ruin was a fresh opportunity for Finch. Preserving Alabama’s diversity will help natural systems globally, he said. Biodiversity loss here can lead to cascading ecological, genetic, and economic consequences that reverberate far beyond Alabama’s borders.
This one last great wild place in Alabama can be protected, as Finch said, “not just as an asset to Alabama, but an asset to the whole country.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Paint-Rock-Forest-Research-for-July-29-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 08:56:17.283976

A new analysis found New Jersey has one of the nation’s largest unfunded liabilities for state employee pension plans. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.
“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

n comparison to a year earlier, the jobless rate also increased in all of those metro areas.
St. Joseph had the highest unemployment rate among all of the state’s metro areas in June, rising to 4.5% from 4% in May. The city’s unemployment rate was 4.2% a year before.
Columbia saw the highest monthly increase in its unemployment rate, which was 4.2% in June, up 0.7 percentage points from 3.5% in May.
Jefferson City had the state’s lowest unemployment rate at 3.7% in June.
Springfield and Kansas City had the same jobless rate in June at 4.2%, increasing from 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively, in May.
The statewide unemployment rate before seasonal adjustment in June was 4.4%, rising from 3.9% in May. The unemployment rate was 3.8% in June 2024.
Missouri’s total civilian labor force in June was 3.2 million, with about 140,946 unemployed.

LaMonica McIver's comments came with the release of a new report highlighting political representation by Black women.,"Rep. LaMonica McIver's comments came with the release of a new report highlighting political representation by Black women. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Rep. LaMonica McIver, whose first year in Congress has been marked by a federal indictment and a threat of censure by her Republican colleagues, said her time serving on the Newark City Council helped her develop the “tough skin” necessary to navigate her current political predicament.
McIver’s comments came as Rutgers officials unveiled a new report Thursday that charts a decade of data surrounding Black women’s representation in public offices, one that shows historic strides but a continued lack of representation at every level of government.
“City council and local government, it makes you tough … I’m up against a case that’s literally trying to throw me in jail. I have a situation where members of the other side of the aisle are trying to censure me, they’re trying to kick me off committees,” McIver said during a virtual briefing on the report. “That experience really gave me those, you know, tough lessons that is helping me today.”
Federal prosecutors in June hit McIver, a Democrat representing the 10th Congressional District, with a three-count indictment accusing her of assaulting federal officials and impeding the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, also a Democrat. The charges stem from a May 9 incident outside a migrant jail in Newark, when McIver and two other members of Congress attempted to enter the building for an inspection. A melee followed when federal agents attempted to arrest Baraka.
McIver and Baraka, whose federal trespassing charge was dropped days after his arrest, say the charges are political, as do their Democratic colleagues. The state’s chief federal prosecutor, acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a former personal attorney for Republican President Donald Trump, has pledged to use her office to “turn New Jersey red.”
McIver, who sat on the Newark City Council for six years and was its president when she was elected to Congress, on Thursday credited other Black women in Congress whom she said “hold me down.” McIver joined Congress in September 2024 after winning a special election to replace the late Rep. Donald Payne Jr. At 39, she’s one of the youngest members of Congress.
“We’re facing so many challenges, you know, each and every day to, you know, be serving in Congress, be serving at the federal level. Many of us have families. Many of us are wives. We’re trying to manage so much, but at the same time, we’re managing literally being targeted each and every day as well, on many different levels. And so the sisterhood has really been incredible,” she said.
Thursday’s report was produced by Rutgers’ Center for American Women and Politics and the Higher Heights Leadership Fund, a nonprofit aimed at boosting Black women in leadership roles. It found that while a record number of Black women now serve in state legislatures, only 25 Black women have ever held statewide elected executive office — in just 17 states — and none have ever been elected governor.
The report was released just one day after former Vice President Kamala Harris announced she would not pursue the governorship of California, a decision that panelists described as representative of how Black women navigate power obstacles. Harris last year lost her bid for the White House to Trump.
“She believes that her current most powerful use of her voice, her time, talent, and treasures, is as someone not running for office and somebody not governing,” Glynda Carr, the president and CEO of Higher Heights, said.
Speakers on Thursday discussed the “Kamala effect,” the idea that Harris’s rise and representation at all levels of government have inspired Black women to greater political participation.
Since 2014, the number of Black women in statewide elected executive offices has grown from two to 10. In the 2024 election, 63% of Black women congressional nominees won their contests, outpacing the win rate of women candidates and men candidates, the report said.
Chelsea Hill, the report author and director of data at the Center for American Women and Politics, said that Harris’s presidential campaign revealed the obstacles that Black women face when running for elected offices.
“She confronted deeply entrenched gender, racial and intersectional stereotypes about her likability, her deservedness of the nomination and her ability to do the job,” Hill said.
There’s a status conference in McIver’s case scheduled for next week. A motion to censure her was introduced last week in the House by Rep. Clay Higgins (R-Louisiana). It says her actions on May 9 violated congressional rules that members “behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House.”

There's more than enough to go around, and every little bit helps. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Paul Quackenbush: Don’t look away.","This commentary is by Paul Quackenbush, a resident of Burlington. 


Recently, as I exited the Ethan Allen Shopping Center on North Avenue in Burlington, I saw a woman on the sidewalk with three small children. She was trying to corral them away from the road as she held a sign that read “Every little bit helps.” I looked away. I told myself it was because I had a 10-year-old in the car, and I didn’t want him to see that situation or ask me difficult questions. 
The next day, I learned that more than 800 people — including nearly 300 children and 250 individuals with acute medical needs — were evicted when their motel vouchers ran out. The evictions came after Gov. Phil Scott initially vetoed a bill that would have regionalized the motel voucher program and then refused pleas to extend the vouchers — or even to set up emergency shelters for those leaving the program. They also came at a time when federal food assistance is drying up. Unsurprisingly, the downscale of the motel voucher program has been correlated with a steep rise in unsheltered homelessness in Vermont.

I thought of that mother and her kids again recently while I kayaked along the Lake Champlain shoreline, past multimillion-dollar homes that sit vacant for most of the year. I thought, too, of the poverty I had seen in many parts of a state that prides itself on its progressive values, like in Essex County, where the median annual income is less than $59,000 and more than 1 in every 6 children lives below the federal poverty line. 
My mind turned to what I could have done for that woman and her children. 
Maybe I should have stopped and bought them food and seen what I could do to help. Maybe I should have stayed better informed about the end of the motel housing voucher program so I could have contacted my representatives and Gov. Scott ahead of time to express my concerns. Maybe I should have worked harder to elect leaders who wouldn’t turn a blind eye toward the most vulnerable. And maybe I should have donated my time and money to one of the wonderful local organizations serving those in need. 
I still can.
One of the great things about living in the second least populous state is that each of us can have a relatively big impact. Many problems feel intractable right now, and it’s easy to point the finger at the powers and systems that be. 
But it’s our state, and those of us with enough can do a little more to make sure other Vermonters have enough too. There’s more than enough to go around, and every little bit helps.

Child care in Minnesota has been in crisis for years and now it is moving swiftly from crisis to collapse.
It is unaffordable for families, and yet we don’t have enough resources to pay our teachers living wages. We are losing child care programs every day, often ones that have been part of the fabric of our communities for decades, leaving families scrambling to find care. 
This spring St. Paul lost several child care centers: Hallie Q. Brown Early Learning Center, Sandcastle Early Learning Center, and Children’s Center Montessori. 
Children’s Country Day School is closing at the end of this summer. 
I’ve had too many conversations with other child care directors center around whether or not they will be able to stay open much longer.
When the Minnesota Legislature passed over $1 billion of funding for child care in 2023, it felt really big, but in reality it was far too little and far too late. Now, in 2025, with the federal government operating in the interest of billionaires at the expense of our family, friends, neighbors and — most importantly in my work — our children, we are left with no choice but to act boldly. 
You know what happens when we act boldly? We create amazing things, like Head Start. Head Start turned 60 years old this year — but what should be a joyous moment of celebration is instead a tenuous moment of fear and worry. 
Head Start has served over 40 million kids in its 60 years. We have spots for 38 of those children at Wilder Child Development Center, where I am the director. That’s over half of our enrollment. These are kids like Liam, who needs extra behavioral and mental health support after losing his father at a young age. He’s getting that support and thriving, and his mom can work full time without worrying about him. It is very clear that investing in our youngest at a young age works.
To meet the requirements of Head Start, and the needs of these children, we receive a “per diem” for every Head Start child. For us, that adds up to nearly $250,000 every year — about one-third of our entire budget.
The Trump administration has backed off their quest to eliminate Head Start, but it is little consolation, as they have also closed five of the regional Head Start offices with no notice and no instruction on what the programs served by those offices should do, leading to huge funding delays. Administrators are being forced to take out bank loans to make payroll. In what world is this ok?
More recently, the administration declared that Head Start should be reclassified as a “federal public benefit” which would slash eligibility of immigrant families by up to 500,000 children, while immediately impacting 115,000. This affects all of us. 
If we lose Head Start kids, we lose Head Start funding. If we lose that funding, we will have  to close at least one classroom, leading to loss of child care for 15-20 children, whether they are part of Head Start or not. Without that funding, we would have to let staff go. It is even possible that we would have to close our doors.
What I mean by acting boldly in this moment is taking action to ensure that if federal funding for child care is cut off, that we as a state have the resources we need to support the programs the federal government is choosing not to — because if they are coming for Head Start, they are surely coming for the federal grants that support our Child Care Assistance Program, too. 
Already, state agencies are struggling to draw down federal funds they use for child care and instead are met with an email from DOGE asking them to justify why they need the money. Considering that child care centers are closing every day because they can’t charge families enough to cover their expenses, this is beyond insulting.
Without funding, child care will cease to exist, thousands of parents will be unable to work, our economy will no longer function, and our kids will suffer greatly. 
Our children cannot wait, our families cannot wait, and we cannot wait. The time to act is now. We need our elected leaders in Minnesota to not just act, but to act boldly.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/D753AC86-F1DD-456D-BA50-EDD802758461-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-01 07:56:39.132251

Josh Hawley speaks to reporters at the governor's ham breakfast at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia on Aug. 15 , 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Recently, Missouri’s senior senator introduced the American Worker Rebate Act which promises “at least” $600 per adult and dependent child funded by revenue from President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. The proposed legislation represents a dangerous fiscal misstep that threatens to worsen inflation while squandering a rare opportunity to address America’s mounting debt crisis.
Hawley’s proposal goes against one of Our Republican Legacy’s five pillars — fiscal responsibility — which is being woefully overlooked by current Republicans.
Our Republican Legacy’s fiscal responsibility principle reads: “Historically, our party stood for fiscal responsibility. The explosion of national debt in recent years is a legacy of weakness that future Americans must inherit. We renew our historical commitment to a sound economy.”
Hawley’s proposed tariff rebate is an anathema to the very idea of fiscal responsibility and is an example of just how much the GOP has changed from what it used to be.
American workers deserve policies that genuinely improve their economic prospects, not Hawley’s political theater that provides temporary checks while imposing hidden long-term costs.
Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, and those costs are inevitably passed along to consumers through higher prices. Hawley’s rebate scheme will have American families paying higher prices at the store while receiving what amounts to their own money back—minus the administrative costs of collection and redistribution.
The inflationary risks of Hawley’s plan cannot be overstated. The U.S. has brought in a record $150 billion worth of tariff revenue so far, but that economic burden came directly from American consumers and businesses.
Rather than allowing this contractionary effect to help cool inflation, Hawley proposes pumping the tariff revenue directly back into consumer spending through cash payments. This creates a perfect storm for further price increases with tariffs driving up the cost of imported goods while rebate checks increase consumer demand, pushing prices higher across the board.
The Federal Reserve has spent the past few post-Covid years fighting to bring inflation under control, raising interest rates and implementing contractionary monetary policy to reduce demand pressures in the economy. Hawley’s rebate scheme would effectively counteract these efforts by providing fiscal stimulus precisely when the economy needs restraint.
For a family of four potentially receiving $2,400, the immediate gratification of cash payments would be quickly eroded by the resulting price increases on everything from groceries to housing.
Hawley’s tariff rebate plan offers an economic sugar rush mixed with short-term political gain at the expense of long-term economic stability.
As troublesome as the risk of inflation, Hawley’s proposal also misses a massive opportunity for debt reduction. With the national debt approaching dangerous levels and interest payments consuming an ever-larger share of federal revenues, the $150 billion in tariff collections could make a meaningful dent in our fiscal obligations.
Our Republican Legacy’s founder and former Sen. John Danforth had the following to say: “Hawley’s plan which, as I understand it, would give $600 to every man, woman and child in America, is the opposite of one of (Our Republican Legacy’s) core principles of fiscal responsibility. The current Republican program blows the lid off the national debt which now stands at $37 trillion and, under the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, will grow an additional $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years.”
Reducing the national debt would lower the government’s interest burden, freeing up resources for productive investments in infrastructure, education, and defense. It would also strengthen America’s fiscal position for future economic challenges and reduce the intergenerational burden we’re placing on young Americans. Every dollar spent on rebates today is a dollar not available for debt reduction, meaning higher taxes or reduced services for future generations.
Again, from Danforth: “As I understand Hawley’s proposal, that increase in the debt is not enough. He would increase it by an additional $200 billion in a one-time payment to all.”
Rather than fueling inflation through misguided stimulus, Congress should demonstrate genuine leadership by either repealing the tariffs, which is within their Constitutional powers, or apply the tariff revenue to debt reduction, providing lasting benefits for all Americans while avoiding the inflationary trap this proposal would create.
While it remains to be seen whether Hawley’s proposed legislation would ever become law, this isn’t the first time Hawley has embraced the idea of sending out checks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hawley was a lone Republican calling for additional rounds of stimulus checks back in 2020, even teaming up with democratic socialist, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.

(Getty Images)Watching successful programs disintegrate due to state budget cuts is particularly disheartening. Adding bypassing investment in other opportunities to that makes it downright depressing.
A widely supported dropout prevention program called Jobs for America’s Graduates was expanded under former Gov. Eric Holcomb, but has now lost all its state funding.
Similarly, the statewide initiative through Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library aimed at increasing literacy in Hoosier children is in peril after lawmakers removed it from the state budget. A private fundraising effort is ongoing, but its future is unclear.
These are ongoing programs that might fail.
On top of that, there are examples of initiatives that could be created or increased to improve the lives of Hoosiers.
For instance, at least 16 states have sales tax holidays for parents buying school supplies. It could save families a significant amount when you consider clothes, computers and other supplies needed.
Gov. Mike Braun proposed this holiday, which also would have covered youth sports purchases — even putting it in his draft budget. But other priorities won out and it was eventually removed.
Or what about actually increasing money going to food banks at a time when food insecurity is high? The budget maintained a $2 million line item but saw no increase despite food banks facing higher demand.
And I haven’t even mentioned the state employee layoffs that are happening. Recently the Indiana Department of Workforce Development laid off 15% of its workforce.
Impact on revenue
And I want to be clear about one thing. The state is still seeing increased tax collections — just not as robust as expected.
In fiscal year 2025, Hoosiers paid $22.2 billion in taxes — including sales, income, corporate, gaming, fuel and others. That was about $740 million more than the prior year.
50+ state employees laid off as Indiana budget cuts take effect

The problem is that some programs like Medicaid are growing so fast it squeezes out other worthy initiatives.
There is still wiggle room though. For instance, the state could afford both JAG and the Dolly Parton program.
Indeed, lawmakers created a Freedom and Opportunity in Education Fund and appropriated $50 million to it each year. It doesn’t direct the money to any specific programs, instead just outlining general uses such as improving academic performance, recruiting educators in high-need areas, expanding computer science programs, reading intervention and dropout prevention.
We will have to wait and see what the Indiana Department of Education and the Braun administration use that money for instead.
Tax cuts continue
Other initiatives — like eliminating the tax on adult diapers or feminine hygiene products — also can happen. But lawmakers instead continue to slowly reduce Indiana’s flat income tax rate, which means less money comes to the state.
Indiana’s individual income tax rate has dropped from 3.4% to 3.05% since 2015 via a phased-in reduction. And it’s scheduled to drop to 2.9% by 2027.
Indiana’s corporate income tax rate has also dropped.
For several years, when Indiana was swimming in new revenue and the state was plowing billions into new buildings, paying down unfunded pension obligations and incentivizing regional development, it made sense.
But that’s not the case anymore. And the tax cuts are happening at such an incremental pace that most Hoosiers don’t even realize it. Collectively, though, those dollars could be used to improve services, continue successful programs and generally invest in the future.
Of course no one likes paying taxes and it’s easy to support tax cuts. But I am curious what the ultimate goal is and whether lawmakers will ever admit a certain level of revenue is needed to move Indiana forward.

The Washington Bee Atlas is modeled after the Oregon Bee Atlas, which began in 2019 as part of the broader Pacific Northwest Bumble Bee Atlas. That program began in 2018 and monitors bumble bee activity in Oregon, Washington and Idaho. 
Washington remains part of the Pacific Northwest Bumble Bee Atlas, but launched the Washington Bee Atlas in July 2023 as part of an effort to better understand Washington’s native bees, identify which are doing well and which may need conservation support.
The Washington Bee Atlas also documents which plants native bees depend on, with the goal of developing recommendations for seed mixes to support pollinators. 
All of the latest bee data from Washington will be added to the Ecdysis research data portal, with plans for more ways to make the data usable by the public under discussion.
The Washington State Department of Agriculture began training program volunteers in 2023. 
Most bee collecting is done by volunteers trained to collect and pin museum-quality specimens and record the location and host plant where the bee was collected. The volunteers then submit the pinned specimens to Wright for identification. Eventually, all specimens not used for education and outreach will reside in the Washington State University entomology museum.
Aside from being over the age of 18, there are no prerequisites for new volunteers, as the program provides the necessary training.  
In 2024, 67 Washington Bee Atlas volunteers collected over 17,000 specimens on more than 600 different host plants. 
The project has identified at least 26 new or rare species in the state, with many of the collected bees yet to be identified.
The state Department of Agriculture said there have already been several remarkable discoveries, including 15 species never collected in the state before, a bee found in Yakima County that had not been recorded in Washington since 1917, and another bee found in Yakima and Pierce counties that had never previously been found in western Washington. 
Many of these bees were detected in central Washington, likely because most native bees have adapted to thrive in dry areas like the microclimates found east of the Cascade Mountains, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. 
Ten of the 26 new or rare bee species that have been identified so far were collected in Chelan County. 
Eight of those bee species collected in Chelan County were discovered as part of a graduate research project conducted by a University of Washington student and a Washington Bee Atlas volunteer.
A total of eight new or rare bee species were collected in Grant County, five in Yakima County, four in Kittias County, two in Okanogan County, and one each in Douglas, Thurston, Clark, Pierce and Benton counties. 
Some bee species were collected in more than one county. 
“These are just our preliminary findings,” Wright said. “There are still many more bees to identify from what has been collected, not to mention lots of opportunities to find new or rare species.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-2.13.03-PM-1024x590.png,,,2025-08-01 07:56:39.132251

(Getty Images)Despite having some of the most resources and economic support, a recent national study ranked Indiana’s early education system 42nd in the country — and second-to-last when it came to accessibility.
The WalletHub story, shared earlier this week, is simply the latest confirmation for Hoosier parents that Indiana’s child care market is struggling. Experts, business leaders and politicians agree that Indiana needs more child care, but can’t seem to agree on the best way to meet the moment. 
Report: state loses out on $4.2B annually due to child care shortage

Facing budgetary pressures and depressed revenue forecasts, state leaders opted to trim funding and narrow eligibility for early learning and child care resources earlier this year. Seats for state-funded preschool, known as On My Way Pre-K, have been halved while vouchers for subsidized child care have more 21,000 children on a waitlist.
One federal program, Head Start Indiana, hopes to help close the gap left by vanishing state funding, but faces its own challenges with flat federal funding. 
“We are the quietest, most successful 60-year old program in the federal government’s history,” boasted Rhett Cecil, the organization’s executive director. “… (our programs) are going to support their families and children. They’re allowing families to work or get job training or further education. And our services — that child care and early education — are free for those families.”
Just under 13,000 families in all 92 counties utilize the program, which receives roughly $181 million in federal funding annually. That budget line was briefly threatened by the Trump administration, which walked back proposed cuts in favor of flat funding — which does mean services will be lost as inflation and other costs eat into the bottom line. 
The second-term president also eliminated the federal Head Start office covering Indiana back in April — though the federal Administration for Children and Families announced it would dedicate one-time funding to Head Start locations earlier this week explicitly for nutrition, but not for other programming costs. 
Additional federal support could allow it to expand to meet the need following state cuts, leaders hope, and continue employing almost 4,000 Hoosiers.
“Let’s say, hypothetically, we get $100 million more dollars. How many more teachers and classrooms could be opened?” Cecil mused. “How many kids could we serve off that waitlist?”
 Importance of child care

Participating in and access to child care resources reaps benefits for young Hoosiers, such as better school readiness skills. Some national research has found that early education may also decrease future crime and could generate $7.30 for every one dollar invested.  
In Indiana, the shortage of child care options costs the state an estimated $4.2 billion annually, over a quarter of which is linked to annual tax revenue lost. 
The 2024 study from the Indiana Chamber of Commerce emphasized the need to free up parents, mostly women, who’ve left the workforce “as a direct result of childcare-related issues.” 
“There’s some data out there that one in four Hoosier parents leave their job over child care gaps, and it really impacts talent and workforce,” said David Ober, the chamber’s vice president of taxation and public finance. “It’s hindering economic momentum in the state and so it is a huge deal for us.” 
For the last few years, tackling the state’s child care crisis has been a top legislative priority for the organization, which represents the interests of thousands of Hoosier employers. Ober said the chamber is working to plan a child care summit later this year to identify potential solutions.
According to Brighter Futures Indiana, average full-time weekly care costs families $181 per week — with even higher prices for infants and toddlers. That doesn’t factor in type of care or quality, and prices vary by community.

Families can spend more on their young children’s care than on a college education — if it’s even available in their communities. Rather than pay the price, many Hoosier parents simply drop out of the workforce at the same time that employers are scrambling to hire talent. 
Ober highlighted recent legislative efforts to expand child care, including one that expanded a tax credit for employers directly providing their employees with child care resources. Other bills have tweaked staffing ratios and created a pilot program for so-called microcenters. 
But workforce remains a challenge, even for Head Start centers, earning its own legislative study carveout. Over 20% of Indiana’s child care workers left the field during the pandemic — a shock that “has not really fully healed,” Ober said. 
“If you ask any provider in the state, workforce is the hardest problem,” Ober said. “… How do you get educators and keep them? There’s so much more work to be done there and it’s challenging.”
Traditional market forces struggle to balance affordability for parents against costs for child care, a gap sometimes covered by government subsidies. 
But Ober insisted that “child care is infrastructure,” especially for the businesses reliant upon employees who are parents. Changing funding is “going to just exacerbate underlying problems,” he added.
“Those numbers are pretty stark,” Ober said. “And then when you add in changes at the state and the federal level, it creates new problems that we all have to come together and work on,” he concluded.

(Photo by  NIAID, National Institute of Health via Flickr | CC-BY-SA 2.0)Once again Montana is in the news for confirmed cases of West Nile Virus scattered across the state.  While no one seems to making the connection, one might credibly wonder how the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks’ approval of a new private pond every working day of the year plays into the proliferation of this disease.  And once again, no one is talking about that.
West Nile Virus is carried by Culex mosquitoes and infects both humans and livestock.  The virus has now been found in Lewis and Clark, Cascade, Sheridan, Custer, and Daniels Counties.  As reported by the Daily Montanan: “Illness caused by West Nile Virus can vary significantly in severity,” said Department of Public Health and Human Services Vectorborne Disease Epidemiologist Devon Cozart. “Although some people may not experience any symptoms at all, many people experience the onset of flu-like symptoms such as body aches and fatigue that may persist for weeks to months. Severe, neurological cases of West Nile Virus also occur every year in Montana, which may lead to death or permanent disability like blindness or paralysis. Don’t take a chance; prioritize avoiding mosquito bites whenever possible.”  
If the fact that “severe, neurological cases of West Nile Virus occur every year in Montana” caught your eye, you have good reason to be concerned since there is no vaccine or targeted medication for the virus in humans.
While the precautions issued by the Department of Public Health and Human Services suggest not getting bitten by mosquitoes is a priority, for most people, especially children, that is an impossibility for anyone spending time outdoors — which most Montanans do in summer. 
The other suggestion is to “Drain standing water around the house to prevent mosquito breeding.”  And therein lies the rub. 
While it’s fine for people to make sure there’s no standing water around their homes, the fact is mosquitoes breed in “standing water” — and that includes the proliferation of private ponds now spreading across Montana like, well, West Nile Virus. 
More than a coincidence?  
Hardly.  
Nothing says “standing water” like a pond which, unlike rivers and streams, are generally not flowing water.  Some may have an inlet, but many are now being filled with groundwater or even pumped in water and the exchange rate between inflow and outflow is very low.  Likewise, water temperatures tend to be higher than naturally flowing rivers and streams, which is why many ponds are now being stocked with warmwater species such as bass.
Although the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks produces Environmental Assessments before issuing the pond permits, suffice it to say they are generally very superficial and primarily concerned with the species of hatchery fish to be stocked in the pond.  
Even though ponds are supposed to be certified by the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to ensure they have the water rights to fill them, many of the environmental assessments lack even that basic documentation — and water rights in Montana are a hot topic right now.
With Montana’s rapidly warming climate it’s only a matter or time before we can expect to see not only more West Nile Virus, but a host of other insect-transmitted diseases spreading north. 
When considering the significant evaporative loss of ponds, the potential for human, livestock, and aquatic disease transmission, and the inevitable march of a hotter, drier climate it’s hard to find state approval of a private pond every day as prudent public policy — and one might just wonder why the state continues to do so without considering all the potential effects.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/53011360208_c743df9991_o-1024x774.jpg,,,2025-08-01 06:56:35.348329

(Photo by Karla Brizuela/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Tens of thousands of students have received financial literacy and career readiness training through a new Oklahoma City program designed to simulate real-world experience.
Since the nonprofit center launched in October, students as young as fourth grade have translated the lessons they’ve learned in the classroom to age-appropriate real-world scenarios such as how to budget or run a business.
The idea to create the specialized programs came from the realization that students lacked essential business and financial skills, said Edward Pope, regional director of Junior Achievement of Oklahoma, the group leading the effort. 
“We realized students did not have the appropriate knowledge, and so we wanted to create a nonprofit that would help students learn about business and learn how to conduct them,” Pope said.
Oklahoma lawmakers require students in grades seventh to 12th to demonstrate a “satisfactory knowledge level” of 14 financial literacy topics before they graduate. Those topics include the importance of work and budgeting, balancing a checkbook, saving and investing, and the consequences of bankruptcy.
Supporters of the program said that they developed two distinct programs designed to align with Oklahoma’s financial literacy graduation requirements and state standards. There are now two of these centers in Oklahoma. The other is located in Tulsa.

The newest center, located in northwest Oklahoma City, connects volunteers with students to teach them how to navigate real-world financial and business scenarios.
BizTown, which is designed for elementary students, teaches students how to manage a business in a simulated town.
It merges skills learned in the classroom with a visit to an imitation town where students practice the skills they’ve learned in the classroom, learn how to keep their own checkbook, read a paycheck and work a simulated job. Students take on jobs roles within storefronts sponsored by local companies.
The experience gives students a chance to earn and spend money while practicing communication and collaboration, Pope said. 
Finance Park is geared toward high school students. It focuses on personal budgeting and long-term financial planning. Students begin by choosing a career path and education level, and then they navigate adult decisions such as marriage, housing, child care and transportation.
Pope said the students progress through three or four life stages. At the end, they find out if they met their financial goals, he said.
Both pathways are free to schools across the state, and over 250 schools have arranged field trips to the center. Supporters said over 4,000 people have volunteered at the center since its launch last year. Over 80% of its funding to pay for the programming comes from several hundred corporate sponsors.
During the 2023–24 school year, Pope said an analysis of the programs show they reached 59,367 students and resulted in over 860,000 contact hours. Over 90% of program participants said the trainings either increased their confidence about joining the workforce or helped set them on a path to set financial goals.
The organization said that number grew to more than 62,000 students during the 2024-25 school year, and the organization said it worked with 270 schools in 96 districts and 1,200 teachers.
Norman teachers Wanda Dyer and Lynndi Cox, who teach at Irving Middle School, said they both incorporate the programs into their classrooms.
Dyer said the center enables her to create engaging modules by combining group activities, personal finance lessons and career exploration exercises.
“They’ve practiced balancing budgets, thinking through life decisions, and identifying career goals,” Dyer said. “By the time they go to the simulation, they’re not just guessing — they’re making informed choices.” 
She believes introducing students to the program in eighth grade helps them start thinking about careers before entering high school. 
“They can go ahead and start working and have a game plan,” she said.
Cox said some of her students didn’t even know certain jobs existed before visiting the center.
“It gives them options outside the traditional academic path and shows them how their interests can translate into careers,” she said.
Rachel Kanady, senior vice president at NFP, an Aon company, and a Junior Achievement board member, said the center’s age-specific curriculum is able to be adjusted as needed to meet the needs of students and the state.
“Our curriculum is designed to engage students at the right age level, aligning with what they’re learning in school,” she said.
Pope, the regional director, said the center hopes to grow and impact more students.
“As more schools and volunteers get involved, the hope is that even more students across the state will leave better prepared for life after graduation,” he said.

When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
State regulations
As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”










If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.

The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.
The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs look like across the country?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma schools find themselves in a challenging position, suddenly caught in the middle of the Trump administration’s push to deport illegal immigrants.
Schools have found themselves at the forefront of immigration debates before, but this feels different.
They face so many more challenges ranging from the threat of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids to decreasing attendance rates as families choose to keep their children home to avoid the trauma associated with them. The Trump administration has withheld funding for school programs, including migrant education and services for English language learners. And State Superintendent Ryan Walters’ policies, such as trying to require schools to collect data on the immigration status of students, are further destabilizing our education system.
This isn’t the first time I’ve attended OK Justice Circle’s Breaking Bread panel and group discussions. This panel has met 14 times since 2020 in order to “increase community awareness of the lived experiences of racial and ethnic minorities in Oklahoma City area.”
The latest Breaking Bread topic, which focused on the harm state and federal policies are causing to our state’s Hispanic community, was the most emotional one I’ve ever attended during the last five years.
For instance, as a panelist was leaving for the conference, a student told her that she is studying the Holocaust and could see parallels forming between that horrific event that ultimately resulted in the deaths of 6 million Jewish people and the ramping up of our country’s immigration enforcement efforts.
An elected school board member, who represents a majority Hispanic district, reported receiving death threats.
Another urban district reported seeing an alarming surge in absenteeism.
I heard stories about how students now come to school every day with their birth certificates in their backpacks just in case ICE raids their schools. I can’t remember the last time a child had to prove they were an American citizen while in school.
These raise tough questions about what schools can do to protect the students they’re entrusted to serve.
Schools cannot politicize the issues they deal with, but they can help provide “wrap-around services” like increased access to food and or solutions to housing insecurity. They can also address the physical and mental health issues their students are experiencing. And, they can refer students to nonprofit and public agencies that have support structures.
But those solutions require trust in the law and the procedures that ICE agents are required to follow. It is really difficult to trust the immigration enforcement process right now.
The Trump administration held funding for English language services. I worry that federal leaders could one day try to take it even a step further by denying access to public school to undocumented children.
That would inflict incredible hardships on families and untold amounts damage on our state’s social and economic future.
Fortunately, Rep. Arturo Alonzo-Sandoval, D-Oklahoma City, gave me some reason for hope. Over 20 anti-immigration bills were introduced to the Legislature this year, but only one became law.
Only time will tell if the majority of Oklahomans can find the courage to push back on the policies that are causing immeasurable harm to our Hispanic neighbors.
I often find myself wondering, what would it say about Oklahomans and our integrity if we did not stand up and reject today’s cruelty?

A legislative panel heard hours of public comment that mostly cautioned against prematurely changing state law to accommodate nuclear microreactor manufacturers.
The post Lawmakers table bill to allow nuclear waste storage in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Legislation that would allow nuclear microreactor manufacturers to store spent radioactive fuel in the state stalled Wednesday during a meeting of the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee.
“I think it needs some more work,” committee co-chair and Casper Republican Sen. Jim Anderson said after several hours of expert testimony and public comment. “I think we’ve got five months to work it to see if we really can change some minds in Wyoming to work this bill.”
It’s unclear whether the committee might still consider sponsoring the draft bill, “Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” during the 2026 budget session. Though some members expressed support for holding a third interim hearing, the committee didn’t commit to it.
The panel heard from approximately two dozen residents who, collectively, appeared split on the issue. But sentiment tilted toward the notion that lawmakers are simply moving too quickly to change state law to accommodate Radiant Industries, which plans to manufacture nuclear microreactors near the town of Bar Nunn and store spent fuel from the units at the facility.

“We don’t have to be the first,” Bar Nunn resident Laura Redmond told the committee, noting that Radiant would be among the earliest in the nation to mass-manufacture portable microreactors for military and commercial use around the world. “We can let other [states] make the mistakes, and we can capitalize on that.”
Will Almas of Lander, who has experience in the nuclear energy industry, said he generally believes the advancing nuclear microreactor industry is safe, along with federal oversight of waste facilities. However, “I can’t wholeheartedly endorse the project,” he said.
Radiant is scheduled to test its Kaleidos microreactor design at the Idaho National Laboratory next year, Almas noted. Lawmakers should consider waiting until after the test, he suggested, before changing the law. Meantime, he suggested officials organize a public engagement effort throughout the state — preferably hosted by a neutral third party — to help gain trust in the actual benefits and risks before determining whether Wyomingites want to welcome the industry here.
“We’re not comfortable with risks that we don’t understand and that are new,” Almas said. “I think that’s part of what’s going on here, is that [residents] just don’t know how to evaluate that risk.”
Not everyone embraced such nuance or a wait-and-evaluate attitude.

Several residents and industry proponents suggested Wyoming is in a race with other states to capitalize on what they see as a burgeoning and lucrative industry, and one that has enthusiastic backing from the Trump administration. Many others were dead-set against the industry and, in particular, storing nuclear waste near Bar Nunn or anywhere in the state.
“Why would we amend state statute for a company not in the business of storing spent fuel, knowing we are taking on all the risk and responsibility for the unforeseeable future,” Bar Nunn resident Lee-Ann Newquist said, noting there is no permanent federal repository and that any “temporary” storage in Wyoming would likely become permanent.
Bar Nunn, an industrial yet quiet community of 3,000 a few miles north of Casper, is like living in “Mayberry,” Newquist said, referring to the idyllic American small-town portrayed in The Andy Griffith Show. But the town has become polarized since Radiant’s plans were announced.
“Now, many of us pass each other without eye contact or even acknowledgement, and any mention of ‘nuclear’ is like pouring gasoline on a fire,” Newquist said, adding that opponents of the proposal are often ridiculed. “We’re continually belittled, told our emotions are notwithstanding, that we’re fear-mongering and stupid.”
Rush to nuclear?
The draft bill is the third legislative attempt within a year to add exceptions to Wyoming’s decades-long ban on storing nuclear fuel waste. 
A similar piece of legislation, Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” was defeated during this year’s legislative session. Lawmakers also rejected House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” earlier this year, which would have opened Wyoming’s doors to decades of nuclear waste that’s been accumulating at the nation’s nuclear power plants.

Lawmakers have already made one exception to the state’s ban on nuclear waste storage, however. 
House Bill 131, “Nuclear power generation and storage-amendments,” was passed in 2022 to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant being built near Kemmerer. That exception allows nuclear power plants operating in the state to “temporarily” store their own radioactive waste. But it doesn’t allow waste from nuclear power plants outside the state.
Skeptics of expanding waste storage exemptions to nuclear microreactor manufacturers note that it’s a significant departure from storing nuclear waste at TerraPower’s Natrium plant. Specifically, Radiant’s business model is to ship its 1-megawatt Kaleidos microreactors to clients all over the nation and the world, according to the company. All the units would eventually be shipped back to Radiant’s manufacturing campus near Bar Nunn for refueling and redeployment, vastly increasing the chances of an accident en route, many worry.
Several times during the hearing, residents questioned whether elected officials — state, local and federal — are actually listening to their concerns. Many were particularly frustrated at Wednesday’s hearing.
Dozens of residents showed up by 9:30 a.m., anticipating the beginning of the nuclear waste discussion on the agenda. But the committee didn’t get to public comment until late in the afternoon, and when it did, Chairman Anderson wanted to hear from other state-elected officials first, drawing ire from committee member and Cheyenne Republican Sen. Tara Nethercott.
“This is a new practice of the Wyoming Legislature to allow legislators to dominate the conversation from ‘We the people,'” Nethercott said. “The purpose of the public meeting is to hear from you [addressing the audience], because I can hear from my colleagues all the time. So I just want to caution us from pontificating a little too much about our opinions on the topic, and rather hear from those that don’t have access to us as frequently in this public forum.”

The streaks of light and shadow that often accompany Equality State sunrises and sunsets have a name — crepuscular rays.
The post Wyoming’s twilight highlights appeared first on WyoFile .","The streaks of light and shadow that often accompany Wyoming sunrises and sunsets have a name — crepuscular rays.
Stemming from the Latin “crepusculum,” meaning twilight, the sunbeams can appear at any time of day, but are most noticeable as the sky changes at dawn or dusk, as photographed on Tuesday evening in Laramie. 
Sunlight shooting through gaps in clouds or other features of the horizon causes the optical phenomenon, while tiny particles like dust, water vapor or pollen, suspended in the air, scatter the light, making it visible to our eyes. 
Though the beams appear to fan outward from the sun, crepuscular rays are parallel. It’s similar to how lines on a highway or railroad tracks appear to narrow in the distance. 
The next time you spot crepuscular rays, turn your back to the sunset for a chance to see a more elusive phenomenon. Though less vibrant, anticrepuscular rays appear in the opposite direction of the sun and can give the effect of the horizon being cut in half, visible in the photo below.

Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls) and Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) said in a cosponsorship memo that[...],"A health care provider bandages a child after giving a vaccination shot. (Photo by Scott Housely/CDC)A pair of Wisconsin Republicans want to increase awareness of the state’s vaccine exemptions by requiring waiver forms be given to parents with the health forms they receive from schools and child care center providers. 
Coauthors of the bill Rep. Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls) and Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) said in a cosponsorship memo that there is a “lack of transparency” around the exemptions that “can create confusion and unnecessary barriers for parents” and “increase administrative burden on schools when immunization documentation is incomplete or delayed.” 
Wisconsin law requires children in elementary, middle, junior or senior high school, a child care center, or a nursery school to get vaccinated for various diseases based on their grade or age. The vaccine and booster schedule covers mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis and tetanus. 
Wisconsin allows parents to get the requirement waived if they submit a written statement objecting for reasons including health, religious or personal conviction. 
Lawmakers noted that the bill would not change current requirements for vaccines. The bill would require schools, child care centers and nursery schools to create a process to present a vaccine waiver form with each health-related form it requires before a student can be enrolled.
“Many parents are unaware of this right or are unclear about how to obtain that waiver and feel pressured to make medical decisions for their children that they otherwise would not have,” Brill said in a statement. “This bill ensures that schools make parents aware of the rights already afforded them by Wisconsin law and include information about the waiver from the vaccine requirement and a procedure for presenting it in any required pre-enrollment health-related forms.”
The proposal comes as Wisconsin’s vaccination rates have not caught up with pre-pandemic levels. According to a 2024 U.S. Centers for Disease Control report, Wisconsin is falling behind other states in childhood immunizations for illnesses including polio, pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus, and measles, mumps and rubella. 
The decline in vaccine rates is partially to blame for diseases, including measles and pertussis, increasing across the country, according to health officials. 
According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, 86.4% of students met the minimum immunization requirements during the 2024-25 school year — a 2.8 percentage-point decrease from the prior year. The agency also reports that 6.7% of students had a waiver for one or more immunizations, representing a 0.6 percentage-point increase from last year, though the number of students waiving all vaccines fell to 1.3%. 
Amid falling rates, DHS officials have ramped up efforts to encourage vaccinations to help improve effectiveness. 
Wisconsin has one of the lowest measles vaccination rates in the country, with only Alaska falling below it. One dose of the MMR vaccine, which fights measles, provides approximately 93% protection, while two doses are about 97% effective.
As measles vaccine rates have fallen, cases of the highly contagious disease have hit the highest level in 33 years, according to the CDC with 1,288 cases this year. More than 150 people have been hospitalized from measles, and three people have died this year. No cases have been reported in Wisconsin so far, but its neighboring states, including Illinois and Minnesota, have had cases.
The lawmakers’ efforts to increase awareness of vaccine exceptions comes amid a national wave of skepticism to vaccination, including from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is a leading and prominent vaccine skeptic and was appointed by President Donald Trump this year. 
Brill thanked Kennedy for his work on his “Make America Health Again” agenda in her statement about the bill.
Cabral-Guevara, a board certified family nurse practitioner, has supported legislation that would loosen vaccine requirements before including a 2024 bill that would have allowed immunization exemptions at higher education institutions without documentation. 
The bill passed the Senate and Assembly, but was vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers, who said in a veto message that he objected to “the Wisconsin State Legislature’s efforts to micromanage decisions to respond to public health incidents and restrict existing tools available to higher education institutions to keep students, faculty, staff safe and healthy on their campuses.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)With little discussion, Tennessee’s Building Commission approved a no-cost lease Thursday for state property near the Capitol for Elon Musk’s Boring Company to launch its tunneling project.
A few logistical questions are: Where are they going first, what about the potential environmental impact and who owns all the rock? Will the state give up its mineral rights?
Critics of the project also want to know why the state is giving away property – on top and under the ground – to a billionaire without a public vetting? 
“Why are we rushing this process? What’s the hurry? Why don’t we have an impact study? Because we’re dealing with a billionaire?” D.J. Porter asked the group of state officials.
Despite opposition from a packed room, the Building Commission’s Executive Subcommittee approved the lease of a parking lot on nearly an acre deemed to be surplus property at 637 Rosa Parks Blvd., just down the hill on the southwest side of the State Capitol, where the boring machine could start digging. 
Are they headed next to the Capitol and Music City Center, up and down Broadway and then to the airport? The plan calls for using zero-emissions electric vehicles to ferry people from one station to another, a plan that critics said will only help Musk’s companies transport tourists, not Nashvillians.
Department of General Services Commissioner Jeff Holmes told the panel the state secured a line of credit from Boring in case it abandons the tunneling project. The company also obtained a license to work at the parking lot where it already put up a construction fence.

State officials are playing it close to the vest, though the lease of the Rosa Parks property makes it pretty clear where the tunnel could start. After all, they’ve got to dig a hole somewhere to go underground.
Committee members didn’t make themselves available for questions or declined to talk to reporters after Thursday’s meeting.
Everything’s running through Gov. Lee, who called it the “coolest” project he’s introduced in his two terms.
The Governor’s Office this week announced the start of a public process to “evaluate potential routes, engage stakeholders and finalize plans for the project’s first 10-mile phase.” With that in mind, it doesn’t appear the first part of the “Music City Loop” will start at the convention center south of Broad and go to the airport, only that it will connect those at some point with an eight-minute transit time using underground tunnels beneath state-owned roads.
State Sen. Becky Massey told the Lookout this week the state will sign a long-term lease with the Boring Company, enabling it to build the tunnel on or under state right of way.
What happens with the extracted rock remains to be seen, since the state holds mineral rights to everything under its above-ground right of way, to the center of the Earth. Will the state require Boring to pay for the limestone it removes, or will it give up those rights as part of a long-term lease? Will the state use the rock to build roads? 
Considering this is being called a public-private partnership, what is the state’s role, other than providing the land, and how does it benefit? Few answers are being supplied as this deal steams down the track. 
Education leader zaps feds

Tennessee’s education commissioner inadvertently gigged the Trump administration’s handling of federal funds for public education this week, saying it’s still getting its “sea legs.”
The U.S. Department of Education initially withheld billions of dollars from states but then reversed course and released the money, giving states some modicum of relief as students return to school in August.
Asked this week if she would like to see more consistent policy from the federal level, Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds told reporters the state hasn’t gone through a full year yet with the Trump Administration but she expects improvement.
“I think they’re getting their sea legs underneath them and trying to figure out all the landscape. I think once the appointees get confirmed, I think there’ll be a lot more consistency,” Reynolds said. “So I think that’s kind of been a little bit of a holdup. Get the people in there that understand public education and can help support states. Not that they don’t support public education. … That kind of came out wrong.”
We know what she means, since that’s what many people are thinking but afraid to say out loud.
Reynolds spoke to reporters after a meeting of the legislature’s Federal Education Deregulation Cooperation Task Force, possibly one of the longest committee names in state history, which is supposed to figure out how to handle a major reduction.
Tennessee receives $1.3 billion in education funding from the federal government, mainly for nutrition, disadvantaged students, disabled children, extended learning, teacher instruction, career and technical education, English language learnings and rural and low-income schools.
Tennessee’s Republican leaders have wanted to eliminate the federal education department for years. Reynolds and her staff complained in Tuesday’s hearing that the department is inundated with paperwork to satisfy the feds.
Reynolds told lawmakers they’d like to receive the federal money in a block grant, or lump sum, and disburse it to their liking. Yet the department wouldn’t cut staff, only repurpose their work.
Even though many lawmakers have spent months and years blasting the U.S. Education Department, Republican state Sen. Bill Powers of Clarksville told the group he assumed the release of funds was a “breath of fresh air across the state of Tennessee. … It was for my district.”
Later, Powers said the federal Education Department is in “a state of flux,” but he added, “when the edict comes down from on high,” the state is prepared to handle it.
It’s still unclear, though, whether Tennessee would be able to handle the shortfall if the feds pull back the money, possibly next year.  
Asked that question by committee Chair Dawn White of Murfreesboro, education officials said they would have to “get back with you.”
Working on teacher license
Commissioner Reynolds admitted to reporters this week she still doesn’t hold a teacher license, even though state law requires the state’s education leader to be qualified to teach at the highest grade over which she has authority.
“I work on it on weekends, and I do my best,” Reynolds said.
Tennessee education commissioner remains under the microscope

The department’s new spokesperson, Maggie Hannan cut off the conversation, more or less ending Reynolds’ first interview with Capitol press corps members in, well, maybe ever.
Following Reynolds’ appointment by Gov. Lee, Democrats said in early 2024 she was unqualified to hold the job because she wasn’t licensed to teach in K-12 here.
Reynolds enrolled in a teacher education program at UT-Martin and received a tuition waiver before she had been with the state department the required six months, after signing an affidavit stating she was eligible for the money. Reynolds reportedly repaid the money after questions arose.
Reynolds pushed the governor’s private-school vouchers, a new program that gives $7,000 to 20,000 students in its first year to enroll in private schools, regardless of whether they attended public or private schools the previous year.
After going head-to-head in 2024 with critics of the proposal, Reynolds rarely, if ever, visited committee hearings this year. Lawmakers narrowly passed the $146 million program, and the Education Department is continuing to enroll applicants until July 31, less than a week before school starts.
Likewise, Reynolds is running out of time to earn her teaching license. Gov. Lee’s second term will run out in early 2027. Will she get the license before then, or is this an exercise in futility?
Public at last
The Registry of Election Finance released a document this week showing the Professional Board of Responsibility dismissed a complaint against Nashville attorney Cynthia Sherwood. The release came nearly two weeks after the Lookout requested a copy of the letter.
Bill Young, leader of the Registry, which oversees the state’s campaign finances, filed the complaint last fall after Sherwood sent a private investigator to his home to question him. Young declined to speak to the PI because Sherwood’s client, Cade Cothren, has pending cases before the Registry. Young is represented by staff counsel and the state Attorney General’s Office in the case.
Tennessee board clears attorney in ethics complaint from state campaign finance watchdog

Registry board members said the incident was an ethical violation and voted to send a complaint to the Board of Professional Responsibility.
In early July, the board sent the letter to Young stating, “Our inquiry has not revealed sufficient evidence to proceed against the attorney (Sherwood) for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.” Dismissal of the case was approved and set to become final in 30 days, absent a written appeal.
During the Registry board’s July meeting, the dismissal letter was considered closed to the public. Registry members asked the AG’s Office for an opinion on whether it should be a public record. 
Sherwood later provided a copy of a letter she received on the case’s dismissal to the Lookout.
By the time the board meets again in September, the question could be moot. But the Registry board probably won’t be happy with the case’s dismissal.
Not so tough
A Nashville Criminal Court judge ordered former state Rep. Jeremy Durham to serve seven days in jail for DUI after suspending most of a year-long sentence, the Tennessee Journal reported.
The attorney for Durham, a Franklin Republican, requested a lighter penalty that would allow him to serve 48 hours at a Rutherford County facility where offenders can pay for better digs than jail.

The former rep hit a car just off Broadway in Nashville late one night, then tried to run from police. He was charged with felony reckless endangerment, DUI, resisting arrest and unlawful use of drug paraphernalia.
Apparently, he tried to get out of the arrest that night by telling police he was an attorney and former legislator. That didn’t help his cause.
Judge Jennifer Smith called the situation “egregious” and questioned whether Durham appreciated the “gravity of it,” according to the report.
Durham must have failed to mention he was expelled from the House in 2016 for not-so-exemplary behavior toward more than 20 women who worked in the legislature. But who’s counting?

A new analysis found New Jersey has one of the nation’s largest unfunded liabilities for state employee pension plans. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.
“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”

For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
 State regulations

As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.

The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs look like across the country?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

However the board ultimately deadlocked on the summary language, unable to find a middle ground on language detailing how the amendment would impact small business owners and whether the proposal can guarantee funds are used for specific investments into schools. 
While the board previously approved language for the Invest in MI Kids initiative at its June 27 meeting, procedural issues resulted in the board rescinding its approval, sending the initiative back to the beginning of the process. 
The initial summary presented to the board on Thursday used the same language they approved in June. However, the board was split with Vice Chair Mary Ellen Gurewitz and Canvasser Heather Cummings, both Democrats, in support of reapproving the previous language, while Board Chair Richard Houskamp and Canvasser Paul Cordes argued they should alter the summary in light of Thursday’s testimony. 
“We approved the summary. And now everybody who doesn’t like the summary wants, as Ms. Cummings says, they want a second bite at the apple, and I don’t think we should give it to them,” Gurewitz said.

The Invest in MI Kids coalition is proposing a 5% “fair share surcharge”on individual filers making more than $500,000 and over $1 million for joint filers, with the coalition arguing the effort would address $4 billion to $5 billion of underfunding Michigan schools. 
However, business groups from throughout the state argued before the board that the effort would amount to a graduated income tax and would bring harm to small businesses owners.
“Many small businesses are organized as S corps, LLCs, partnerships and sole proprietors, which means they claim business income on their individual income tax. And this proposal narrows in on that specifically,” said Kelli Saunders, vice president of policy and engagement for the Small Business Association of Michigan. “The $500,000- $1 million reportings are not their take home pay. Small business owners must leave earnings in the business for hiring, expanding salary and benefit packages, cost increases, capital expenditures and normal increases in day to day operations to keep the doors open.” 
Anne Kuhnen, Kids Count policy director for the Michigan League for Public Policy, said the proposal would raise over $1.5 billion in revenue to help educate the future workforce, emphasizing that the tax would be applied to individuals, not businesses.
“The surcharge applies to all income an individual taxpayer earns from salaries, gambling or lottery winnings, investments, capital gains, spousal incomes and businesses, as well as other eligible sources. But it is not a business tax.…This surcharge also does not enact a graduated income tax. Instead, it proposes a new separate tax at a simple flat rate,” Kuhnen said.

While the amendment would require money from the additional tax go toward classrooms in local school districts, including funding for career and technical education, attracting and retaining high-quality educators and reducing class sizes, Brian Shoaf, vice president of Public Policy and business advocacy at the Detroit Regional Chamber, argued the Legislature and the governor have the final say over how these funds are spent. 
State Rep. Regina Weiss (D-Oak Park) disagreed, offering her opinion as a lawmaker and former chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on School Aid and Education that the Legislature could not spend that money for any other purpose than what is outlined in the amendment language.
In hopes of breaking the deadlock, Steve Liedel, attorney for Invest in MI Kids, offered to meet with Michigan Director of Elections Jonathan Brater and Eric Doster, attorney for Small Business for Better Michigan, which is opposing the effort, with Brater drafting a new summary based on the conversation. 
Not included in the conversation was Daniel Ziegler, an attorney representing the opposing Coalition to Stop the Business and Family Tax Hike, who objected to his exclusion.  
However, the new proposal language, and the subsequent tweaks made to the summary were not enough to bring the board into agreement. With Gurewitz bringing a vote to approve the revised petition summary, the board voted on  party lines, failing to approve the language.
However, the board did vote to approve the form of the constitutional amendment. With that approval, Molly Sweeney, organizing director of 482Forward, a member of the ballot proposal coalition, said the plan is to move forward and distribute the petitions using the language previously approved by the board and presented by Brater earlier in the meeting. 
“We’re going to make sure it gets through and we believe the law’s on our side. We have an approved petition, we have an approved form, and we’re ready to go,” Sweeney said. 
While petitioners can ask the director of elections to prepare a summary to be approved or rejected by the board, they are not required to use that summary. However, a summary approved by the Board cannot be challenged on the grounds that it is misleading or deceptive.
Regardless, Liedel dismissed any concerns that the effort would not be permitted to move forward under the previously approved summary. 
In order to make the ballot in 2026, Invest MI Kids will need to gather 446,198 signatures within 180 days to be placed on the statewide ballot in the 2026 election.
However, Houskamp told reporters that if the matter does make the ballot, the next battle over this petition will likely involve the ballot summary language. 
In addition to arguing the proposal cannot truly require the Legislature to spend funds raised by the amendment in specific ways and that the matter amounts to a graduated income tax, Houskamp also took issue with placing tax policy directly into the Michigan Constitution, where it cannot easily be altered. 
“The 1,000-word summary doesn’t mean anything at the end of the day. The trouble is, if you catch somebody standing in front of the library and you read that 100-word summary, that makes it sound like this is a great deal. You flip it over and read the petition, and you really read it, well, yeah, it’s got a couple flies in it. And I think that those little issues with that petition are not little issues. I think they’re major issues,” Houskamp said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4189-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 06:56:35.348329

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.
In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

But her claim — that the attorney general’s office was the first in the country to file a state lawsuit against opioid manufacturers for the crisis — isn’t true. 
A June 2001 West Virginia case filed against Purdue Pharma and Abbott Laboratories predated the lawsuit she’s been referring to — a December 2015 suit filed by the office of Fitch’s Democratic predecessor, Jim Hood, against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and other companies that made opioid pills. 
Fitch has been making the claim about her office since at least 2021, touting the agency’s role in addressing overdose deaths that followed drug companies misrepresenting the danger and addictiveness of opioid painkillers.

Fitch, a Republican, has used the claim to ask local governments to join the lawsuits as plaintiffs and to advertise her work to secure more dollars for the state. 
The West Virginia case, which ended in 2004 with a $10 million settlement, is cited by archivists as the first lawsuit against opioid manufacturers for their roles in the 21st century addiction epidemic. 
Kate Tasker, director of the University of California San Francisco library maintaining lawsuit records related to the crisis, said the West Virginia case is the first one her library knows about. 
When Mississippi Today reached out to Fitch’s office about the miscategorization, spokesperson MaryAsa Lee said it was the case’s unique approach that set it apart from previous lawsuits.

“Mississippi’s lawsuit – the first to sue 16 opioid manufacturers – was the first of its kind, and within 3 years, 32 other states followed our model, which ultimately brought the injunctive and monetary relief that is helping us recover from the opioid epidemic,” Lee wrote in an email. 
She did not respond to a follow up question asking how this lawsuit was the first of its kind. California filed one against nine opioid manufacturers for their roles in the overdose crisis a year earlier than Mississippi’s lawsuit.
Tasker said she was not aware of the 2015 Mississippi case. It does not appear in scholarly articles that trace timelines of prescription opioid-related litigation.
John Davidson, a Ridgeland lawyer who worked on the 2015 Mississippi case and has continued to assist Fitch’s office on opioid cases, did not respond to phone and email inquiries about that lawsuit. The website of his law firm, Davidson PLLC, says it filed “the FIRST opioid case in the country on behalf of a state government.”
William Thompson, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, was raised in that state’s southern coalfields — a region of Appalachia that, by many metrics, suffered more harm from the overdose crisis than anywhere in the country. He remembers people he grew up with who had the potential to become doctors, lawyers, engineers or teachers, but were never able to escape addiction.

Thompson said West Virginia’s 2001 lawsuit and a series of cases against opioid distributing companies were filed out of necessity, as the public health crisis was taking over the state. He said some of the settlement dollars from the first case were used to help start a southern West Virginia court that connects people struggling with addiction to treatment, a program he oversaw as a circuit court judge. 
“It’s sad when you see your home community devastated by opioids, and that it has to be the laboratory for some type of solution to the problem,” Thompson said. 
He said he welcomes any elected officials, in Mississippi or elsewhere, using their positions to combat the calamity that has claimed more than a million lives. From new drugs of concern to diminishing federal mental health investments, the crisis is changing in ways that require states to think of innovative solutions. 
“But this has been a problem,” Thompson said. “And this is something that the courts have tried to fix since at least 2001.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/31114854/3X0A0139.jpg,,,2025-08-01 06:56:35.348329

Penny Schwinn, in line to serve as second in command of the U.S. Department of Education, has withdrawn from the nomination, Education Secretary Linda McMahon announced Thursday.
Instead, the former Tennessee education commissioner will take on a different role for the department.
“I am grateful to Dr. Schwinn for her commitment to serving students, families, and educators across the nation,” McMahon said in a statement. “Penny is a brilliant education mind and I look forward to continuing working with her as my chief strategist to make education great again.”
Schwinn, in a statement, said she gave the decision “thoughtful consideration” and said she will  “remain committed to protecting kids, raising achievement and expanding opportunity  —  my lifelong mission and north star.”
Considered a champion for improving reading outcomes and high-dosage tutoring, Schwinn was among President Donald Trump’s early picks for department posts. Many perceived her as a more bipartisan choice than others joining the administration, but among Tennessee conservatives, many who felt she was too liberal, opposition to her nomination was strong.
The timing of Schwinn’s withdrawal couldn’t be worse, according to some conservatives.
“Her decision to remove herself from consideration to become deputy secretary hurts students, educators, and the Trump administration,” said Jim Blew, co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute, a think tank. “Secretary McMahon has been charged by Congress and the president with huge tasks under the One Big Beautiful Bill and several urgent executive orders.”
As head of the Education Department, McMahon is striving to turn more authority over education to the states. It’s now unclear who will step into the deputy position and take the lead on the state’s requests for more flexibility over education funding. At least two states, Iowa and Oklahoma, have already submitted requests for block grants, and Indiana is currently gathering comments from the public in preparation for a similar proposal. Kirsten Baesler, North Dakota’s long-time education chief, is currently awaiting confirmation to be assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education at the department. In February, she joined 11 other GOP chiefs in asking McMahon for greater freedom to direct education funds toward state-level needs.
Controversies and questions over Schwinn’s conservative qualifications have followed her for years. Far-right groups, including Moms for Liberty, said her past support for equity initiatives, like hiring more teachers of color, was evidence that she was not a good fit for an administration determined to eliminate such programs. Others remained angry over Schwinn’s pandemic-era plan to conduct “well-being” home visits. Even though she scrapped the plan, parents and members of the legislature considered it an example of government overreach.
More recently, Steve Gill, a conservative commentator in Tennessee, reported that while she was deputy superintendent of the Texas Education Agency, Schwinn recommended individuals who advocate for comprehensive sex education, including abortion rights, to advise the state on health curriculum.
Gill told The 74 he shared his TriStar Daily article about her stance on these issues with Tennessee Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, as well as the state’s congressional delegation. Blackburn, who is expected to run for governor next year, was considered a possible no vote for Schwinn.
According to Gill, Blackburn’s office “has been working tirelessly behind the scenes with the White House, Secretary Linda McMahon and Majority Leader [John] Thune to block the confirmation.”
But Madi Biedermann, spokeswoman for the department, said the agency “strongly disagrees with that characterization.”

Blew said it’s unfortunate that politics got in the way, noting that Schwinn’s experience in both blue and red states would have brought valuable expertise to the Ed Department role. In addition to her jobs in Tennessee and Texas, Schwinn founded a charter school in Sacramento and also served in the Delaware Department of Education.
“It’s sad that a handful of demagogues are standing in the way of giving Secretary McMahon the team she needs to succeed,” he said.
Others praised Schwinn’s record of prioritizing the science of reading in Tennessee schools and directing COVID relief funds toward tutoring.
“This is a setback for all who want to see Washington slashing red tape, advancing literacy and fighting for common sense values,” said Rick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
For some critics, Schwinn’s business ventures since leaving the top spot in Tennessee two years ago raised questions as she waited to appear before the Senate education committee.
In June, a day ahead of her joint hearing with three other nominees, The 74 reported that shortly after Trump tapped her for the job, she registered a new education consulting business in Florida, New Horizon BluePrint Group, with a longtime colleague. Before Schwinn filed ethics paperwork with the federal government, her sister replaced her as a manager on the business.
When a reporter from The 74 asked questions about the new project, Donald Fennoy, her colleague and a former superintendent of the Palm Beach County School District, dissolved the business.
Ethics experts say candidates for an administration post often distance themselves from new business entanglements to avoid any appearance of a conflict, but Schwinn has faced accusations of poor judgment before.
While she was in Texas, the state agency signed a $4.4 million no-bid contract in 2017 with a software company where she had a “professional relationship” with a subcontractor, according to a state audit. And in Tennessee, the education agency made an $8 million deal in 2021 with TNTP, a teacher training organization where her husband Paul Schwinn was employed at the time. Lawmakers considered the deal a “huge conflict.”
“Ethics was a crucial concern,” said J.C. Bowman, executive director and CEO of Professional Educators of Tennessee, a non-union organization. He was among those who sent letters to the Senate, asking them to remove her from consideration. “Her personal business interests and possible conflicts could potentially influence educational decisions in ways that many found difficult to overlook.”
Clarification: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the role Penny Schwinn will take on in lieu of serving as the deputy education secretary. Schwinn will be taking on an advisory role at the Education Department.

A federal appeals panel in Boston posed this very question to the Rhode Island Supreme Court in February 2024 while considering the constitutionality of a law halting competing truck dealerships from operating within 20 miles without giving notice to the state.
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals finally heard back with an answer Tuesday: Yes, Rhode Island’s law does reach across the state line.
“We take judicial notice of the fact that the state of Rhode Island is only 37 miles wide,” Rhode Island State Supreme Court Associate Justice Melissa A. Long wrote in the court’s July 29 opinion. “Given the state’s size, a circle with a radius of 20 miles will always encompass an area outside the state.”
The question over the reach of Rhode Island’s dealer law is at the center of a legal dispute that began in 2019 after Daimler Trucks North America authorized Advantage Truck Group to sell Freightliner-brand trucks at its dealership on Route 44 in Raynham, Massachusetts. 
Advantage Truck is 18 miles from Rhode Island Truck Center in East Providence, which was authorized by Daimler to sell the same brand in 2016.
In 2022, Rhode Island Truck Center filed a protest petition against Daimler before the Rhode Island Motor Vehicle Dealers License and Hearing Board, a board created under the state’s dealer law to hear disputes between manufacturers and dealers. The five-member panel ultimately dismissed the case during the meeting held June 1, 2022, “due to a lack of jurisdiction.”
“This board lacks the authority to apply the provisions of the Rhode Island dealer law in an extraterritorial manner and therefore cannot prohibit respondent from establishing or moving a dealership outside the boundaries of this state,” wrote then-Chairman James Botvin.
The board had cited a 1994 case in which a Massachusetts-based Nissan dealership protested the establishment of a competitor in Rhode Island, only for the petition to be dropped on the grounds that out-of-state dealers lacked standing to protest under its dealer law.
Rhode Island Truck Center appealed the board’s dismissal in Providence County Superior Court, which Daimler then had moved to the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island where Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ruled in favor of Daimler on Oct. 24, 2022.
McConnell ruled that Rhode Island’s law violated the U.S. Constitution’s Dormant Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from engaging in protectionist practices against other states.










We take judicial notice of the fact that the state of Rhode Island is only 37 miles wide. Given the state’s size, a circle with a radius of 20 miles will always encompass an area outside the state. 


– Rhode Island State Supreme Court Associate Justice Melissa A. Long


Rhode Island Truck Center appealed to the 1st Circuit Court in Boston, which submitted a “certified question” to the Rhode Island Supreme Court to define the state’s dealer law. It’s a process that doesn’t get used too often, Roger Williams University School of Law professor Michael Yelnosky said in an interview. 
The last time the Rhode Island Supreme Court answered a certified question was in 2021 over the definition of “civil action” under the state’s insurance law.
For a federal court to certify a question, Yelnosky said two things are required: First, the case must hinge on an essential question of state law. Second, the state courts should not yet have answered that question in any prior cases.
When a question is certified, Yelnosky said, it’s done under the legal doctrine of “constitutional avoidance” — a way for the federal court to resolve a case without relying on constitutional grounds.
“A constitutional question does go away if the court had said it only applies in Rhode Island,” he said. 
But Long’s answer now means the federal appeals court must decide on the constitutionality of Rhode Island’s dealer law. 
“As a general matter, state A can’t control the matters of state B,” Yelnosky said. “That’s a violation of state B’s sovereignty.”
Andrew Johnson, head of communications for Daimler North America, based in Portland, Oregon, declined to comment on the case.
“We don’t comment on pending litigation,” he said.
Joe Travers, Rhode Island Truck Center’s director of operations, called the state Supreme Court’s answer to the certified question “a big win” for the company, which employs 50 people. 
“It’s definitely been an impact on business,” he said of having a competitor so close to the truck center. “I’m not sure how equitable it is for us. When you look at all the things impacting economic conditions right now, does that justify having that kind of saturation?
But Travers said the dealership has managed to maintain its regular customers including the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, along with municipalities like Pawtucket, Warwick, and Warren. Rhode Island Truck Center also holds accounts for numerous oil companies in the area, Gold Medal Bakery in Fall River, Massachusetts, and the National Lumber Company in Mansfield, Massachusetts.
“We have a pretty diverse customer base,” he said.
Not mentioned in any of the legal filings is how Massachusetts’ own dealer law defines “relevant market area” — which is set at an 8-mile radius between competing franchises within Bristol County.
But Yelnosky said the Massachusetts limit is irrelevant to the federal appeals court’s proceedings since its focus is squarely on Rhode Island’s law.
Still, he said he found it “cute” to see Rhode Island’s small size noted in the state Supreme Court’s opinion.
“We don’t think about state lines here as much as people do in other parts of the country,” Yelnosky said. “You can drive in and out of two or three states in the matter of a couple hours here.”

On Monday, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals handed another loss to voting rights advocates in Arkansas and the other states in the 8th Circuit by continuing to erode the power of the Voting Rights Act, or VRA, a 60-year-old cornerstone of federal civil rights law.
The U.S. Supreme Court is now considering whether to take up a different VRA case from North Dakota, also part of the conservative 8th Circuit. If it does, the stakes will be high.
There’s some reason to think a majority of the justices might disagree with the 8th Circuit’s restrictive, precedent-defying interpretation of the VRA — which was outlined in 2022 with a different case out of Arkansas — thus restoring Arkansas voting advocates’ ability to challenge allegedly racially discriminatory practices under the civil rights law. But if the Supreme Court sides with the 8th Circuit, such VRA lawsuits could become non-starters everywhere in the country.




The Monday ruling from the 8th Circuit was about an Arkansas law that dates back to 2009, under Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe. The law places limits on how many voters a particular individual can assist at the polls in the name of fraud prevention; it makes it illegal for a single person to help more than six voters cast a ballot. That’s been a problem for the immigrant advocacy group Arkansas United, which says the restriction makes it unnecessarily hard for translators to assist voters who aren’t fluent in English.




Arkansas United sued under the Voting Rights Act in 2020, and in 2022 a federal judge in Fayetteville sided with the group. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks issued an order blocking the state law, though the 8th Circuit stayed Brooks’ injunction while it heard the state’s appeal of his ruling.
On Monday, the 8th Circuit reversed Brooks’ order, but not on the merits of the case. Instead, a three-judge panel of the appellate court said Arkansas United had no standing to sue under the VRA. The law only gives the U.S. attorney general the power to bring a lawsuit, the 8th Circuit panel said.
That’s more or less the same conclusion another 8th Circuit panel reached in 2023 in a different Arkansas VRA case, that one about gerrymandering. In that case, the Arkansas NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel — represented by the ACLU of Arkansas — contended that the state’s redrawing of state legislative district lines in 2021 diluted the power of minority voters.
The federal judge in Little Rock who originally heard the NAACP case, U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky, conceded there might be some evidence of discrimination in how Arkansas Republicans drew legislative maps after the 2020 census. But, Rudofsky said, whether or not the new lines might be discriminatory was immaterial because the plaintiffs couldn’t sue in the first place. The suit was brought under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and the judge said that section doesn’t allow for a private right of action, meaning private citizens or entities do not have standing to sue. That’s despite the fact that individuals and voting-rights groups have long sued to enforce the federal law under Section 2.
The decision was a radical departure from how courts have handled VRA cases over the decades, but it went down well with the conservative 8th Circuit. The appeals court embraced the new theory put forth by Rudofsky — a Trump appointee who previously worked for the Arkansas attorney general’s office — and has applied it more broadly. The case brought by Arkansas United included a claim under a different section of the Voting Rights Act, Section 208, which protects the right of disabled voters or those with language barriers to receive assistance. The 8th Circuit’s ruling on Monday said there’s no private right of action under that section, either.



That brings us to the Voting Rights Act case out of North Dakota, memorably shorthanded as the “Turtle Mountain” case. It was brought by two Native American tribes —  the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Spirit Lake Tribe — along with three individual voters, all of whom say that state’s legislative map was redrawn in a racially discriminatory way. The plaintiffs sued, a federal judge sided with the tribes, and North Dakota appealed to the 8th Circuit.



In May, a split three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit reversed the lower court, saying again that the Voting Rights Act doesn’t allow for private plaintiffs to sue — only the federal government.
The plaintiffs went to the Supreme Court and asked it to intervene. On July 15, the high court granted their request for a temporary stay, blocking the 8th Circuit’s ruling from going into effect for the time being while the justices consider the request.
The three Supreme Court justices generally considered most right-wing, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, said they disagreed with the decision to grant the temporary stay. That means the Turtle Mountain plaintiffs — and voting rights advocates more generally — still have a chance, despite the court’s conservative slant. The temporary stay suggests that Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts are at least somewhat skeptical of the 8th Circuit’s recent rulings and the “no private right of action” interpretation of the Voting Rights Act explicated by Rudofsky.
It’s still unclear whether the court will take up the full Turtle Mountain case or not. Even if does, a decision won’t come until next year at the earliest. But there’s a bit of hope there for voting rights protections, even if it’s not much.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Supreme-Court-Guardian-of-Law.jpeg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

The state has had at least 51 flash flood warnings so far this year, its most since 2020","Gov. Wes Moore (D) inspects damage at a library in Westernport on May 15, 2025, in the wake of flooding in Western Maryland in the previous week. (Photo by Patrick Siebert/Governor's office)Severe thunderstorms across Maryland on Thursday brought torrential rainfall reaching up to 6 inches in some areas, causing thousands to lose power and requiring several water rescues in Harford County after multiple cars were trapped by rising water.
Earlier this month, dozens of others had to be rescued from trapped cars in Montgomery and Fairfax counties after torrential rainfall in the Washington, D.C., area on July 19.
And in mid-May, flooding caused by days of heavy rain led to millions of dollars in damage and emergency response costs to several Western Maryland communities.
As the heat and humidity have increased in Maryland, so too has the number of flash floods. The state has had at least 51 flash flood warnings so far this year, its most since 2020, according to the National Weather Service. Maryland had 45 warnings throughout all of 2024.
Chris Strong, the warning coordination meteorologist for the NWS Baltimore-Washington office, attributed the increase to the abnormally hot and humid conditions, especially over the past six weeks. Flash floods typically occur in the early summer months from about June to August, he said.
“We haven’t had a lot of extreme heat days where it’s been over 100 degrees, but we’ve had a lot of very warm days, and, more importantly for the flash flooding, a lot of very humid days,” Strong said.
James Hyde, manager of the Maryland Mesonet, a growing network of weather-monitoring stations across the state run through the University of Maryland, College Park, said there is a higher amount of precipitable water in the atmosphere, which he described as “if you took all the water in the air above your head” and squished it down into a cup and then measured the amount.
Normally, Hyde said, precipitable water ranges from about 1.3 to 1.4 inches during this time of year. But during the thunderstorms this summer, the amount has ranged from 1.8 to 2.3 inches, which is up to a 75% increase.










Water is one of the most powerful forces there is. In terms of direct fatalities, nothing’s a bigger weather killer than flooding is. So anytime there’s flash flood warnings in particular for your area, people’s awareness should be heightened as to what the water is doing around them.


– Chris Strong, warning coordination meteorologist, National Weather Service


The combination of high humidity and temperatures in the lower atmosphere and weak wind flow in the upper atmosphere has led to slow-moving thunderstorms producing heavy rainfall — the perfect recipe for flash flooding, Hyde said.
“They tend to sit and dump rain,” he said. “That’s when you start to get the flash flooding scenarios. The soils quickly become saturated, it goes into surface runoff, etc.”
First came drought
The increase in flooding this summer comes after a roughly two-year long period of drought in Maryland, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s restoration specialist Rob Schnabel.
A year ago, about two-thirds of the state was classified as abnormally dry, while almost a quarter was in severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. On Thursday, only 3% of the state’s land was classified as abnormally dry.
Schnabel said that as the climate changes, the state is seeing these periods of drought followed by large, sudden rainfalls.
“Once the soil is really dried out, and kind of baked somewhat with the heat temperatures, it actually has less ability for water to infiltrate into the ground,” he said. “Healthy soil is 25% air, 25% water and then the rest is solid material. But once you bake the ground and lose that water vapor in the ground, you lose that sponge effect.”
When there are these kinds of heavy rainfalls after two years of drought, he said, some of the soil “might as well be pavement.”
Another key issue, Schnabel added, is Maryland’s lack of stormwater management as continued urban development leads to more impervious surfaces, like parking lots or roadways, which can’t soak up water and instead create more runoff.
To combat the issue, communities can utilize multiple strategies such as planting more trees, which can absorb up to 13,000 gallons of water a year each, or creating rain gardens in natural drainage areas in parking lots, he said.
“We really need to focus more on water volume,” he said. “What happens on the land is going to determine the whole success of the Chesapeake Bay cleanup. So we need to do a better job of addressing water up on the land prior to it coming into our stream systems and into the bay.”
More floods, more collaboration
The increased flooding has caused damage to several communities across the state so far this year, including many in Western Maryland.
From May 12 to 14, “extreme rainfall” triggered significant flooding which inundated several communities in Garrett and Allegany counties. According to official estimates, the floods caused $15.8 million in emergency response costs and damage to local infrastructure — including 200 homes.
Last month, the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied the state’s request for emergency assistance funds.  Speaking to reporters in Westernport on Sunday, Gov. Wes Moore (D) called the denial a “political decision” by President Donald Trump (R), and criticized it as petty, partisan and punishing.
But as the state faces more and more floods, Hyde said he has “never seen more collaboration” among weather analysts, state emergency management officials and those who run the warning systems.
“People behind the scenes are watching this and paying attention,” he said. “The Mesonet takes observations every three seconds, and we’re transmitting that data every minute.”
One strategy counties are employing to combat the danger of flash flooding, Strong said, is to purchase properties that are at particular risk for flash floods so there’s less exposure to the public when one occurs.
And as the state’s weather monitoring systems improve, Strong said the goal is to increase the time between when a warning is issued and when actual flooding occurs. Currently, he said the average is about an hour before a flood occurs that a warning is sent out.
He emphasized the danger that flash floods pose, particularly for low-lying areas where water drains to.
“Water is one of the most powerful forces there is,” he said. “In terms of direct fatalities, nothing’s a bigger weather killer than flooding is. So anytime there’s flash flood warnings in particular for your area, people’s awareness should be heightened as to what the water is doing around them.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PS3_3926-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

Duke Energy can now backslide on its legally mandated carbon emissions reductions, offload a greater share of fuel costs to residential customers and charge ratepayers for financing costs of planned new power plants even if they’re never built.
On Tuesday the North Carolina House and Senate overrode Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of Senate Bill 266, “The Power Bill Reduction Act.”
Stein vetoed the measure July 2. “This summer’s record heat and soaring utility bills have shown that we need to focus on lowering electricity costs for working families—not raising them. … Additionally, this bill walks back our state’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions,” Stein wrote in his veto message.
The bill allows Duke Energy to amp up its use of natural gas while cancelling its interim carbon reduction goal of 70 percent by 2030. That benchmark, a crucial and highly lauded provision, was part of a climate law enacted by the legislature just four years ago.
The utility would still be required to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. But National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists reported in 2022 that “without dramatic action in the next couple of decades, we are unlikely to keep global warming in this century below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit compared to pre-industrial temperatures”—the threshold at which the most serious climate impacts can be mitigated.
“But the more we overshoot that threshold, the more serious and widespread the negative impacts will be,” the NOAA scientists wrote.

Our planet is on fire,” said state Rep. Pricey Harrison, a Guilford County Democrat, on the House floor Tuesday, as she pleaded with her colleagues to sustain the governor’s veto. “We have got to reduce our carbon emissions.”
The new law was introduced in March as Senate Bill 261, sponsored by Republican Sen. Paul Newton, a former Duke Energy executive. (Newton resigned shortly after introducing the bill to accept a job as vice chancellor and general counsel for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.)
At the time, Duke Energy spokesman Garrett Poorman told Inside Climate News that as North Carolina continues to experience unprecedented growth, “we’re focused on making substantial investments in our critical infrastructure to ensure reliability and keep costs as low and predictable as possible for our customers. We are supportive of policies that enable us to meet the state’s growing energy needs, including those that advance efficient and always-on baseload generation resources.”


The bill idled until early June, when its contents were cut and pasted into SB 266, which originally exempted buildings reconstructed after historic floods from floodplain requirements. Bill sponsors then rushed the measure through. Some members of the House Rules Committee had only 12 hours to review the measure before voting on it, Harrison said at the time, adding it became publicly available just 10 minutes before the committee hearing.
Bill sponsors and proponents, including Duke Energy, the N.C. Chamber, the American Petroleum Institute and the N.C. Manufacturers Alliance, have relied on an analysis by the Public Staff of the N.C. Utilities Commission to justify their claims that the measure will lower energy costs.


  Rep. Dean Arp (R-Union) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
“This bill is about one thing: saving all consumers money on electric bills,” said Rep. Dean Arp, a Republican from Union County who co-sponsored the measure.
The Public Staff estimated that by eliminating Duke’s interim carbon reductions goal, ratepayers could save $13 billion in energy costs by 2050. However, that modeling did not account for the volatility in natural gas prices, nor the escalating costs of turbines required to build the new plants.
An analysis written by three N.C. State University environmental engineering professors accounted for those increases. They estimated that removing the interim target could cost ratepayers up to $23 billion in added fuel expenses over the same time. Even moderate increases in natural gas prices would hike fuel costs to $13.7 billion if the interim target is dropped, they found.


Earlier this week, two economists from Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability reviewed that analysis and agreed with its overall findings. They additionally factored in the Trump administration’s rollbacks of incentives for renewable energy, which “are also likely to result in a grid that is more reliant on natural gas generation.”
A repeal or revision of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Final Greenhouse Gas Rule and its provisions for either carbon capture or limits on new gas units could also lead to additional demand for natural gas by utilities, according to the Duke University economists.
“This additional gas demand … may lead to higher natural gas prices in North Carolina and potentially increase volatility in gas markets,” they wrote.
Higher fuel costs won’t be apportioned equally among Duke Energy’s North Carolina customers. The new law now shifts 55 percent of fuel costs to residential customers, with 45 percent to commercial and industrial sectors. Previously, those costs were split 50-50.
The measure will also let Duke Energy charge financing costs of power plants to ratepayers before those facilities are built. Bill opponents are concerned that could saddle North Carolinians with higher electric bills if those projects are never finished.
This scenario played out in South Carolina, where ratepayers had to cover $9 billion in costs for the Summer nuclear plant, which was canceled because of higher-than-predicted costs.
After the override vote, Dan Crawford, the N.C. League of Conservation Voters’ director of governmental relations, released a statement: “Today, lawmakers chose to reward corporate greed over the people they were elected to serve. By overriding the governor’s veto, they handed Duke Energy a blank check—one that North Carolinians will be forced to pay.”
Drew Ball, Southeast campaigns director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the bill “a handout to Duke Energy that shifts billions in cost and significant risks squarely onto North Carolina families. … It pushes outdated, costly gas plants that deepen our dependence on a fragile fuel supply.”
Ball is also a commissioner for Buncombe County, an area that includes Asheville, one of the hardest-hit by Hurricane Helene. More than 40 people there died because of the storm, which a climate attribution study last year showed had more punishing rains as a result of global warming.
Opponents of SB 266 had scheduled a rally outside the legislature for late Monday afternoon. They canceled the event because the heat index was forecast to reach 115 degrees, an irony not lost on organizers.
As the House was holding its override vote mid-morning Tuesday, the heat index in Raleigh was already approaching 100—the 18th day this summer to hit this mark, according to WRAL meteorologists.

(Photo courtesy Kennedy Library)According to a new report by a state commission on banned books in Virginia schools, Hanover County Public Schools removed the book “Medical Discoveries: Medical Breakthroughs and the People Who Developed Them” from libraries sometime between July 2020 and March 2025.   
Censored, too, was a book entitled “Sexual health information for teens: health tips about sexual development,” described by its publisher as “basic consumer health information for teens about puberty, sexuality, reproductive health, contraception, and disease prevention.””
Likewise jettisoned were copies of “Encyclopedia of the Human Body,” “The Way We Work: Getting to Know the Amazing Human Body,” and “The Medical Advisor: The Complete Guide to Alternative and Conventional Treatments.”  
The conservative library review movement in Virginia’s public schools, which has galvanized during the tenure of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, purports to be about protecting parents’ rights to know what their children read. The July report by Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) put the lie to that claim. 
Book banners in schools want to dictate what students can learn in their classrooms and from their libraries, regardless of what individual parents and guardians believe. No greater violation of adults’ child-rearing choices exists than the moral arbitration right-wing extremists hope heap on them.
JLARC found that 63% of Virginia public schools removed no books from their libraries. That good news was tempered by the fact that one in three had removed at least one book. But the real bad news is that the public-school book ban movement is just getting up to speed, as holier-than-you evangelical Christians try to take over school boards across the country. We’ve seen it in Pennsylvania, Florida, and other states. As many of those types of people gain positions of power in the administration of President Donald Trump, violations of parents’ First Amendment rights by radical theocrats seem likely to accelerate.
Hanover County, which lies about 30 miles north of Richmond, serves as a cautionary tale. Hanover schools are governed by a conservative majority and the school board is appointed, not elected like most school districts in the state. The JLARC report revealed that Hanover accounted for 36% of all “book removal actions” in the state. Hanover removed 125 titles from its schools from July 2020 until March 2025, the report found.
Hanover school board referendum is an opportunity to see democracy in action

This is the last step in a progression that begins with challenging content in library books, then pulling them from shelves and requiring guardian consent to check them out, and finally, removing them from libraries entirely. 
Letting political and religious ideologues control children’s reading choices leads to censoring their exposure to prize-winning literature  and reflects obvious prejudices against books about racism and LGBTQ+ issues. It sacrifices scientific knowledge to faith and, in some cases, ignorance. Hanover proves that.  
The conservative attack on diversity, equity and inclusion – all fundamental American values – will lead to a literal whitewash of U.S. history and doesn’t serve anyone who believes that those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. 
Censorship to shape politics and culture like what is happening in Hanover often finds its natural conclusion in symbolic or actual book burnings, like those that famously fired up Hitler’s power in Germany.
Banned books in Hanover don’t just include books about gender or sexual identity. The list also includes literary classics by Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, Booker Prize winner Maragaret Atwood, and National Book Award winner Kurt Vonnegut.
For would-be book banners, a single sex scene in hundreds of pages or a suggestion of white racism now serves as justification for exclusion from a school library. 
As that continues, taboos grow. Hanover County dumped “The Freedom Writers Diary.” The book tells the story of a California teacher who taught students about the Holocaust by making them read and write about “The Diary of Anne Frank.”
School districts struggle to implement new laws on sexually explicit books

To get an idea of how far-gone Hanover is, the county Board of Supervisors removed references to school library censorship from a certificate it gave a Hanover student who won a national Girl Scout award.  Kate Lindley received a “Freedom to Read” award from the Girl Scouts for establishing a website and a series of “Banned Book Nooks” in the county where students could read books the school board had removed from libraries.
As she accepted her certificate from the Board of Supervisors, Lindley showed  more class than the governing body.
“You have shown the world that you are afraid to call something what it is, be that a banned book or a deselected one,” she told the board’s conservative majority. “Thank you for this recognition.”
What the rest of us must recognize and resist is the assault on our rights by people who, without our consent, would deprive Virginia kids of access to books like “Jesus Land: A Memoir.” A New York Times bestseller, it tells the true story of a 16-year-old white girl and her Black adopted brother trying to survive a brutal, violent fundamentalist upbringing. It could be that Hanover County banned the book because it does not cast Christian fundamentalism in the light that evangelicals want it seen.
That is the polar opposite of parents’ rights.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).High temperatures this summer have resulted in the deaths of 19 individuals and more than 1,200 Marylanders landing in the emergency room with heat-related illnesses.
That’s a five-year high in hospitalizations related to heat stress, according to updated Department of Health data published this week. It’s also the second highest number of heat-related deaths since 2021, with still 11 weeks in the annual “heat season” left to go.


Cooling centers
For information on cooling centers in all 23 Maryland counties and Baltimore City, go here.


State officials continue to urge Marylanders to keep up with heat safety measures during the remainder of the summer.
“Check in on elderly and those living alone,” was one recent social media post from the Maryland Department of Health. “Drink water and avoid caffeine, alcohol and sugary drinks. Limit time outside and stay in air-conditioned spaces.”
The data is part of weekly reporting on heat-related illnesses during the annual heat season, which runs roughly from the end of April through September.
The elderly population in the state is one of the most vulnerable groups affected by heat illness, according to state health officials, and of the 19 people who have died so far this summer, 16 were over the age of 65. They also were primarily men. Only three women have died from heat-related causes since the start of heat season.


Over the course of July, through July 26, more than 500 people had to go to the emergency room or urgent care and eight people died because of heat illnesses.
Last summer also proved to be extremely dangerous, as a total of 27 people died from heat-related illness, the highest since 2018. If trends continue, the 2025 heat season could be just as deadly.
With many high schools and colleges starting their fall semesters in August, members of the Maryland congressional delegation are trying to make sure that student athletes across the nation are protected from heat illness.
Last week, U.S. Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) reintroduced the Jordan McNair Student Athlete Heat Fatality Prevention Act to mandate that schools and colleges create emergency action plans for athletes experiencing heat illness.
The legislation is named after a freshman football player with the University of Maryland who in 2018 collapsed during practice and died from heat stroke symptoms days later.
U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) has filed similar legislation in the House of Representatives, with U.S. Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) and U.S. Rep. Johnny Olszewski (D-2nd) as co-sponsors, among others.
Mfume and Van Hollen have led previous efforts to pass the Jordan McNair act.
“It is long past time that we pass the  Jordan McNair Student Athlete Heat Fatality Prevention Act and finally ensure student athletes are protected, and college athletic programs implement heat illness emergency action plans and coordinate with local emergency responders,” Alsobrooks said in a written statement last week. “Jordan McNair would be 26 today. We must honor his memory by getting this legislation passed.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2024_march28_baltimore-newsletter-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

(Photo courtesy WVMR)A radio cooperative serving Pocahontas County in West Virginia and two neighboring Virginia communities expects to lose more than half its annual budget after Congress passed a bill rescinding $1.1 billion previously approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Allegheny Mountain Radio comprises WVMR in Dunmore, West Virginia, WVLS in Monterey, Virginia, and WCHG in Hot Springs, Virginia. The stations feature hyperlocal programming including news and entertainment, funeral and lost pets notices, weather, school closings and emergency alerts, station manager Scott Smith said.
The cooperative typically relied on federal funding for 60 to 65% of its annual budget, Smith said. They employ six full time and five part-time workers. Smith said the cooperative won’t make drastic cuts like layoffs or closing stations immediately. They’ll rely on reserve funds for now and look for ways to cut costs. They’ll also try to beef up support from underwriting, private donations and other funding opportunities, he said.

“This will be kind of a transition year, if you will, to where we see how things work without our federal money,” Smith said. “We’ll try to find other sources of income, and we’ll try to find sources we can save money at. But that’s also in the context of continuing on the way we are and what we do.”
While the Corporation for Public Broadcasting funded about 1% of NPR’s budget and 16% of PBS’s budget, Allegheny Mountain Radio is one of hundreds of small stations around the country who relied more heavily on the federal funding. CPB funding made up 19% of West Virginia Public Broadcasting’s budget. Executive director Eddie Isom told West Virginia MetroNews earlier this month it was too soon to say what the funding cut would mean for West Virginia Public Broadcasting.
Trump and other Republicans have criticized NPR and PBS broadcasts for being politically biased and called them a “waste of money.”
West Virginia’s entire congressional delegation, all Republicans, voted in support of rescinding the money. In separate statements after voting, Sen. Jim Justice called the legislation commonsense and said “the days of wasting money with zero regard for the taxpayer are over.” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the bill “eliminates wasteful spending.” Virginia Democrats voted against rescinding the money, while Republicans there voted in support of the bill.
Smith said he had several conversations with congressional leaders representing both Virginia and West Virginia explaining the importance of the station to its communities and the need for the federal funding.
“It didn’t really seem to move the needle, if you will, for the Republican side of the representatives I talked to,” he said.
When the legislation came on to Smith’s radar, he started trying to raise awareness, he said. Since the bill passed, he’s done interviews with national media outlets ranging from Politico to NBC’s Meet the Press and NPR. 
“When the Senate passed this, on that Thursday, then the handwriting was on the wall,” Smith said. “And we quickly became the poster child for the collateral damage of this thing. And multiple people reached out.”
 Volunteer Sam Botkin broadcasts from the WVLS studio in Monteray, Va. (Photo courtesy WVLS)
The media attention garnered the station more than 120 private donations from across the country as of Tuesday morning, he said. The majority of donors had never heard of the station before two weeks ago.
“Yet they heard our story, they looked into us, they said, ‘absolutely, you all should continue to exist. You all are important. And here’s some of our own hard earned money to make that continue to happen.’ That’s moving and validating in a way that you can’t really put into words.”
Several media outlets have asked Smith to explain the value of a small radio station in 2025, when many people get their news and entertainment from other sources. The stations are high in the Appalachian Mountains, he said, where cell service is spotty to nonexistent, he said. The people they serve are older.
“We are still out here providing all the things that I told you for people that may not necessarily turn to their smartphones for their morning news or their music or whatever it is that they’re looking for. They still prefer and use traditional forms of media like us.”
The radio stations are especially important after severe weather events like in 2012, when a derecho knocked out power, phone lines and other infrastructure to much of the state for days. The radio station was still broadcasting to anyone with a car or battery-powered radio, he said.
“We were still on the air broadcasting to anyone that could hear us about where cooling stations, where you could get water, where you could get supplies, when your utilities might come back — just the whole situation,” he said. “So there’s definitely a place for radio in today’s world.”

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.
How many people detained by ICE at the Chesterfield Courthouse were there for traffic-related violations?
As the federal government continues an aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration nationwide, ICE agents’ detainment of undocumented immigrants at the Chesterfield Courthouse have dominated headlines across the state this summer and prompted pushback from advocates and legislative leaders who say the practice isn’t transparent, fuels fear in Latino communities and hinders due process.
A report from WTVR showed during a four-day period in June, ICE detained 15 people. A Freedom of Information Act request revealed that five of those 15 had non-traffic related violations, with the most serious offense being assault on law enforcement.
The other ten were in court for traffic citations such as improper vehicle registration, or driving while suspended or without a drivers license.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares  supported  the ICE detentions at the courthouse, with the governor saying the majority of undocumented immigrants detained were violent criminals who “should be arrested.”.”
But the television station’s review of those 15 people’s criminal records in the state found only two had faced previous charges for violent offenses.
Over 2,500 people have been detained by ICE in Virginia since March. Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan pushed back against the Youngkin administration’s claim that most of them were violent criminals, stating she does not believe all 2,500 people have violent offenses because of the lack of evidence to support that claim.
McClellan recently introduced legislation into Congress that requires the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to track and publicly report when U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are detained or deported for immigration purposes. This is in an effort to create transparency and bring to light potential wrongful removals.



The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.



 Loudoun County School Board looks to limit public comments
Twice a month, the Loudoun County School Board has two public comment nights. But one member of the board wants to limit the invitation to the public to speak their minds to  once a month.
WJLA reported that board member Anne Donohue said it has been a challenge to balance receiving public opinions and maintaining time to conduct board business. The topic will be debated at a meeting next month. There could be further limitations after recent meetings have dragged on late into the night.
Hot button topics, such as the debate over if students should be allowed to use the locker room or bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, have drawn large crowds of people eager to share their thoughts.
The report stated that Prince William, Arlington, and Alexandria school boards limit public comment to one hour per meeting. Prince William County can extend that time if there are a lot of speakers. Fairfax County School Board limits the number of people who can speak at each meeting and people are selected through a lottery.
Former Richmond City Council candidate in hot water over campaign finance filings
The Virginia State Police are investigating Tavares Floyd after campaign finance filings for his failed run for the 6th District City Council seat raised questions. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that multiple supposed donors said they never contributed to the campaign.
The paper submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to see the interview notes related to the state police investigation. A FOIA officer rejected the request, stating the files are exempt from production due to being part of an active criminal investigation.
Floyd, who was running against the incumbent Councilwomen Ellen Robertson and another candidate, Willie Hilliard, reported $150,000 in campaign donations from people around the country.
Five donors said they never made donations to Floyd’s campaign, with some stating they had never heard of him. A sixth person listed as a donor had been dead for 30 years.
Floyd reportedly refused to answer the Times-Dispatch’s questions and sent the newspaper a cease and desist letter.
Norfolk Superintendent faced more than one attempt to fire her
Records obtained by journalist Jim Morrison revealed that when Norfolk School Board fired Superintendent Sharon Byrdsong, there had been efforts in the works for years to oust her.
The report published by WHRO explains through emails and phone calls between other board members obtained via Morrison’s FOIA request, Byrdsong had been serving as interim superintendent when she was hired in 2020 and she had not applied for the position. 
The former school board chair had written in a Feb. 19, 2020 email that a phone call from former school board member Rodney Jordan seemed threatening because he pressured Byrdsong not to apply for the job, saying it would “ruin her career”.
The board ultimately approved a contract for Byrdsong but there were divisions between the board members on if they approved of having her in the position.
The 4-3 vote that ended Byrdsong’s tenure as the superintendent had been added last-minute to the agenda and did not provide cause for her termination. The termination didn’t include a public announcement about her severance package, which is required by Virginia law to be shared.
Emails obtained through public records requests show that there had been negotiations between Byrdsong and her attorney before the vote for her to potentially resign without cause. They also showed there had been attempts in 2024 to oust Byrdsong that had been thwarted by other members of the board.
After she was fired, the Norfolk City Council seemingly hit back at the school board by passing a resolution praising her and spoke about her successes. 
Morrison faced some challenges getting the public records requests in this case and ended up taking Norfolk Public Schools to court to obtain the records. He faced delays, omissions, and what he considered to be excessive fees for the files. After he filed suit, he reported that the school district had been much more responsive to his requests and even waived all fees.

(Photo by Eakin Howard/Getty Images)Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
‘Pure emotion’ frequently drives debates on sports stadium deals

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.











It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community.


– Angeline Close Scheinbaum, professor of sports marketing at Clemson University



After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
Kansas v. Missouri stadium battle shows how states are reigniting border wars

In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

(Photo Credit: Return ‘Em Right)It happens with a tug at first, the smallest indication that a fish has taken interest in the bait on your hook. Then it pulls hard and steady, bending the fishing rod into a steep downward arc toward the water.
The reel digs into the palm of your hand as you work to spool back the line with — hopefully — a prized red snapper on the end. It rushes through the deep blue of the water, from hundreds of feet below up to the surface, the shining red- and white-scaled creature breaking through the waves.
But fish like red snapper face health risks when pulled up to the surface too quickly from such depths. Much like a scuba diver, they can be hurt from the sudden, dramatic change in pressure.
Fishing experts and researchers have explored different ways to address the concern, with federal rules and special tools having been created for use on the water. But convincing anglers to follow and use them is challenging, especially as one key law is set to expire soon.
Barotrauma, an injury sustained by a rapid change in pressure, heavily affects reef fish when they are pulled up from deeper water. Gases in the fish’s body expand as they accelerate toward the surface, where they “blow up like a balloon,” said Nicholas Haddad, communications manager for Return ‘Em Right, a nonprofit partnership program funded with settlement money from the BP-Deepwater Horizon disaster.
Return ‘Em Right uses the funds to send free descending device release gear to the angling community in the Gulf of Mexico and provides education on how to use them.
An avid angler in his own right with a background in fisheries management and biological science, Haddad said the signs of barotrauma, such as bulging eyes and organs protruding from a fish’s body, “can be kind of gruesome looking.”
Barotrauma mainly affects fish species that spend most of their time at the bottom of the water column or on reefs. Some fish are vulnerable to pressure damage at depths as shallow as 30 feet.
“Once you start fishing deeper than that, the signs of barotrauma will continue to get worse,” Haddad said. “So if you’re fishing in 150 feet or deeper, likely every fish you pull up will have barotrauma.”
If a fish is out of season or not within the size range anglers can keep, it has to be put back into the water alive. Barotrauma prevents fish from being able to swim back down to the bottom on their own, making them a floating, vulnerable meal for predators or causing them to succumb to their pressure-related injuries.
“It’s almost like trying to swim down with a life vest,” Haddad said. “You’re buoyant so you can’t get down on your own, so you’ve got to do something to overcome that.”
Haddad said, for many years, few anglers knew there was anything they could do to help fish swim back down to the bottom. But programs and groups such as Return ‘Em Right and Louisiana SeaGrant, part of a network addressing marine issues, are spreading the word about tools that can help fish survive and better recover from barotrauma.
Jeffrey Plumlee, a fisheries scientist with Louisiana SeaGrant and assistant professor at Louisiana State University, recommends using gear that’s designed to alleviate the pressure put on a fish’s body, called venting tools or descending devices. A big push to increase their use has made them popular along the Pacific Coast over the past 20 years, he said.
“You attach them to the lip of the fish … attach it to a spare rod and reel, or you can attach it to a rope and a hand line, and basically lower the fish back down,” he said.
The slow descent allows the fish to release built-up pressure that would otherwise prevent it from swimming to the bottom on its own.
“All those physics, everything is happening in reverse, so all those gasses are recompressing naturally,” Plumlee said.
Fishers can use venting tools, as simple as a hollow needle, to manually release the pressure inside the fish’s swim bladder, the main organ that puffs up with gas as a fish is pulled to the surface. While piercing the swim bladder is better than doing nothing, Plumlee said there is a risk of piercing the wrong organ and harming the fish more.
Both methods require specialized gear and extra time to help get the fish back to depth.
Venting or decompressing fish increases their chances at survival dramatically, said Haddad, citing a wide body of preliminary research into the effectiveness of these tools.
“When you add that up to tens of millions of fish a year, it can really add up in the survival rates,” he said.
But anglers have mixed feelings on whether they believe in using these tools.

The DESCEND Act, a federal law sponsored by then U.S. Rep. Garret Graves, R-Baton Rouge, in 2020, requires fishers in federal waters have either a venting tool or descending device on their vessel and ready to use. But it doesn’t require anglers to actually use the tools.
Enforcement would be nearly impossible, said Emily Muehlstein, spokeswoman for the Gulf Council, one of eight regional fishery management groups Congress has tasked to manage and guide fisheries.
It can be hard to break into the culture, said Myron Fischer, a retired biologist with Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and former charter fishing captain.
His son, Richard Fischer, president of the Louisiana Charter Boat Association, said promoting the use of descending devices throughout his organization and changing the culture is a priority.
“These people charging well over $1,000 to go fish, maybe closer to $2,000, they’re in a rush,” Myron Fischer said. “They want to get that fish off the line and get a customer baited and go back down.”
“I think the need for education is very important and needed,” Richard Fischer said.
“There are some recreational fishermen that don’t take conservation seriously, and [descending devices are] just kind of collecting dust on their boat,” he added. “So if they get stopped by enforcement,  ‘Yeah, here it is. I got it,’ and they never had any intention of using it.”
And the law is about to change; the DESCEND Act, signed into law by President Trump in his first term in office, is set to expire in January.
“I do think that, regardless of whether or not there’s a regulation, a good bit of the fleet is already adopting those behaviors,” Muehlstein said.
“I don’t think a lot of dudes are gonna chuck the gear off their boats just because the DESCEND Act is gone,”she added.
The Gulf Council is interested in placing the DESCEND Act’s standards in its own rules, having previously required fishers in its jurisdiction to have a venting tool on board their vessel.
But it won’t be in place by the time the federal law expires.
“A lot of the requirements of our rulemaking, we have to base our management decisions on the best available scientific information,” Muehlstein said.
The Gulf Council wants to see more population-level research, such as exact mortality rates for different species, how different sexes of fish are affected and data over longer periods of time, before it implements a new rule, she said.
“It’s very much a fledgling field, like we’re kind of newly learning about these tools and how useful they are and how impactful they can be,” Muehlstein said.
Researchers now rely mostly on information reported from anglers, Plumlee said, which can vary in accuracy. Newer methods, such as satellite imaging of popular recreational fishing spots to assess how many boats travel and fish there, can help provide more precise information, he said, but there is still much more to figure out.
“If we can get better data collection – and if we can get better estimates of how many people are using these descender devices that we know are effective – we can reduce the amount of discard mortality that we’re assuming,” Plumlee said.
With more research, these tools could have a large impact on the number of fish in the ecosystem, he said.
“By making sure that they get back down to depth and recover from this injury so that they can live to be caught another day, that’s a really important concept,” Plumlee said.
Muehlstein thinks progress is being made but also said there’s more work to be done with continued education and further research.
“I think that in recent years, people have been slowly adopting and changing to using descending devices,” she said. “But I don’t know that a majority of folks have done that, especially some of those old salted guys that are just going to do it the way they’ve always done it.”

Kelly Ayotte signs Senate Bill 245, which bans surprise billing and standardizes pricing for ambulances in New Hampshire, on a stretcher at a ceremonial bill signing in Nashua Thursday. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed Senate Bill 245 on top of a stretcher Thursday morning.
“I have not signed a bill on a stretcher (before),” she quipped. “This is a good circumstance to do it. I wouldn’t want to do it in others, but if I had to, I would. I want you to know.”
Ayotte was at American Medical Rescue in Nashua, surrounded by ambulances and paramedics, for a ceremonial bill signing. The legislation she signed into law prohibits surprise ambulance billing in New Hampshire and sets the rates at which ambulance providers can legally charge for their services.
“Imagine if you or a loved one needed an ambulance because you were having a health situation that threatened your life,” Ayotte said. “This bill is going to make sure that when you have that ambulance come to your house for your mother or your father or your loved one, that there’s not a surprise bill that comes afterwards, that really makes you feel, ‘Wow. How can I pay for this? How am I going to meet this financial challenge?’ So this is incredibly important, and for our ambulance providers in our cities like Nashua all the way up to our most rural areas, they need to receive fair rates so that they can actually have the resources to get those ambulances to people in their most difficult circumstances.”
Surprise billing, also known as balance billing, occurs when an ambulance costs more than the insurer is willing to pay for it and the patient is billed for the rest of the ambulance ride. SB 245 bans that practice beginning Jan. 1.
The bill also mandates the rate ambulance providers will charge insurers (unless the two parties come to an outside agreement for a different price). This bill sets the rate at 350% of the federal Medicare rate, which varies depending on the location and other factors, for the first two years it is in effect. After those two years are up, the state Insurance Department will set a new, updated rate based on an actuarial study that takes into account inflation and other market factors.
SB 245, which was sponsored by West Lebanon Democratic Sen. Sue Prentiss, beat out several competing bills meant to address this issue. That includes House Bill 316, sponsored by Rindge Republican Rep. John Hunt, which also banned surprise billing but used an actuarial study previously commissioned by the Insurance Department to set the initial rate at 202%. (The study came after the Legislature passed a bill in June 2024 requesting it, and the final report was released in January.) That bill was lambasted by ambulance providers, who thought the rate was too low.
Hunt, who was not at Thursday’s bill signing, previously said he believes SB 245’s rate of 325% is far too high and gave ambulance providers an excessive windfall, though he was willing to compromise to eliminate surprise billing. The governor commended the compromise.
“This rate was a result of compromise with the people behind me working incredibly hard to make sure that we’ve received a rate that is going to be able to sustain those services throughout our state,” Ayotte said Thursday, flanked by state lawmakers and EMS workers. “But one of the reasons we have the study is because we need to continuously evaluate that rate. As you know, costs change. Inflation can impact the cost. This is a very good compromise, and we’ll continue to evaluate it going forward, to make sure that we can sustain those services, and also to just make sure that patients have the services that they need.”
Chris Stawasz, Northeast regional director for American Medical Response and a vocal proponent of SB 245, said he’s not worried that the rate will fall dramatically lower than 350% when the actuarial study is complete after two years.
“New Hampshire is the 17th state, first in New England, to adopt this kind of legislation,” Stawasz said. “We have not seen any other state that’s gone down as a result of this.”
Asked how that squares with the actuarial study that’s already been completed that recommends a significantly lower rate, Stawasz argued that the previous study was flawed.
“We, as a group of providers, had some real issues with that study,” he said.
He said the study was completed in six months, “which is a really, really short period of time for a study like that” and said it looked at pre-pandemic data, “so we think it’s important to look at today’s data.”
“And let’s think about that,” Ayotte chimed in. “If the study’s done pre-COVID, if you look even in the context of inflationary costs, it kind of makes sense that it doesn’t have the most current data. So that’s the most important thing here. We want current data to evaluate where we are.”
However, the report from that study, which is available online, says it used data from a Medicaid database and the New Hampshire Comprehensive Health Care Information System, which reflected ambulance services from Jan. 1, 2022, through June 30, 2024. The pandemic was officially declared in March 2020. It’s unclear if the study mandated by SB 245 in two years will use the same methodology as this one.
The bill was praised by ambulance providers Thursday, including private EMS companies and fire departments that provide EMS.
“By eliminating unexpected ambulance billing, we are protecting the patients and families from financial strife during some of their most vulnerable moments,” Mike Sitar, Tilton-Northfield Fire District chief, said. “At the same time, the legislation recognizes the operational needs of all private and municipal service providers by guaranteeing minimum payments for the essential services they deliver.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AyotteSigningSB245-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Kentucky’s largest utility is proposing to delay the retirement of a coal-fired power plant unit and move forward with building billions of dollars of gas-fired power generation as part of a proposed settlement agreement before the state utility regulator.
The proposed settlement offered by Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities (LG&E and KU) this week would build two new natural gas-fired power plants, each with a capacity of 645 megawatts, costing a total of more than $2.7 billion. Mill Creek 2, one of four coal-fired units at the utility’s Mill Creek Generating Station, would have its planned retirement delayed from 2027 until one of the new gas-fired power plants is operational in 2031.
The settlement is a part of a months-long case LG&E and KU brought before the Kentucky Public Service Commission requesting to build more fossil fuel-fired power generation that the utility says is needed to meet “unprecedented” projected energy demand driven by an influx of data centers. 
“As Kentucky’s largest regulated utilities, we have an obligation to serve all customers and new economic development load in the lowest reasonable cost manner. This agreement reflects the importance of that role and the critical needs addressed in our long-term generation investment plans,” said LG&E and KU president John Crockett in a released statement. 
The proposed settlement — which the commission could approve, deny or change — was agreed to by groups including Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers representing energy-intensive manufacturers; the Kentucky Coal Association; the Southern Renewable Energy Association; and Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, who praised the settlement as promoting “affordable and reliable energy for Kentucky families.” 
“This agreement taps into Kentucky’s abundant natural resources and our ‘all-of-the-above’ energy strategy to power the commonwealth’s bright future,” said Coleman in a statement. “By securing our affordable energy future, we’ve also kept our commonwealth open for new business investment, job creation and economic growth.”
Coleman also touted the settlement for proposing to partially and temporarily offset the costs of one of the proposed gas-fired plants through revenues associated with data centers. 
However, intervenors in the case representing affordable housing advocates in Louisville, environmental stakeholders and others lambasted the settlement as saddling Kentuckians with billions of dollars of “costly, polluting infrastructure based on hypothetical future demand.” 
Byron Gary, an attorney for the environmental legal group Kentucky Resources Council representing the intervenors, in a statement said the settlement “prioritizes corporate interests over affordability, public health, and climate action.” 
Tony Curtis, the executive of the Metropolitan Housing Coalition in Louisville, one of the intervenors opposed to the settlement, in a statement said the “risk and cost” of building two new gas-fired power plants based on “speculative need is not in the best interest of ratepayers, especially low-and fixed-income residents.” 
Curtis said data centers driving the energy demand, not ratepayers, should bear the risk with proposed gas-fired generation.
Intervenors critical of the proposed settlement also stated they were disappointed in local governments for Louisville and Lexington not advocating for each cities’ goals to mitigate climate change. The two cities’ leaders agreed to not oppose the proposed settlement. A spokesperson for Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg did not provide a response to emailed questions about the proposed settlement. 
Susan Straub, a spokesperson for Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton, in an emailed statement said the city was “not comfortable with the level of additional power generation permitted in the settlement.” But the city did support other aspects of it, such LG&E and KU removing an additional request to build a utility-scale battery storage system. 
An influx of prospective data centers, some to power artificial intelligence services, has created a projected surge of demand for electricity across the country, though it’s unclear whether a number of proposed data centers will be built. Data centers have also driven an increase in electricity costs for ratepayers. 
The Kentucky Public Service Commission will begin a public hearing on LG&E and KU’s case and the proposed settlement Aug. 4 at 9 a.m. ET at its Frankfort office. The hearing will be broadcasted live on the agency’s YouTube channel.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5813-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

(Photo courtesy of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.)A former chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital is suing the federal government in an attempt to regain his asylum status. 
He said the government used a set of inaccurate claims and misinterpreted academic articles to revoke it in the first place. The academics themselves agreed, according to documents filed in a Cincinnati federal court last week. 
The story of Ayman Soliman has taken on a national profile since his July 9 arrest. 
He came legally to the United States in 2014 after he was beaten and tortured by Egypt’s totalitarian government for working with western journalists during the Arab Spring uprising, his lawyers said. 
Soliman was granted asylum in 2018, only to see the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service start the process of revoking it last December.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The government claimed that Soliman provided “material support” to a terrorist organization. 
The Muslim Brotherhood was the organization in question. However, Soliman didn’t belong to it, and it’s not designated by the United States as a terrorist organization.
In a motion to reinstate Soliman’s asylum status, his lawyer, Robert Ratliff, points out a key date the government got wrong in trying to revoke it.
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services claimed that the Egyptian government designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization on Dec. 5, 2012. 
That didn’t actually happen until Dec. 25, 2013, and big changes happened in Egypt between the two dates. 
Soliman worked with al-Jameya al-Shareya, a group that coordinated community-level social services in a country where nearly a third of people live in poverty and government services are scant.
In 2011, Arab Spring uprisings toppled the long-time, authoritarian government of Hosni Mubarek. 
The Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group, had a legally registered political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, or FJP, that participated in ensuing elections.
“The FJP were very successful in these elections, most notably when their candidate, Mohammed Morsi, won the two-round presidential elections in May/June 2012,” Steven Brooke, faculty director of Middle East Studies at the University of Wisconsin, wrote. 
“International election observers judged these contests as free and fair, and their results were accepted as valid by the international community, including the United States.”
During that time, Soliman’s group worked occasionally with the Muslim Brotherhood on community-level programs, but Brooke wrote that, “Individual instances of cooperation or overlap do not indicate that al-Jameya al-Shareya is organizationally allied to the Muslim Brotherhood.”
On July 3, 2013, a military junta staged a coup, jailed Morsi and later jailed Soliman for his work as a journalist. 
The repressive regime continues in power, with U.S. support.
“Significant numbers of individuals, both affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood and not, were killed, imprisoned without trial — or forced to flee the country,” Brooke wrote to the court. “As part of this crackdown, the Muslim Brotherhood was declared a terrorist organization in late December of 2013. Under this same military government, Egypt today is one of the most repressive and authoritarian countries in the region.”
Brooke was writing to the court to say that the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service had gotten its facts wrong, and was misusing his work in an attempt to deport Soliman.
“In brief, the documents incorrectly date the Muslim Brotherhood’s designation as a terrorist group by the Egyptian government by one year,” Brooke wrote. “The documents also treated the Egyptian government’s designation uncritically, and do not contextualize what ‘affiliation’ between the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Jameya al-Shareya represents.”
ICE continues to hold Ohio cleric. His defenders say the government’s claims are bogus

Marie Vannetzel, of France’s National Center for Scientific Research, also wrote the court on Soliman’s behalf.
 She said that in revoking Soliman’s refugee status, the Customs and Immigration Service lifted some of her work from its context — apparently intending to mislead.
Government lawyers quoted a sentence in the middle of a paragraph. The middle sentence said the Muslim Brotherhood under Anwar Sadat in the early 1990s was allowed to work with Soliman’s group, al-Jameya al-Shareya, until the brotherhood won a spot on the board. Then the board was dissolved, the sentence said.
But government lawyers left out sentences before and after saying that al-Jameya al-Shareya was a venerable, large “para-public” Islamic charity with many members who had nothing to do with the Muslim Brotherhood.
“I strongly disagree with the way these sentences are quoted and interpreted,” Vannetzel wrote. “I consider this a dishonest manipulation of my text and my work.”
In a separate development in Soliman’s case, an immigration judge denied his application to be released on bail. 
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had argued that because he was accused of supporting a terrorist group, the immigration judge didn’t have jurisdiction to grant bail.
Immigration judges and their courts are not part of the judiciary. Instead, they’re administered by the Department of Justice, a part of an executive branch whose head is committed to mass deportations. Immigrant support groups say the arrangement is inherently unfair. 
For now, Soliman will continue to be jailed in Ohio under a U.S. district judge’s injunction. He’ll remain in the state at least until Aug. 14.

Renewal letters get lost in the mail, phone calls are missed and never returned, or verification paperwork is submitted but never processed. The result is the same: children lose coverage, and families lose access to the care their kids urgently need. 
For nearly 15 years, I’ve worked in Medicaid policy. Before joining GEEARS, I spent six years at a legal nonprofit serving Georgians with low incomes in the 154 counties outside of metro Atlanta. During that time, I answered dozens of calls each month from panicked parents and caregivers with the same heartbreaking concern: My child’s Medicaid was cut off even though we’re still eligible. 
Some moments have stuck with me:

A mother phoned from an emergency room. Her daughter had a broken leg, but the hospital refused to set it because her Medicaid had been terminated. They sent the child home with only pain medication.
A grandmother reached out in distress. Her grandson’s Medicaid had been cut off, and he hadn’t had his ADHD medication in months. He’d been suspended from school, and his grades were plummeting.
A mother, standing outside a surgery center, had just been told her daughter’s scheduled ear tube surgery was canceled. Medicaid was showing as inactive, even though they had submitted all the requested information.

In each case, the child was still eligible for coverage. These were not gaps in eligibility, but gaps in the system.
That’s why GEEARS: Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students has long advocated for Georgia to adopt a Medicaid waiver that would ensure continuous coverage for children from birth through age three. The earliest years of life are critical for brain development, and stable access to care during this time helps lay the foundation for long-term health and learning. Routine pediatric visits, immunizations, developmental screenings, and early interventions — all are essential in the first three years of life.
Continuous coverage would both support children and families and also reduce the strain on state agencies by minimizing the paperwork caseworkers must review.
Yet on July 17th, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a memo announcing that it would no longer approve or renew Section 1115 waivers that provide continuous Medicaid eligibility for young children. This decision puts in jeopardy the waivers already approved in nine states and several other states’ waiver proposals.
Georgia never submitted such a waiver, though the legislatively mandated Comprehensive Health Coverage Commission recommended pursuing one for children through age six in its report last December. Had it been implemented, the policy could have stabilized care for the nearly 50% of babies whose births are covered by Medicaid.
Last year, that amounted to over 60,000 babies — 60,000 little ones who deserve uninterrupted access to health care during the most important years of their development. This waiver offered a straightforward solution. By shutting down this option, CMS has blocked a critical path to improving early childhood health outcomes in Georgia and across the country. It’s a deeply disappointing decision that ultimately harms our nation’s most precious assets: our children.

It’s no surprise that State Rep. Carla Cunningham – a Democrat from Mecklenburg County — declined to speak with reporters this week after helping to override Gov. Stein’s veto of a mean-spirited and ill-conceived anti-immigrant bill.
That’s what often happens when a politician puts their foot in their mouth.
House Bill 318 will force local sheriffs – even when it makes their communities less safe—to cooperate with federal ICE officials in detaining people merely accused of criminal offenses.
It’s one of the ham-handed tactics the Trump administration has been using to terrorize immigrant communities and round up good people for deportation.
Unfortunately, all of this seems to have escaped Cunningham, who not only provided the decisive ‘yes’ vote, but who also gave an uninformed speech in which she accused immigrants of exploiting and abusing native born Americans and implied that immigrant cultures are inferior.
The bottom line: Cunningham embarrassed herself and her constituents – many of them foreign born – with her cruel rant. One prays she’ll awaken soon from her delusions.

To keep spending under the constitutional cap, Lamont will have to find the $106 million in savings required by the legislature somewhere else — if higher education, which accounts for nearly one fifth of the annual budget, won’t absorb any of it.
“I’m grateful that the governor’s decided not to hold back any funding for CSCU and UConn institutions,” said Rep. Gregory Haddad, D-Mansfield, co-chairman of the Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee, who added those units already have “a significant amount of cost-cutting to accomplish while trying to prioritize student services and maintain affordability.”
Higher education units, collectively, must do without about $270 million in federal pandemic grant funding that support their operations last fiscal year, which wrapped on June 30.
The General Assembly has struggled increasingly in recent years to adhere to a spending cap that keeps most state budget growth in line with household income or inflation.
The governor — a fiscal moderate — and his fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority have postponed a showdown over higher education funding since 2021 thanks to more than $2.8 billion in emergency pandemic relief Congress granted Connecticut through the American Rescue Plan Act [ARPA].
Faced with universities’ requests for more funding, the governor and lawmakers normally have two options: Deny those asks, risking programmatic cuts, tuition hikes, or both, or grant them, shifting resources — already limited by the cap — away from other programs. 
Instead, years ago, they chose a third option: assigning hundreds of millions in temporary ARPA dollars, which could be spent outside of the cap system, to cover ongoing higher education costs. 
But state officials knew those ARPA dollars would be exhausted by 2026 and that using them to cover recurring expenses was a ticking fiscal time bomb, a huge hole that eventually would have to be filled some other way.
Lamont says universities should have done more to prepare for the eventual loss of those funds. But higher ed officials sought that support, at numerous public hearings and meetings, to cover regular operations, and many legislators say everyone, including Lamont administration officials, understood this.
But Lamont faces his own fiscal challenges.
The $27.2 billion spending plan legislators set for the fiscal year that began July 1 directs the Executive Branch, which oversees the bulk of spending, to achieve $106 million in savings once the budget is in force. 
Governors traditionally meet these savings targets by spreading the pain among dozens of state agencies, holding back a share of their allotments. And by exempting higher education, Lamont is taking a big piece of the budget pie out of the cost-saving exercise.
UConn expects to spend almost $3.7 billion this fiscal year on its main campus in Storrs, its regional campuses and its Farmington health center combined.
The CSCU system, which includes four regional universities, 12 community colleges and the online Charter Oak State College, has a $1.2 billion budget.
Together, the spending plans for these public colleges and universities represent almost one-fifth of the entire state budget.
Collibee added that while there are no plans to reduce funds for higher education now, things could change. 
“The administration may still choose to apply the remaining holdback authority, including potentially in higher education, if we believe spending or revenue trends warrant that action this fiscal year,” he said.
That was the situation this past fiscal year. 
Lamont initially exempted higher education from helping him meet a $209 million efficiency savings target for 2024-25. But the administration reversed itself in late March after the General Assembly went against Lamont’s wishes and ordered a supplemental $40 million increase in special education grants for K-12 school districts.
Legislators said the funding was crucial and that a growing gap between the demand for special education needs and local resources to cover them was pushing district school budgets into crisis.
Lamont, who had proposed boosting special education aid by $40 million — but not until July 2026 — countered that the state budget already was on pace to exceed the budget cap and that legislators needed to make tough choices and trim spending.
The two sides eventually agreed to send the extra $40 million to school districts right away, using a technical accounting maneuver, which Lamont traditionally has decried, to skirt the spending cap issue. 
The administration responded by ordering about $41 million in spending reductions across numerous state agencies, including $6 million from public colleges and universities. 
Higher education units hope to avoid a situation like that this year and are taking steps to adjust to the loss of ARPA dollars.
The CSCU system came under fire last spring when the Connecticut Mirror disclosed it held more than $600 million in reserves, a huge cushion equal to roughly half its operating budget.
UConn’s budgetary safety net was more modest last spring, involving about $170 million for the Storrs and regional campuses and about $300 million for the health center.
But all higher ed units are beginning to spend their reserves.
The CSCU system expects to dedicate $162 million to support the budget and mitigate program cuts, according to spokeswoman Samantha Norton.
UConn officials still are working on various cost-cutting initiatives, but spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz said as much as $38 million in reserves could be used to support the main and regional campuses and another $62 million to bolster the health center’s budget. 
Both Haddad and Sen. Derek Slap, D-West Hartford, the other co-chair of the higher education committee, called for higher education units to reduce their reserves last spring.
Slap also praised Lamont this week for not asking higher education to forfeit funds to meet the budgetary savings mandate.
“The state can’t backfill everything, but I think to not subject them to holdbacks right now is a good thing, especially considering what’s coming down the road,” Slap said, predicting recent federal spending cuts ordered by Congress and President Donald Trump would take a heavy toll on research grants and other programs that support higher education.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CCSU-2.jpg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810
