(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)The American Association of University Professors delivered a petition to OU administrators Friday demanding answers regarding its handling of an academic freedom case that has garnered national attention.


In November, OU psychology junior Samantha Fulnecky filed a formal claim of illegal discrimination after receiving a zero on an essay on gender stereotypes in which she cited the Bible as her sole source, later published by The Oklahoman.
The instructor, Mel Curth, said in her grading comments the paper did not follow the assignment and was at times “offensive.” In the essay, Fulnecky wrote that the “lie that there are multiple genders… is demonic and severely harms American youth,” as well as “lies spread from Satan.”
Curth was placed on administrative leave during the university’s investigation and was later relieved of all instructional duties at the investigation’s conclusion — a decision Curth is appealing, according to a Bluesky post from civil rights attorney Brittany Stewart.
OU claimed Curth’s grading of the paper was “arbitrary.” It did not release the findings of the investigation into Fulnecky’s religious discrimination claim, and the grade appeal was decided in her favor.
The petition, which has 24,571 signatures as of Monday afternoon and is addressed to OU President Joseph Harroz, demands OU:

Release full details on the process resulting in Curth being placed on administrative leave in December.
Publicly reaffirm the right of OU instructors to teach, grade and research “free of political interference, unlawful mandates or pressures that inhibit authentic engagement.”
Work with the campus community to develop a Harassment Response and Prevention plan to provide guidelines for responding to political attacks.

“OU’s decision to place the instructor on administrative leave following a routine grading dispute — a decision it has yet to adequately explain — and subsequent failure to defend her from harassment and discrimination, including reported death threats, raises serious concerns about the University’s commitment to educational standards, academic freedom and instructor safety,” the petition reads.
OU’s Faculty Handbook pulls its definition of “academic freedom” from the AAUP:
“As teachers, faculty members encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students,” the policy reads. “They hold before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Faculty members demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors. Faculty members make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to ensure that their evaluations of students reflect each student’s true merit.”
OU-AAUP President Michael Givel said the university’s actions open a “can of worms” for academic freedom and scholarly integrity.
“There’s a crisis at OU,” Givel said. “… are there concrete standards, in terms of academic integrity, scientific values, scholarly research? Or do instructors and anybody else have to worry about somebody who doesn’t like their grade claiming they’ve been discriminated against based on, supposedly, religion?”
Givel said the AAUP chapter wants clarity on the university’s response process for student discrimination complaints — a process he said is not in writing.
The case has drawn backlash from all sides. In November, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt posted on social media, calling for the OU Board of Regents to review the investigation. National publications have taken notice. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the incident “intellectual rot in higher education.”
In December, hundreds of supporters gathered at OU’s Norman campus to protest Curth’s suspension.
Fulnecky has since spoken to media outlets and at a recent event hosted by local conservative group Original Constitutional Principles Affecting Culture.
“I was asked to give my opinion, and I gave my opinion,” Fulnecky said at the event. “I’ve gotten 100% on every essay I’ve written in that class.”
Punitive measures for universities are also making their way to the state Capitol. Last week, Rep. Gabe Woolley (R-Broken Arrow) filed House Joint Resolution 1037, which would grant the legislature the authority to freeze, suspend or withhold up to 100% of state-appropriated funds recommended for allocation to a higher education institution within the Oklahoma State System for Higher Education. If approved, the measure would be placed on a statewide ballot.
OU did not return a request for comment on the AAUP’s petition. Givel said his organization will decide what it will do next if the university does not respond to the demands.

The Wyoming Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the state’s two abortion bans are unconstitutional, preserving a hotly contested right amid a push by legislators to end the practice in the Equality State.
In a 4-1 decision, the court agreed the bans conflict with a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution that protects individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions. That amendment, ironically, was enacted by voters after a push by conservatives in the same Legislature that’s since made repeated attempts to curtail abortion.
Ballot initiative to end Idaho’s abortion ban has more than 50,000 signatures, group says

“A woman has a fundamental right to make her own health care decisions, including the decision to have an abortion,” the ruling states.

“The State did not meet its burden of demonstrating the Abortion Laws further the compelling interest of protecting unborn life without unduly infringing upon the woman’s fundamental right to make her own health care decisions. As such, the Abortion Laws do not constitute reasonable and necessary restrictions on a pregnant woman’s right to make her own health care decisions.”
The ruling represents a victory for abortions rights advocates in one of the nation’s reddest states. They contend abortion bans conflict with the state’s long history of skepticism toward government involvement in medical and other personal decisions.
For abortion opponents, the decision is a bitter setback that suggests an abortion ban would require changes to the Wyoming Constitution — a more difficult hurdle than a simple majority vote in the Republican-dominated statehouse.
 Republican push to end abortion in Wyoming came after fall of Roe v. Wade

Wyoming’s once vaunted live-and-let-live political ethos for years thwarted legislative attempts to restrict abortion. That began to change in the years before the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed abortion rights in the U.S. since 1973.
In early 2022, Wyoming lawmakers passed a trigger law that banned abortion with Roe’s fall. But that ban did not go into effect due to a court challenge that centered, in part, on Wyoming’s 2012 constitutional amendment.
In 2023, Republican lawmakers in the Legislature tried again, this time succeeding in passing two abortion bans. One was a fairly comprehensive prohibition that included only a few notable exceptions, such as in the case of rape or incest. A second law banned medication in abortions — the first law of its kind in the nation.
A group of abortion providers and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the bans, and Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens temporarily blocked them as the case played out.

Finally in November 2024, Owens ruled the bans were unconstitutional. The state, which was represented by the Wyoming Attorney General’s Office, appealed the decision to the Wyoming Supreme Court. The justices heard arguments on the case in April.
In the meantime, Wellspring Health Access in Casper has provided abortions for women in Wyoming and neighboring states. The facility was targeted by an arsonist before it opened and later became a plaintiff in the legal challenges to the growing number of abortion restrictions passed by state lawmakers, including mandatory ultrasounds and a 48-hour waiting period passed earlier this year.
Justice Kari Gray was the dissenting vote in the case while Justice John Fenn authored a concurring opinion. Meanwhile, retired Justice Kate Fox participated in the case’s consideration and decision since she heard the case, per state law and the Wyoming Constitution.

(Getty Images)Nearly 92% of Indiana’s high school seniors graduated in 2025, setting the highest graduation rate on record, the Indiana Department of Education announced Monday.
“Today’s record-high graduation rate is a testament to the hard work of Indiana’s students, families, and educators,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a news release.
“While high school graduation marks the end of a student’s K-12 journey, our schools play an essential role in preparing students for all that comes next, whether that’s going to college, starting a career, or joining the military,” he continued. “This strong improvement in our state’s graduation rate shows that when we focus on academic excellence and establish clear, personalized pathways, our students thrive.”
The 91.83% graduation rate bested the 90.23% record set in 2024 by 1.6 percentage points.
It represents the third straight year of post-pandemic improvement kicked off in 2023, when 88.98% graduated. Seniors recorded a decade-low graduation rate of 86.65% in 2022.

“As we continue to scale the new Indiana diploma and readiness seals statewide, we will not only strengthen the value of high school and help more students graduate, we will ensure that they are prepared to succeed in whatever path they choose for their future,” state Education Secretary Katie Jenner said.
Numerous student populations improved in the results released Tuesday.
Almost 87% of Black students graduated in 2025, up 3 percentage points from the previous year, along with nearly 90% of Hispanic students, in a boost of 2 percentage points. White students improved to 93%, or by about 1.5 percentage points, and their multiracial classmates logged a graduation rate of 88%, up by 1 percentage point.
Seniors learning English, receiving free and reduced-price meals, and in special education also graduated at higher rates than the year prior — but still lagged their native speaker, paid lunch and general education peers.
The rate of students who graduated without waivers additionally cleared 90%. Students who do not complete or pass some graduation requirements can still qualify for a diploma if they demonstrate knowledge or skill.
The waivers are intended to help students with special circumstances, like those who’ve transferred to a new school or who have attempted to pass competency tests at least three times.

State education and policy leaders have for years sought to lower dependence on waivers, including by setting caps on the percentage of graduation waivers that can be counted toward a school’s state and local graduation rate. They took effect with the 2024 cohort.
Non-public schools outperformed their public counterparts by about 1 percentage point — 93% versus 92% — but the differences between traditional public and public charter schools were not reported. In the 2024 results, about 93% of students at traditional public schools graduated as opposed to just 59% of students at public charter schools.
Indiana’s federal graduation rate increased, almost hitting 90% compared to 2024’s 89%. The rates are calculated differently because of differences between state and federal accountability models, according to IDOE.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)When I heard my former student Mike was suspended after shoving and injuring my 2nd grade student, Eddy, as they got off the bus at the start of a recent school day, I wondered if I could repair what had been done, providing an outcome that would make a positive difference in the lives of these boys.
Could I mediate a conversation between them so that Mike, now in middle school, understood the gravity of what he did? Could I help ensure Eddy felt safe around older students?
Buoyed by the idea of using restorative practices, which separate the deed from the doer and shift the focus away from punishing Mike to address and fix the harm that was done, I asked my school administrators and the boys’ families if Mike could spend time in my classroom as a tutor and mentor to Eddy.
The powerful connection that grew between the boys as a result of this extra effort gives me so much hope.
Across the country, including schools around Pennsylvania, projects are underway to turn traditional student discipline models on their heads. Why? It’s all about encouraging appropriate behavior by bringing students into the collaborative process to resolve the issues.
A recent study by the University of Chicago Education Lab found that schools that implemented restorative practices saw proactive changes in students’ behaviors—including an 18% decrease in suspensions—with many youth experiencing a stronger sense of belonging.
In 2023, Representative Anthony Bellmon introduced bipartisian legislation that reflected this growing body of research and would have embedded conflict resolution instruction into both coursework and educator training. The bill, which didn’t pass, was meant to ensure students develop skills such as mediation, effective communication, emotional regulation, and relationship-building by equipping educators with sustained professional learning to put these practices into action in our schools.
Restorative practices and  more robust teacher training are important strategies that go beyond what is included as student supports in Pennsylvania Statute.
Here’s why:
First, they are a more effective and sustaining way to address discipline. Suspension, which pulls students away from their classrooms and learning, doesn’t always help them see the bigger picture of how their behaviors affect others. After the incident, Eddy was hesitant to be anywhere near Mike. However, as I supported them, each boy had a role to play as they worked together. Eddy became more relaxed; feelings of safety and trust replaced his uncertainty as they built a mentor-mentee relationship. Meanwhile, Mike got a “little brother” out of the deal.
Another reason for employing restorative practices is that it teaches students collaborative skills. With Mike’s support, Eddy, who struggled with reading comprehension, became more confident to ask questions of me and his peers when he struggled to understand what he read. For his part, Eddy’s calm nature forced Mike to slow down, which helped him be more patient and understanding while also strengthening his confidence in his abilities as Eddy’s reading tutor. And the time they spent together encouraged conversations outside of academics. Soon Mike and Eddy were singing songs they both liked.
Just as important, restorative practices help students work through conflicts, giving students tools to engage with each other during disagreements and empowering them to use their voice and become part of change.
During the last week of school, as the students walked to their bus, Mike playfully pulled Eddy into a hug and ruffled Eddy’s hair. Eddy was full of smiles and giggles. I was near enough to overhear their conversation: “Eddy, I’m sorry for what I did to you. I don’t know why I did it. If I could take it back, I would.”
The Latin root for discipline is discere which means “to learn.” Restorative practices are a tool that educators can use to teach students how to navigate their social world. Let’s bring it into schools across Pennsylvania so that students like Mike and Eddy can move beyond punishment and into a place where they belong and get along.

Free.,Death of US House member from California narrows already slim GOP majority,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/death-us-house-member-california-narrows-already-slim-gop-majority,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. California Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa has died and Indiana Republican Rep. Jim Baird was injured in a car accident, President Donald Trump said Tuesday. Speaking to a meeting of House Republicans at the Kennedy Center, Trump said he wanted to express “our tremendous sorrow” following LaMalfa’s death and said the congressman was “a fierce champion on California water issues.”“I also want to send our best wishes to Congressman Jim Baird and his wife, who are recovering from a car accident. They’re going to be okay. But they had a pretty bad accident,” Trump said. “And we’re praying they get out of that hospital very quickly. He’s going to be fine. She’s going to be fine. But it was a bad accident.”The cause and timing of LaMalfa’s death were not immediately clear on Tuesday morning. It will reduce Republicans’ already slim House majority, making it more complicated for leadership in that chamber to pass legislation that’s not bipartisan. Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation earlier this week, combined with LaMalfa’s death, decreases the GOP majority to 219 seats. Baird’s absence until he recovers and can vote in person further erodes that to 218. And it could be narrowed even more by GOP lawmakers missing votes for other reasons. Democrats control 213 House seats, giving Republican leaders next to no margin for defections on partisan bills. LaMalfa, 65, was first sworn in as a member of Congress in January 2013 and represented California’s 1st Congressional District, which covers a large section of the northeastern corner of the state. Baird, 80, has been a member of Congress for seven years, representing Indiana’s 4th Congressional District constituents in the central and northwestern parts of the state. Baird’s office released a statement shortly after Trump’s announcement, saying the congressman ""is in the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery, and he is extraordinarily grateful for everyone’s prayers during this time. “Congressman Baird looks forward to continuing his work on behalf of Hoosiers. The Office of Congressman Baird will continue to provide services and support for those who need it. Congressman Baird and his office remain steadfast in their commitment to serving constituents and focused on advocating for Hoosiers at the highest levels of government.”Johnson, Jeffries mourn LaMalfaSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., released a statement saying that “Congress is devastated to learn this morning about the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa.” “Doug was a lifelong resident of northern California and deeply loved its people. He was as fierce of a fighter for his state’s vast natural resources and beauty as we have ever known,” Johnson wrote. “We are mourning the loss of our friend and brother today and we send our respects for his life and work to his wife Jill and the LaMalfa family during this difficult time.” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York wrote in a statement that he joined “people across Northern California in mourning the untimely passing of Congressman Doug LaMalfa. “Doug and I joined the Congress as classmates in 2013, and it was an honor to witness firsthand his passion and personal resolve for more than a decade,” Jeffries wrote. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., released a written statement that he was “devastated to hear of the passing of my dear friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa.”“A fourth generation rice farmer, he fought passionately for the region’s agricultural community and small businesses, and in 2024 was elected Chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, which focuses on the priorities of Western and rural America,” Scalise wrote. “He also worked to bolster disaster recovery efforts and funding for rural schools.”National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson of North Carolina wrote in a statement that he was “deeply saddened by the passing of my colleague and close friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.” “I cherished our time serving together on the Agriculture Committee and discussing NASCAR; he was a real gearhead and motorsports fan,” Hudson wrote. “I will deeply miss my ‘amigo.’ Renee and I are praying for his beloved wife Jill, as well as Kyle, Allison, Sophia, Natalie, and all his loved ones, friends, and staff during this incredibly difficult time.”",,,,2026-01-06 11:58:46.502630

Tim Walz ending his reelection campaign in light of alleged widespread fraud in the state’s social services programs, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, who is also a Republican candidate for governor, is now seeking an audit of the Great Lakes state’s child care programs.
Nesbitt, of Porter Township, on Jan. 2, issued a letter to Michigan’s Auditor General Doug Ringler asking his office to take a look into the Michigan Child Development and Care Program housed in the relatively new state Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement and Potential, or MILEAP. While the program began in 2018, it moved to MILEAP when Gov. Gretchen Whitmer created that agency in her second term via executive order.
A message seeking comment from the department was not returned at the time of publication.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ends campaign for third term

The senator and gubernatorial candidate wrote that he wanted Ringler to take a deeper look into the program in light of what was happening in Minnesota.
Reporting from Michigan Advance’s sister publication, the Minnesota Reformer, shows that Walz, a Democrat who was the 2024 vice presidential nominee, faced headwinds after national Republicans learned about the wide-scale fraud in Minnesota’s social services programs during Walz’s tenure. That includes the Feeding Our Future scandal, in which fraudsters pocketed hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars intended to feed children during the pandemic, the Reformer reported.
It has also been reported that the national attention to Minnesota’s issues was driven by a right-wing YouTuber specifically directed to various day care centers by that state’s Republican Party.
In his letter to Ringler, Nesbitt noted that Michigan’s program is intended to assist low-income families with the cost of child care and has received more than $540 million in taxpayer support this year. 
“The lack of affordable child care is one of the greatest challenges facing families in Michigan,” Nesbitt wrote. “As such, every tax dollar lost to fraud or waste makes it even more difficult for law-abiding Michiganders to get the child care they need.”
Nesbitt also said the audit was important because of what he viewed as previous oversight failures from the Whitmer administration.

Trump […]","The Nevada State Republican Party posted this picture on social media after party chairman Michael McDonald, center, and five other Republicans signed a fake certificate in December 2020 falsely claiming that Donald Trump had won the 2020 presidential election in Nevada that Trump lost to Joe Biden.Nevada State Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald and the five other 2020 fake presidential electors from Nevada – James DeGraffenreid, Duward James Hindle III, Jesse Law, Shawn Meehan and Eileen Rice — must be celebrating today in observance of the violent attempt to overthrow an election by storming the U.S. Capitol five years ago.
Trump attorneys instructed McDonald, DeGraffenried, et al. to meet in Carson City in December 2020 and pretend Trump had won the presidential race in Nevada, even though old Joe Biden beat Trump fair and square.
Due to the patent absurdity of not only the McDonald-led cast of characters but also their empty election fraud claims, their tawdry little ceremony on Dec. 24, 2020, was mostly brushed off at the time as just another exhibition of Trump-inspired quackery.
And yet the plot to steal the election, and the January 6 insurrection that ensued, rested on the existence of fake electors from Nevada and six other states. That’s why Team Trump instructed Nevada’s fake electors to put on their pathetic little show and then send fake electoral certifications to Congress.
Under the scheme crafted largely by Trump lawyer John Eastman, Vice-president Mike Pence, while overseeing the electoral vote count, would accept the fake certificates from Nevada and other states as grounds to declare the election results in dispute and either not count them or throw the election to the House of Representatives to determine the election outcome. Under either scenario, Trump would have been declared the winner of the election he lost.
Of course it turned out Mike Pence had at least an ounce or two of something wholly undetectable in the likes of Trump, Eastman, or McDonald: patriotism. If you’ll recall, according to Trump’s followers that day, patriotism is an offense punishable by hanging.
McDonald is still the chair of the Nevada State Republican Party, and the party has an astounding preponderance of weak candidates and failed campaigns to show for it.
The most — only — high profile victory by a Nevada Republican in a competitive contest over the last ten years was Joe Lombardo’s win over former incumbent Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak in 2022. Upon securing the nomination, Lombardo’s campaign tried to get as little of Trump, or the Nevada Republican Party, on their candidate as possible, and Lombardo won  despite the state party, not because of it.
But the Nevada Republican Party’s considerable fecklessness notwithstanding, under McDonald’s leadership, it can always be relied upon to diligently and faithfully put Trump’s interest ahead of Nevada’s.
Like fake electors in other states, McDonald et al. were indicted. Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford literally could not have been slower in bringing the indictments, only to have a court rule Ford filed the case in the wrong jurisdiction. The Nevada Supreme Court overruled that decision in November, and the case is scheduled to finally be heard next month.
In 2023 the Nevada Legislature passed a law clearly and specifically outlawing fake electors. Perhaps remembering that his political career could be ended with a single social media post from Trump, Lombardo vetoed it.
Trump pardoned the 1,600 lawless insurrectionists on the ground in Washington on Jan. 6. He also pardoned the fake electors in Nevada and the other states who made it all possible. But Ford’s charges are state, not federal, so Trump’s pardon of Nevada’s electors was nothing more than a minor red meat media hit for the base.
Meanwhile, Ford hopes to be the Democratic nominee for governor against Lombardo this year. So maybe Ford will slam Lombardo for vetoing the bill to outlaw fake electors.
Then again, maybe not.
Five years after the insurrection, the most glaring thing about Nevada’s fake electors is the degree to which the state, including many of its elected officials — Republican and Democrat alike — have sought to ignore them, or if that’s not possible, then to normalize them, effectively succumbing to Trump’s attempt to deny and rewrite history.
And now, ironically thanks to a Nevada electorate whose votes Trump and Nevada’s fake electors tried to nullify five years ago, we’ve got the president to show for it.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fake-electors-bordered.jpg,,,2026-01-06 11:58:46.502630

According to a news release, a traveler from South Carolina who has been diagnosed with measles spent a night in Albuquerque, with potential exposure to others between 11:45 p.m., Dec. 28 and 7 a.m., Dec. 29 at the Quality Inn (450 Paisano St. NE).
The health department said anyone who stayed at the Quality Inn during that time period should check their vaccination status; report any symptoms in the next three weeks to a health care provider; and stay home if symptoms develop. Those symptoms include: fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes followed by a spotted rash that begins on the head before spreading to the rest of the body. People can pass measles on from four days before and after the rash begins.
“This situation reminds us there continue to be active measles cases across the United States,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine remains the best protection against measles.”

Wyoming Supreme Court rules two bans passed by state lawmakers are unconstitutional.
The post Abortion remains legal in Wyoming after state high court strikes down bans appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the state’s two abortion bans are unconstitutional, preserving a hotly contested right amid a push by legislators to end the practice in the Equality State.
In a 4-1 decision, the court agreed the bans conflict with a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution that protects individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions. That amendment, ironically, was enacted by voters after a push by conservatives in the same Legislature that’s since made repeated attempts to curtail abortion.
The ruling represents a victory for abortions rights advocates in one of the nation’s reddest states. They contend abortion bans conflict with the state’s long history of skepticism toward government involvement in medical and other personal decisions.
For abortion opponents, the decision is a bitter setback that suggests an abortion ban would require changes to the Wyoming Constitution — a more difficult hurdle than a simple majority vote in the Republican-dominated statehouse.
Wyoming’s once vaunted live-and-let-live political ethos for years thwarted legislative attempts to restrict abortion. That began to change in the years before the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed abortion rights in the U.S. since 1973.
In early 2022, Wyoming lawmakers passed a trigger law that banned abortion with Roe’s fall. But that ban did not go into effect due to a court challenge that centered, in part, on Wyoming’s 2012 constitutional amendment. 
In 2023, Republican lawmakers in the Legislature tried again, this time succeeding in passing two abortion bans. One was a fairly comprehensive prohibition that included only a few notable exceptions, such as in the case of rape or incest. A second law banned medication in abortions — the first law of its kind in the nation.
A group of abortion providers and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the bans, and Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens temporarily blocked them as the case played out. 
Finally in November, Owens ruled the bans were unconstitutional. The state, which was represented by the Wyoming Attorney General’s Office, appealed the decision to the Wyoming Supreme Court. The justices heard arguments on the case in April. 
In the meantime, Wellspring Health Access in Casper has provided abortions for women in Wyoming and neighboring states. The facility was targeted by an arsonist before it opened and later became a plaintiff in the legal challenges to the growing number of abortion restrictions passed by state lawmakers, including mandatory ultrasounds and a 48-hour waiting period passed earlier this year.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 16:06:20+00:00,CT Mirror,HHS bars Head Start providers from using ‘women’ and ‘race’ in grant applications,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/hhs-bars-head-start-providers-from-using-women-and-race-in-grant-applications/,A coalition of organizations said in court filings that Trump officials told a Head Start director in Wisconsin to cut over a dozen terms from her application.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is telling Head Start providers to avoid dozens of terms in federal grant applications, including “race,” “belonging” and “pregnant people” — a directive that could reshape the early education program.
A coalition of organizations representing Head Start providers and parents said in court filings last month that the Department of Health and Human Services told a Head Start director in Wisconsin to cut those and over a dozen other terms from her application. She later received a list with nearly 200 words the department discouraged her from using in her application, including “Black,” “Native American,” “disability” and “women.”
President Donald Trump’s administration associates the terms with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which it has vowed to root out across the government.
The guidance could lead Head Start centers to preemptively drop anything that could be seen as fitting the administration’s definition of DEI, said Ruth Friedman, who led the Office of Child Care under President Joe Biden.
“Grantees are sort of self-selecting out of those activities beforehand because of fear and direction they’re getting from the Office of Head Start that they can’t do these important research-based activities anymore that are important for children’s learning and that are actually required by law,” Friedman said.
The filings came in a lawsuit filed in April by parent groups and Head Start associations in Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials. They allege the Trump administration is illegally dismantling Head Start.
The plaintiffs say the administration is trying to force providers to change how they operate in violation of the Head Start Act, which requires directors to provide demographic information about their families, a task that becomes difficult if they are banned from using “Black,” “disability” and “socioeconomic.”
Health and Human Services officials said they do not comment on pending litigation.
Head Start centers receive the bulk of their funding from the federal government. The long-standing preschool and family support program serves babies, infants and toddlers who come from low-income households, foster care or homeless families.
Plaintiffs’ attorneys say the anti-DEI guidance has generated confusion for Head Start programs, which are operated by nonprofits, schools and government agencies. The grant application itself contains many of the banned words, asking directors to include demographic data about their community that includes estimates of the number of pregnant women and children with disabilities.
“This has put me in an impossible situation,” the unnamed Head Start director in Wisconsin wrote in the court filing. If she complies with the Head Start Act and includes the banned words in her application, she could end up losing her grant, she said. But if she follows the Trump administration’s guidance, she said she fears she’ll face penalties for violating the law down the line.
Another Head Start, located on a Native American reservation in Washington state, was told to cut “all Diversity and Inclusion-related activities,” leading it to drop staff training on how to support autistic children and children with trauma, according to the court filing. Officials there also told the director that she could no longer prioritize tribal members for enrollment — even though the Head Start Act expressly permits this. The word “Tribal” is among the disfavored terms.
For some, the new grant application rules are another attempt to undermine Head Start, a program with a history of bipartisan support that some conservatives have been attacking as problematic and ineffective.
“They don’t believe these public programs should actually be open to serving all communities,” said Jennesa Calvo-Friedman of the ACLU, an attorney for the plaintiffs. The effort to ban words from applications “is a way to gut the fundamentals of the program.”
Not long after Trump took office, his budget chief unsuccessfully tried to halt all federal grants, saying they needed to be reviewed to root out any DEI efforts. Head Start was not supposed to be part of the freeze, which was quickly reversed, but in the months afterward, grantees reported problems drawing down their funding. Some had to briefly close.
The Government Accountability Office later said the delays violated the Impoundment Control Act, which limits when the president can halt the flow of government funds.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dims.apnews-1-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-06 11:12:19.146688

The state has the nation’s fourth-highest per capita population of Native Americans, and about one in ten of the residents in its second-largest city — Rapid City, gateway to Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills for millions of annual visitors — are Native American.

Native-led tourism alliance launches ‘economic catalyst’ tours on reservations

It’s the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre, but also the American Indian Movement of the 1970s and its occupation of Wounded Knee. More recently, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe drew international attention to protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline just north of the South Dakota border and etched the phrase “Water is Life” into the cultural lexicon.
Those tribal ties help draw tourists. A survey from South Dakota Tourism in 2018 found that around 80% of visitors want a Native American “experience” during their stay. Yet the state’s nine tribal nations typically don’t see much from the billions in economic impact that tourism delivers to the state.
The South Dakota Native Tourism Alliance formed in 2019 to help bridge that divide. The nonprofit organization trains tour guides, plans tribal tour itineraries and works to develop tourism infrastructure in tribal communities.
Recently, it secured one of 10 J.M. Kaplan Innovation Prize awards, earning it $175,000 and connecting it with other early stage nonprofits across the U.S. for collaboration and guidance.
South Dakota Searchlight recently spoke with Rhea Waldman, South Dakota Native Tourism Alliance’s executive director, and Sarah Kills In Water, a Rosebud Sioux tribal member and member of the group’s board of directors.
EDITOR’S NOTE: The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What can you tell us about what you’ve done so far? Can you give us an update on your economic catalyst tours?
Kills in Water: We worked with Destination America and developed multi-reservation tours, a multi-day tour that started in the Black Hills. They came through Pine Ridge, spent two days on Rosebud and went up to Standing Rock. They ended up marketing that itinerary to a company called Trafalgar, which operates heavily in South Dakota. So that was one major win.

Our tour guide training came up out of a need for another initiative that we worked on, helping the Sicangu Oyate Treaty Council and the Wild Foundation host the Wild 12 conference last year. They brought in people from all over the world, and they wanted to hear from our youth on questions like “How is the mining in the Black Hills going to impact your youth for the next seven generations, for the foreseeable future?” 
So we went to engage with the Sicangu Youth Council, and they jumped on the opportunity. They provided a tour experience for a group of 50 international visitors at Bear Butte State Park. The kids were excited, and they were wanting to expand and do more, and so I brought them into my Trafalgar itinerary this year. They actually do the tours on Rosebud when Trafalgar comes through. 
What’s lacking in the tourism landscape today that your organization aims to improve upon?
Kills In Water: The cultural piece is so important. Having these experiences with us, provided by us, told in our voices, our stories, everything, it makes it more personal, and I think it brings the realization to our visitors that these people are still here. After all the years of government oppression and everything that’s been done to them, they’re still here, and they’re still vibrant.
Tribal people sometimes have a really bad idea when they think about tourism. They think we’re selling our culture, but that’s not what we’re doing. All we’re here to do is help tribal nations define what stories they want to tell. What do you want to share with your visitors? 
Waldman: South Dakota Tourism has been a great partner for us, and really helped us, because obviously they have a lot of data. One of those data points is that over 80% of people want to have a Native American experience when they visit South Dakota. Not even half of them actually do, though. So why don’t they do that? It’s because people don’t know where to go, where to find information.
What are the hidden gems that are already there that you point people to? 
Waldman: Every tribal nation has their own gems. The tribes along the river have some of the most beautiful scenery you can imagine. Cheyenne River has one of the biggest buffalo herds in North America. There are cultural centers that have phenomenal art, that are showcasing local artists and the breadth of the history that Native Americans have experienced.
One of the challenges comes when you think about the great American road trip. When you’re on Interstate 90 between Sioux Falls and Rapid City, none of the reservations really are right there. I live in Pierre, and even though we’re the state capital, it is actually hard to get people out here. It’s because we are 35 miles from the interstate, so it takes you at least an hour and a half to travel there and back. So how much can you see here in order for people to come? That’s even worse for the reservations, because they are not the capital, and people don’t necessarily know all the things they can do. 
What is it that this grant in particular might help you do? 
Kills in Water: The nine tribal nations in our state are so geographically spread out. We don’t always have the resources to get out and go to these tribal nations ourselves. I live in Rosebud, and unless there’s gas money or something tied to it, sometimes I can’t just go to Flandreau. Pine Ridge is close enough where I can volunteer my time, because they’re only an hour and a half from us. With these funds, I see us increasing our partnerships with each tribal nation and really strengthening our efforts that way at the grassroots level.

Waldman: The grant is unrestricted, and that is huge. We’re all aware of travel reimbursement after the fact, but if you’re living in a place where you’re maybe living paycheck to paycheck and you don’t have a thriving business yet, waiting for travel reimbursement can take a while. If you do something like gift cards for gas, that is definitely not something that you can reimburse with federal grants.
And we’re not only getting money. There are 10 different organizations that receive this innovation grant, and we are meeting with them frequently. We can learn from those other amazing entrepreneurs. In addition, the entire team at the JM Kaplan Fund are there to help us succeed, because they know they are funding early stage nonprofits. They’re there with us every step of the way. Yes, money is great and we still need more, but having people that rally for you, that are there for you, that are your family and want to see you succeed, that is really special.

(Courtesy photo)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger announced on Tuesday morning that long-time educator Jeffrey Smith would be Virginia’s next secretary of education.
The Richmond Times-Dispatch first broke the story about the announcement, as the next administration prepares to shape education and other areas of state governance for the next four years.
Smith has over 32 years of experience in public education, including 15 years as a superintendent. He led Hampton City Schools for eight years and served seven years as superintendent in the Town of West Point. He now leads the Virginia Air and Space Science Center. 
Spanberger appoints former state education secretaries to transition team

“As a mother of three daughters in Virginia’s public schools, I understand the importance of making sure Virginia’s students are set up for success and the invaluable foundation that the Commonwealth’s schools provide for our next generation of leaders,” said Spanberger in a statement. “Dr. Smith’s decades of experience leading districts in Virginia gives the Commonwealth’s students a champion who I know will work tirelessly on their behalf — and I’m excited to work alongside him to strengthen our schools.”
Once confirmed by the General Assembly, which will be under Democratic control in the House and Senate, Smith will guide education agencies and key state learning institutions, including the Virginia Department of Education, the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, museums and cultural institutions, and boards and foundations.
His career also includes work in several Virginia school divisions and teaching roles at Old Dominion University and William and Mary. 
In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly recognized Smith for his service and academic achievements during his time with Hampton City Schools, among other local, state, and national recognitions. Smith was one of four finalists for AASA National Superintendent of the Year and recipient of the Virginia Department of Education’s Mary Peake Award for Education Equity.
While at Hampton, Smith was involved with two notable accomplishments:  strengthening the division’s dual-enrollment program with the Virginia Peninsula Community College and expanding career pathways at the Academies of Hampton.
“It is an honor to serve as a member of Governor-elect Spanberger’s administration. I strongly support her Strengthening Virginia Schools Plan,” Smith said in Tuesday’s announcement. “Together, we can advance a vision for a Commonwealth that is stronger, safer, and more affordable for all Virginians, ensuring that every learner has the opportunity to achieve and succeed.”
Spanberger will be inaugurated in Richmond on Jan. 17, replacing Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who cannot run for a second consecutive term.

Gov. Delbert Hosemann speaks at a forum sponsored by Mississippi State University's Stennis Institute of Government and the Capitol Press Corps on Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, at Hal & Mal's restaurant in Jackson.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann at separate events on Monday said they plan to push for legislation this year to make it easier for K-12 students to attend schools outside their home districts. 
Hosemann, the Republican president of the Senate, said he wants a more measured policy tailored to public schools. White, the Republican leader of the House, is pushing for a more comprehensive package of policies commonly called “school choice.” 
Hosemann said at a Stennis Institute of Government Capitol Press forum that he wants the Senate to pass a measure to ease restrictions for students to attend public schools outside their districts. 
Mississippi has a very limited version of this policy already, commonly called “portability.” Students can attend schools outside their district, but the receiving and the home districts both have to agree to the transfer. 
Now, Hosemann is pushing his colleagues to remove the requirement that the home district must approve a transfer. 
“I think that’s something arcane and needs to be removed,” Hosemann said. “Where you don’t have the ability to hold a student back who wants to leave and go to another school.” 
Hosemann also said he is pushing the Senate to pass a bill that would raise salaries for K-12 teachers, as well as community college and university professors. 
White on Monday afternoon conducted a press conference in his Capitol office but blocked Mississippi Today from attending. Multiple media outlets provided audio of the press conference to Mississippi Today. 
The first-term speaker also favors legislation that would make it easier for students to transfer to other public school districts But he said on Monday that he will also advocate for legislation for taxpayers to pay for 10,000 or 15,000 students to attend any school in the state, including private schools. 
These programs are referred to as “vouchers” or “education savings accounts” in other states. Families can apply for public tax dollars to pay for education outside of traditional public schools, including homeschooling. Some of these programs are universal, meaning any student can apply. Others are limited by income or group. Mississippi has had an education savings account program for students with disabilities since 2015.
White proposed Monday that of the available slots, lower-income students who come from families making up to 300% of the median income level would receive priority. 
“The slots will be limited,” White said. “And we will receive half of the slots only for current public school kids, and the other slots will be available for any and all students in the state.” 
The speaker also said he will push for legislation to reform Mississippi’s charter-school application process, including allowing charter schools to open in any area of the state. Current state laws only allow charter schools to open in school districts with a D- or F-rating.

The Republican primary field is already crowded, featuring House Speaker Lisa Demuth; MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell; 2022 GOP nominee for governor Scott Jensen; state Rep. Kristin Robbins; and perennial candidate Kendall Qualls, who recently won a straw poll of delegates in the GOP State Central Committee. 
Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who is running for U.S. Senate, said in a statement Monday she is focused on the Senate race and will not run for governor. Former U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips said on X that he has no intention to run for governor. 
Primary elections are on Aug. 11. 
Here are some potential Democratic candidates for governor: 
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar

Amy Klobuchar has represented Minnesota in the U.S. Senate since 2007, and has handily won each of her re-election campaigns since, though the margin of victory has narrowed over time, perhaps reflecting political changes here and nationwide. In 2024, she outperformed presidential candidate Kamala Harris by more than 5 percentage points. 
A source close to Klobuchar, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said, “Sen. Klobuchar is getting outreach from people encouraging her to run, and is seriously considering it.”
Klobuchar ran in the Democratic presidential primary in 2020 but dropped out after performing poorly in early contests after some withering national press scrutiny. She wound up endorsing former President Joe Biden just before Super Tuesday.
The senior senator previously served as Hennepin County attorney, where she brought high-profile charges. That could give her a platform to talk about the public program fraud that is expected to continue to dominate the political conversation in the coming months.
Secretary of State Steve Simon

Steve Simon has been the state’s top elections administrator since 2015, among the other duties of the secretary of state. For more than a decade prior, Simon represented a west metro House district in the Legislature. 
During his time in office, Simon has battled against election misinformation among the public and high-ranking elected officials. He has refused to comply with Trump administration requests for voter rolls, calling the requests unconstitutional. 
At the 2022 state DFL convention, Simon spoke briefly about how his great-grandfather, a Lithuanian Jew, wound up in America. 
“He didn’t just emigrate to America. He fled. He fled discrimination and persecution. He was what today we would call a refugee. The year before he left for America, Jews in the Russian empire lost the right to vote.” 
Simon announced in December he would seek a fourth term as secretary of state. 
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison

Keith Ellison represented Minneapolis in Congress for 12 years before winning a narrow election to become the state’s top legal officer in 2018. In 2022, he won re-election by less than 1 percentage point. 
Ellison was the first Black person elected to statewide office and the first Muslim elected to any statewide office in the United States.
As attorney general, Ellison has taken on cases against gun manufacturers, TikTok and negligent landlords. He is part of a cohort of blue-state attorneys general that is fighting the Trump administration in the courts, suing dozens of times on a range of issues including funding cuts, trans athlete bans and immigration status checks in federal programs. 
Ellison said in October he would seek a third term as attorney general.

(Photo provided by SC Department of Motor Vehicles)COLUMBIA — When getting new license plates, South Carolina residents can choose — at no additional cost — to brag about the state’s role in winning the Revolutionary War.
Department of Motor Vehicles offices across the state began offering the commemorative plate last week as one of its two standard options, coinciding with this year’s 250th anniversary of the country’s founding.
The tag replaced the decade-old, blue-and-white plate with the state’s motto, “While I breathe, I hope,” printed above a Palmetto tree. Those license plates will remain valid until their expiration date, according to the DMV.
As per state law requiring the switch, the American Revolution tag will remain the state’s regular plate through December 2032, the 250th anniversary of the British completing their evacuation of occupied Charleston, which ended the war in the Carolinas.
Drivers can still opt for the license plate reading, “In God we trust,” with an American flag and Palmetto flag flying.
The new plate, which is nearly identical to one available by request since Jan. 1, 2022, includes an illustration of Sgt. William Jasper retrieving Fort Sullivan’s flag during the Battle of Sullivan’s Island in 1776. As the British Royal Navy bombarded the fort, Jasper grabbed the fallen flag, replaced its pole with a cannon gunner’s staff, and replanted it.
Known as the Moultrie Flag, it’s depicted on the license plate with a white crescent in one corner — copying the original flag — and the word “LIBERTY” in all caps across the bottom, which didn’t exist on the flag 250 years ago.
The only difference between the new, standard plate and the 2022 special plate is the words across the top.
The plate available for the last three years read, “250 Year Anniversary Revolutionary War.” The new one reads, “Where the Revolutionary War Was Won.”
After success at State Fair, SC250 considers how to show exhibit year-round

“It’s recognizable, and it’s one of those things where, if it’s not broken, don’t fix it,” said Molly Fortune, executive director of the SC250 Commission.
The change in wording to take credit for the nation’s independence was a late addition by the state Senate in the legislation signed by Gov. Henry McMaster last May. Senators pointed to the more than 200 skirmishes and battles fought in the state, including multiple significant fights, in proposing the tagline, which passed both the House and Senate unanimously.
Historians cite the decisive Patriot victory at South Carolina’s Battle of Cowpens in 1781 as laying the groundwork for the surrender at Yorktown in Virginia nine months later. Thomas Jefferson called the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780 “the turn of the tide of success.”
Rep. Neal Collins, an Easley Republican and the law’s main sponsor, has seen some debate online about the accuracy of calling South Carolina the place the war was won, since the final major land battle took place hundreds of miles away. That discussion is a good thing, he said.
“Hopefully that’ll get people to crack open a book or ChatGPT it and get some answers,” Collins said.
As long as people are learning about the state’s role in the Revolutionary War, the plates are serving their purpose, said Collins, who also proposed the 2021 law creating the previous special plates.
South Carolina has plenty of Revolutionary War stories, much like the other states involved, Collins said: “It’s just that over the years we haven’t marketed it as well.”
Much of the celebration for the country’s sestercentennial will center around July 4 to mark the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, but that “was really just sort of a beginning of an era,” Collins said.
The 2022 plates are still available upon request. Unlike other specialized plates, which show off emblems for businesses, nonprofits and universities, the special Revolutionary War plates are available at no additional cost, according to the DMV.
There are 1,667 of the 2022 special license plates in circulation, said DMV spokesman Mike Fitts.

(Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Jordan Chessher senses an urgency surrounding an effort to increase the criminal penalties in Kansas for child endangerment.
Fatal and near-fatal cases involving children across Kansas have stuck with him “because warning signs were missed, oversight failed or the law lacked the strength to intervene early and decisively,” he wrote in a Dec. 20 open letter to news outlets.
A bill filed in the Kansas House ahead of the 2026 legislative session may address his concerns. House Bill 2412 seeks to increase penalties for people convicted of child endangerment or aggravated child endangerment if their crimes involve children younger than 6 years old.
Chessher is the cofounder of Project Heaven, a Wichita-based grassroots group advocating for legislative changes to prevent child abuse. He said the bill, if passed into law, could save children’s lives.
“This legislation is not about punishment alone — it is about deterrence, accountability, and prevention,” he said.
Child endangerment applies when a person “knowingly and unreasonably” allows a child younger than 18 years old “to be placed in a situation in which the child’s life, body or health may be endangered,” according to state law. Aggravated child endangerment applies to the same situation but when a person recklessly causes or allows a child to potentially be placed in danger.
Typically, those situations involve drug manufacturing or use.
For children younger than 6 years old, the bill proposes upping child endangerment from a misdemeanor to a felony.
Sara Hortenstine, executive director of the Kansas State Child Death Review Board, said the board consistently has found that infants and young children are at heightened risk for serious injury and death.
That’s often because of their developmental stage, physical dependency on their caregivers, and a limited ability to seek help and protect themselves, she said.
“Recognizing this vulnerability helps ensure accountability is proportionate to the level of risk and dependency involved and supports enhanced safeguards for very young children,” Hortenstine said.
The review board sits within the Kansas Attorney General’s Office and acts as a citizen panel responsible for gauging whether state and local agencies are adequately protecting children by reviewing every child death in the state. The results of the board’s evaluation are published in an annual report.
The board’s most recent report examined deaths that occurred in 2023. Of the 361 children who died in Kansas in 2023, a toxicology screening was performed for 180 of them. There were 24 detections of marijuana, 16 of fentanyl and nine of alcohol, according to the report.
Nearly half of the 221 sleep-related sudden, unexpected infant deaths in Kansas between 2019 and 2023 involved a parent or caregiver with a history of substance use. In 12 instances, a caregiver was under the influence at the time of a child’s sleep-related death, the report said.
In more than half of all child deaths during that time period, a parent or caregiver had prior or current involvement with child protective services, according to the report.
The board outlines each year a series of public policy recommendations to improve child death investigations, enhance data collection and prevent future child deaths. Many have reappeared year after year. Modifying child endangerment statutes was not one of the recommendations featured in the 2025 report, but Hortenstine said the bill enhances legal protections for young children.
Rep. Ken Collins, a Republican and convenience store owner in Mulberry, filed the bill on Dec. 10.
In 2024, a high-profile, unlicensed day care incident led to permanent medical conditions for then-4-month-old Benny Cannon in Pittsburg, near Collins’ district.
Two day care attendants who left Cannon alone in a bouncer were sentenced earlier this year. One pleaded guilty to aggravated battery, two counts of child endangerment, aggravated child endangerment, marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia possession, according to court records. She served 60 days in jail and was given 18 months of probation along with mandatory substance use treatment and restitution payment requirement. The other pleaded guilty to three counts of child endangerment, served 30 days in jail, was given 18 months of probation and must pay restitution.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Statehouse-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 09:58:46.251936

Rising home insurance prices around the country and in New England, driven by increasing climate risk and higher rebuilding costs due to inflation and tariffs, are accelerating the FAIR Plan’s next critical juncture. 
Already, the FAIR Plan’s premiums have gone up 11 percent between 2019 and 2023 even without a rate hike, and last year it increased the amount of coverage new policyholders are required to purchase. 
Now, after the FAIR Plan saw its largest single-year jump in 2024 in new enrollees in two decades, the plan will need to decide this year whether it wants to raise the rates it charges — something that hasn’t happened in 20 years. 
“This is the tension between getting everybody insurance and what that costs,” said Charlie Sidoti, a former insurance executive who now serves as executive director of the Cambridge-based nonprofit InnSure, which works with insurers and communities navigating climate risk. “Either way, people are screwed. If the premiums provide the coverage people need in case disaster strikes, but they can’t afford it, that causes strain. If the coverage is inadequate but affordable, there’s a protection gap that could really hurt people and whole communities during the next catastrophe event.” 
Last year, the FAIR Plan, which provides home insurance for those unable to get it in the private market, launched a new requirement to raise the amount of coverage new policyholders must purchase. Those enrollees must now buy insurance that covers at least 90 percent of the reconstruction cost of their home, up from 80 percent.  
Frank O’Brien, the FAIR Plan’s general counsel, said in an interview that most other private insurers now also require coverage of at least 90 percent of the reconstruction cost and “we didn’t want to be inconsistent with the marketplace.” 
That reflects a growing tension: whether the insurer of last resort should continue to be both widely available and affordable amid rising prices and nonrenewals from private insurers. While being so accessible would help more people get needed coverage, it could also concentrate risk within the FAIR Plan among coastal properties, which are most vulnerable to severe damages from flooding, high winds, and other forms of extreme weather.  
Such a scenario would disproportionately saddle the FAIR Plan with massive losses should a major storm hit Cape Cod and Plymouth and Bristol counties. Those areas now account for 55 percent of all FAIR Plan enrollees. 
O’Brien said the decision to raise the amount of coverage new enrollees must purchase was essentially made with these tradeoffs in mind.  
“We made that change because we were growing,” he said. “And one of the concerns is that when you have a large and growing residual market, which is what the FAIR Plan is, that’s a sign that the market is not as healthy as it should be. Our ability to do things that would slow growth down is pretty limited. One of the things that we looked at, however, was this requirement. It’s not a good thing when somebody’s under-insured — when something bad happens, they get the check and can’t go rebuild their house with it.” 
The next decision in the FAIR Plan’s hunt for the affordability sweet spot will be more dramatic and impact far more people. 
A two-year ban on the FAIR Plan being able to file for a rate increase will lift in March. Any rate changes would need approval from the state division of insurance, and the FAIR Plan agreed to the two-year prohibition in 2024 as part of a package of reforms it made in coordination with regulators.  
O’Brien declined to say whether or not the plan would request a rate hike, saying that “we’re constantly evaluating where we are in the marketplace” and that it “depends on a lot of circumstances” like the plan’s costs and claims.  
The last time the FAIR Plan filed for a rate increase, in 2013, the insurance division denied it. A rate increase would likely impact all policyholders within the FAIR Plan and would be a recognition that the base cost of coverage is going up due to a higher potential for climate-driven disasters and increased repair costs. 
The churn at the FAIR Plan, accelerated by a spike in enrollment in 2024 and the expiration of the ban on a rate increase, shows how the insurer of last resort is navigating a time of change in the industry. 
The Bay State, though, is in a better spot than others. A number of private insurers remain competing for business in Massachusetts, unlike in states like California and Florida, where several companies exited altogether in the wake of catastrophic wildfires and hurricanes that prompted dramatic spikes in enrollees in their insurers of last resort. 
And the 11 percent increase in FAIR Plan premiums in Massachusetts between 2019 and 2023 is still far lower than other states’ insurers of last resort, including the 393 percent jump in California, the 116 percent spike in Georgia, the 735 percent increase in Louisiana and the 18 percent hike in Rhode Island.  
Insurance in the private market is also likely more expensive since the FAIR Plan last raised rates in 2006, though premiums have gone up in the plan despite rates remaining flat because of increases both in the risk for individual properties and of property values over time. 
One tweak that the Massachusetts FAIR Plan made years ago struck right at the heart of the tug-of-war over affordability for homeowners now versus ensuring they can rebuild later in the event of a major loss – and it’s stirring controversy today. 
In 2019, the FAIR Plan changed wording in its manual for agents and brokers that required homeowners to purchase insurance based on their home’s reconstruction cost, which is more of a “worse case scenario” of what it would take to rebuild a replica of a home after a loss, including demolition or debris removal and higher labor and material costs.  
Buying insurance based on the reconstruction cost can be more expensive than buying it based on the replacement cost, which doesn’t take those factors into account, but could offer a more accurate representation of the price of rebuilding a home after a disaster and thereby grant the homeowner better protection. (The FAIR Plan’s policy terms for home insurance, however, references replacement costs as the level to which a home must be insured.) 
Frank Lombard, a Chicopee-based independent insurance adviser, has complained to the FAIR Plan that that switch in wording paved the way for what he views as unnecessarily high insurance costs for policyholders above what the policy terms require, according to emails viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.
For two of Lombard’s clients, according to valuation documents, the difference between the replacement cost and reconstruction cost of the homes was roughly $193,000 and $644,000, respectively. The disparity between purchasing insurance based on the replacement cost and the reconstruction cost, then, would account for the significant increase in premiums those clients shouldered, he argued. 
Lombard said he has no doubt private insurers are following the same practice. The difference, he said, is that people enrolled in the FAIR Plan have nowhere else to go for coverage. 
“They’re inflating the amount of coverage that’s required,” Lombard said in an interview. “In some cases, these are retired people, or elderly households. It’s not fair.” 
O’Brien denied that that change had any impact on the premiums people are paying, arguing that the FAIR Plan treats those terms as interchangeable. He pointed to policy language that states the plan will “repair or replace” the damaged home after a loss, which O’Brien says essentially renders moot any difference between the terms. Premiums, he added, can change for any number of reasons. 
There’s some divergence among insurance experts about whether the wording in the agent’s manual would have an impact on the amount of coverage provided and the corresponding premiums that homeowners pay. 
Tristan Hormann, executive director of the Washington state FAIR Plan, said replacement and reconstruction costs are, in his experience, used interchangeably, especially when there is the “repair or replace” clause in the policy like there is in Massachusetts. 
Chris Stark, executive director of the Massachusetts Insurance Federation, said although the reconstruction cost is generally a more specific value that incorporates more of what it would cost to rebuild a damaged or destroyed home, the disparity in definitions between the terms could look different in practice: In many cases, Stark said, the two values may be similar. But the reconstruction cost of a historic Victorian-style home could be much higher than the replacement cost of that home, for instance, since there could be a large difference in costs between simply building a new home of similar square footage and building that home with today’s prices with identical Victorian style and materials. 
Still, even if it costs more to maintain coverage based on the reconstruction value, the homeowner gets more in return, he said. 
“This is likely a balance of solvency and ensuring the proper coverage for homeowners by the FAIR Plan, as was the decision to require more coverage for new policyholders, and eventually any decision to raise rates will be one, too,” he said. “We always have to balance solvency with consumer protection. In this instance, you actually are getting more protection for these changes.”  
And the FAIR Plan’s choice to use the reconstruction cost value in determining the coverage offered and the corresponding required premium is emblematic of the insurer’s larger tensions, Stark said. The plan is trying to keep insurance affordable in an era of soaring premiums while raising the level of protection for homeowners so they can be made whole should disaster strike and ensuring that the plan has the capital it needs to cover that risk and pay those claims, he added.  
“All of this is about addressing the delta that people have between what they are insured for versus what it would cost to get that home back into its pre-loss condition,” Stark said. “It’s a careful balance of having consumer access to affordable and available insurance products while at the same time making sure that they’re not risking their solvency. Collectively, these are all various decisions that help maintain that balance as much as possible with affordability always in mind, especially for the insurer of last resort.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Climate_Flooding_House_Lowell.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 09:58:46.251936

People are trickling in for lunch, served every weekday to Missourians 60 and older for an optional donation. One person asks about the soup of the day, while another donates a stack of Sunday papers. There are coupons for baby formula inside, she explains, in case anyone has family who could use them.
“Seniors need socialization,” said Diana Asher of Holts Summit, who has been attending the lunches a few times a week since moving from California in June. “Most people are busy. Seniors tend to end up alone at home one way or another, even if they have a spouse.”

Rebecca Nowlin, CEO of Aging Best, said the nonprofit, which is central Missouri’s area agency on aging, was able to keep offering all of its services throughout the 2025 federal government shutdown. But to cope with delayed reimbursements, it instituted a hiring freeze and expanded the waitlist for home chore services.
Funding delays during the shutdown forced other area agencies on aging to also cut back services or furlough staff, causing lasting harm to the agencies and the older Missourians who rely on them, agency leaders said.
Now Missouri’s 10 area agencies on aging are facing more uncertainty. Federal funding for the Older Americans Act, currently sustained by the same legislation that ended the shutdown in November, is set to expire on Jan. 30. 
“These are dollars and funds which for more than 50 years have been stable funding in the community to help seniors with day to day needs, so that they don’t have to go into a nursing home,” said Anneliese Stoever, director of the St. Louis Area Agency on Aging.
The federal law, enacted in 1965, established a national network of area agencies on aging to connect older Americans with services to help them stay safe and healthy in their homes. 
In Missouri, those services include free or subsidized home-delivered and community meals, transportation to medical appointments, to buy groceries or visit family, home modifications like grab bars and relief for family caregivers. 
All agencies have now been reimbursed for services they offered while Congress was deadlocked, said Lisa Cox, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which administers state and federal funds for the agencies. 
Cox said in an email to The Independent that the federal government has always come through with funding for the agencies.
“This has happened in the past, and funding has always continued,” Cox said. “There has been no cut to the funding to date.”
But since it takes four to eight weeks for funding to be processed at the federal and state levels after a shutdown, some agencies have only recently been reimbursed for services they provided while Congress was deadlocked.
Stoever said at the end of December that the agency was “just now receiving the dollars that are flowing as a result of the last government shutdown.”
And as agencies fight to build up their cash reserves to protect against future funding delays, some services haven’t resumed.
Most Thursdays since the end of October, there have been no weekly hot meals at the Cameron Lunch Club Senior Center.
Penny Crawford, CEO of Young at Heart Resources, the area agency on aging for northwest Missouri, said the group meals it hosted in Cameron attracted 60 to 70 people before the shutdown.
Now the Cameron senior center only serves lunches when there’s a private donation — like when a client donated $1,000 to fund a Thanksgiving lunch, complete with turkey, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole and pumpkin pie.
“She said, ‘I have to have my Thanksgiving meal here. It’s the only way I get Thanksgiving,” Crawford said. “So she [got] everyone a Thanksgiving meal, and she got to be with people.”
 Home and community-based services

Stacy Morse, executive director of the Missouri Council on Aging, said that by improving health outcomes among older Missourians, services provided by the agencies save the state money and reduce stress on rural hospitals. 
Morse added that stable Older Americans Act funding is crucial in addition to short-term sources of federal investment, like the Rural Health Transformation Program passed by Congress this summer as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Missouri has been awarded more than $216 million for fiscal year 2026 through the program, one of five potential years of funding. With the money, Missouri proposed expanding a pilot project called ToRCH, or Transformation of Rural Community Health, that put six rural hospitals in charge of local health initiatives and enabled medical and community providers to get Medicaid compensation for a broader range of preventative services.
Morse said that in order to take advantage of a future outcome-based Medicaid payment system, Missouri needs reliable support for services that keep people healthy.
Cheryl Lee, of Lamar, Missouri, for years received meal and grocery deliveries from the Region X Area Agency on Aging. Services from the agency enabled her to die at home instead of in a nursing home (photo submitted).
“We need the Older Americans Act money to support home and community-based services in order to make the ToRCH program successful,” Morse said.
Nowlin said staff of area agencies on aging, including Aging Best, are experts in connecting clients with services in their communities.
“I don’t think anybody else out there probably has the expertise of some of our people,” Nowlin said. “If you call us, they know who to talk to.”
Jennifer Shotwell, CEO of Region X Area Agency on Aging in Joplin, said meal and grocery deliveries are the only way some older Missourians can access nutritious food, especially in rural areas.
Shotwell said Cheryl Lee, a client from Barton County, for years depended on meals and groceries from the agency. The agency even delivered food for her cats.
Where she lived, outside of Lamar, Shotwell said, “they don’t have delivery. They don’t have DoorDash, no Uber.”
“We did our job,” Shotwell said, “because she passed away at home where she wanted to be and not in a nursing home.”
Morse said these services provide a lifeline to older Missourians who use them.
“Just think, for one day, what that would be like to not have access to food,” Morse said, “to not have access to transportation, to not have anybody to help you, whether it’s to open your medicine bottles or take you to the bathroom to get cleaned up.”
 Funding stress

Even without federal disruptions funding has not kept pace with increased costs and demand as Missourians age, said Julie Peetz, executive director of the Missouri Association of Area Agencies on Aging.
“I had one [agency leader] tell me recently, ‘I don’t have any more rabbits to pull out of my hat,” Peetz said. “I just can’t do more. There’s no fallback anymore.”
The total state and federal funding Missouri’s agencies received increased by only 15% from fiscal years 2019-2024, from $40.8 million to $47.1 million, according to data provided to The Independent by the association, though there were spikes due to supplementary funding during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Cox, the spokesperson for the state’s health and senior services department, said about 71% of Missouri’s funding for the agencies for fiscal year 2026, or $30.1 million, comes from the federal government. 
The agencies have begun to benefit from a state tax on insurance premiums passed by Missouri lawmakers in 2019 to help fund home and community-based services. But that new funding stream was intended to supplement existing funding sources, not replace federal contributions.
Shotwell said that during the shutdown, her agency could only keep offering lunches at its six senior centers thanks to private donations and loans from several city governments.
“I couldn’t keep assuming expenses if I had no idea when we were going to be reimbursed,” Shotwell said.
Shotwell said the agency, which serves Barton, Jasper, Newton and McDonald counties, has had to place about 40 people on a wait list for home-delivered meals.
Crawford’s agency, which serves 18 northwestern counties, furloughed half of its staff and halved its in-home services. The agency cut its program to help clients navigate Medicaid eligibility recertifications and paused transportation services.
Peetz said some furloughed staff quit.
“They’re not going to wait around a month or two months to see if they’ll have a job,” Peetz said.
Between staff losses and services that were cut, Peetz said the shutdown did “permanent damage” to agencies “and most of all to the clients.”
Stoever said her agency, one of two in Missouri that are part of a local government, was able to sustain its services throughout the shutdown partly through support from the city of St. Louis. Most agencies in the state are nonprofits.
The agency collaborated with the antipoverty and disaster relief organization Convoy of Hope to distribute 965 cases of food across 10 senior center food pantries to meet heightened demand due to the pause of monthly food benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, Stoever said. 
About 22% of Missouri’s 1.1 million residents 65 or older receive SNAP benefits, according to the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services.
As a result of the delays in federal benefits, Stoever said, the agency delivered 3,325 emergency meal boxes in November.
 Lasting effects

Agency leaders said they are adjusting their financial planning in anticipation of more frequent funding delays. 
Stoever said that due to funding uncertainty, she’s had to tell contractors and community partners that while she doesn’t anticipate cutting their funding in the coming fiscal year, she can’t increase it either. 
Shotwell said her agency is trying to increase its cash reserves, aiming to have six months in the bank rather than three. 
“Previous to this shutdown,” she said, “if I had more than three months’ worth of my expenses in the bank, I’m doing a horrible job as a nonprofit. My job is to turn dollars into services to help older adults live independently and with dignity.”
But Shotwell said the shutdown — along with inflation and increasing labor costs as Missouri has increased the minimum wage — have demanded a “paradigm shift.”
Shotwell said she is “constantly chasing grant money and fundraising” to accumulate carryover funds.
But that won’t ultimately be enough, she said.
“We can’t keep up the pace we’re at without an investment in the [Older Americans] Act,” Shotwell said.
Morse said it isn’t sustainable for Congress to keep funding area agencies on aging through temporary spending measures, called continuing resolutions. 
“We need to stop this continuing resolution business and get a budget so that [the agencies] have some defined numbers and stability,” she said.
Nowlin said that even though reimbursements from the shutdown have come through, Aging Best is still being careful with funds.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, speaks at an Aug. 4, 2025, news conference in her Anchorage office. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)It was an eventful year in national politics, and Alaska’s senior senator was often in the spotlight for bucking the Republican Party or the Trump administration.
She sat down with veteran Alaska reporter Nathaniel Herz of the Northern Journal to reflect on the last year and look forward into 2026 — in a conversation that ranges from federal funding for public broadcasting to Alaska’s 2026 U.S. Senate election to transboundary mining.
The Alaska Beacon is republishing this edited transcript of their conversation.
Nathaniel Herz: Have you seen these t-shirts yet, with this quote from you?
Lisa Murkowski: I’m looking at it. What is it? Oh, yeah. It says, ‘What’s woke about the birthday line?’
Right? What’s woke about the Talk of Alaska Merry Christmas greeting (show) today?
Nathaniel Herz: My understanding is, the genesis of these t-shirts was that you were at the public media station in Bethel, in Western Alaska, KYUK. And that this was maybe a cheeky question that you posed about their Birthday Line program, in the context of critics saying that public media is woke and liberal.
Lisa Murkowski: I’m like, ‘Yeah, really?’
Nathaniel Herz: Because the Birthday Line is, like, people calling in and wishing people happy birthday?
Lisa Murkowski: Mm hmm. ‘I want to wish my auntie in Aniak a happy birthday.’ ‘I want to wish my brother Tom downriver a happy birthday.’
Nathaniel Herz: And your point was, ‘This is not anti-Trump. This is not anti-whatever’?
Lisa Murkowski: This is not radical, woke, leftist bias. It’s just not. And people in the Lower 48 only wish that they had fun things like the Birthday Line. We could transform America with the birthday line.
Nathaniel Herz: I had a question about public media, which was effectively close to zeroed out in the federal budget last year. It seems like a lot of people had their minds made up about this issue while it was being debated. But I was questioning whether the argument that folks were making about the need and value of public broadcasting was the right one. Because there was this big emphasis on emergencies. But today, everyone gets tsunami alerts on their phones. Was there a more compelling argument than the one you guys were making that could have resonated more with folks?
Lisa Murkowski: You know, I don’t disagree with you. As I think back to how I was trying to get people, like, exercised about it — it was really convenient, oddly enough, to have had that massive earthquake over in Russia, and the impact on the tsunami.
But as I think about the real value — the real value is the ability to connect people within their communities.
I think particularly, the role that KYUK would have played in this whole (Western Alaska) typhoon incident. Yeah, we know that everybody from (the village of) Kipnuk is evacuated. But you have so many people, like: ‘Well, my brother was born here in Kipnuk, but he’s living down in Kasigluk.’ And the way that people just checked in with one another was by listening to public radio.
It’s not necessarily the Birthday Line. It’s like, oh, you knew the generator has been out in this town for two weeks now. So, you know that you’re going to call your brother and say, ‘How you doing?’
I think that’s the type of thing where, in Alaska, particularly, where you don’t have roads that connect people, this public media is your connector. It’s your communications connector. Maybe it’s been replaced a little bit by Facebook. I’m not a Facebooker, so I don’t know. But I think it’s the connections, and that’s why people in rural America understand, a little bit more, the value of public media. Because they, too, need those connections
Nathaniel Herz: There’s this year of funding through the Bureau of Indian Affairs that Alaska’s junior senator, Dan Sullivan, I think, helped make happen, which is supporting some Alaska stations.
Lisa Murkowski: It was (South Dakota Sen.) Mike Rounds who made it happen.
Nathaniel Herz: What’s your sense of the outlook for whether you can get Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding, or some sort of recurring federal funding, back for stations once that first year expires?
Lisa Murkowski: We are working to, kind of, reexamine, and we’ve been working directly with the corporation. They’ve got a big decision to make as to whether they even remain in existence. And my pitch to them — I actually talked with their board a couple of weeks ago — was like, ‘We know how we’re going to limp through this next year. But I need you to exist for a little bit longer, until we can figure out if we can get more predictable funding streams. If it’s a more reduced version of what we’re seeing at the federal level — which I believe it will be — but it is still somewhat reliable, then you can kind of piece in the other things after that.’
So, I am not convinced that it’s going to be through what the Bureau of Indian Affairs is doing. BIA actually called up the corporation and said, ‘We have no clue how to implement any of this.’ For lack of a better word, ‘Can we contract with you?’
I mean, this is how bizarre the whole thing is, and how stupid it is, and what a waste of money it was. But this is how they got Sen. Rounds to stand down from his opposition. ‘Your tribal stations, we’ll support them.’ But I think, initially, the commitment was going to be, they were going to support the tribal stations without a one year limitation. So, I think he kind of got ripped off, myself.
Nathaniel Herz: Did the junior senator from Alaska and the representative for all Alaskans miss an opportunity to be more outspoken and to have made an impact on the outcome here?
Lisa Murkowski: There were a lot of other issues that were going on. But this place was electric with the buzz about funding for public media. And I don’t think it was reserved just for the conversations that I was part of. It was a big deal. People would come in and they wanted to talk about health care, they wanted to talk about energy. And it was like, ‘Oh, and, don’t forget, this is important.’ So, I don’t know. I don’t understand how you can say you support public broadcasting and then you don’t support public broadcasting when it’s in front of you.
Nathaniel Herz: There has been a ton of speculation about Democratic former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola and what she’s going to do, as far as running for Alaska governor or U.S. Senate. I’ve been hearing increasingly about the potential for her to run for Senate against Sullivan. What kind of position would that put you in, given that you work with Sullivan on a day-to-day basis but have also supported Peltola in the past?
Lisa Murkowski: Well, it’s not so much about me. That’s a hard race. Sen. Sullivan is coming up on finishing two terms, and not without significant successes. So, anybody who’s thinking about taking him on, I think, is setting themselves up for a very, very hard and a very expensive race.
You know, I made it very clear, when Nick Begich was running against Mary (in 2024) — I said, ‘No offense to you, Nick, but Mary has been my longtime friend, and I’m going to support her.’
If she were to run against my colleague, yeah: It puts me in a difficult spot. But I also think it puts a lot of Alaskans in a difficult spot. Mary, not unlike me, is able to attract support from both sides, right? And granted, it’s early right now. But my sense is that Dan is doing a pretty good job of shoring up this support from not only traditional Republican voters and donors, but from many who kind of view themselves more independently.
Nathaniel Herz: He’s trying to broaden his base a little bit.
Lisa Murkowski: I think that will put people in a spot where it’s like, ‘Yes, I may have supported you (Peltola) when you were running for the House. But we’ve got a different scenario here.’ So, I think it would be hard. I think it’d be really hard.
Nathaniel Herz: Do you feel like you could say at this point whether you’d support Mary if she made that decision?
Lisa Murkowski: No, I can’t say that I would support, no.
My hope is that we have an election where we recognize the value of the individuals that are running, the contributions that they’ve made, and we don’t get into this nasty, going-at-one-another’s-throats campaigns. I really don’t want to see that. I don’t think Alaskans want to see that.
Nathaniel Herz: Would you like to see Mary run?
Lisa Murkowski: For Senate, for governor, for house?
Nathaniel Herz: For Senate.
Lisa Murkowski: I think it would be a very, very, very hard race. I think it’d be hard on people in this state. And again, I don’t like the idea of, just, a really nasty, nasty race at the Senate level. I have said many times very publicly that Mary is my friend. I want Mary to do what’s going to make Mary happy. And only Mary can determine that.
Nathaniel Herz: My sense, from having done some reporting on her choices here, and from reading others’ reporting on it, is that there is very clearly a dynamic when it comes to the national Democrats that have pushed her to run for U.S. Senate. And that perspective is not about Mary, it’s not about Alaska, it’s about the big picture sort of politics.
Lisa Murkowski: Just put a name to it. (U.S. Senate Democratic leader) Chuck Schumer would like to be in the majority. And he’s got to figure out where he picks up more votes. And so, the pressure to get a Democrat who has that level of notoriety, public support — he’s going to weigh in and promise, probably, the sun, the moon and the stars to her.
But it’s one thing to go through a campaign. I have said many times, you know, ‘Well, I may not always agree with some of the decisions that come out of the Trump administration, or from my Republican leadership.’ I have no desire or design or intention of being in a caucus that is led by Chuck Schumer.
I think it would be hard. I think it would be really, really hard for Mary Peltola, or any Democrat from Alaska, to be in a caucus like we currently have with Schumer as the leader over there. I don’t think it would work for any Alaskan.
Nathaniel Herz: Change of subject. We’ve been doing some reporting on transboundary mines — those on the Canadian side of the border, in watersheds that flow into Alaska. You’ve been pretty consistent in your support for resource development inside Alaska, and haven’t necessarily expressed those same kinds of concerns about mining projects here, even as others have expressed concerns about them.
What’s different about these projects in Canada compared to the ones in Alaska that are making you feel more compelled to speak on behalf of folks who are concerned about them?
Lisa Murkowski: It’s an easy question, and the answer is, Tulsequah Chief. (Tulsequah Chief is an abandoned mine in Canada that has been leaching pollution into a watershed that drains into Alaska.)
For how many years? Well, it’s been at least 25, because I was in the state Legislature when I first heard of what we were dealing with, coming from the Canadian side. And not only a level of contamination that was basically left unchecked, but just a whole series of finger pointing. Promises that they were going to address it, and no delivery.
In that instance, we saw, just, a complete failure, and a failure that went on for decades to the point where, in British Columbia, they know that they have got to address it. They know that for projects going forward, they’re kind of stained by the operation there, and so they’re making the same promises, ‘Our environmental regulations are tough. We’re going to be good stewards.’ But it’s really hard when they have failed to keep their word.
I look to the requirements that we have on our side of the border. They’re much more stringent than the Canadians’. And so, I think that’s where you have the difference.
We made some headway during the Walker administration, when Byron Mallott was lieutenant governor. I think we had a real good level of communication going on for the first time in a while. (But) we’ve kind of pulled back from that. And it’s been tough to get the U.S. State Department involved. And I don’t feel like we’re going to have that much luck with this particular State Department, so we’re exploring other ways to get the attention of Canada on, just, the obligations.
Nathaniel Herz: Like what?
Lisa Murkowski: I mean, noodling. Maybe we incorporate some things on, you know, from a tariff perspective. We’ve been doing kind of the same thing for a while, and we haven’t really gotten the attention to it.
Nathaniel Herz: The idea being that tariffs are a tool that could be used to get their attention.
Lisa Murkowski: Yeah. And we haven’t explored it any further than that. But again, we’re just kind of spitballing.
Nathaniel Herz: It’s an idea. It’s not legislation that’s drafted.
Lisa Murkowski: Yeah.
Nathaniel Herz: I get the sense that you experienced a lot of pressure, and had to do a lot of work, in this past year. And I’m just curious, looking back on it, if you would say this was the most difficult year you’ve experienced in D.C., or if you wouldn’t go that far.
Lisa Murkowski: I don’t know if it’s been the most difficult year. But I can tell you that I am so happy to be having the door of 2025 close on my butt, and I’m done with it.
It has been — it’s been a challenging year, and a lot of it has to do with, just, the unknowns that were in front of us. You have a new administration coming in, and that’s always different. But there was just a lot that was coming before us that caused anxiety with a lot of people — whether it’s anxiety about, you know, ‘My health insurance is going to triple in cost, and so I’m stressed out about that.’ Or, you know, ‘We’re in the middle of a government shutdown, and I’m having to work, but I’m not getting paid, and it’s costing me 100 bucks to fill up my truck to get into work, and I still have to pay childcare.’ And the uncertainty that comes about when you had all of the DOGE rifts early on, and people not knowing what their situation was going to be.
We received all of that, as incoming. People wanting answers on their grants, to know whether or not they needed to lay off an extra staff person, or whether something is coming in. And it was hard. It was just, emotionally, a hard year for a lot of Alaskans. And maybe it’s because I’m a very empathetic person: I don’t want people to be anxious that way. I don’t want them to be suffering. I don’t want them to feel like this is a really bad place for them, their family. And so, I kind of absorbed a lot of that, to kind of carry it. And so, it’s been a hard year, because there’s just been so much uncertainty.
Nathaniel Herz: Does it push you one way or the other, as far as your desire to do this for another six years when we get to 2028 and your re-election?
Lisa Murkowski: It’s hard, because the harder the job is, the more you realize why it’s so important that you’re there doing the hard job, if that makes any sense. It just does.
I take really seriously the responsibility that I have to the Constitution, to the oath of office that I have made. And that sounds maybe a little bit old fashioned. But I don’t get to sit in this office just because we pay the rent every month. It is a privilege that has been given, because people have asked me to try to help them. And part of that means that you have to stand up for what you think is right.
And when an administration of your own party is doing something that either you don’t feel is right, or you don’t feel comports with their authorities under the Constitution, there’s a responsibility to stand up. And that can be hard.

The top artificial intelligence and tech companies in California may be swimming in cash for now, but as skepticism grows over whether this current AI boom will continue or bust, so do concerns over the state’s budget and its reliance on the AI industry.
As CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay explains, California’s biggest source of revenue is personal income tax. In addition to base wages, many tech companies pay employees in stock options, which when fully vested and owned by employees are treated like ordinary income for tax purposes. Companies pay withholding taxes on some of that income to the state and U.S. governments.
The revenue paid from these taxes by some of the state’s biggest tech companies is expected to make up about 10% of all income tax withholding this year, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. As California faces a projected $18 billion deficit this year (more on that below), the state’s financial outlook is partly tied to these AI companies.

Chas Alamo, LAO’s principal fiscal and policy analyst: “We’re seeing a real boost to income-tax receipts because of this — for a relatively small number of employees. If the AI market were to deteriorate, we could see these withholdings decline.”

That’s because other aspects of California’s economy, such as job growth and wages, remain stagnant or are declining: In September California’s unemployment rate rose to the highest in the country, and from 2024 to 2025, the number of Bay Area tech jobs decreased. Some tech companies, such as San Francisco-based Salesforce, cite AI as a reason why they must layoff employees. 

Jeff Bellisario, executive director of the think tank Bay Area Council Economic Institute: “Tech booms in the past have led to an employment boom. This doesn’t feel like that.”

Coming soon: The last Newsom budget

Speaking of the state budget, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday will unveil his preliminary spending plan for 2026-27 — his last as California’s governor. With an $18 billion deficit projected for the fiscal year, how Newsom plans to handle the deficit could have notable implications for his expected presidential bid, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.
The deficit is a result of the state’s escalating spending, federal funding cuts and rising economic insecurity under President Donald Trump. State Republicans and other Newsom critics also blame the deficit on Newsom’s mismanagement. 
To close the gap, state leaders could walk back some of last year’s funding commitments. Medi-Cal is also California’s most expensive program, though Newsom has not indicated whether he’ll target it for cuts. But as a lame-duck governor eyeing the presidency, Newsom would be even less inclined to enact major policy changes to address the state’s long-term budget issues, political strategists say.

Garry South, longtime Democratic consultant: “It’s not an uncommon occurrence in California for a departing governor to leave a note on the new governor’s desk that they’ve got a budget deficit.”

Most Altadena residents still displaced, still awaiting utility settlements

Utility company Southern California Edison has paid out just 82 victims of the Eaton Fire through its wildfire recovery compensation program, despite drawing in nearly 1,800 customers into the program, writes CalMatters’ Malena Carollo.
A year ago, the deadly wildfire killed 19 people and destroyed over 9,000 structures in Los Angeles County. About 80% of Altadena residents are estimated to still be displaced as of October. Though an official cause has yet to be determined, federal prosecutors cite faulty Edison equipment for the fire. 
To settle numerous lawsuits against the company, Edison launched a compensation program two months ago. Survivors have criticized the program for excluding some residents, underpaying others and requiring participants to waive their right to sue the company.
Edison offered a total of $34.4 million to settle the 82 claims, with half of the claims for total losses, and the others related to smoke and ash damage.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: As Newsom kicks off his last year as governor, California’s intractable issues not only serve as a potential drag on his presidential campaign, but they also color the campaigns of his would-be successors.
The attention brought to incarcerated firefighters during last year’s L.A.-area wildfires showed that people want to see second chances given to incarcerated people working to turn their lives around, writes Jose Angel Amezcua, a formerly incarcerated firefighter from Salinas.

As talk of a possible AI bubble grows, so does uncertainty around an important source of California tax money.


As California becomes more dependent on tax revenue from the tech industry, its stake in the health of the artificial intelligence industry has grown.
The state is seeing financial benefits from the AI boom, a new analysis by the Legislative Analyst’s Office shows. But the boom raises questions: Will it continue to be accompanied by a decline in tech and other jobs? Is it a bubble? 
Tax revenue from stock-option withholding paid by some of the state’s biggest tech companies made up about 10% of all income tax withholding in 2025, estimated Chas Alamo, the principal fiscal and policy analyst with the LAO. Alamo looked at tech companies’ public financial filings and other data through the second quarter of 2025. That figure would be about the same as 2024, and is up from more than 6% just three years ago, when he first did the analysis.
The state’s biggest source of revenue is personal income tax. It’s common for tech companies to pay employees in stock options in addition to their base wages. Stock options that have vested and are fully owned by employees are treated like ordinary income for tax purposes, so companies pay withholding taxes on some of that income to the state and U.S. governments. 
Shining a spotlight on where the state’s tax revenue comes from is especially timely, when it needs all the revenue it can get. California is expected to have a nearly $18 billion budget deficit this year, with the state expecting to have to fill funding gaps because of cuts by the Trump administration. But the state’s growing reliance on AI-driven revenue is risky for two reasons: fears that the technology is overhyped, and because AI’s rise threatens livelihoods.
Alamo based his analysis on the performance of the state’s five most valuable tech companies by market value: Apple, Google, Nvidia, Broadcom and Meta. Shares of Nvidia, Broadcom and Google did especially well in 2025: They rose 25%, 46% and 59% for the year, respectively. Alamo also included Intel, Cisco, AMD, Intuit, Paypal, Applied Materials and Qualcomm in his analysis because they paid substantial amounts of withholding on their employees’ stock options.
“We’re seeing a real boost to income-tax receipts because of this — for a relatively small number of employees,” Alamo told CalMatters. “If the AI market were to deteriorate, we could see these withholdings decline.” 
In other words, if the AI bubble pops, California could see a steep drop in tax revenue. That’s because there has been little job growth and wages are not rising, Alamo said, adding that the analyst’s office has been raising its concern over “the stagnant nature of the state’s labor market and broader economy” for the past couple of years. In September, the most recent data available, California’s unemployment rate rose to 5.6%, the highest among U.S. states.

‘AI is not a job-gainer’
Despite the AI boom, the number of tech jobs in the Bay Area actually decreased from September 2024 to August 2025, according to the latest analysis by the Bay Area Council Economic Institute, a think tank supported by the Bay Area Council, a business coalition. Jobs in the information industry were down 1.3% over that period, while jobs in professional and business services fell 1.5%. Some tech companies, such as San Francisco-based Salesforce, mentioned AI as a factor when they disclosed layoffs of thousands of employees. 
“Right now, on net, AI is not a job-gainer,” said Jeff Bellisario, executive director of the think tank. “The bigger question for us is, you put aside (tech companies’) valuation and think about the number of people employed in these companies.” 
Another analysis of employment data by the California Business Roundtable’s information arm, the California Center for Jobs and the Economy, shows a loss of more than 130,000 jobs in high tech, including manufacturing jobs, through the first quarter of last year. 
“Tech booms in the past have led to an employment boom,” Bellisario said. “This doesn’t feel like that.”
There’s no consensus about whether this tech boom is set to go bust anytime soon. Some of the biggest AI optimists include Jensen Huang, chief executive of chipmaker Nvidia, who told investors in November: “There has been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” 
Another optimist is Dan Ives, longtime tech analyst and managing director at Wedbush Securities. 
“This is not a bubble,” he told CalMatters. “This is Year 3 of an 8- to 10-year buildout of the AI revolution.” Ives said AI could be huge for U.S. innovation, and that this moment in time reminds him “much more of a 1996 moment than a 1999 or 2000 moment.” 
Bubble back-and-forth
In the mid-1990s, widespread adoption of personal computers and the advent of the graphical web browser paved the way for the dot-com boom and gave rise to companies such as Google, Netflix and PayPal. But by 2000 or shortly afterward, after the founders of those companies made their fortunes, many other internet companies had gone out of business — some in spectacular flameouts, such as Webvan or Pets.com.

Today, there are signs that there are too many startups in certain subsectors, according to analysts at PitchBook, which tracks public and private capital markets. Among the ones they mentioned in their 2026 outlook: AI scribes in health care, which automatically generate medical notes; aerial defense drones; content development in gaming; personal assistant bots; and more. The analysts warned investors that startups would really need to differentiate themselves to bring value.
Researchers for Allianz Trade, the global insurance company, wrote in a November brief: “The financial market frenzy over AI shows classic signs of an asset bubble: widespread consensus, unproven valuations and returns at times detached from earnings.” The researchers also said they were watching a lot of corporate spending on AI as concerns grow around tightening energy constraints. AI is driving demand for data centers, which are straining the electric grid.
Discussion about a bubble aside, some tech-friendly experts point out that California’s reliance on AI means the state should help the sector succeed, such as by not overregulating it. 
“What’s important to remember is that California’s social safety net depends on a healthy tech industry, “ said Kaitlyn Harger, an economist for Chamber of Progress, a think tank funded by the tech industry. The financial cushion tech provides helps the state fund public-sector jobs, health services, education, social services and more, Harger said.

As Gov. Gavin Newsom prepares to release his spending plan this Friday, a projected $18 billion deficit awaits. Will he raise taxes or cut spending? Either could spell trouble for Newsom’s legacy. 


In 2019, first-year Gov. Gavin Newsom inherited a state flush with cash. With a $21.4 billion budget surplus to play with, an ambitious Newsom invested billions in affordable housing, child care and health care expansion while paying down the state’s debt and shoring up reserves. 
The next governor won’t be that lucky.
When Newsom unveils his last spending plan as governor Friday, he will do so with the spectre of a projected $18 billion deficit — the result of the state’s fast-growing spending, federal funding losses and heightened economic uncertainties under President Donald Trump’s administration.
The deficit could balloon to $35 billion annually in the next few years if state leaders don’t pursue long-term solutions, namely making sustainable revenue increases or cutting spending, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the nonpartisan fiscal adviser to lawmakers. 
But neither will be appealing options to Newsom and legislative leaders this year. 
They have repeatedly resisted increasing taxes on average Californians and high-income earners alike — a politically dicey pitch to make in a state with high tax rates and increasing revenue. Spending cuts are equally painful to swallow, especially for Democrats running for re-election in November who have fought to expand services, such as Medi-Cal, that may now be rolled back. 
For Newsom, a lame-duck governor with presidential aspirations, there is even less incentive to address the state’s long-term budget health through major policy changes, political strategists say. 
“It’s not an uncommon occurrence in California for a departing governor to leave a note on the new governor’s desk that they’ve got a budget deficit,” said longtime Democratic consultant Garry South.
But how Newsom tackles the structural deficit will almost certainly have implications for his expected presidential bid. State Republicans, such as Assemblymember David Tangipa of Fresno, are already blaming the budget problem on Newsom’s mismanagement. “A Newsom presidency would be a fiscal and governance disaster of historic proportions,” Tangipa wrote in a December op-ed.
It’s the fourth consecutive year in Newsom’s tenure that the state is projecting a deficit even as revenue grows. In the past, state Democratic leaders resorted to temporary fixes such as internal borrowing, deferring payments, one-time cuts and drawing from California’s rainy day fund to avoid cutting into the social safety net. 
But that cushion is deflating: The state’s reserve stands at $14 billion, half its peak balance, after two years of withdrawals. State leaders have borrowed more than $20 billion from other state funds, debts that will come due in later years. Continuing to rely on those options would leave the state “undeniably less prepared” for an economic downturn, the LAO warned. 
“Eventually you are going to run out of Band-aids,” said Steve Maviglio, a Democratic strategist who worked for then-Gov. Gray Davis during a massive budget deficit. “(Newsom) has used every trick in the book, and after a certain point, there’s nothing left.”
More health care cuts to come?
Newsom has not indicated whether he’ll consider cuts to Medi-Cal, the state’s primary health insurance program for low-income residents. But as the state’s most expensive program, it is an attractive target. More than half of the $200 billion program’s funding comes from the federal government. 
Last year, as Newsom and legislators scrambled to close a $12 billion budget gap, they froze new Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrants, charged immigrant enrollees a $30 monthly premium and delayed cutting certain benefits. The cost of Medi-Cal has been rising faster than expected, forcing the state Legislature to allocate $6.2 billion midyear to prevent a shortfall. 
The decision was contentious, with some health care advocates and Democratic lawmakers slamming their leaders for creating a “two-tiered health care system” that deemed immigrants less worthy of quality coverage. 
“That was an incredibly disappointing backslide,” said Amanda McAllister-Wallner, executive director of Health Access California, which advocates for universal health care.
This year, Trump’s budget reduced the federal government’s share of funding to Medi-Cal, requiring the state to pay more to provide the same benefits. California is projected to spend at least $1.3 billion more to implement that change, a figure that could reach $5 billion by fiscal year 2029-30, the LAO estimated.

Assemblymember Mia Bonta, an Oakland Democrat who chairs the Assembly Health Committee, said solving the state’s budget crunch shouldn’t come at the expense of health care.
“California needs its state and federal leaders to look for more innovative solutions to fill the gaps, make health care affordable, and keep our families healthy,” she said in a statement that did not offer specific alternatives. 
Any cuts to Medi-Cal could bring political consequences for Democrats who often pride themselves on expanding social services. Rolling back Medi-Cal could hurt Newsom’s legacy, too, since it was under him that the state began offering Medi-Cal to immigrants.
“Democrats are the party of expanding health care,” Maviglio said. “To slash it goes against everything they stand for.”
McAllister-Wallner acknowledged she isn’t optimistic about the budget outlook. But she said she hopes the state finds new revenue through taxing corporations instead of making cuts to vulnerable populations.
If “we are addressing this through cuts only, and cuts to the most vulnerable, that’s … not the leadership that we are looking for,” she said.
State leaders could also walk back some of last year’s funding commitments in other areas. While state lawmakers negotiated $500 million for homelessness to counties and delayed it until next year, it is not guaranteed. Newsom, who has blamed the state’s homelessness problem on local governments, could withhold the money. 
Newsom also promised last year he’d reach a deal with Bay Area transit advocates over state funding to save the area’s transit net from collapsing. But last month, in light of the budget shortfall, Newsom urged advocates to dip into previously allocated dollars to save the regional transit network, instead of a $750 million loan the advocates had requested.
Taxing the rich a nonstarter for Newsom
It’ll be hard to muster the political will in Sacramento to raise taxes. 
Former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Los Angeles Democrat running for state superintendent of public instruction, said he’s long supported higher taxes on industries that have “skated away from taxation for a long time.” 
But even the most progressive Democrats in California have had little appetite to raise taxes, he said, because many represent affluent areas such as Silicon Valley where their wealthy donors live. 
Even when the state faced a projected $56 billion deficit over two years in 2023, Rendon said Democrats were “shrugging” at the problem and pointing to the state’s reserves as a solution, which he said reflected a culture of reliance on the rainy day fund.
This year, Newsom has already spoken out against a proposed labor-backed wealth tax ballot measure, consistent with his past opposition to similar proposals. 
The ballot measure, titled “The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act” and filed with the state attorney general’s office in October, seeks to tack a one-time 5% tax on those with a net worth of at least $1 billion and use the money to fund the state’s health care and education programs. The effort is led by the SEIU-UHW, a powerful labor union representing health care workers, and St. John’s Community Health, one of the largest nonprofit health care providers in Los Angeles County.
State. Sen. Roger Niello, a Roseville Republican and vice chair of the Senate Budget Committee, applauded Newsom’s opposition to the proposed tax increase. 
“To have a situation where we have developed an increasing deficit in the face of an economy that is not in recession, and revenues are increasing, it would seem to be silly to solve that by further increasing revenue,” he said. 
While taxing the rich is a popular Democratic talking point, backing a proposal like that could mean alienating the wealthy donors Newsom will likely rely on for his presidential run. 
There would also be no political gain for Newsom in his last year to stabilize the state’s progressive tax structure, which heavily relies on high-income earners, despite him promising to do so when he took office.
“He’s going to make more enemies doing it than he would not doing it,” Maviglio said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The moment Gov. Tim Walz was cooked was little remarked upon at the time, but in retrospect illustrates how he and his administration were sleeping through an enveloping crisis. 
At the late 2024 budget forecast, he said disability and autism services were driving state government spending beyond expectations. When he was asked about potential fraud in the autism program — about which we’d reported an FBI investigation six months prior — he seemed unfamiliar. I traded texts with an incredulous reporter who was there and wound up publishing a column called, “Minnesota: an easy mark.” 
More recently, Walz faced the full force of the right-wing propaganda machine in the past two months. It was a frightening sight to behold, and a healthier democracy would never be host to such a parasitical malignancy. 
Although restoring American democratic habits of mind to eviscerate that propaganda machine should be on our lengthy, long-term to-do list, the lesson here for me is that the most underrated tool in the political toolbox is … governing. 
Deadly dull, I know, but the word governor even has the word “govern” in it: competently administering programs to help people who need it; ensuring Minnesota’s children are learning literacy and numeracy; and managing the state’s vast infrastructure assets. That’s the job. 
Former St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, another one-time rising star in Minnesota politics, recently faced the same sort of governing reckoning as Walz, when Mayor Kaohly Her pulled off an upset November victory promising to make stuff work again. May Democratic elected officials everywhere take notice. 
We live in perilous times, no question, but Minnesotans are right to expect a minimum level of competency in these matters of public administration. It’s especially important for the party of government, i.e., the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, to pay attention to details, like whether a 3,000% increase in spending on the autism program is reasonable, especially when some of the providers had ties to Feeding Our Future. 
Tim Walz is at heart a decent man, and he doesn’t deserve what’s been thrown at him in recent weeks — especially a despicable allegation leveled by the president of the United States and the odious propagandist Nick Shirley that Walz was involved in the assassination of former House Speaker Melissa Hortman. 
He made some mistakes, but he’s not evil, unlike some of the loudest and most influential voices in American politics today, whose greed and lust for power are boundless. 
Walz’s first term was marked by almost constant crisis, none of it his doing. He was a mostly steady hand, even as Republicans came to despise him during the pandemic and the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd.
His second term comprised major legislative accomplishments — for which the credit mostly belongs to Hortman and the late Sen. Kari Dziedzic — as well as his (again, in retrospect) disastrous candidacy for vice president. All the while, thieves were stealing the people’s money with gusto.
Walz has served the community of Mankato, the people of Minnesota and his country. 
And now he has saved us from what would have been a deeply divisive campaign, and which would have put the state of Minnesota under federal siege. 
Unlike former President Joe Biden, who doomed his party and the country with his insistence on running for a second term, Walz is stepping aside before any more damage is done to his state and the DFL. He says he’ll focus all his energies on cleaning up the mess. 
He deserves our thanks for that service and for making this decision.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_9328-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for Utah News Dispatch, image courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)After President Donald Trump returned to the White House last January and launched an aggressive immigration crackdown, at least 3,040 immigration arrests have happened in Utah — more than double the number of arrests under former President Joe Biden’s administration in 2024.
Of those, slightly more than half of the arrests in Utah last year — 55% or 1,685 — have been of people with criminal convictions. But that’s not so for the other 45%.
About 27.4% or 832 arrests were of people with what immigration officials categorized as having pending criminal charges at the time of their arrests. And the other 522 arrests — making up about 17% — were detained solely for alleged immigration violations. That’s more than six times the number of immigration arrests in Utah of people with no criminal record (82, or a 7% share) under former President Joe Biden’s administration in 2024.
That’s according to data obtained through public information requests and litigation by the  Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers that collects and shares anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets, and compiled into a dashboard developed by Relevant Research, a research group focused on immigration data. 
The dashboard includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest data dating back to September 2023 and through Oct. 15, 2025. Monthly arrest data in that time frame show a clear uptick in ICE arrests starting last January and continuing through 2025, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data obtained and processed by the Deportation Data Project, and analyzed by Utah News Dispatch. 



Because about 16% of the government data provided to the Deportation Data Project is missing state information, the number of immigration arrests in Utah may be higher.
Through 2025, the share of arrests of people in Utah solely for alleged immigration violations and no pending or criminal charges have also grown compared to 2024.
From September 2023 to December 2024, 1,457 immigration arrests took place in Utah, according to the dashboard. Of those, 71% (1,034) were of people with criminal convictions. About 22% (322) were of people with pending criminal charges, and less than 7% (101) were solely for alleged immigration violations. 
The data paints a statistical picture of ICE operations in Utah. Under Trump, ICE arrests of all types are up — and a majority include those with criminal convictions. But even if it’s a smaller percentage, there’s a growing share of people arrested by ICE with no criminal record. 
Notably, Utah’s share of immigrant arrests solely for alleged immigration violations is smaller than the national share of those arrested with no criminal record, which makes up roughly one-third of immigrants arrested nationwide. 
While high-profile ICE operations in major cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Massachusetts have resulted in more than half of those arrested with no criminal record, according to The New York Times, operations in the red state of Utah haven’t been as aggressive.

However, the numbers only go so far to tell the story of what’s been happening in the Beehive State, where ICE operations have largely flown under the radar — except for certain arrests that have sparked outcry. 
Among them was an arrest of a woman at the Salt Lake City International Airport — which went viral after a video posted on social media showed four plain-clothes ICE officers take her away as she screamed for help. 
In the state’s Democratic stronghold of Salt Lake City, leaders condemned the arrest. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said she was left “aching from the fear and pain these types of operations keep striking in my heart and the hearts of so many of us.” 
‘Worst of the worst’
While ICE officials under Trump have said they’re targeting the “worst of the worst,” critics including immigrant advocates and attorneys in Utah have criticized the Trump administration’s approach. 
They say the federal government’s tactics have been “broad” and “haphazard,” sweeping up too many otherwise law-abiding people while the nation’s immigration system remains broken and difficult to navigate.
Utah News Dispatch sent a request for comment to the Department of Homeland Security pointing to the data that shows arrests of all types are up in Utah, but also asking about the growing percentage of people in Utah who are being arrested solely on alleged immigrant violations. The department issued a statement from Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs, that has been provided to other news outlets maintaining the Trump administration is focused on “the worst of the worst.” 
“This story only reveals how the media manipulates data to peddle a false narrative that DHS is not targeting the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said. “Nationwide our law enforcement is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens — including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.”
She added: “70% of illegal aliens ICE arrested across the country have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges just in the U.S. This statistic doesn’t account for those wanted for violent crimes in their home country or another country, INTERPOL notices, human rights abusers, gang members, terrorists, etc. The list goes on.”

The Department of Homeland Security statement also pointed to a list of press releases it said were examples of “non-criminals” arrested by ICE that are wanted for crimes allegedly committed outside of the U.S. 
The Department of Homeland Security has also created a “worst of the worst” dashboard to highlight arrests. As of Monday, about 250 arrests were listed on that dashboard from Utah. The dashboard lists their name, city where they were arrested, and what they were convicted of, according to the Department of Homeland Security. 
The convictions listed next to some of the highlighted arrests on the “worst of the worst” dashboard range from homicide, assault, sexual assault and drug trafficking. Some convictions listed, however, include nonviolent crimes such as fraud for making a false statement, forgery, and illegal re-entry. 
The dashboard doesn’t list dates for the arrests, but the 250 highlighted in Utah make up about 8% of the 3,040 immigration arrests that occurred in the state in 2025, according to Deportation Data Project data. It’s also less than 15% of the total number of people arrested (1,685) with criminal convictions in all of 2025 in Utah. 



Is being present in the U.S. in violation of immigration laws a crime? 
On its own, no, it’s not a crime, but a civil infraction. The act of entering the U.S. without being inspected and admitted is a federal crime (a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the circumstances). But many undocumented immigrants do not enter the U.S. illegally. “They enter legally but overstay, work without authorization, drop out of school or violate the conditions of their visas in some other way,” according to the American Civil Liberties Union. 



While more than 80% of ICE arrests in 2025 in Utah have been of people with pending criminal charges or convictions, the increased enforcement on others without criminal records has raised alarms for immigration advocates and legal defenders.
With eyes on what’s happening both nationally and in their home state, they say the uptick of ICE operations — and particularly arrests of people with no criminal backgrounds — have left many immigrants, their families and their communities living in fear and uncertainty. 
They say the tactics — especially arrests of those seeking legal status at Salt Lake City’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office — have intimidated many to retreat further into the shadows. 
A human and economic cost
The cost of more aggressive immigration enforcement is both human and economic, said Bob Babcock, a longtime construction attorney specializing in an industry that is highly dependent on immigrant labor. 
“I feel like we are abusing this community,” Babcock told Utah News Dispatch in a recent interview. “And I am shocked that so many of our citizens don’t understand and they think it’s a simple solution — ‘Oh just go back and come legally,’ you know? That’s a bunch of crock.” 
Babcock said he wishes more people understood there’s not a simple “line” that undocumented immigrants wait in to obtain legal status. 
“There is no line for carpenters, concrete workers, drywall workers,” he said. “No such line exists.” Meanwhile, he said the industries are short employees because the natural birth rate in the U.S. has long been declining and fewer people are willing to work in labor-intensive fields. 










They’re not criminals. They’re not the ‘worst of the worst.' That’s not who they’re getting. They’re getting anybody and everybody they can. 


– Bob Babcock, construction attorney


In a recent op-ed for the Deseret News, Babcock posed a question for leaders and residents of a state that has long been known to be welcoming and solutions-focused when it comes to immigrants and refugees: Are Utahns OK with what ICE is doing in their state? 
“Everybody’s very fearful,” Babcock told Utah News Dispatch, adding that his clients in the construction industry have seen workers occasionally being “picked up and detained.” 
“They’re losing guys. They’re not criminals. They’re not the ‘worst of the worst,’” he said. “That’s not who they’re getting. They’re getting anybody and everybody they can.” 
Babcock said he’s not aware of any major raids or large-scale arrests on job sites in Utah, but the arrests that have happened instill fear. That fear has been leading some to not show up to work at times.

“And the expectation is it’s going to get much worse,” he said. 
While Republicans and Democrats alike have for years agreed the nation’s immigration system is broken, nothing has been done about it, Babcock said. And the resulting reality is it’s common for undocumented people to work in construction and agriculture, and without them the industries would suffer, he said. 
The current approach, he said, is doing more harm than good. He called on Utah’s state and federal leaders to be courageous and stand up to the Trump administration and say what’s happening isn’t only inhumane — it’s damaging the workforce and economy. 
“Everyone should be standing up and saying, ‘We need a solution,’” he said. “Crushing the workforce day by day is not the solution.” 
What has Gov. Cox said about ICE enforcement in Utah?
In late 2024, Gov. Spencer Cox announced a “targeted” state effort to support the Trump administration’s immigration policies with an emphasis on immigrants “who have committed crimes and pose a threat to public safety.” 
“When it comes to immigration policy, the safety of Utah residents is my top priority,” Cox said in a statement at the time. “Utah will continue to welcome refugees and immigrants who enter the country lawfully, and we will continue pushing for reforms to the asylum process and for more visas to support our workforce needs. We have zero tolerance, however, for those who demonstrate a threat to public safety while in the country illegally.” 










My position is always that laws are supposed to be followed, that we are, I believe, the most welcoming state in the country when it comes to people who are seeking a new life and who are coming here. But you also have to do it the right way, and that’s really important.


– Utah Gov. Spencer Cox


When asked during his most recent news conference broadcast by PBS Utah on Nov. 25 about ICE operations in Utah becoming more frequent and aggressive, Cox said “my position hasn’t changed at all.” 
“My position is always that laws are supposed to be followed, that we are, I believe, the most welcoming state in the country when it comes to people who are seeking a new life and who are coming here,” he said. “But you also have to do it the right way, and that’s really important.” 
Cox added that his administration has been “very supportive of operations to enforce the law and will continue to be.” 
Cox’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.  
‘Haphazard and broad enforcement’
Like the arrest data shows, civil rights advocates have noticed an uptick of ICE enforcement in Utah — and “we have seen an increase in detentions and arrests of folks that don’t have a criminal record or only have a record of more minor criminal offenses,” said Ellie Menlove, legislative and policy council for the ACLU of Utah. 
“We’re seeing more haphazard and broad enforcement without regard to a person’s criminal status,” Menlove said, “which is extremely worrying to us from a civil rights perspective, and it wasn’t what ICE said that they were going to do in the state.” 
The ACLU of Utah is part of the Utah Immigrant Advocacy Coalition — a group of organizations “committed to ensuring Utah remains a welcoming and supportive community for all immigrants, regardless of their status,” according to the coalition’s website. 
The ACLU of Utah has been keeping an up-to-date tracker of the various types of 287(g) agreements that state and local governments have adopted to give local police the power to enforce federal immigration law. In effect, the agreements can turn local officers into ICE agents, “fueling deportations, racial profiling, and fear in immigrant communities,” the ACLU of Utah says on the site. 



The following Utah government entities have adopted 287(g) agreements, according to the ACLU of Utah

Utah Department of Corrections — Warrant Service Officer 
Riverton Police Department — Task Force Model
Cache County — Warrant Service Officer 
Weber County — Task Force Model
Tooele County — Task Force Model
Utah County — Task Force Model and Warrant Service Officer
Wasatch County — Warrant Service Officer
Sanpete County — Warrant Service Officer
Sevier County — Jail Enforcement Model and Warrant Service Officer
Beaver County — Warrant Service Officer
San Juan County — Jail Enforcement Model
Kane County — Warrant Service Officer
Washington County — Task Force Model and Jail Enforcement Model

 



“This just creates a lot of fear in immigrant communities, and it’s overall very harmful to public safety in general when people are under the impression that a law enforcement agency is working with ICE,” said Molly Karasick, a legal fellow with the ACLU of Utah.
The different types of 287(g) agreements grant varying levels of power to local agencies to enforce immigration law — but they all have the same effect of giving the impression that those agencies are partnering with ICE, and that has a chilling effect on communities, Karasick said. 
“When you see that your local agencies partner with ICE, that gives a broad impression that they’re working with ICE and it undermines the community towards law enforcement in general,” she said. “And then, in effect, we have people who are scared to contact their local police or sheriff’s department because they’re under the impression that they’re working with immigration. And when people aren’t reporting crimes, that’s more dangerous for every single person.” 
There are three different types of 287(g) agreements — the Jail Enforcement Model, the Warrant Service Officer and the Task Force Model. 
The Task Force Model grants the most power and is the most concerning to civil rights advocates. Described by ICE as a “force multiplier,” it allows state and local law enforcement agencies to make immigration arrests during regular police enforcement.
The Jail Enforcement Model delegates some immigration authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to identify immigrants in state and local custody and place them into immigration proceedings. “Corrections officers in local jails, under the supervision of ICE, are deputized by the federal government to interrogate people in their custody about their immigration status and funnel people into the deportation pipeline,” the ACLU of Utah says. 
The Warrant Service Officer model grants limited powers, allowing ICE to train, certify and authorize state and local law enforcement officers to serve administrative immigration warrants on people who are in custody in their jails.

‘One of the great horrors of our generation’
Immigration Attorney Nicholle Pitt White was among the attorneys last month warning immigrants to get legal consultation before going to appointments at the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services field office in Salt Lake City due to reports that arrests of immigrants in the process of applying for legal status had started taking place there. 
Though data shows more than half of ICE arrests in Utah have been of people with criminal convictions, Pitt White said the growing number of people arrested solely based on alleged immigration violations is unjust. 
‘Stuck between a rock and a hard place’: Lawyers warn of arrests at Salt Lake immigration office  

Pitt White said she takes the following legal principle of criminal justice to heart: “It’s better that 10 guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.” 
“And I think that’s true for immigrants, too,” she said. “The vast majority of these people, even the ones with criminal history, their crimes are generally pretty minor.”
To Pitt White, what’s happening in the U.S. is “one of the great horrors of our generation.” 
She has multiple stories of aggressive ICE arrests from her own law firm. 
From a case that happened in Utah, Pitt White described seeing dashcam footage “of a dad that had his toddler in the car with him, that had a removal order, meaning a deportation order, but there was reason to believe that should be re-opened.” 
“ICE stopped him. They broke the window where his toddler was. They refused to identify themselves,” she said. “He didn’t know if they were actually ICE or just criminals trying to harm him and his kid, and he took off.” 
Thanks to the dashcam footage, Pitt White said she and her legal team were able to prove “he didn’t actually harm any of the ICE officers” in the face of federal officials accusing him of trying to cause intentional harm to a federal officer. “He was able to provide video evidence to prove that was a big fat lie.” 
“But that’s one of the most egregious things I’ve seen,” she said.

Pitt White said she’s also heard of “several examples” in areas like West Valley City and Magna where “ICE has just kind of sat outside of apartment complexes that are heavily Latino, and they’ll just stop everyone on their way out and ask for papers. And they’ve, like, filled up vans of people and taken them away.” 
Compared to other states, Utah’s ICE operations aren’t as large-scale or high profile — but Pitt White noted Utah does have a fairly large immigrant population in parts of the state, and arrests are happening here, even though many go unreported in the media. 
“I think we had a false sense of security here because Utah is so red,” she said. “But the more we know and the more we’ve seen, it’s not any different here.” 
Like Babcock, Pitt White said she wishes Utah’s political leaders would stand up to what’s happening. Most immigrants are here seeking safety, not to cause trouble. 
“I’ve met so many people that have come here not just because they wanted to work and make a better life for themselves and their family, but because in their home country they were raped by multiple family members and the police refused to help them,” she said. “And the only place they felt they could be safe was here. Because here we follow the laws and we have police that will protect you and we care about your rights.” 
“It’s horrifying,” she said, “that that no longer seems to be the case.” 
Pitt White also urged people who might support the Trump administration’s actions to take a step back and recognize there are good people being swept up by ICE — it could be their neighbor, a friend, someone who cleans their house, or who works on a local farm or at a nearby mechanic shop. 
“Those are the people that they’re picking up. Everyone has someone that they know that is like that, that is a good person, that has no criminal history, that’s paying their taxes and trying to do everything they can to support their family,” she said. “But they refuse to see that humanity in the vast majority of people, and I think it’s shameful.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Immigration_5-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

Travelers heading to their gates stopped in their tracks as a woman cried out for help, yelling “No!” and “I have my papers” at Salt Lake City International Airport.  
Video quickly spread of four immigration officers pulling her to the ground and taking her away as she tried to break free, jumping in her stocking feet. Since then, immigration attorneys say the emotional and widely viewed arrest has marked a turning point in Utah.
The viral airport arrest has ratcheted up fear for Utahns without permanent legal status. And it changed the advice Utah attorneys give many of their clients about booking any flights as the Trump administration continues to intensify immigration enforcement.

Two months later, would-be travelers continue to ask South Jordan attorney Carlos Trujillo if it’s unwise to buy plane tickets out of state to visit family or take their children to a Disney theme park. He now advises those with pending applications for green cards or asylum to stay home. 
“The best answer you can tell them is, honestly, if it’s not a necessary flight, if somebody’s not dying, it’s not recommended,” Trujillo said. “It’s not, because that’s where they’re grabbing people.” 
He also tells naturalized citizens and permanent residents to bring their documents with them, saying several clients have been stopped for further questioning. 
“They’ve been taken to secondary screening for the first time in all their life here, and that seems to be picking up more and more,” Trujillo said.  
Few interactions involving immigration enforcers in Utah have been as visible as the airport arrest. Before this year, authorities didn’t typically arrest flyers in the busy, public setting unless they were wanted in criminal cases. The woman they detained on Oct. 29, originally from El Salvador, had a prior deportation order but no criminal record.

The dramatic video reinforced how immigration operations are increasingly being carried out in public, at businesses, near schools and in public places across the country. Trujillo said he anticipates immigration enforcement will intensify in 2026 after a cash infusion from Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill.”
Congress set aside $30 billion for ICE hiring, transportation and other costs as part of the legislation. ICE did not respond to a request for comment from Utah News Dispatch about the arrest at the airport or the new funding’s impact in the state. 
Kimberly Tobar, a therapist with Jacky’s Recovery Support Services who works with members of Utah’s Latino communities, noted the significant change to daily life for many immigrants who  haven’t left their homes in months and aren’t going to work or school because they’re worried about being stopped by authorities. 
“Even people who have documentation here feel that fear, because they feel that they’re going to get racially profiled and just be accused of not having documentation,” Tobar said.

She said that worry has left many in a state of isolation and constant anxiety “that they feel very powerless over, because they’re like, ‘What can I do?’”
Tobar said teenagers her organization works with report they’re worried about ICE coming to their school or job and detaining them, or that they’ll come home at the end of the day to find their parents aren’t there anymore. Others have brought up that they aren’t traveling to see loved ones. 
“A lot of the youth have also been the ones that are learning about their rights and teaching their family members,” Tobar said. 
Attorneys representing the woman detained at the airport emphasize that she has a current work permit and no criminal history.
“What it demonstrates is that ICE is actively using everything in its means to try to identify individuals who have outstanding deportation orders,” said one of her attorneys, Andrew Armstrong. 
He said his client applied for asylum in the U.S. years ago with the help of someone she hired to assist with the paperwork. But that person never provided her with correspondence from the government demanding her further participation in the process, Armstrong said.

Her subsequent lack of response triggered the deportation proceeding, Armstrong told Utah News Dispatch. She didn’t receive notice of that case either, and didn’t know it ended in a deportation order until she was carried out of the airport, he said. 
“I don’t want to criticize the ICE agents having to do their job,” Armstrong said. “But they were large men who forcefully removed her from the airport who did not speak Spanish and were not able to explain to her what was going on.”
She is being held in a detention center in Louisiana, Armstrong said, as she waits to hear whether a judge will withdraw the deportation order. Such arrests “create fear so that they inspire certain immigrants to leave on their own because they are so afraid of what might happen to them if they stay here,” Armstrong said. 
His client came on the radar of ICE via a list of passengers that airlines provide the federal government, Armstrong said. The Transportation Security Administration has begun sharing more data with ICE to deport more people, including in her case, The New York Times reported in December, citing internal documents the newspaper obtained. 
TSA and ICE are both under the umbrella of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
Ysabel Lonazco, an immigration attorney in West Valley City, agrees the dramatic scene near the baggage claim was a turning point. 
She now counsels those living in Utah without documents to avoid traveling. 
“There’s an Ysabel before the airport — and after the airport,” Lonazco said. “The attorney before the airport event would tell you, ‘OK, you can fly with your passport, you’ll be fine. Keep on with your life.’ But after, it’s like, ‘Don’t go anywhere. Don’t fly out of state.’” 
She also advises clients at risk of deportation to avoid driving to Zion National Park, because the sheriff’s office in neighboring Washington County has a formal partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement known as a 287(g) agreement.
Lonazco said she tries to avoid instilling more fear in clients, but has new advice for those whose travel plans cause her concern:  “just try to find joy within home.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/saltlakecityairport_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

(Annie Knox/Utah News Dispatch)On an early December weekend hundreds of Latinos congregated at a Salt Lake Community College conference center in Sandy. Tables were set in a fair-like style, the smell of a mixture of perfume samples saturated the air, the hot pink and bright yellow of Venezuelan snack packaging and stress balls from an immigration law firm decorated some areas.
A voice with a Maracaibo accent announced an upcoming raffle for a piece of pernil-style pork, a traditional Christmas dish every hour, this year’s initiative at the annual Christmas celebration hosted by Utahzolanos, a social media outlet and community.
The event has been a tradition kept for five years. But this time, amid stronger immigration enforcement tactics deployed by the Trump administration, and increasing immigration arrests in the state, the sentiment and tone around the event changed.

Organizers modeled the party into an event in support of the community, said Patricia Quiñonez, who runs Utahzolanos. However, she said, it still was “a chance to cheer each other on, to give each other strength.”
Fewer people showed up this year, Quiñonez said. Still, about 2,000 came, which is about 1,000 less than what the organization had seen in past years.
“We are happy because we expected fear to prevail over the call, the invitation to attend,” she said.
This year’s Christmas party had Santa Claus hats, toys, crafts and gifts. However, the busiest tables were those of immigration law firms offering free consultations. 
But, other events, like Utahzolanos’ New Year’s party, an often-sold out event where over 1,000 people gather for food and music, was almost canceled as ticket sales languished. The traditional celebration ultimately came together, but with 60% fewer attendees this year.
“We didn’t want to lose the tradition we’ve had for the past five years,” she said. “The families who didn’t come told us they were afraid to attend a predominantly Latino event that might attract the attention of ICE.”
Venezuelans living in the U.S. have felt a particularly heavy impact since the second Trump administration took power. The Temporary Protection Status, a protection from deportation that Trump granted Venezuelans during his first term, has been eliminated, abruptly leaving about 600,000 Venezuelans without work permits, driver’s licenses or permission to remain in the country. In all, more than 1.5 million people lost legal status in 2025.
Quiñonez says many of her group’s followers have said they are self-deporting out of fear of being detained and separated from their families. Others have voluntarily left the country after the detention of the breadwinner.

“It’s not just people who have been here for two, or three years. We are talking about friends who applied for asylum 10, eight, seven years ago,” Quiñonez said in Spanish, adding that many feel worn out by how cases are playing out in immigration courts. 
In October, the Department of Homeland Security reported that 1.6 million people had voluntarily self-deported since President Donald Trump reclaimed the White House.
“Fear is overcoming faith or the choice of moving forward with immigration cases,” she said.
Since Venezuela and the U.S. don’t share a diplomatic relation, first-generation Americans born in Venezuelan families aren’t able to receive a visa to Venezuela to join their parents if they are deported. 
Some of those who decide to stay have begun limiting their routines — Latin restaurants have become off-limits for many fearing an ICE raid. And some churches have low attendance on Sundays, as well, she said. Immigration attorneys have started advising their clients to restrict travel, a new recommendation stemming from a high-profile ICE arrest at the Salt Lake City airport.
However, in the last three months, Quiñonez has also seen Latino entrepreneurs opening businesses, including restaurants, barber shops, insurance companies and car dealerships, she said. 
But, amid these sparks of hope in the Latin community, immigrants remain uncertain about whether immigration enforcement will turn more aggressive in Utah, especially now with reports naming Utah the home of an upcoming 10,000-bed ICE detention facility. 
“It makes you wonder, if that 10,000-people capacity means that they’ll be stricter. Will they search for more people to be at that detention center?” Quiñonez said.
‘The fear isn’t exclusively quarantined just to Latinos’
Like other owners of establishments with international offerings, for a naturalized American business owner with warehouse operations in Salt Lake City, watching how ICE raids developed in 2025 makes him feel “completely uncomfortable.”
While the business owner is an American citizen, with tensions lingering in the immigrant community, he asked not to be identified for fear of becoming an ICE target.
“Their program is to remove criminals from our communities, but our community is suffering because they don’t pause and take the time to respect human rights,” he said, adding that officers have often detained people without a criminal record. “It’s terrible for our communities, and it’s terrible for any industries where immigrants and minorities are working.”
Anecdotally, there hasn’t been a massive mobilization across Hispanic businesses in the state, said Victoria Petro, a Salt Lake City Council member and executive director of the Utah Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. But, this federal administration’s tactics instill fear among communities in the state.
“People are more susceptible to false alarms and anecdotes, right?” Petro said. “So it just creates kind of a jumpiness and a difficulty for our people to understand, where is truth? Where is credible information?”



Let us know what you think...


 


The immigration enforcement operations have also brought a chilling effect to Utah Hispanic establishments — mostly from anxiety about spending money in Latin businesses in fear of being detained, even with a legal immigration status, she said.
“If I’m a consumer, and I go to a market that caters predominantly to the Hispanic community, ‘la migra’ might show up there a lot more readily than they’re going to show up at Smith’s,” Petro said. “So we’re seeing a transfer of buying power to a more dominant paradigm, and it’s more difficult to aggregate audiences and consumers in places where they worry they might be profiled.”
With more Latin consumers saving up for emergencies and avoiding Hispanic establishments, the conversation around immigration enforcement in the chamber has been ongoing, Petro said, with many businesses aiming to determine how to maintain consumer bases with this threat. 
“I was just with a business the other day that showed me their year-over-year, their expenses have skyrocketed and their revenues have gone down,” she said.
And, not only Hispanic-owned businesses have suffered the impact of the federal operations. 
“We’ve seen an influx from construction companies who are looking into membership with us to stand with us, and to try to stay up to date as to what they’re facing in labor supply,” Petro said, “So the fear isn’t exclusively quarantined just to Latinos. It’s being shared now by the dominant paradigm as well.”
The Salt Lake City business owner still hopes his staff doesn’t feel targeted just for the fact his business has Mexican origins. He has done some planning, ensuring that everyone knows their rights in the case an immigration officer comes knocking on his business’ door. But, he’s not making a big fuss out of it, especially since not every employee that works for him “happens to be Mexican,” he said.
His job, he said, is to run his business, “not to create chaos.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4962-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

“The premise behind this is to make sure that every child in the state of Alabama, especially with the emphasis on the Literacy Act and other programs that have recently been implemented, but to make sure that every child in the state of Alabama has access to books and to help them develop a love for learning,” Kitchens said in a recent interview.

Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is a book gifting program that mails free “high quality books” to children regardless of their families income. The initiative was started in 1995 by Parton to distribute books to families in Sevier County, TN. In 2000, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library became a nationwide program.
Gov. Kay Ivey launched a statewide expansion of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library in 2023. The prefiled bill makes no changes to the program but codifies an executive order Ivey signed in 2023 to establish the statewide expansion of the Imagination Library.
State funds will make up half of the funding for the program, while local partner programs will make up the other half.
Collins filed a similar bill in the House during the 2025 legislative session. It did not pass through the Senate due to time constraints. 
Under the legislation, the Alabama Imagination Library will be managed by the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education (ADECE). The department will also be required to work with a nonprofit agency to operate the program and create rules as needed.
Private donations are also allowed to be contributed to help fund the program.
“When you pass legislation, more people are going to hear about it, so more families with young children will be able to sign up. They’ll be more informed about it, and then local groups or individuals that are looking for something to support, they can see the benefits of this, and so they can choose to support it,” Collins said in a recent interview.
The books provided for the children must be considered age appropriate.  
“Age appropriate when they’re very young, would be those big, almost cardboard pages, so that their little fingers can turn them by themselves,” Collins said “And they may have more touch, and there’ll be less as they get a little bit older. They’ll still be simple books, but there’ll be some that they can start recognizing some of the words and some of the things that go with the pictures.”
On Dec. 1, Ivey said in a statement that 2 million books have been distributed by Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library to children in all 67 counties in the state. The statement also said over 106,000 children are enrolled in the program.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wes-Kitchens-May-8-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381
,California,2026-01-06 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s urgent issues loom over Newsom campaign and his would-be successors,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/california-issues-newsom-presidential-campaign/,Gov. Gavin Newsom's State of the State address may hint at how he'll balance his last year as governor with his presidential campaign image.,"Political California cranked up for the New Year Monday.
The Legislature reconvened after a 114-day recess, Gov. Gavin Newsom renewed his nascent campaign for president and the dozen or so men and women who covet his job continued to seek ways to reach a so-far-uninterested electorate.
Newsom’s interview Monday on MS NOW, the cable channel beloved by Democratic politicians and activist voters, implied anew that his final year as governor will be dominated by his all-but-certain bid for the White House in 2028. He spent much it criticizing President Donald Trump for refusing aid to Los Angeles fire victims and cracking down on undocumented immigrants.
Newsom’s preoccupation will color whatever he and the Legislature do about a deficit-ridden state budget and a half-dozen or so other stubborn issues that have emerged or become more acute since Newsom took office seven years ago.
In past years Newsom has been lackadaisical about delivering the annual State of the State message to the Legislature that the state constitution requires. But he’ll perform the chore later this week, then unveil his response to the projections of semi-permanent, multi-billion-dollar deficits.
Gabe Petek, the Legislature’s budget analyst, sees an immediate $18 billion gap between income and outgo that could mushroom to $35 billion if not closed. He’s warned that Newsom and legislators can’t count on a sluggish economy to solve their problem.
They have used a variety of gimmicks, including raids on emergency reserves, off-the-books loans and deceptive accounting gambits to stave off the day of fiscal reckoning, but the shortfall, born of overspending revenues, has continued.
“If our estimates hold, the Legislature will face a fourth consecutive year of budget problems — all during a period of overall revenue growth,” Petek said in a November analysis. “As it stands — with larger forecasted deficits and many fewer tools available to address them — California’s budget is undeniably less prepared for downturns.”
The Legislature’s leaders, pressed by a powerful progressive contingent, don’t want to reduce the health care and income support services they so willingly enacted after Newsom declared, erroneously, that the state had a $97.5 billion surplus three years ago.
Progressives and their allies in public employee unions and other left-of-center groups want to close the budget gap with new taxes and are sponsoring two ballot measures, one to extend a surtax on the highest-income taxpayers that’s due to expire and a second to impose a new wealth tax on the state’s billionaires.
Newsom has steadfastly rejected tax increases to deal with the deficit, unwilling, obviously, to become a pro-tax presidential candidate. But neither has he offered, so far, anything other than gimmicks to solve the problem his wildly off-base 2022 surplus declaration created.
The state’s stubborn budget deficit is just one of the issues that continue to defy resolution as Newsom’s final year begins. Other issues include high levels of homelessness and poverty, a housing shortage that’s just as acute as when he took office in 2019, an insurance crisis born of chronic wildfires, a woebegone bullet train project, soaring costs of living, persistent water supply uncertainties and a looming shortage of gasoline as refineries close due to hostile state regulation.
On top of everything, California’s $4 trillion economy is more or less stuck in neutral, with the nation’s highest unemployment rate, no net job growth since the COVID-19 pandemic and severe employment cutbacks in signature sectors, such as film and TV production technology.
The stark existence of such issues during Newsom’s final year as governor is not only a potential drag on his presidential campaign, but it colors the cast-of-thousands campaigns to elect a successor.
Will the would-be Democratic governors be willing to point out Newsom’s leftover issues — especially the budget deficit — and tell voters how they would approach the challenge? Or would they merely joust over who can be the loudest?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010526-Newsom-BB-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

Dina Titus. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Nevada’s sole Republican congressman, Rep. Mark Amodei, had as of Monday evening yet to comment on the military capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro or President Donald Trump’s assertion the country and its oil production industry are under U.S. control.  
Maduro and his wife, captured Saturday in Caracas by an elite U.S. military squad, entered pleas of not guilty Monday in New York to charges of trafficking cocaine. 
Amodei’s office did not respond to a request for comment Monday. His silence comes as Nevada’s Democratic congressional delegates are calling out Trump for deploying the military for a criminal matter and for engaging in regime change and nation-building, policies Trump has previously decried. 
“Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,” Trump said while campaigning in 2016. 
Maduro “was a brutal dictator who deserves no sympathy,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said on social media. “But the Trump Administration using American service members to overthrow a foreign leader it has criminally indicted under U.S. law sets a dangerous precedent.”
Trump, she said, “made a dangerous decision to bypass Congress with his actions in Venezuela, and so far he has offered no real details on plans for the future other than a vague assertion that the ‘United States will be running the country.’” 
The prosecution of Maduro, Cortez Masto added, “contradicts” Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was found guilty by a federal jury of conspiring to traffic cocaine and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He was released last month as a result of Trump’s pardon. 
On Monday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president in Maduro’s absence. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, laid out a scenario that more closely resembles a military takeover than the criminal apprehension of two individuals.
“We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller said. “By definition, we are in charge, because we have the United States military stationed outside the country. We set the terms and conditions. We have a complete embargo on all of their oil and their ability to do commerce. So for them to do commerce, they need our permission. For them to be able to run an economy, they need our permission.” 
Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Maduro an “illegitimate and brutal dictator” but noted only Congress has the power to declare war. “This illegal regime change operation won’t make our country safer and risks destabilizing the region, dragging us into additional military conflicts, and increasing the amount of immigrants seeking refuge at our border.”
Trump’s administration needs to “explain why it lied when it claimed in its briefings that regime change wasn’t the U.S. goal in Venezuela,” Rosen said, and urged Congress to pass Senator Tim Kaine’s (D-Virginia) War Powers Resolution “to prohibit Donald Trump from carrying out additional strikes without our input.”
In a statement issued Saturday, Rep. Dina Titus, a former Political Science professor at UNLV, detailed more than half a century of U.S. regime change efforts in Latin America. 
“In each case, our long-term interests were not advanced, regional relationships were damaged, and the Hemisphere saw more turmoil and violence, not less, “ she said. “Instead of learning from history, President Trump has perpetuated a failed foreign policy.”
The Trump administration’s action, Titus said, “is clearly based largely on the desire to take over Venezuela’s oil.”
The U.S. invasion of a sovereign nation, she added, “opens the door for Xi Jinping to do the same in Taiwan and lends legitimacy to Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine.” Titus said Trump, who calls himself “the ‘President of Peace’ has once again shown that he is the ‘Commander-in-Chaos.’”
Titus faces challenges in 2026 from six Republicans, including State Sen. Carrie Buck, who did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s takeover of Venezuela. 
Rep. Susie Lee, also a Democrat, said Maduro’s capture raises “more questions for the Trump Administration than answers. The American people are opposed to another forever war.”
Lee noted that taking control of Venezuela is “an act of war, not a law-enforcement activity, and requires Congressional authorization and clear legal authority, neither of which the Administration has been given.” 
Three Republicans vying to replace Lee are praising Trump’s actions. 
Dr. Aury Nagy praised Trump’s “decisive leadership” but a spokesman was unable to say whether Nagy supports putting U.S. troops in Venezuela. 
Marty O’Donnell, who is prioritizing affordability in his campaign, commended Trump and the military for taking decisive action without loss of life to Americans. 
Dr. Jeff Gunter, who served as an ambassador during Trump’s first term, praised the military action that resulted in Maduro’s capture as a “’lawful, moral, and necessary’ step to protect American families from drug cartels and liberate Venezuela from socialist tyranny.”
Gunter is best known in political circles for an attack ad in the 2024 Republican primary race for U.S. Senate, in which he portrayed fellow Republican Sam Brown as a swamp creature. Brown was disfigured by an improvised explosive device in 2008 in Afghanistan, where he was serving in the U.S. Army. 
Gunter did not respond when asked whether he supports U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela. 
Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, echoed colleagues in asserting Trump’s actions “appeared to be driven largely by access to Venezuela’s oil resources.”
“Nevadans struggling through the Trump Slump get no relief from another reckless attempt at nation-building abroad,” he said. “President Trump is occupying Venezuela for corporate oil profits while the American people are clamoring for affordability relief here at home.”
David Flippo, one of several Republicans seeking to oust Horsford, praised Trump’s actions. In a statement, the former Air Force commander said Trump acted “exactly how the Commander-in-Chief is supposed to act…” 
He did not respond when asked whether he supports prolonged U.S. involvement and troops in Venezuela. 
Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.
“Operations like this send a clear and unmistakable message: the United States will not tolerate criminal regimes poisoning our communities with fentanyl and other deadly drugs,” Whipple said in a statement. He did not say whether he supports deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela.

According to the Mayo Clinic, both the symptoms of PTSD and when they arise can vary from person to person. Typically, symptoms appear within the first three months of the traumatic event, but it could also take years and last for a year, or more. Symptoms are grouped into four categories, according to the clinic: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions.
According to a 2023 study, about 1% of all suicides in the United States between 2015 and 2017 were first responders. Most of them were law enforcement officers, followed by firefighters.
The report is not available to the public until it is submitted to the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. The commission has until Jan. 15 to do so. But Legislative Attorney Jeff Condra walked members of the commission through its contents on Monday. 
“The overall purpose of the report is to demonstrate to the Senate president pro tem and to the House speaker that the commission was faithful to its charge,” Condra said.
Condra said the report contains the discussions of the commission’s October and November meetings. It also includes the findings of a survey the commission sent to first responders and veterans across the state.
“There are key insights from the survey responses that were gleaned by the study commission: the need for better communication to first responders about available mental health resources, the fact that health insurance is provided through the local government, their health care insurance program does include mental health treatment, the importance of peer support, and the fact that a lot of these current problems kind of operate in isolation from one another,” Condra said. “Which means that there could be a lot of inefficiency, and there can be gaps in what we might call the continuum of care.”
The report also includes a communication plan from the Alabama Department of Mental Health (ADMH) that aims to increase awareness of available resources. 
“This plan focuses on the existing resources so that it’s easier for them to be told about it, and then actually access those resources,” Malissa Valdes, public information officer for ADMH, told the commission on Monday.
Valdes said ADMH will measure the success of the communication plan by tracking usage of the 988 suicide hotline, downloads of the Connect Alabama app and social media analytics. 
“We feel people will actually utilize this in order to reduce stigma, actually go out there and get help, create the mental health resilience that they need in order to help with PTSD,” she said.
Treadaway, who was a police officer for 31 years, said that awareness of resources is the biggest issue and that he learned about many programs through the commission.
“I think what we’re learning each year is that mental health has a lot of challenges, and the state of Alabama and the Legislature is ready to meet those challenges,” Treadaway said in an interview after the meeting.
Treadaway said additional legislation is possible but not guaranteed for the 2026 legislative session, which begins on Jan. 13.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5915-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

Dan Caine at Mar-a-Lago Saturday, January 3, 2026. (Official White House Photo by Molly Riley)An image circulated over media the weekend of Jan. 3 and 4 was meant to convey dominance: Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, blindfolded and handcuffed aboard a U.S. naval vessel. Shortly after the operation that seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would now “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be arranged.
The Trump administration’s move is not an aberration; it reflects a broader trend in U.S. foreign policy I described here some six years ago as “America the Bully.”
Washington increasingly relies on coercion – military, economic and political – not only to deter adversaries but to compel compliance from weaker nations. This may deliver short-term obedience, but it is counterproductive as a strategy for building durable power, which depends on legitimacy and capacity. When coercion is applied to governance, it can harden resistance, narrow diplomatic options and transform local political failures into contests of national pride.
There is no dispute that Maduro’s dictatorship led to Venezuela’s catastrophic collapse. Under his rule, Venezuela’s economy imploded, democratic institutions were hollowed out, criminal networks fused with the state, and millions fled the country – many for the United States.
But removing a leader – even a brutal and incompetent one – is not the same as advancing a legitimate political order.
 Force doesn’t equal legitimacy

By declaring its intent to govern Venezuela, the United States is creating a governance trap of its own making – one in which external force is mistakenly treated as a substitute for domestic legitimacy.
I write as a scholar of international security, civil wars and U.S. foreign policy, and as author of “Dying by the Sword,” which examines why states repeatedly reach for military solutions, and why such interventions rarely produce durable peace.
The core finding of that research is straightforward: Force can topple rulers, but it cannot generate political authority.
When violence and what I have described elsewhere as “kinetic diplomacy” become a substitute for full spectrum action – which includes diplomacy, economics and what the late political scientist Joseph Nye called “soft power” – it tends to deepen instability rather than resolve it.
 More force, less statecraft

The Venezuela episode reflects this broader shift in how the United States uses its power. My co-author Sidita Kushi and I document this by analyzing detailed data from the new Military Intervention Project. We show that since the end of the Cold War, the United States has sharply increased the frequency of military interventions while systematically underinvesting in diplomacy and other tools of statecraft.
One striking feature of the trends we uncover is that if Americans tended to justify excessive military intervention during the Cold War between 1945–1989 due to the perception that the Soviet Union was an existential threat, what we would expect is far fewer military interventions following the Soviet Union’s 1991 collapse. That has not happened.
Even more striking, the mission profile has changed. Interventions that once aimed at short-term stabilization now routinely expand into prolonged governance and security management, as they did in both Iraq after 2003 and Afghanistan after 2001.
This pattern is reinforced by institutional imbalance. In 2026, for every single dollar the United States invests in the diplomatic “scalpel” of the State Department to prevent conflict, it allocates US$28 to the military “hammer” of the Department of Defense, effectively ensuring that force becomes a first rather than last resort.
“Kinetic diplomacy” – in the Venezuela case, regime change by force – becomes the default not because it is more effective, but because it is the only tool of statecraft immediately available. On Jan. 4, Trump told the Atlantic magazine that if Delcy Rodríguez, the acting leader of Venezuela, “doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”
 Lessons from Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya

The consequences of this imbalance are visible across the past quarter-century.
In Afghanistan, the U.S.-led attempt to engineer authority built on external force alone proved brittle by its very nature. The U.S. had invaded Afghanistan in 2001 to topple the Taliban regime, deemed responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But the subsequent two decades of foreign-backed state-building collapsed almost instantly once U.S. forces withdrew in 2021. No amount of reconstruction spending could compensate for the absence of a political order rooted in domestic consent.
Following the invasion by the U.S. and surrender of Iraq’s armed forces in 2003, both the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Defense proposed plans for Iraq’s transition to a stable democratic nation. President George W. Bush gave the nod to the Defense Department’s plan.
That plan, unlike the State Department’s, ignored key cultural, social and historical conditions. Instead, it proposed an approach that assumed a credible threat to use coercion, supplemented by private contractors, would prove sufficient to lead to a rapid and effective transition to a democratic Iraq. The United States became responsible not only for security, but also for electricity, water, jobs and political reconciliation – tasks no foreign power can perform without becoming, as the United States did, an object of resistance.
Libya demonstrated a different failure mode. There, intervention by a U.S.-backed NATO force in 2011 and removal of dictator Moammar Gadhafi and his regime were not followed by governance at all. The result was civil war, fragmentation, militia rule and a prolonged struggle over sovereignty and economic development that continues today.
The common thread across all three cases is hubris: the belief that American management – either limited or oppressive – could replace political legitimacy.
Venezuela’s infrastructure is already in ruins. If the United States assumes responsibility for governance, it will be blamed for every blackout, every food shortage and every bureaucratic failure. The liberator will quickly become the occupier.
 Costs of ‘running’ a country

Taking on governance in Venezuela would also carry broader strategic costs, even if those costs are not the primary reason the strategy would fail.
A military attack followed by foreign administration is a combination that undermines the principles of sovereignty and nonintervention that underpin the international order the United States claims to support. It complicates alliance diplomacy by forcing partners to reconcile U.S. actions with the very rules they are trying to defend elsewhere.
The United States has historically been strongest when it anchored an open sphere built on collaboration with allies, shared rules and voluntary alignment. Launching a military operation and then assuming responsibility for governance shifts Washington toward a closed, coercive model of power – one that relies on force to establish authority and is prohibitively costly to sustain over time.
These signals are read not only in Berlin, London and Paris. They are watched closely in Taipei, Tokyo and Seoul — and just as carefully in Beijing and Moscow.
When the United States attacks a sovereign state and then claims the right to administer it, it weakens its ability to contest rival arguments that force alone, rather than legitimacy, determines political authority.
Beijing needs only to point to U.S. behavior to argue that great powers rule as they please where they can – an argument that can justify the takeover of Taiwan. Moscow, likewise, can cite such precedent to justify the use of force in its near abroad and not just in Ukraine.
This matters in practice, not theory. The more the United States normalizes unilateral governance, the easier it becomes for rivals to dismiss American appeals to sovereignty as selective and self-serving, and the more difficult it becomes for allies to justify their ties to the U.S.
That erosion of credibility does not produce dramatic rupture, but it steadily narrows the space for cooperation over time and the advancement of U.S. interests and capabilities.
Force is fast. Legitimacy is slow. But legitimacy is the only currency that buys durable peace and stability – both of which remain enduring U.S. interests.
If Washington governs by force in Venezuela, it will repeat the failures of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya: Power can topple regimes, but it cannot create political authority. Outside rule invites resistance, not stability.

Wired for Profit: Second in a series about Alabama Power’s influence over electric rates, renewable energy, pollution and politics in the Yellowhammer State.
There’s a curious sight on the far-left wall of the Alabama Public Service Commission’s main hearing room.
Framed 8-by-10-inch photos of the previous commissioners dating back to 1881 line the wall. The photos are black and white. The commissioners are just white, but that’s not the strange part.
The strange part is that in the bottom left quadrant of the photo wall, directly above the most recent former commissioner, Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, hangs the smiling mug of one of the most notorious faces in Alabama history.

Eugene “Bull” Connor, the former Birmingham police commissioner whose brutal suppression of civil rights demonstrations with police dogs and firehoses drew worldwide condemnation, stares back at the observer with his slicked-back white hair, horn-rimmed glasses and the slight vestige of a smile.
Connor, after his presence became an untenable black eye for the city of Birmingham, was shuffled off to Montgomery and the Alabama Public Service Commission, where he served as PSC president from 1965-1973.
Alabama’s civil rights history is inescapable, even in places most people wouldn’t expect. Their electric bills, for example.
George Wallace, the four-term governor who famously stood in the schoolhouse door in an attempt to prevent Black students from enrolling at the University of Alabama, was never on the commission, but may be as responsible as any single political figure for the state of Alabama’s electric regulation today.
That’s because throughout the 1970s, when crying “segregation forever” was no longer a viable political strategy, Wallace needed a new target for his brand of populist demagoguery. He found it in Alabama Power.
Wallace railed against what he called Alabama Power’s “exorbitant rates” for years, attempting to thwart or delay nearly every rate increase or construction project the company proposed. That campaign turned the state’s regulatory environment into a circus, pushed the state’s largest utility to the verge of bankruptcy and provoked a backlash that still clouds the ratemaking process
David Rountree worked at the PSC for 12 years in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, including stints as chief of staff or principal advisor for three different commissioners. Rountree said Wallace’s actions still reverberated through the PSC building decades later. Years before joining the PSC staff, Rountree had actually covered some of the hearings as a reporter for the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper.
“Those rate hearings were just a nightmare,” Rountree told Inside Climate News. “Nobody wanted to get sent over to have to cover a PSC rate hearing. It was like, ‘Can you just pull my fingernails out?’ And they would last for months on end.”
After years of Wallace’s chaotic attacks on the system, the PSC snapped back hard in the other direction. The commissioners attempted to create a system that would take political chaos out of utility ratemaking and prevent another George Wallace from hijacking the regulatory process. Rate increases were put on “autopilot,” Rountree said, going up automatically whenever Alabama Power’s earnings fell below a certain percentage.
The commission voted to approve the new system, called rate stabilization and equalization, or RSE, in 1982. That was the last time Alabama Power held a formal rate case that nearly all other states require. The RSE process did its job of averting contentious and costly rate cases, but there were serious side effects. One, according to environmentalists and public interest lawyers, has been a lack of transparency and almost any meaningful public participation.
The public rate cases that had become so toxic under Wallace had been eliminated, but those hearings served as the best method for the public to gain insight into how their power bills were calculated, and which utility decisions they were paying for. Now the public and advocate groups have to fight and claw for information that is public and easily accessible in other jurisdictions.
In a 2013 white paper titled “Public Utility Regulation without the Public,” the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis writes that Alabama’s RSE process “allows Alabama Power to adjust its charges each year without any public evidentiary hearings and, indeed, without any participation by ratepaying consumers whatsoever other than off-the-record and after-the-fact comments at an informal hearing that completely lacks public transparency.”
The paper states that only Louisiana and Mississippi have similar processes for utility regulation, but notes that those states have more “meaningful opportunities for public involvement.”
A spokesperson for Alabama Power told Inside Climate News that the RSE process still ensures oversight over the company, even if it differs from other states.
“Alabama’s Rate RSE framework provides continuous, formula-based oversight with monthly filings, annual PSC review, and automatic refunds or adjustments when earnings fall outside the approved range,” Alabama Power said. “Different structure does not equal lack of regulation.”
The Alabama Public Service Commission is in the process of completing its required review of Rate RSE that takes place every six years. It is not clear when the findings of that review will be made public.
“Following the review process engaged in by staff with representatives from Alabama Power and the Alabama Attorney General’s office, staff will consult with the Commission and provide an assessment of the effectiveness of Rate RSE and discuss any potential modifications deemed necessary,” a PSC spokesman said in an email. “The Commission will determine whether any further course or courses of action are necessary based on those consultations with staff. Any determination regarding the need for outside input will not be made until the Commission has made an assessment of the findings compiled by staff.”
Alabama Power went from the precipice of bankruptcy to being one of the most stable and profitable utilities in the country. But its customers shouldered the highest total electric bills in the country last year, according to an Inside Climate News analysis, and pay the highest electric rates in the Southeast.
Advocates who have criticized Alabama Power’s high returns point to the RSE process as a key reason that the company’s profits are so high.
Here’s how it happened.

George Wallace v. the Power Company

To say Wallace was popular in Alabama through the 1960s and ‘70s is an enormous understatement. He was elected governor of Alabama four times from 1962 to 1982, bouncing in and out of the governorship as term limits allowed. He didn’t leave the governor’s office for good until 1987.
In 1966, the Alabama constitution did not allow governors to serve consecutive terms, blocking Wallace from seeking reelection. So Wallace’s wife, Lurleen Wallace, ran for governor in his stead, explicitly stating that her husband would stay in control. Her name appeared on the ballot as “Mrs. George C. Wallace,” and she won handily, winning the primary without a runoff and garnering 63 percent of the general election vote. Alabama would not elect another female governor until 2018.
Lurleen Wallace died of cancer 16 months into her term, casting the Wallaces temporarily out of the governor’s office. Doctors reportedly told Wallace of his wife’s cancer as early as 1961, but he insisted she not be told, delaying any possible treatment for years. She remained unaware of her condition until 1965, when a different doctor told her directly. Despite her condition, she handled a rigorous campaign schedule throughout 1966, but her health began to deteriorate shortly after taking office.
Lurleen Wallace died in 1968. That same year, Alabama voters approved a constitutional amendment to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms, setting the stage for George Wallace to run and win in 1970, 1974 and 1982.
In 1970, as Wallace campaigned to retake the governor’s office after his first interregnum, he campaigned against “banks and utilities and the rich on Wall Street who don’t pay their taxes,” former Newsweek columnist Stewart Alsop wrote at the time.
Alsop added that Wallace’s “attacks on the big newspapers, the banks, and the utilities account for that electric current in his shirt-sleeved crowds at least as much as the race issue.”
After his reelection, Wallace hired well-known attorney Maurice Bishop to formally intervene in the rate cases at the PSC. A handful of commissioners elected in the next several years had close ties to Wallace or at least shared his views on Alabama Power’s rates.

Meanwhile, Wallace held rallies and gave televised speeches criticizing the power company and called multiple special sessions of the legislature in unsuccessful attempts to give the governor’s office and/or the Alabama Supreme Court the power to directly overrule the PSC on electricity rates. Wallace was unwilling to compromise on any of those issues, which never advanced past the state Senate. He blamed Alabama Power for wielding “undue influence” over senators who balked at his proposals. Some of the senators pushed back.
“George Wallace had made a career out of raising emotional issues and demagoging his way into office,” state Sen. Joe Fine said, according to the Montgomery Advertiser. “First he used the race issue, black against white, but [now] that’s run out.”
In June 1976, the PSC rejected a rate increase request from Alabama Power, which the company’s president Joseph Farley called “shocking and dismaying.” The company appealed the PSC’s decision to the Montgomery County Circuit Court, which ordered the PSC to grant at least a partial increase. Alabama Power appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court.
The pattern would continue for several years, with rate cases bouncing between the PSC and the courts, and with Alabama Power repeatedly filing emergency rate cases before the courts had ruled on its previous rate increases.
People angry over their electric bills were bussed to PSC meetings from across the state. PSC hearings were moved to larger venues to accommodate the crowds.
Financial firm Standard and Poor’s dropped Alabama Power’s credit rating from A- to BBB. The company was forced to rely on high interest, short-term loans to stay afloat due to the long lag between rate increase decisions.

1977: ‘The terrible year’

In the book “Developed for the Service of Alabama,” a company history published by Alabama Power in 2006, historian Leah Rawls Atkins calls 1977 “the terrible year,” though 1978 and 1979 may have even been worse.
Skyrocketing prices caused by inflation and the oil embargo were creating huge costs for the company, and the clashes in Montgomery put the company on its most perilous financial footing since its early days of existence.
In January, an emergency rate case hearing was relocated to Montgomery’s Garrett Coliseum, where huge crowds packed the arena for what was, by most accounts, a circus.
Media reports at the time estimated the crowd ranging from 800 to 2,000 people, more or less evenly split between those who supported Alabama Power’s rate increases—power company employees, steelworkers, construction workers, economic development officials—and those who opposed the increases.
More than 50 witnesses testified, ranging from Alabama Power executives and expert witnesses to everyday Alabamians worried about their ability to pay higher bills in times of economic downturn and inflation.
Stewart B. Clifford, a senior vice president at Citibank, testified as a representative of a nine-bank syndicate that had granted Alabama Power $350 million in short-term loans over two years.
“None of them are willing, under present conditions, to extend any additional credit to Alabama Power,” Clifford said, according to The Birmingham News.
Meanwhile, numerous residents, many elderly, testified that they would not be able to pay their power bills if the increase were approved. So did construction workers who said they would be laid off if Alabama Power were not allowed to build the infrastructure it was planning.
One of the commissioners stated he believed the rate increase to be illegal because a previous rate increase was still awaiting judgment in the Alabama Supreme Court.
At one point in the two-day hearing, officials resorted to playing Simon and Garfunkel’s “Bridge Over Troubled Water” over the PA system to ease the tensions.
In the end, the PSC approved a smaller increase than the company asked for, but the struggles continued for the next two years.
In 1978, after Alabama Power reported a dramatic drop in earnings due to the newly constructed Joseph M. Farley nuclear power plant, the PSC approved an emergency rate increase to steady the ship in November, after that year’s elections. Wallace appealed and got a court to issue an injunction blocking the rate increase.
In December, the company filed a request for an emergency $288.8 million rate increase, saying its return on equity had fallen to a “disastrous” 4.5 percent.
According to Rawls’ book, Alabama Power responded by freezing officer salaries, cutting back construction projects and paying its bills only on an as-needed basis. The company sold five of its buildings with agreements to rent the spaces instead, freeing up cash, but losing out in the long run.
In January 1979, the Alabama Supreme Court denied Alabama Power’s motion to lift the injunction blocking its rate increase. The court found the PSC’s rate increases null and void and dismissed all appeals.
Rawls’ book quotes Alabama Power comptroller Jack Minor as saying the company had $45 million in unpaid bills and was unable to borrow money or sell stocks or bonds to cover them. He reported stacked invoices on his desk, not to be paid “until someone demands payment.”
The company put word out that it would remember which vendors were forgiving of its struggles, and which were not. Rawls says that there were some major suppliers that showed a “lack of support during this critical time,” and that Alabama Power “never did business with them again.”
Alan Martin, who held many executive positions in Alabama Power, including senior vice president, said executives in the company who experienced those times came out stronger for it.
“The enduring effect was positive,” Martin said in Rawls’ book. “Those who lived through those years were like the World War II generation. We were tougher. Our leadership has been real conservative, but when the company is criticized, we are quick to jump like a tiger to defend it.”

A solution emerges

By 1982, it was clear that the situation was untenable. Even Wallace and those in his administration conceded that something had to change.
Billy Joe Camp, Wallace’s former advisor and spokesman, had been elected PSC president, and he and the other commissioners implemented the rate stabilization and equalization system.
The goal of the system was to put utility ratemaking on autopilot, removing the possibility of messy rate case battles and political grandstanding that dominated the previous decade.
“At times the rate structure was used as a political football,” Camp said, according to the Associated Press. “I was part of that irresponsibility sometimes. We had to get to a new environment.”
An approved rate of return range was set for Alabama Power at 13 to 14.5 percent of the value of its common equity. Every December, if the company’s earnings for the coming year were projected to fall below that range, rates would go up automatically in January. If the company earned more in the course of the year than its allowed range, some of that money would be refunded to customers the next year.
The new system did not require a vote by the commission to increase rates, nor were there any public rate hearings or formal testimony from the utility on its revenue. In trying to stop political manipulation of the rate system, the PSC nearly removed the public from the process altogether, limiting the opportunities for public engagement or even understanding of the ratemaking process.

Instead, the PSC hosts informal hearings each year in December. The company presents its latest revenue figures for the year in progress and projections for the coming year, as well details about its environmental compliance plans for the next five years.
Company representatives answer questions from PSC staff, the attorney general’s office or members of the public, but they are not under oath as they would be in a formal rate case. The commissioners, if they attend, sit in the audience with everyone else. Proceedings are not streamed online, as regular PSC meetings are.
Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, attends the informal sessions on behalf of SELC clients, asking questions about Alabama Power’s profits, or issues like renewable energy adoption, coal ash cleanup plans, energy efficiency or electric vehicle charging programs offered by the company.
The one-day hearing typically lasts about four hours.
“The informal meetings held in December are the only opportunity for the public to ask Alabama Power questions about its environmental compliance costs or its profits,” Tidwell said in an email. “They are limited in scope—there is no discovery or opportunity to offer expert testimony and Alabama Power’s witnesses are not under oath. There is also no transcript of the meeting.
“It’s unclear to me what role these hearings play in overall utility regulation.”

High interest rates preserved for decades

One criticism of the RSE process is that utility return rates were locked in at 1982 rates for more than 40 years. And the early 1980s featured the highest interest rates since at least the 1950s thanks to inflation control measures taken by the Federal Reserve.
As Alabama Power demonstrated during its turbulent times in the 1970s, a utility company needs to earn returns higher than benchmark interest rates in order to attract investors to fund its operations and construction projects. If investors can get similar returns on government bonds, there’s little incentive to wade into the slightly riskier waters of utility companies, where politicians could scuttle or delay needed rate increases.
In 1981, the U.S. average interest rate spiked to 16.38 percent, dropping to 12.26 percent in 1982. But after 1982, interest rates dropped sharply for decades. This year, it is 4.21 percent after spending much of the past 20 years at near-zero levels in the wake of the 2008 economic crash and the COVID pandemic.
Utilities in other jurisdictions had to appear before state regulators periodically to justify their return rates, which dropped as well in many cases. Yet Alabama Power kept earning the same margins.
The only major change to the system occurred in 2013, when the PSC switched from using the industry-standard return on equity metric to evaluate Alabama Power’s profit margins to a novel weighted retail return metric developed for Alabama. The new metric gives Alabama Power additional incentives for having a higher percentage of equity as opposed to debt, a good thing when measuring financial health of the utility, but also made it harder to compare Alabama Power’s returns to other utilities.
By then, the 13 to 14.5 percent returns guaranteed by RSE were among the highest in the nation. After the adoption of the weighted return, Alabama Power’s return on equity remained around 13 percent through 2020, but has since dropped to around 11 percent.

Rountree, the former PSC employee who served as chief of staff to then-Commissioner Terry Dunn when the switch was made in 2013, said the change seemed mostly cosmetic, to deflect criticism over the high allowed returns.
By that time, Rountree said Dunn was being boxed out by the other commissioners, having advocated strongly for formal rate hearings that the other commissioners opposed.
“I crunched a lot of numbers back in the day when they were doing that, because I wanted to make sure that I understood it, and Commissioner Dunn wanted to make sure that we knew what they were doing,” Rountree said. “It looked to me like basically what they were trying to do was refashion the presentation of the numbers so that they look more benign.”
Dunn was the lone PSC commissioner to oppose the change to weighted returns, as he had been the only commissioner criticizing Alabama Power’s high return rates. Dunn lost the Republican primary the next year, after what he called a “smear campaign” linking him to national environmental groups and criticism from other Republicans.
Alabama Power’s return on equity, based on figures included in its federal Securities and Exchange Commission filings, remained above 13 percent through 2020, falling to around 11 percent after that. It is on track to earn about 11.1 percent this year, per filings with the PSC.
Last year’s nationwide average return on equity for an electric utility approved by state regulators was 9.74 percent, according to S&P Global.
Those handful of percentage points can add up. The Energy and Policy Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group, calculated in 2020 that from 2014 through 2018, Alabama Power earned over $1 billion more in profit than it would have if it earned industry-average returns.
The group found that Alabama Power’s profits over those five years totaled $4.26 billion at around a 13 percent return on equity. The group estimates that at industry average rates of return 9.75 percent, Alabama Power would have earned $3.24 billion.
Alabama Power is projected to earn $1.56 billion in profit this year, according to its filings.
The utility agreed to a two-year rate freeze this year with the PSC, intended to avoid increases through 2027, as concerns mount about high rates and the potential need for new generation to accommodate hyperscale data center projects that are currently being planned in Alabama.
U.S. Sen. Katie Britt has, on multiple occasions, said that Alabama Power has the “highest rates in the Southeast,” and called the situation “unacceptable.”
Alabama Power and the PSC have said that any data center customers will pay the “full and fair costs” of their operations, including any new infrastructure that is required. Specific details of those contracts however will likely not be made publicly available.
Rountree said he believes it is vital that utilities be allowed to earn a fair return on their investments.
“In utility regulation, you’re trying to have your public utilities do the job they’re supposed to do as best they can, and as efficiently as they can,” Rountree said. “It’s very important to make sure that you don’t starve them to death, that they have the wherewithal to do it well.”
Rountree credits Alabama Power for being a “first-rate utility” and for helping recruit major industries like Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai to build facilities in Alabama. But he also believes the returns are too much.
“Perhaps in the earlier years, giving Alabama Power that extra boost of return to build itself into a well-operating, good utility, maybe there was some wisdom there,” Rountree said. “But by God, I think it’s unfair, and I think it should be less than it is, the allowed rate of return.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/George-wallace-horizontal-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 07:11:40.876744

Among contaminants the city found exceeding state health thresholds on some home demolition sites are arsenic, chromium, lead, and PAHs, a highly toxic class of chemicals that suggests parking lots or roadways were used as backfill. 
Test results show the city is not testing dirt on the demolition sites’ surfaces. The surfaces must be checked to fully and accurately gauge the health risk, independent experts say. That and other testing gaps may leave residents living next to unsafe toxic waste sites as Duggan leaves to run for governor. 
The gaps show “total ignorance,” of proper testing protocol, said Allen Burton, an ecosystems management researcher with the University of Michigan who studies the health risks in sites contaminated with toxic substances. 
“They don’t really know what’s going on at these sites,” Burton told Michigan Advance. “They should go out and sample the part that people are exposed to – the surface. That would answer the question of ‘Is there a health risk?’”

The Duggan administration has maintained there was no way to prevent the problem, a claim public health advocates say is untrue. The failure to address the contaminated soil, and the ongoing “dirtgate,” as some observers have dubbed it, raises questions about the success of Duggan’s blight elimination program, which he touts as he runs for governor as an independent.
“If you want to find fault, it’s in them not having a robust method for avoiding this,” said Steve Hoin, a former state regulator who worked on previous Detroit demolition site remediations. “How did this fail in the first place? It doesn’t lend confidence to the whole thing.” 
 A Duggan gubernatorial campaign spokesperson in an email statement said, “None of that is true. Every time there [w]as an issue, the dirt was tested.” 
However, no experts suggested the dirt was never tested – they allege the testing is inadequate to determine a risk. 
The Duggan administration has previously said the fact that it caught the contaminated dirt is evidence of its protocols’ success. 
Duggan announced on Dec. 22 that around 425 Detroit home demolition sites were potentially backfilled with toxic dirt that may in effect create hundreds of small toxic waste dumps throughout the city’s neighborhoods. That came after a Detroit Office of Inspector General report found 42 of 47 home sites it reviewed had dirt that was “unsafe for direct human contact.” 
The December announcement marks the fifth contaminated dirt discovery during Duggan’s tenure, in which his administration demolished around 30,000 abandoned structures.
Duggan and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, or EGLE, did not release which contaminants were in the dirt until Dec. 29, after The Guardian published a report stating that the information was being withheld. 
Officials have said some debris from the demolished Northland Shopping Mall was used to fill former basements and level demolition sites. Other sources of contaminated construction slag were used, but officials have not disclosed which. 
Some of the contaminants found on the sites are carcinogens, linked to neurological damage or present other serious health risks at very low exposure levels. Those living around the sites face a long-term health risk from dust. The situation presents a more immediate risk for kids playing in the neighborhood, or for those gardening, experts say. 
The city tested dirt samples from between 1-2 feet and 5-6 feet below the surface. It is removing dirt at sites where there are exceedances of state health thresholds for direct contact or inhalation. 

DRAFT_DETR0060_3526_Beatrice.TCLP_.RPT_REV.12.12.25 
Independent remediation experts said the testing and removal was a good step, but it does not cover the most likely exposure risk for neighbors – the surface dirt. Even if the dirt was removed, residents may have been exposed for years. 
Hoin, a former EGLE geologist, said the city’s testing did not aim to determine whether surface dirt had put neighbors’ health at risk. Instead, it aimed to determine if the backfill was toxic to a level at which state law triggered a cleanup. 
“The goal was to determine if the bulk fill material was contaminated and needed to be removed, not to determine whether there was a risk to hypothetical neighborhood kids,” Hoin said. 
Hoin praised the city’s testing, which he said looked for a wide range of contaminants and took a “conservative” approach to determining removal. But he said asking whether residents have been, or are, safe is a different question. That would require testing the surface, Hoin said. 
Nick Leonard, director of the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center in Detroit, said it is “commonplace” in these situations for the surface to be tested because “that is typically the dirt that people are going to be exposed to.” 
The city may not have sampled the surfaces because the sites were allegedly covered with a foot of clean topsoil. During his December 22 press conference, Duggan downplayed the health threat, stating that there would only be a risk “if you were to dig through the foot of topsoil and spend a lot of time digging in the dirt.”
However, the contractors have allegedly lied about the source of their dirt, raising questions about whether topsoil was actually spread, whether it was clean, or whether a full foot was spread across each site.  
Even if a foot of clean topsoil was spread, that depth is not considered an adequate toxic waste cap for residential redevelopment, U of M’s Burton said. Caps require a thicker layer, a membrane, or several feet of clay. 
Meanwhile, the city is not removing dirt at sites in which it did not find exceedances of state health thresholds for individual contaminants. But multiple toxic chemicals are at the sites, and low levels of lead, PAHs, arsenic, chromium and other toxins in combination could present a risk, even if the individual levels do not exceed health thresholds. 
Regulations do not cover multiple exposures at once. The leaves people living next door to sites that have been determined to be safe facing a potential health threat. Leonard said exposure to multiple carcinogens can especially increase the risk of cancer.  
Most of the contaminants found at high levels are carcinogens, though Leonard added that there are a number of factors that determine cancer risk, like the route and length of exposure. 
“But it’s certainly not a good thing to be exposed to a multitude of different environmental risks, particularly for Detroiters who in some respects are more susceptible to these risks for a variety of reasons,” Leonard said. 
The inadequate testing is not unique to Detroit. The government often develops testing plans or protocols that are not designed to fully determine a health risk. 
In a late December email, then-Duggan administration spokesperson John Roach said it is impossible to stop contractors from using contaminated dirt. 
“There is no protocol that suggests the City of Detroit has any legal authority to supervise and regulate the day-to-day operations of landfills or gravel pits in Oakland County – that authority belongs to EGLE,” Roach said. 
But Leonard said the city could contractually require dirt contractors to test dirt, or the city could sample the dirt. However, that would have slowed the demolition program on which Duggan is now campaigning. 
“I think it’s safe to say that the city prioritized getting things done quickly, and at the price of getting things done in a proper way that protected people,” Leonard said.

She’s pro. He’s against.
As city council members in Pasco and Lynden, respectively, they fought two of seven battles in Washington in the past two years over fluoridation in public water supplies. Those fights reflect a spike in skepticism about the long-time, dental-related practice supported by health experts. Washington already is below the national average in residents served by fluoridated water.
Barajas, who left office in recent weeks after not seeking reelection, grew up in Salinas, California, where she began raising two sons.
Salinas’ water system did not have fluoride. Barajas had to stretch a small family budget to provide fluoride to protect her boys’ teeth. After moving to Pasco 20 years ago, she got heavily involved in the community, becoming a city council member in 2018 and later serving as mayor.
A proposal went to the Pasco City Council last year to eliminate fluoride from the city’s water system because of concerns about the health effects and wanting citizens to make their own decisions about fluoride.
With one seat empty, the council split 3-3 on taking this matter to a public ballot. A follow-up vote on just the council making the decision passed 4-2 to remove the fluoride. Mayor David Milne hesitantly switched sides to apparently put the issue to bed on Nov. 17.
“It’s a disservice to those children. It’s a disservice to those families,” Barajas said.
Meanwhile, Bode has been on the Lynden City Council for 26 years. He has read lots of literature criticizing fluoridation as a health risk — lower IQs, softening bones in senior citizens, and damaging pineal glands, part of the brain that helps regulate sleep cycles.
“There’s a laundry list of studies,” Bode said.
More than two years ago, and minus one member, Lynden’s council began holding hearings and debates on ending fluoridation. It voted 4-2 to remove fluoride, but the mayor vetoed the decision. The council went through the whole process again to get a veto-proof 5-2 vote on April 21.
“This is the most important thing I’ve done for public health,” Bode said.
Health and dental experts say there appears to be an increase in anti-fluoridation efforts involving local governments, although they do not collect statistics for comparison.
Along with Pasco and Lynden, the city councils of Aberdeen and Camas have voted to remove fluoridation from their water supplies in 2024 and 2025. The Longview and Battle Ground councils voted to reject anti-fluoridation efforts. Yakima’s council is pondering the issue.
Washington’s state health department policy is to leave this matter up to local governments. “Some people think it infringes on their autonomy in their decisions on what goes into their bodies,” said state health officer Tao Kwan-Gett of the Washington State Department of Health.
This year, 46% of Washington residents have access to public fluoridated water, according to the department. It did not have percentages for previous years. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that about 72% of Americans had access to fluoridated water in 2022.
The state health department, the Washington State Dental Association and the statewide dental lobbying organization, the Arcora Foundation, are not aware on any coordinated effort to remove fluoridation, but pointed to U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s national push to stop fluoridation. 
So far, Utah and Florida have banned fluoride in public water systems.
“These (Washington efforts) are grassroots organizing. But the national narrative is driving it,” said Chris Dorow, outgoing president of the Washington State Dental Association and the only dentist in Othello. The natural water around Othello is already high in fluorides.
The use of fluoride in drinking water dates back to Colorado Springs in 1901. Spearheaded by a Colorado Springs dentist, wondering why brown stains showed up in children’s teeth, he and other researchers spent the next 30-plus years trying to figure out why those stains occurred in Colorado Springs and a few other western areas, and not elsewhere, according to the federal National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.
During that research, it was found that the brown-stained teeth were stronger and more resistant to cavities than other teeth. Fluorides in the natural water was pinned down as the source of brown stains and stronger teeth in the 1930s. Researchers then tackled finding a fluoridation sweet spot on strengthening teeth without causing brown stains.
Researchers found that balance, and Grand Rapids, Michigan, decided in 1945 to become the first city to fluoridate its public water supply. Fluoridation has a good track record on dental health. The CDC says the proper levels of fluoridation reduce tooth decay by 25%.
Poor oral health can cause pain and handicap a person’s ability to eat, sleep, learn and work, according to Arcora. Untreated oral disease can make chronic health conditions, like diabetes, worse. Medical costs can increase.
Percentages of tooth decay in Washington can vary from city to city. Hispanic, Native American, and Black children have consistently higher rates of tooth decay than their white counterparts, according to Arcora.
Lynden’s Bode pointed to numerous articles that linked fluoride with the loss of IQ points in children. The most commonly cited figures are a loss of 5 to 7 IQ points.
The peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association looked at 74 articles on studies on the links between IQ points and fluoride. Authors of the JAMA article determined that there is a high risk of scientific bias in 52 of those studies and a low risk of bias in 22. Forty-five of the articles originated from China.
The links between fluoride and loss of intelligence show up when the fluoride levels in water are above 1.5 milligrams per liter, the JAMA review found.
“There were limited data and uncertainty in the dose-response association between fluoride exposure and children’s IQ when fluoride exposure was estimated by drinking water alone at concentrations less than 1.5 mg/L,” the JAMA review said.
“That’s much higher than what we use for public water fluoridation,” said Washington state health officer Kwan-Gett.
The CDC says the recommended level for fluoride in a public water system is 0.7 milligrams per liter. Dorow pointed to the centuries-old concept that the dose of a substance often dictates whether or not it is poisonous, not the substance itself.
“There are no negative impacts at normal levels,” Kwan-Gett said.
Regarding Bode’s concerns about pineal glands and bone health, the state health department emailed a number of observations.
The agency said that while some animal studies suggest that high levels of fluoride could affect the pineal gland, studies in humans are inconclusive and limited. And the American Dental Association says that there is no known effect of fluoride on the functions of the pineal gland.
Additionally, the department pointed to a recently published review of scientific literature that concluded low concentrations of fluoride have no significant harmful effect on bone health. A recent study reported a link between fluoride exposure and bone density and fracture risk, but that was at fluoride levels that are more than twice what is used for community water systems.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/water-faucet-1024x746.jpg,,,2026-01-06 07:11:40.876744

(Photo courtesy of the Indiana Department of Transportation)The number of nixed road and bridge plans is rising, the Indiana Department of Transportation told state lawmakers on Monday, citing “funding constraints.”
“We’ve continued to cancel projects. They’ve continued to have to be postponed,” Legislative Director Aaron Wainscott said.
INDOT reported hitting the brakes on 300 projects this time last year.
“I don’t have a specific number, but I can tell you for sure that number has continued to increase over the last 12 months,” Wainscott told the House’s Roads and Transportation Committee.
“It probably wouldn’t be real hard to get that number,” replied Committee Chair Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, who also requested the dollar amount associated with those projects.
Priority initiatives have been among those trimmed, per Wainscott.
INDOT had planned a “major” interchange improvement project northwest of Indianapolis, near Whitestown. But “due to funding constraints, we’ve had to break that into about three different projects that are going to be carried out at different times,” he said, instead of all at once.
Strategic legislative revisions aid renewed Indiana drive for tolling

Another priority project, which could cost $1 billion to build, took some heat.
The Mid-States Corridor is intended to better link State Road 66 to Interstate 69 in southern Indiana, according to its dedicated website. INDOT is still working on environmental review but plans to begin construction next year, Wainscott said, prompting disbelief from Pressel.
“We canceled over 300 projects in the last year and a half, but we’re going to spend a billion dollars on a brand-new roadway,” Pressel said. “… I’m not — I’m not getting it. … I’m really looking for some guidance on how we’re doing this, but yet we’re killing other projects.”
INDOT has eyed tolling as a potential revenue generator.
U.S. law generally bans user fees on federal-aid highways, including those that make up the Interstate Highway System. There are exceptions: two “mainstream” programs, which don’t require any state-federal tolling deal, and two application-only, limited-slot pilot programs.
Wainscott confirmed INDOT submitted a tolling application late last year to the Federal Highway Administration specifically for Interstate 70, but didn’t provide it to committee lawmakers or the Capital Chronicle.
“I’m not sure if it’s necessarily public, publicly displayed. That would not be up to me to make that decision,” he told Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis.
“Well, I’m officially requesting it,” she responded.
Wainscott also said INDOT has received “good feedback” on the application but noted the agency doesn’t know how long approval will take.
Gov. Mike Braun has said that he wants to capture dollars from out-of-state vehicles traveling through Indiana that don’t fill up at the gas pump.
The federal highway department previously referred the Capital Chronicle to INDOT regarding the application but didn’t say why it couldn’t disclose a copy.
Wainscott additionally reviewed early results from a highway construction speed enforcement pilot — reporting that “excessive” speeding of 11 miles per hour over the speed limit or more has dropped by 70% in camera-enforced zones. Ticket revenue goes to the state’s General Fund, not INDOT.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Mississippi’s 174 legislators will return to the Capitol at noon on Tuesday for their 2026 regular session. 
This will be the third year of the current Legislature’s four-year term. Over the next three months, lawmakers will likely file 3,000 or more bills, winnow them down to a few hundred that are passed into law, and also set an over $7 billion state budget.

Already, legislative leaders have telegraphed that “school choice” and other K-12 public education policy will likely dominate the session.

Here are some of the major issues the Legislature is expected to focus on during this year’s session. 
School choice 
School choice policy, which includes allowing families to pay for alternative education options with public dollars, is set to be the top issue of the session.
Over the past year, House Speaker Jason White has led the charge to expand school choice. 

Proponents, who often refer to the policies as “education freedom,” say expansion would give parents more say over their children’s education. Opponents of school choice say the policies will siphon money away from an already underfunded public system and give it to private schools with little oversight.

The House committee White created to study school choice has met several times ahead of the session, and is stacked with pro-school choice advocates. Meetings of the Senate Education Committee, on the other hand, have centered on the public education system’s achievements, potentially setting up a clash between the two chambers of the Legislature.

White has vowed to bring the issue, and a bill, up early in the session. Public school advocates who oppose a universal voucher or school choice system in recent days on social media have told their followers a House vote on the issue could happen on day one of the session.
Mississippi already has some version of school choice — a limited education savings account system, some charter schools, and a plethora of private schools. But none of those are accessible to every student.

Teacher pay 
Mississippi teachers are among the lowest paid in the country, and legislative leaders have indicated they want to change that this year. 
The average teacher starting salary, $42,492 a year in Mississippi, ranks 40th in the nation, according to the National Education Association.
In 2022, state lawmakers passed the last meaningful teacher pay raise, an average annual increase of $5,140. But health insurance premium increases and inflation almost immediately started chipping away at the extra pay, and many other states in the region raised their salaries as well.
Even when adjusted for cost of living, Mississippi educators are the third-lowest paid in the country, nearly $9,000 less than the national average, according to a report from State Auditor Shad White.
Teachers recently told Mississippi Today that they have to keep second jobs and cut corners financially to make ends meet.

Ballot initiative 
For the fifth year in a row, lawmakers plan to introduce legislation to restore the ballot initiative, a way for citizens to circumvent the Legislature and place issues directly on a statewide ballot. 
The Mississippi Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the prior initiative process was invalid due to some legal technicalities.
Over the last four years, the House and Senate failed to reach an agreement over how the process could be replaced.

Prison health care reform 
House Corrections Chair Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, said she will introduce legislation based on findings gleaned from numerous tours of Mississippi’s prisons as well as instances of alleged denial of medical care documented by Mississippi Today in its “Behind Bars, Beyond Care” series.
Currie last year drafted a bill that introduced several reforms, including giving authority to the Mississippi Department of Health to review prison health care and make policy changes. Other central tenets of the bill included ensuring that inmates have access to 24/7 medical care, dispensing medication in a way that ensures inmates who need it actually receive it, requiring prisons to provide communal electronic kiosks for prisoners to request medical appointments and waiving fees for a wide range of medical services.
Long considered one of the most conservative members of the Mississippi House, Currie last year secured support from the entire House, winning over everyone from tough-on-crime Republicans to criminal justice reform-minded Democrats. The bill passed 118-0 in the House. It was amended and whittled down before passing the Senate, but ultimately died in late negotiations between the chambers.
Currie believes the bill contained too many provisions, drawing opposition from the office of Gov. Tate Reeves and some of his Senate allies. To avoid a similar impasse this year, Currie will introduce many of the same measures, but in separate bills.
One key policy fix Currie plans to reintroduce this year is revamping the process by which inmates request medical attention at many prisons. Prisoners often still need to rely on guards to bring them to an infirmary. This arrangement gives guards, who are not medical professionals, the power to determine whether a prisoner receives immediate care.
Another prison health care issue Currie plans to tackle again is the spread of hepatitis C. Documents and private conversations reported by Mississippi Today show the problem appears to be widespread in state prisons.
Currie plans to keep pushing for the Department of Corrections and VitalCore to purchase hepatitis C medication through health care organizations enrolled in the federal 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical companies to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices. The program can offer discounts on drugs in the range of 20% to 50%.
In an interview, Senate Corrections Chairman Juan Barnett, a Democrat from Heidelberg, said that he “vaguely remembered” Currie’s bill and supported some of its key provisions, but wanted to center efforts in his committee around reducing Mississippi’s prison population to free up more money for health care services.

Opioid settlement spending 
The Legislature must decide how to spend over $100 million Mississippi is receiving from a national opioid lawsuit settlement. These funds are intended to help address the state’s ongoing opioid crisis that has killed thousands of Mississippians over the past decade. 
One portion of the funds is specifically earmarked for programs to prevent and treat opioid misuse, and another smaller pot can be used for any public purpose. But the Legislature must eventually appropriate money from both of the funds. 
Lawmakers in 2025 created the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council to review grant applications from organizations proposing addiction prevention projects and make prioritized recommendations to the Legislature. The council recently recommended more than $80 million in the two highest tiers for specific projects.

Public Employee Retirement System 
Legislative leaders once again want to address the financial sustainability of the state’s public pension system, which has a $26 billion unfunded actuarial liability.
They will also likely debate concerns over the massive changes to the system they passed into law last year, including creating a new system for new hires that will be a hybrid of a defined contribution plan, similar to the 401(k) system many private employers offer, and a defined benefit plan which the state has had for decades. Opponents of the new hybrid plan say its more austere benefits will make it hard for the state to hire and retain workers, particularly first responders and teachers.
First responders, through their associations of chiefs of police and firefighters, are calling on lawmakers to create a separate retirement plan for them.
Speaker White and the House leadership aim to establish a dedicated, recurring revenue stream for PERS, but Hosemann and his Senate leadership have favored a direct cash infusion to address the liability. 
Specifically, House leadership has favored diverting the bulk of the state’s lottery proceeds to PERS, or legalizing mobile sports betting and taxing a portion of the bets.

(Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s largest state employee pension fund can’t recover losses from investments in Ontario-based capital funds, a Cole County judge ruled last month as he closed out a five-year court battle.
The Missouri State Employees Retirement System, or MOSERS, spent at least $21 million pursuing the case accusing Catalyst Capital Group Inc. of mismanaging $175 million entrusted to its care. In a Dec. 19 decision, Circuit Judge Daniel Green ruled MOSERS failed to prove its allegations of misconduct against Catalyst and ordered MOSERS to pay the defendants’ costs to contest the lawsuit.
The ruling comes as lawmakers return to the Capitol this week to start working on the state budget for the coming fiscal year. MOSERS is again asking for an increase in the pension contribution rate — to 32% of state payroll costs — as investment returns lag behind increases in promised benefits.
For fiscal 2027, which begins July 1, MOSERS is asking lawmakers for $864 million, including $533 million in general revenue. The total request is almost $330 million more than the state’s contribution for fiscal 2023.
The final ruling from Green came after several preliminary decisions pared the lawsuit down by dismissing several claims. One barred MOSERS from seeking damages on behalf of other investors because MOSERS had not attempted to make other investors, including the University of Missouri, parties to the lawsuit.
Chuck Hatfield, the attorney representing Catalyst, said the decision vindicated the investment group’s actions. MOSERS claimed losses linked to three funds created by Catalyst that have purchased companies like Cirque du Soleil and Canada-based Gateway Casinos were due to misconduct by fund managers.
“These funds all still own companies that are not sold yet,” Hatfield said. “When they do (sell), MOSERS is probably going to make a fair amount of money on that sale.”
MOSERS filed the lawsuit in 2020 when Catalyst called for the pension system to fulfill $10 million of its $100 million commitment to one of the three funds. 
In a statement to The Independent, MOSERS spokeswoman Candy Smith said Green’s order didn’t address the merits of the allegations.
“The judge’s rulings did not evaluate the actual misconduct at issue,” Smith wrote. 
The lawsuit outlined what MOSERS considered to be loans that were made to an insider at Catalyst that also put too much of the funds into a single entity. 
The system’s board of trustees will consider whether an appeal has a likelihood of success, Smith wrote.
MOSERS is the general pension system for state employees, covering workers in most state agencies and state universities. There are 56,494 retirees and their dependents currently receiving benefits and 44,673 active state employees, with another 17,943 vested and scheduled to receive a benefit at retirement age.
According to the latest annual report, MOSERS had $12.1 billion in cash and investments at the end of June, with net assets of $9.6 billion. At the end of June, it had enough money to cover 55.4% of current and future obligations. That is down from 59% in fiscal 2021, when the lawsuit was filed.
During arguments in court, attorneys for MOSERS said it invested $120 million of $175 million in commitments to Catalyst Funds III, IV and V, pledging to invest up to $50 million, $25 million and $100 million, respectively.
At a hearing in 2020, MOSERS said it lost $34 million from $50 million invested in Fund III, $18 million from $25 million invested in Fund IV, and $7.2 million of the $45 million invested to that point in Fund V.
In the investment section of the most recent annual report, the market value of the funds were listed as $11.2 million for Fund III, $6 million for Fund IV and $61.2 million for Fund V. The report does not state how much has been received as distributions from those funds.
One reason MOSERS saw several of its claims dismissed in early 2025 was because its attorneys did not bring other investors into the case as co-plaintiffs. Instead, MOSERS sought to assert the claims on their behalf — and recover the damages — without their participation.
“MOSERS argues that defendants engaged in rampant, potentially criminal misconduct for the better part of a decade, and that such conduct caused more than $1 billion in damages to these investment funds,” Green wrote in the January 2025 decision. “If that were true, it is reasonable to think that MOSERS could muster evidence that even one other investor (some of whom contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the funds) shared MOSERS grievances.”
Green refused to issue an order at that point to bring other investors into the lawsuit.
“The judge said they were a day late and a dollar short,” Hatfield said. “Many of their claims were time-barred and they should have known long ago. And many of their claims were just wrong on the law.”
Through the end of June, MOSERS had paid $20.6 million for legal help, including $15 million to the law firm Quinn Emanuel, $3.6 million to  Thompson Coburn and $2 million for expert witnesses.
Changes in investment assumptions, not the payments to attorneys, are the reason MOSERS is falling behind in its actuarial evaluations, Smith said. The return on investments for fiscal 2025 was a strong 9.8%, she said.
The board “implemented positive changes to the funding policy, fully aware that these changes would cause a short-term decline in the funded ratio and an increase in the contribution rate,” Smith wrote, “but work toward the long-term goal of being fully funded.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050523_Mosers2-1024x640.jpg,,,2026-01-06 07:11:40.876744

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)LGBTQ advocates urged New Jersey lawmakers Monday to protect health care for the state’s transgender community, demanding action on stalled legislation at a midday rally outside the Statehouse in Trenton as federal threats mount.
A bill that would shield both patients and providers in New Jersey from criminal or civil liability for getting or giving health care related to gender dysphoria and gender incongruence has languished since it was introduced in June 2024. Almost half of the Legislature has signed on as sponsors, and the bill’s backers say it has enough other legislative support to pass.
The bill would codify protections Gov. Phil Murphy (D) outlined in a 2023 executive order.
“Everyone deserves health care without discrimination, and trans people are part of everyone. It’s just health care, legislators! It’s nothing to be afraid of!” said Melissa Firstenberg, a transgender woman from Marlton who emceed the rally.
Louise Walpin, an advocate who helped lead the fight to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey more than a decade ago, said lawmakers have failed to act despite a flood of constituent calls and emails supporting the legislation.
“This is not how a democracy works. This is a failure of government, and we will call it out,” Walpin said. “Delay is not neutrality. Delay is collaborating with hate. Delay is harm.”





















































































The delay is also “batsh*t crazy,” said one lawmaker who joined the rally to support the bill.
“If New Jersey wants to be a state that protects people instead of targeting them, if we are going to be choosing compassion and courage over cruelty, then this bill needs to pass and be enacted swiftly,” said bill sponsor Sen. Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson).
Rich McGrath, a spokesman for New Jersey’s Senate Democrats, said Senate President Nicholas Scutari had no comment on why the bill hasn’t moved. Spokespeople for Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin did not respond to a request for comment. Both men control what bills advance in their chamber.
Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester), a bill sponsor who also joined the rally to talk up the bill, conceded lawmakers have a rapidly shrinking window to get the bill to Murphy’s desk, with the next two-year legislative session set to begin on Jan. 13. But if they fail to act, he added, the bill will just be introduced again in the new session.
“We’re hoping to get it done. Speaking personally, I’d like to get it done this week. If not, the game goes on. We regroup very quickly,” he told the New Jersey Monitor.
It’s unclear if Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) would support the legislation. Her spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment.
The legislative inaction comes as hospitals around New Jersey, following a national trend, have increasingly scaled back or abandoned altogether gender-affirming care, fearing federal funding cuts and other reprisals.
On his first day in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring his administration would recognize only two sexes. The Trump administration also issued a report critical of gender-affirming care, and threatened to withhold funding from hospitals that provide such care to youth.
Trump loomed large at Monday’s rally.
Tina Neal, who heads the transgender-supportive nonprofit Tertium Quid, said the Trump administration’s strategy of threatening to defund hospitals to force compliance is a “mafia tactic.”
“I don’t blame providers for making impossible choices under financial coercion. That’s exactly why this administration is doing it. But you know who has money? The state. You know who has the power to keep this care alive for those who need it? The state,” Neal said. “So New Jersey, we ask you: Are you going to stand up for your children?”
Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, have passed similar shield laws, and outgoing New York City Mayor Eric Adams created a $2 million emergency fund last month to ensure access to such care, according to Andy Bowen, a former Garden State Equality executive director and the group’s first transgender leader.
New Jersey legislators should protect gender-affirming care because restricting it for transgender people is discriminatory, said Nathan Rodriguez, executive director of the Trans Equity Coalition. Cisgender people receive gender-affirming care every day already in the form of hormone treatment for menopause, breast reconstruction for cancer survivors, hair transplants, and testosterone for men with low hormones, Rodriguez said.
“That is gender-affirming care, and there’s no outrage, no legislation, and no moral panic,” he said. “If you are willing to let the government strip these rights from trans people, please ask yourself this: Who will be next? How far are you going to let them go before they are knocking on your door, deciding what care you are allowed to receive?”

According to our recent survey of officials in Michigan communities, local democracy is humming along and city hall is taking care of business.
The federal government was shut down in October and November 2025, but cities and towns around the United States continued to fill potholes, purify drinking water, respond to emergency calls and issue construction permits, mostly with little fanfare.
But Michiganders should not take this local resilience for granted. Officials – especially in rural communities – are also raising some red flags about declining public engagement, deteriorating public discourse and harassment.
 The view from city hall

At the University of Michigan’s Center for Local, State and Urban Policy, we have been surveying local officials in Michigan’s 1,856 cities, villages, counties and townships since 2009. About 70% of local governments in the state complete our survey each year, which means that our results reflect the opinions of everyone from township clerks in the Upper Peninsula to mayors of larger cities in the Metro Detroit area.
This Michigan Public Policy Survey has covered a wide variety of local issues over the years. One topic we track closely is how democracy is functioning in local communities.
While many public opinion surveys ask how Americans feel about democracy, very few examine the viewpoints of local officials whose job it is to carry out the daily work of democratic governance. For example, instead of asking whether people trust their government, we flip the question around and ask local officials whether they trust their residents to be responsible participants in policymaking.
 Democracy at its grassroots is strong

To get a high-level understanding of local democratic health, we ask Michigan local officials to rate the overall functioning of democracy in their communities on a scale of 1 to 10, from total breakdown to perfectly functioning.
Statewide, 82% reported a score of 7 or higher when we surveyed them in the spring of 2025. This percentage has remained remarkably steady since we first began tracking it in 2020.
At the other end of the scale, only 2% of communities this year rated democracy poorly – 4 or below – falling from a high of 7% in 2024.

 Small and rural communities are falling behind

While these high ratings are good news for local democracy in general, when we break down the results by whether communities consider themselves more urban or rural, we see some divergence. While 82% of communities overall reported relatively good democratic health this year, this reflects 92% of urban communities and 79% of rural communities.
We also see evidence of a growing urban/rural divide in resident engagement, an essential ingredient of democratic health. When we asked local officials how engaged their residents were with their local governments, 64% of urban communities said their residents were somewhat or very engaged, but only 41% of rural communities felt the same. In fact, 13% of rural communities said their residents are not engaged at all, compared with only 5% of urban communities.

Similarly, local officials in urban communities have higher levels of trust in their residents to be responsible participants in local policymaking – for example, by contributing ideas, volunteering or speaking with elected officials. In Michigan’s urban communities, 48% of local officials said they trust their residents nearly always or most of the time. However, only 38% of rural local officials had the same level of trust in their residents.
 The big picture looks less rosy

While rural communities currently appear to be struggling more than urban communities to engage with their residents, looking over time, democratic participation is getting worse everywhere. For example, 18% of Michigan communities statewide reported this year that civic discourse among residents was somewhat or very divisive, up from 11% in 2012.
Between 2012 and today, despite their efforts to expand engagement opportunities, particularly online, local officials’ satisfaction with their residents’ level of engagement has plummeted from 58% in 2012 to 38% in 2025. Among the most common frustrations are that their efforts attract the same people over and over and that a small vocal minority of residents is negatively affecting overall engagement.
Even more troubling, about half of local officials who responded to the 2022 version of our survey have experienced some kind of personal harassment, with 39% reporting in-person harassment such as hostile or aggressive comments, 31% reporting online harassment and 3% reporting violent actions like assault or destruction of property.
 Looking ahead

While only 17% of Americans currently trust the federal government to “do what is right” “just about always” or “most of the time,” according to a recent Pew survey, 65% of Americans still trust their local government. And as our survey results suggest, most local officials feel pretty confident that they’re being good stewards of local democracy, despite declining help and input from their residents.
To any Americans worried about the state of their democracy, may we suggest heading to the next meeting of the local planning commission? We hear there are sometimes even snacks.

(Photo by Paul Bradbury/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — A legislative measure that seeks to slap restrictions on where homeless shelters can operate across most of Oklahoma is a misguided effort that will cause more harm to an already marginalized community, some advocates say.
Critics of Senate Bill 484, which prevents new homeless shelters from being built within 3,000 feet of a school or school property, said while the legislation appears targeted at registered sex offenders, it would create unintended consequences for unhoused families. They said there are better solutions to address the issue.
Kori Hall, chief programs officer for City Care, an Oklahoma City service provider for homeless people, said lawmakers envision schools and churches as a place where children can access services, and they pass legislation restricting sex offenders from accessing those areas.
But Hall said this bill, which could be considered by the House when lawmakers reconvene in February, has the potential to harm those youth too because a lot of people experiencing homelessness and utilizing services and shelters are families with children.
“Children need to be able to have access to shelters and also to school,” she said. “So creating that distance barrier can kind of be a barrier for them to receive both of the services that they need.”
Hall said her organization is located less than a 0.5 miles from three different elementary schools, and they’ve never had an issue.
“Those schools partner with us because people staying in our shelter have kids who go to their schools,” she said. “It’s actually a benefit for them to have those families close because it makes sure that their kids can go to school and not have truancy.”
The bill would apply to every Oklahoma city with populations of less than 300,000. Only Oklahoma City and Tulsa have populations greater than that. Existing homeless, domestic violence and youth shelters and those operating within places of worship would be exempt.
According to the 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to Congress, a report compiled by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 5,467 people experienced homelessness in Oklahoma in 2024, a 17.6% increase from the previous year. Of those, 1,060 were “people in families with children,” and 450 were “unaccompanied youth,” a term for minors who are not under the care of a parent or legal guardian.
State Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, who authored the measure did not respond to requests for comment, but in January 2025 said the bill is intended to address public safety.
“That’s a constituent bill from my town of Norman which is absolutely a Dumpster fire right now, and what they’ve done to allow the homeless to establish a vagrant nation, if you will … The public safety at Norman is at risk,” she said.
Standridge’s bill narrowly cleared the state Senate last year and is available to be considered by the House when lawmakers reconvene in February.
Norman Mayor Stephen Tyler Holman, whose city would be impacted by the legislation, said the measure seems “arbitrary, capricious, potentially discriminatory” in that it exempts Oklahoma City and Tulsa.
 “It obviously doesn’t really address or solve the issue of homelessness at all,” Holman said. “And it aims to take away the ability for local residents to decide for what we think is best for our own communities. (I am) hoping that we can work with Senator Standridge and other state representatives on ways to actually address the root causes of homelessness and why it’s such a big issue in the state of Oklahoma statewide.”
Cleveland County, where Norman is located, experienced an approximate 12.7% increase in the total number of homeless in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to a 2024 Point in Time Count, an annual census of people experiencing homelessness.
Holman said lawmakers could help his community by determining the future of the state mental hospital that is in Norman, as well as the future of the services it provides to the homeless population located in that area.
“And, if we can more adequately address the shortage of housing, we can prevent more people from becoming homeless, then the homeless issue is easier and less expensive to deal with, ideally,” he said.
He said it would also help if lawmakers also adequately funded mental health services.
Alissa Gilmore, program director and treasurer of the Micah Community Movement, an Oklahoma City-based homelessness service organization, said she doesn’t see any positives to Standridge’s bill.
She said systematic issues in society create homelessness.
Increased access to mental health and affordable drug addiction treatment would both be better solutions.
“Those are things that help to solve homelessness, not just move it around,” Gilmore said. “This kind of bill does nothing to solve homelessness. It basically just moves it around. It’s not an attempt to  make anything better.”

Mike Braun discusses Indiana public safety in an interview on Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, in his Statehouse office. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun on Tuesday touted what his administration called major public safety gains in its first year, pointing to large drug seizures, stepped-up traffic enforcement and a sharp decline in overdose deaths as evidence that Indiana is “safer” under his watch.
In a news release, Braun credited the Indiana State Police with disrupting drug trafficking networks operating in and around the state and removing impaired drivers from Hoosier roads.
The governor said those outcomes are the clearest way he judges whether his administration’s public safety strategy is working.
“You look at statistics — overdose deaths, what we’re taking off the streets — that’s how you measure it,” Braun said in a sit-down interview with the Indiana Capital Chronicle on Monday. “Hopefully, you see big improvements at first, and then over time, you see it trend down and compare favorably to other states.”
‘Safer’ Indiana roads
Public safety was a central theme of Braun’s campaign and transition agenda, which emphasized tougher enforcement against violent crime and drug trafficking, stronger penalties for repeat offenders and closer coordination between state and local law enforcement agencies. 
The plan specifically singled out methamphetamine and fentanyl as major drivers of crime and overdose deaths in Indiana and posited that drug trafficking networks exploit gaps in border enforcement.

“When you look at the consequences of open borders, many of us think every state, every county, every town pays the consequences of it,” Braun said.
“There was such an infrastructure built up with cartels basically having easy ways to enter, and that’s been disrupted” by federal efforts, he added, but every state “still has to do its own part.”
Since taking office, Braun has also highlighted traffic safety as a key component of that approach. The governor’s office said Tuesday that operating while intoxicated arrests increased 17% in 2025 — from 3,406 the year before to 3,985. Braun attributed the increase to ISP’s intensified enforcement efforts aimed at impaired driving.
Those arrests coincided with a decline in fatal crashes statewide. Indiana saw 737 fatal crashes in 2025, down from 804 the previous year, according to the governor’s office. Braun’s administration said the 8.3% decrease is the result of greater traffic enforcement by state police and local law enforcement.
Late last year, for example, the state police rolled out a new fleet of patrol vehicles as part of a broader push to modernize the agency’s roadway enforcement tools and increase visibility on Indiana’s highways.
ISP leadership said the updated fleet — which includes a handful of high-performance Ford Mustang GTs —  is intended to help troopers more effectively deter reckless driving, aggressive behavior and street racing.
“We’re paying more attention to it,” Braun said of impaired driving enforcement. “That OWI number went up because we’re ferreting it out. We’re finding it. If it increased by 17%, that tells you there were way too many people still out there driving while intoxicated.”
State police up drug seizures
ISP interdiction teams additionally seized hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs in 2025, according to the governor’s office, including nearly 1,100 pounds of cocaine found in a U-Haul truck and more than 70 pounds of heroin recovered from a semi-truck. 
State police also confiscated roughly 70,000 THC vape cartridges, which officials said were unregulated products intended for illegal distribution.
Altogether, ISP reported seizing 630 kilograms of cocaine and 38 kilograms of opioids last year, which Braun’s administration described as a significant blow to cartel supply lines feeding Indiana communities.
The release said ISP detectives relied on advanced investigative tools, including wiretaps, to dismantle drug rings operating in small and midsize Hoosier communities, targeting “not only couriers, but the suppliers directing distribution into the state.”

As a result, opioid seizures increased by 117% in 2025, according to the governor’s office.
State officials further pointed to a reported 60% drop in overdose deaths statewide as the most consequential outcome of those efforts.
“Overdose deaths — that’s one of the biggest indicators,” Braun said. “A lot of what was coming across the border illicitly is not anymore, and when you’re taking millions of dollars of drugs off the street, that’s how you start to see those numbers change.”
And Braun’s team said drug interdiction efforts have continued into 2026. 
Over the weekend, ISP seized 140 kilograms of cocaine during a traffic stop — an estimated $7 million street value, according to the governor’s office.
Braun championed several public safety-related measures during the 2025 legislative session, including policies that increase penalty levels for crimes involving fentanyl and provided additional tools for prosecuting impaired driving and drug-related crimes.
Lawmakers returned to the Statehouse on Monday for the 2026 short session, which is scheduled to conclude by the end of February. Neither the House nor Senate Republican supermajority caucuses have released their priority agendas yet.
Braun isn’t expected to release his newest legislative priorities until next week. He admitted that state lawmakers “might already be worn out” from hectic work during last year’s budget-setting session and a legislative battle over redistricting in December, “but they’re going to have some good ideas” on public safety matters.
“A lot of what we did through executive orders is already being used as a template for legislation,” Braun said. “When something makes sense, you want to codify it. So, we’ll keep pointing that out.”

Wyoming's small towns struggle to maintain law enforcement services in the face of unstable funding, sparse populations and vast distances.
The post Policing in Medicine Bow went boom, then bust, reflecting statewide funding challenges appeared first on WyoFile .","During a recent Medicine Bow Town Council meeting, a local radio station owner asked if the town could cite a resident for a barking dog. The answer is no, Mayor Justin George explained, because no local ordinances can be enforced without a functioning marshal’s department.
Nestled in the northeastern corner of Carbon County, Medicine Bow is home to fewer than 250 people. Made famous by Owen Wister’s 1902 novel “The Virginian,” the small town today struggles with sustaining law and order in such a remote enclave.
In early 2024, the Medicine Bow Town Council voted to dissolve its local law enforcement, the town’s Marshal’s Office. Soon after, the council traded three unused patrol cars, three rifles and $55,000 to the Carbon County Sheriff’s Office in return for 360 hours of annual patrol time. Before the agreement was finalized, Sheriff Alex Bakken made it clear that his deputies could not enforce local ordinances. Instead, deputies would spend the contracted time in Medicine Bow responding to emergency calls and monitoring traffic on Highway 30.
Last summer, the contract came up for renewal. During their regular August meeting, Medicine Bow Town Council members publicly criticized the coverage the sheriff’s department provided, citing multiple alleged instances of deputies’ vehicles facing away from the highway as traffic passed through town without slowing down. Due to those allegations, and a lack of funding, the council unanimously voted not to continue the partnership, leaving the community without a law enforcement contract.
Sheriff Bakken did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication. 
Small-town justice
Between its founding in the late 1860s and 2019, Medicine Bow relied entirely on Carbon County to provide law enforcement. In 2019, flush with impact assistance funding from nearby wind projects such as the Ekola Flats wind farm, the Town Council voted to allocate $1 million to establish a Town Marshal’s Office. The plan was to maintain local law enforcement as long as possible using the impact money, while the marshal and his deputies supplemented the operating budget by writing citations.
But the experiment came to an abrupt end. In early 2024, with less than $400,000 left in the budget, the council decided to close the department and return law enforcement duties to the sheriff. Councilors said they had anticipated the funds would last longer than they ultimately did.

With the Medicine Bow Marshal’s Office now shuttered, the town was left with tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of equipment, including guns, ammunition and patrol vehicles. In July of 2025, the council voted to sell the weapons and equipment to a local firearms dealer. That’s when the council concluded that much of the money allocated to the marshals had been spent inefficiently.
In November 2025, Mayor Justin George ticked through an itemized list of leftover equipment from the closed office along with the cost to the town. As a whole, the governing body expressed disbelief at the amount of equipment purchased by the Medicine Bow Marshal’s Office during its five years of operation.
As an example of waste, the mayor reported that the department spent nearly $2,000 on 5,200 rounds of 9mm ammunition for mandatory firearms training. However, an inventory revealed that every bullet was present, indicating no training had occurred.
Additionally, the Marshal’s Office had purchased six $600 spike strips, three $200 combat-ready trauma bags with folding stretchers, three $120 bolt cutters, a $500 pair of Vortex-brand binoculars, and a black cowboy hat, valued at between $100 and $300.
“That was ridiculous, that stuff they had,” Councilwoman Kristi Wickizer said at the November meeting. “It was beyond ridiculous.”
Town policy allows department heads to spend up to $5,000 without prior approval from the council, the mayor said, adding that many of the questionable purchases fell just below the spending threshold.
Medicine Bow is set to recover $8,000 from the firearms sale, money that will be used to pay off outstanding debts from the marshal’s five-year stint, including a $17,000 Motorola radio service bill.
But two former mayors defended the marshal’s department, including its spending, and told WyoFile that they’re disappointed to see it disbanded.   
In 2022, voters elected Sharron Biamon, who was on the council when the marshal’s department was established, as mayor. She resigned the following year, and Councilor Lucy Schofield was appointed to replace her as mayor. Schofield resigned that summer.
While none of the elected officials responsible for the formation of the Medicine Bow Marshal’s Office are still on the council, both Biamon and Schofield said their councils fully supported how the department was run. Purchases had been approved and backed by the council, they said. They added that if the roughly $200,000 in annual ticket revenue had been reinvested into the Marshal’s Office, instead of going into the town’s general budget, the department would still be operating today.
The price of enforcing laws
Medicine Bow isn’t the only Wyoming town struggling to maintain a dedicated law enforcement agency. Twenty miles to the west, in the former coal-mining town of Hanna, local officials continue to wrestle with the cost of operating their own marshal’s office.
Hanna was once a major supplier of coal for the Union Pacific Railroad. After more than a century of mining, however, the seams became increasingly difficult to reach, and by the early 2000s the last coal company had shut down. During the height of the coal era, the town established the Hanna Marshal’s Office to police its few thousand residents. With the mines now closed, Hanna’s population has fallen to fewer than 700. Despite the decline, the town continues to maintain its own law enforcement operation, now staffed by only two part‑time marshals. The Hanna Town Council has repeatedly said it cannot afford to hire any full-time officers.
Many municipalities in Carbon County are turning to the Sheriff’s Office for the entirety of their law enforcement coverage. Like Medicine Bow once did, the towns of Riverside and Baggs signed memorandums of understanding, agreeing to pay the county to have deputies spend a set number of hours in each community. Carbon County commissioners have said towns that rely on the Sheriff’s Office for policing should help fund the department, especially in light of recent state property tax relief measures.
When Carbon County saw 2025 property tax revenue drop by more than $900,000, commissioners cut services across a county spanning nearly 8,000 square miles.
Providing legally required core services, such as water, sewer and law enforcement, is becoming increasingly expensive. In Saratoga, rising equipment costs have led the town, which still maintains its own police force, to cede emergency dispatching duties to the Carbon County Sheriff’s Office. Sheriff Alex Bakken has spent years studying if all dispatching services should be consolidated under his supervision, a prospect the Rawlins Police Department doesn’t fully support.
Even as counties and municipalities struggle to provide law enforcement coverage, state legislators are pursuing additional cuts to property taxes — a primary mechanism of funding county and local governments — including proposals to eliminate residential property taxes entirely. Sheriff Bakken has said that consolidating all emergency dispatching services under one roof is inevitable. Facing increased costs and decreased funding, some local officials wonder whether the same may eventually apply to law enforcement departments themselves. 
In the meantime, Medicine Bow residents must continue relying on the Sheriff’s Office, 40 miles away, for emergency response.

Barrasso and Lummis ""sanewash"" president's dangerous behavior in attack on Venezuela, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Wyoming’s dynamic Senate duo blindly follows Trump downhill appeared first on WyoFile .","Is there a lie that Donald Trump can tell to distract Americans from his incompetence that Wyoming’s U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis won’t stand up and applaud?

Opinion

I don’t think so, based on their response to Saturday’s reckless military strike against Venezuela. Trump’s administration didn’t even tell Congress it had invaded the country and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife until after the mission was completed.
Neither Barrasso nor Lummis questioned why the U.S. would attack a sovereign nation to force regime change that was certain to be condemned by dozens of other countries for breaking international laws, including China, Russia, most of Europe and Venezuela’s neighbors.
Whatever happened to Trump’s “America First” agenda that stoked his base in the last election? It sounds like he pushed it off the table to focus on his own dictatorship dreams.
The two senators didn’t say a word about how the move will destabilize the world and give bad actors like Russia an excuse to seize control of any country and its assets. 
Lummis went on social media to praise Trump’s “decisive leadership.” Both she and Barrasso branded Maduro a “narco-terrorist” — the GOP’s catch phrase of the day — and characterized his arrest as saving thousands of American lives.
Let’s be clear: Both senators were right when they called Maduro a dictator and said the world is safer with him out of power. But to contend that he posed an imminent threat to the U.S. and had to be forcibly removed without even consulting Congress just isn’t true, no matter how many stories Trump invents.
The Poynter Institute’s PolitiFact examined Trump’s justification for blowing up more than 30 boats off the coast of Venezuela since September, killing at least 115 people. It noted he never provided any evidence about what illegal drugs were supposedly on the ships or where they were headed. In one high-profile case, a second strike was ordered to kill two survivors who were clinging to wreckage to keep from drowning. 
If that’s not a war crime, what is?
At his post-invasion press conference, Trump claimed drugs on each boat would kill, “on average, 25,000 people.” If true, the mini-armada would have killed some 800,000 people, nearly 11 times as many drug overdose deaths as the U.S. reports annually.



But Trump gave himself credit for knocking “out 97% of the drugs coming in by sea.” In less than four months! Do you believe it? Of course not, but Barrasso and Lummis apparently have to if they don’t want to get knocked around on Truth Social.
In reality, experts in crime, drugs and Venezuela say the country plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the U.S. compared to Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico. But we aren’t toppling those nations’ leaders and rushing them to New York City for criminal trials.
Trump repeated his ridiculously false claim that Maduro emptied Venezuela’s mental institutions and prisons and sent them all to the U.S. “They were drug dealers. They were drug kingpins. They sent everybody bad into the United States, but no longer,” he said. “And we now have a border where nobody gets through.”
Then the president told us the real reason he invaded Venezuela. The South American nation, he said, “unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets, and American platforms costing us billions and billions of dollars.” Trump is pissed off, and he wants his revenge.
“Massive oil infrastructure was taken like we were babies, so we didn’t do anything about it,” Trump said. “I would have done something about it. America will never allow foreign powers to rob our people or drive us back into and out of our own hemisphere.”
I never expected the truth to suddenly burst from Trump’s lips, but he spelled out how he intends to help his billionaire oil buddies clean up. He said — again without evidence — that our country’s role in governing Venezuela “won’t cost us anything” because U.S. oil companies will invest in new infrastructure.
“It’s going to make a lot of money,” the president added, though many Americans would probably come to that conclusion on their own.
I think Wyoming voters still wearing blinders when it comes to Trump’s huge credibility problems, should ask themselves what’s more plausible: Is he actually kicking ass and fixing our national drug problems by taking over another country in total upheaval, or is Trump trying to make us forget all those phony promises to lower prices and turn the economy around?
There are myriad reasons why starting an illegal war probably seemed like a great option for Trump, who certainly won’t view it as a moral issue as long as people give him proper credit for doing it. 
His first year back in the White House must have been a miserable experience, except when he demolished the East Wing to build a garish $300 million ballroom, or added his name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Arts, or got his kicks ridiculing a famous Hollywood couple who’d just been stabbed to death.
The national media is finally focusing attention on Trump’s rapid physical and mental decline, though not nearly as much as it did by being complicit and railroading Joe Biden out of office.
Then there’s that pesky scandal about Trump’s dead pedophile pal, Jeffrey Epstein, and the treasure trove of documents yet to be released about the infamous crimes. It’s even driven a wedge between the president and some of his most previously loyal MAGA followers, like U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Who could have seen that coming?
There won’t be any splits like that from the Wyoming delegation. Barrasso can’t keep his position as the No. 2 Senate Republican without Trump’s backing. Lummis is leaving the Capitol at the end of her term next year, but she won’t rock the boat. And her likely successor, Rep. Harriet Hageman, was strangely silent about the Venezuelan attack over the weekend, but she owes her political career to the president. 
If Secretary of State Chuck Gray continues his unlikely climb up the state’s political ladder and lands Hageman’s U.S. House seat, he’ll remain a loyal lapdog.
It would be great to see a Wyoming candidate who would dare question why Trump bypassed Congress. Even his chief of staff, Susan Wiles, told Vanity Fair that Trump would need a green light from Congress to approve land strikes in Venezuela.
A president can use military force as commander in chief, but only Congress can constitutionally declare war or fund one. If Trump used this mission just to take the heat off himself for the moment, I can see him simply declaring victory and looking for the next big magic trick to avoid accountability. 
But will any Wyoming Republican politician ever be held responsible for allowing Trump’s madness to be “sanewashed?”

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Five years ago today we were transfixed by the surreal spectacle of the attack on the U.S. Capitol. The violence and horror of that day was made more bearable when the insurrectionists were arrested and the election results they tried to overturn were certified.
But now they’re back, pardoned by President Donald Trump and released from prison and planning to parade triumphantly today through the streets of Washington, D.C. 
Among the people convicted and later pardoned by Trump, at least 33 have been arrested and charged with new crimes, according to the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Their alleged continuing criminal behaviors include rape, illegal possession of weapons, firing on police officers, and, in the case of Chrisopher Moynihan, threatening to murder House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. 
Some of the most violent offenders are back behind bars. But the most powerful proponents of the Big Lie, including Trump himself, the enablers who staff his administration and the Wisconsin Republicans who hatched the fake electors scheme to try to overturn the results of the 2020 election, continue to work to undermine our democracy. 
“We must continue to defeat election deniers and the threats they pose,” the Wisconsin-based progressive firm Law Forward declares on its website, in a section devoted to a timeline of the fake electors scheme. Law Forward brought the first class-action lawsuit against Wisconsin’s fake electors, and forced the release of documents, text messages and other evidence showing how the plot unfolded. They present the timeline “as a call to action for every American to see how close our democracy came to toppling and how the freedom to vote must continue to be protected, not taken for granted.” 
For a few years it seemed as though we had dispelled the nightmare of Jan. 6. But the lawless, emboldened second Trump administration has dragged us back to that scary, dangerous time.
The brave work of people like Jeff Mandell, founder of Law Forward, and the other lawyers, judges and investigators who continue to struggle against the agents of authoritarianism trying to destroy American democracy is still making a difference. 
Last month, Dane County Judge John Hyland found probable cause to continue the trial of Wisconsin attorney James Troupis and Trump campaign aide Mike Roman, charged with felony forgery by Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul in connection with the fake electors scheme. Hyland  rejected Troupis’ desperate effort to scuttle the case by claiming another judge had a personal bias against him.
Wisconsin attorney Ken Cheseboro, the originator of the fake electors plot, is also facing felony charges.
As Trump and his gang openly defy the U.S. Constitution, pursue baseless, vindictive prosecutions of their political enemies, launch military actions without the consent of Congress, threaten to seize other countries and use their positions to enrich themselves while destroying the public welfare, it feels as through that dark moment on Jan. 6 when American democracy was under physical attack was just the beginning.
But as Mandell told me last year, a few months after Trump took office, “I think building a stronger, more resilient democracy in Wisconsin is its own form of resistance.”
“When things feel most shocking and unstable at the federal level,” at the state and local level, Mandell said, “we can show our institutions still work and provide some reassurance.” 
We need that reassurance today more than ever.
“We are slow to realize that democracy is a life and involves continual struggle,” said Robert M. La Follette, the great governor and senator from Wisconsin and founder of the Progressive movement. I’m grateful for the Wisconsinites today who, like La Follette, are committed to that life and willing to continue the struggle.

(Photo: Getty Images)Despite the urging of county mayors, child advocates, clergy and educators, Gov. Bill Lee has declined to secure millions of dollars in federal funding to provide food to low-income kids by the government’s Jan. 1 deadline.
Lee has remained quiet about the apparent decision to forgo approximately $84 million from the federal government’s Summer EBT program, also known as SUN Bucks. In the past, the federal funding has helped feed 700,000 Tennessee kids during summer months when school is out. The governor’s office, for weeks, has not responded to reporters’ questions about whether he planned to participate in the federal Summer EBT.
On Monday, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that “Tennessee has not submitted their intent to participate in Summer EBT for 2026.” 
Gov. Bill Lee stays mum as a deadline looms to opt into a summer food program for kids

Lee rejected the funding last year, too, aligning with more than a dozen Republican governors who cited reasons ranging from opposition to “attempts to expand the welfare state” to administrative costs. In 2025 Tennessee spent $5 million to administer the federal program. 
In its place, the governor established a Summer Nutrition Initiative operating in 15 counties, providing 18,000 kids the same per-child funding as the federal program: $120 for each child. In total, the state spent $3 million on the program.
Hundreds of thousands of children in Tennessee’s other 80 counties, including the state’s urban centers in Shelby and Davidson, weren’t eligible.
It remains unknown whether Lee intends to reintroduce the state-funded Summer Nutrition Initiative again this year. Lee’s office did not respond to questions Monday.
Tennessee launches its summer food benefits this week. Most students in the state will miss out.

In the weeks leading up to the January 1 deadline set by the federal government for states opting into the Summer EBT program, Tennessee lawmakers, faith leaders and county mayors have publicly urged Lee to take advantage of federal dollars, noting high levels of food insecurity among children in Tennessee. 
The funding, made available in the form of debit cards to use while food shopping, impacts more than just hungry children, they noted. 
Before Lee rejected the funding, the Food Research & Action Center estimated the federal funding flowing into Tennessee had a $115 million positive economic impact on the state, a result of virtually all funding spent on buying food in Tennessee grocery stores, farmers markets and convenience stores.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)There is, of course, nothing new about the spectacle of everyday people being forced to endure great suffering because of the whims, foibles, fears and egos of powerful rulers and politicians. From the forced labor that helped construct the pyramids to the countless wars waged to boost a leader’s domestic political standing, millions of people throughout history have suffered greatly because of a powerful man’s – and it’s almost always been a man’s – desire for power.
We Americans sometimes like to think that our country has advanced beyond the kind of crude politics in which a leader issues edicts that sentence innocent people to pain and even death based on a personal desire for wealth, glory and power (or even just their mood on a particular day), but as President Donald Trump has made clear on numerous occasions, it has not.
And today, here in North Carolina, we are experiencing this phenomenon at the state level in the maddening actions and inactions of the state’s Republican legislative leadership – and in particular, one especially powerful leader, state Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger.
Berger, as you may or may not recall (and if you don’t it’s understandable, because it’s been a very long time), was elected to the Senate a quarter-century ago and has presided over the chamber for 15 years. Like a lot of other Republicans who entered politics around the turn of the century, Berger was elected during a time in which the North Carolina GOP was, rather ironically as it turns out, championing term limits for lawmakers and regularly decrying then-Senate President Pro Tem Marc Basnight’s long tenure in office. Basnight led the Senate through nine two-year sessions – a number that Berger clearly aspires to match or exceed. 
Basnight ultimately lost his Senate presidency when Democrats lost their Senate majority in the 2010 elections, but for Berger, the threat to his position comes not from the opposing party, but from within his own. 
Thanks to aggressive GOP gerrymandering, Republicans have almost no chance of losing their state Senate or House majorities anytime soon – even if Democrats win far more votes in legislative elections. But an interesting side effect of that gerrymandering is the way it has emboldened far-right candidates in GOP primaries to seek to outdo incumbents in demonstrating their slavish allegiance to Trumpism.
Hence, the current remarkable situation in Senate District 26, in which Berger, a hard right Republican who has adhered diligently to the Tea Party/MAGA line throughout his time in office, is nonetheless being challenged in the upcoming March primary by Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page. From all indications, it appears to be a credible challenge by a man who has long been a Trump backer and campaign chair and who has won national attention as a loud promoter of anti-immigration policies.   
And that brings us to the crazy and deeply harmful situation that this primary electoral battle in a mostly rural state Senate district – a race that could be decided by a few thousand (or hundred) votes — is inflicting on millions of average North Carolinians. 
Because Berger is clearly determined to cling to power, he has chosen not to allow the Senate to take any actions that might provide fuel to Page – even if he knows deep down from years of experience in Raleigh that doing so will harm the state’s residents. 
And so it is that as the New Year dawns, six full months into the 2026 state fiscal year, North Carolina is the only state in the nation not to have enacted a budget. The central issue: taxes and tax cuts. 
As fiscal analysts have repeatedly noted, now is not the time for North Carolina to plunge ahead with another round of income tax cuts benefiting the wealthy and profitable corporations. Overall public investments are already down effectively by more than a third since the GOP gained power 15 years ago, and the state is failing miserably to meet its basic obligations in numerous core areas of governmental service like schools, health care and fighting hunger. 
The new cuts that took effect January 1 will make this situation much worse. Even Republican leaders in the state House acknowledged the need to at least slow the tax cut rush in the budget proposals they crafted last summer.
Unfortunately, Berger has determined that such a pause would, if enacted, provide red meat for the Page challenge. 
The result: scheduled tax cuts are now in place and the funding shortages that are starving our schools, keeping thousands of children malnourished, and precipitating scores of preventable deaths among people who’ve lost their health care coverage will continue to metastasize.
Will things go on like this? One fantasizes that after the primary Berger might somehow relent and allow common sense policy to prevail.
If Basnight’s 18-year record remains the goal, however, that seems like a longshot. And as has been the case with Trump and so many other power-obsessed leaders throughout history, average North Carolinians will continue to pay the price for Berger’s ambition.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3951-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 06:12:16.094844

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)In the wake of the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, President Donald Trump quickly took up the cause of a 35-year-old veteran named Ashli Babbitt.
“Who killed Ashli Babbitt?” he asked in a one-sentence statement on July 1, 2021.
“An innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman,” Trump said during a Fox News interview a few weeks later.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

To Trump and his Make America Great Again movement, Babbitt was not an insurrectionist shot while trying to get close to the members of Congress who were certifying the election results, the sole rioter killed by police that day. She was a martyr, someone who died for her beliefs. She was a woman who had died for lack of protection.
Trump’s framing of Babbitt’s death in the months after he left office served as one of the guiding principles of his second term: the necessity of “protecting women” and an insistence on identifying and eradicating those he sees as posing a threat to them.
Who was Ashli Babbitt?
She was an Air Force veteran who had done tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. She was married and divorced and then married again. She faced criminal charges after an altercation with an ex-girlfriend of her second husband. She voted for Barack Obama. She bought a pool care business with her husband. She discovered the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon, which asserted that Trump was trying to save the country from a cabal of Satan-worshipping child molesters installed within the United States government.
Over time, Babbitt became increasingly steeped in QAnon and was primed to believe the robustly disproved conspiracy that the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. So when Trump encouraged his followers to go to Washington to support him on January 6, 2021, she did. While the election results were being officially certified by Congress, Trump addressed a crowd that included Babbitt. And when he encouraged them to go to the Capitol, many did — Babbitt among them.
Not everyone who went to the Capitol broke into the building, but she did. With a Trump flag draped over her shoulders like a superhero’s cape, Babbitt was part of the group who tried to gain access to the Speaker’s Lobby, just outside the House chamber. Another rioter smashed glass. As Babbitt tried to crawl through, a Capitol Police officer shot her from inside the lobby.
Video footage from the day shows Babbitt falling backward into the crowd as blood pours out of her mouth. After the shooting, many rioters began to flee the Capitol grounds. Babbitt was transported to Washington Hospital Center. She was declared dead upon arrival. 

The officer who killed Babbitt was cleared of wrongdoing; Lt. Michael Byrd potentially saved lives by stopping the mob, lawmakers and police said.
But her death gave Trump’s Make America Great Again movement something it needed: a martyr.
Religiosity moves in
A religious frame has been present in Trump’s politics since his rallies in the leadup to the 2016 election.
Jeffrey Sharlet, a veteran journalist and professor at Dartmouth College who was an early chronicler of the rise of Trumpism and its ties to religiosity, said these rallies were shaped by the prosperity gospel, a branch of Protestantism rooted in the supposition that, effectively, God wants you to be rich.
In 2020, the religious tenor was still there — but it had shifted to a more conspiratorial approach. Trump stopped merely “winking at QAnon” and began “invoking that level of conspiratorial thinking that has been absorbed into the DNA of the movement,” Sharlet said.
Before Babbitt’s death, Sharlet said, Trump had already been working to incorporate martyrs into his rhetoric, invoking a list of names, usually people who had been killed by immigrants in the country without legal status. They would typically fall into two categories, he said: “blonde white women and promising young Black men” — think Jamiel Shaw Jr., a rising football star in the midst of college applications who was shot and killed by a gang member who was in the country illegally, orSarah Root, who was killed by an undocumented drunk driver the day after her graduation from college.
Sharlet calls Babbitt “a perfect storm”: a White woman killed on camera in footage seen by millions, a Black man —  the Capitol police officer — responsible for her death.
“That changed everything,” Sharlet said. “The first real martyr who really takes hold of Trumpism is a woman, and it gives the movement a real religiosity.”
And it set the stage for Trump to ascend into a kind of religious figure himself after a would-be assassin shot him in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024.
“Every martyr disappears into the cult of personality,” Sharlet said. “She was a placeholder. She keeps the cross warm until Trump gets up there and he’s the martyr. Now, he’s the martyr for us all — but it started with a certain appeal to women.”
Martyrs can’t speak
Babbitt was an active participant in the insurrection — but that didn’t mean she couldn’t be reassigned the role of someone who needed protecting.
Sharlet recalled watching videos of Trump supporters talking about Babbitt in the wake of her death: “They’re aging her backward, they’re lowering her weight, they’re lowering her height, they’re turning her into a little girl.”
It was a blueprint for what was to come, he said of Babbitt: “The blondeness is important, the smallness is important, but so is the camouflage of being a veteran.”
Her race, too, was important, Sharlet said.
“It’s about the Whiteness of things. It’s not enough for them that a woman be murdered,” he said. “She has to be a little girl. She has to be White.”
Meghan Tschanz, a former missionary who has emerged as a critic of patriarchal systems in evangelical Christianity, drew a connection between Babbitt and Laken Riley, a college student whose murder by an immigrant who was in the country illegally was highlighted by Trump. Both women’s deaths became part of a larger narrative — one designed to accomplish a political goal, not mourn the victims.
Tschanz, who lives in Athens, Georgia — where Riley was killed — stressed that criticizing the politicization of Riley’s death is in no way a dismissal of the reality and severity of her killing. Rather, she said, politicization can dilute the pain of the loss in service to a larger narrative.
“Again and again, we see women die and the response isn’t, ‘Let’s make it so women don’t die.’ It’s, ‘Let’s make it so that I can use this to further my narrative that immigrants are evil,’” she said.
Riley’s father, Jason Riley — a Trump supporter — told NBC News about the pain of watching his daughter become a political tagline after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, at the time a strong Trump ally, heckled President Joe Biden during his State of the Union speech in 2024, urging him to say Riley’s name.
“I think it’s being used politically to get those votes. It makes me angry. I feel like, you know, they’re just using my daughter’s name for that. And she was much better than that, and she should be raised up for the person that she is,” Jason Riley said. “She was an angel.”
It’s a dynamic also echoed in Babbitt’s death. Though Babbitt’s mother, Michelle Witthoeft, emerged as a leading advocate for the release of those who were arrested for their actions on January 6, she also has publicly grappled with the way in which her daughter’s death became something other than an acute family tragedy.
Witthoeft told The Washington Post in 2021, “Half the country loves her and half the country hates her,” she said. “It’s weird to have your child belong to the world.”
For Trump, Riley’s and Babbitt’s  deaths helped reinforce the message that women’s lives are in danger and that they need to be saved — something he emphasized in his campaigns as he painted immigrants and his political opponents as threats.
“It all plays into the fears and vulnerabilities that women have to navigate, which is that women are more vulnerable to sexual and gender-based violence and women are tasked culturally with caring for the home and for their children,” said Hilary Matfess, an assistant professor at the University of Denver and the co-author of an analysis done by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University on gender and the January 6 insurrection. “So this message of scary immigrants are going to come in and destroy your communities with drugs and rape your women and children is intended to strike fear into a very specific demographic — namely, suburban White women.”
Matfess pointed to how the role of martyr cemented a view of Babbitt for Trump’s followers. She became someone who needed protecting, a figure whose memory is in need of constant, everlasting protection.
“Being put on a pedestal means you can’t move around too much,” Matfess said.
The ‘protection racket’
Matfess said there is a long-standing academic notion of the “protection racket,” in which a government offers protection from an imagined threat to deflect from the threat posed by the government itself. It’s something that can be used to keep women in subservient roles — and thus effectively in need of some form of protection from others.
“The Trump administration is not saying, ‘Wow, we should really expand access to prenatal health care’ or ‘We need more resources for women that are victims of domestic violence,’ because it is not about protecting women,” she said. “It’s about protecting certain men’s ability to wield power and influence under the banner of protection.”
Babbitt’s death in some ways challenged the narrative, too — she was part of the group trying to stop the certification of the election, not sitting by.
Matfess noted the ways that the Proud Boys — the far-right, all-men neo-fascist group that have become rigorous defenders of Trump and his agenda — insist on the fact that there are in fact no Proud Girls, often suggesting that the best way women can support the politics they espouse is by staying home and reproducing.
Matfess points to early rumors from within the far right that Babbitt was part of a false flag mission — evidence that the movement had to grapple with a woman who was attacking, not asking for protection.
“There’s a lot of utility to narratives that talk of attacks against women and children, and so it becomes that once they decided it wasn’t a false flag, that she was there of her own political beliefs, it becomes a compelling narrative of a woman sacrificing herself for this movement. Whether or not the movement would have been kind to her had she lived is besides the point,” Matfess said.
“The memorialization takes away the kind of difficult questions of how this movement would deal with women who are taking on more transgressive gender roles. Once someone’s a hero, you can leave it at that.”

Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, speaks on the Senate floor on March 19, 2025. He has asked for an attorney general's opinion on the scope of authority for the State Investment Board. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Two North Dakota lawmakers have asked Attorney General Drew Wrigley to formally weigh in on whether the State Investment Board has the authority to offer bonuses to staff responsible for managing the Legacy Fund. 
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, and Rep. Mitch Ostlie, R-Jamestown, requested the opinion as the board considers $1.3 million in proposed bonuses for 12 employees of the Retirement and Investment Office. 
“This is a fairly new program and a unique one,” Cleary said of the bonuses to state employees. “A formal opinion by the attorney general could just provide clarity for everyone, for myself, for the State Investment Board, for RIO.”
Wrigley said he couldn’t comment on the specifics of the request because his office is actively working on the legal opinion.
“I’m prioritizing the matter and I expect to be able to publish my attorney general opinion on that in the relative near term,” the attorney general said Monday. 
The incentive program was approved by legislators in 2023 and implemented in 2024 by the State Investment Board, which oversees the Retirement and Investment Office. This would be the first time bonuses would be awarded under the program.
The incentive pay is based on the performance of the state’s investment funds compared to earnings benchmarks that represent standard market performance. But the approval of the bonuses was tabled at the November meeting of the State Investment Board because of questions about whether the board has the legal authority to do so without a specific legislative appropriation. 
The Attorney General’s Office later verbally advised that the agency could safely proceed with the approval of the bonuses, Retirement and Investment Office Executive Director Jodi Smith said during a December meeting. 
The bonuses are expected to be on the agenda for the State Investment Board’s Jan. 16 meeting. Cleary said “it would be prudent” for the board to delay that decision until the extent of its authority to award the bonuses is clarified by the attorney general. 
“There was ambiguity in how the law was interpreted and discussed across multiple meetings. When public dollars are involved, the responsible step is to get clarity in writing so taxpayers have certainty, not confusion, about how their money is spent,” Cleary said.
North Dakota investment board delays action on $1.3 million in employee bonuses

Seven of the 12 proposed bonuses exceed $100,000 and the largest is $293,000, for the chief investment officer. The agency created the program to encourage investment managers and other staff to focus on bringing in more money for the state, as well as to improve staff recruitment and retention. 
The four largest funds managed by the State Investment Board are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance.
Those funds outperformed benchmarks by $191 million between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025. 
A spokesperson for the Retirement and Investment Office declined to comment at this time, noting any action on the issue must be approved by the full State Investment Board. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the board, declined to comment through a spokesperson, who said he anticipates the topic will be on the Jan. 16 agenda. The governor has previously expressed reservations about the proposed bonuses. 
The State Investment Board is composed of the governor, legislative leaders and other state officials.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A former House staffer — pardoned for a federal corruption conviction — is asking to delay a hearing before the state’s campaign finance watchdog to testify about a political action committee he formed secretly in 2020 to affect the election.
The move is drawing opposition from at least one key member of the Registry of Election Finance.
An attorney for Cade Cothren, ex-chief of staff for former House Speaker Glen Casada, requested that a January hearing before the Tennessee Registry of Election Finance be postponed to allow more time to prepare. The Registry board voted in November 2025 to drop a subpoena against Cothren and, instead, order him to explain the formation of the Faith Family Freedom Fund, a PAC that worked to defeat a Casada nemesis, Republican Rep. Rick Tillis of Lewisburg, in 2020.
Cothren’s attorney, Cynthia Sherwood, notified the Registry that because of the holidays and changing legal issues related to the subpoena, she needs extra time to work on the case. In a Dec. 30 email, she also asked for a one-week continuance from Jan. 2 to turn in sworn documents.
Registry staff attorney Seth May told Sherwood that neither he nor Executive Director Bill Young have the authority to delay items on the board’s agenda and that the request would be scheduled for consideration when the board meets Jan. 22, according to email documents obtained by the Lookout.
May added a note of caution, saying, “Just for purposes of your preparation, it is my instinct that the Registry will not grant a continuance.”
Tennessee campaign finance agency seeks probe of secret PAC

Registry member Tom Lawless, a Nashville attorney who will chair the meeting, said there is “absolutely no reason why this matter cannot proceed at this time.” 
“There has been sufficient time and energy put into this matter, and I cannot foresee how continuing it would necessarily benefit the public and provide the transparency that is so incumbent upon what we do in the Registry,” Lawless said.  
In addition, asked which statutes Cothren allegedly violated, May told Sherwood that state law requires a political campaign committee to accurately certify the name and address of its political treasurer.
“The Registry’s concern is that the treasurer listed on the committee’s filing was not correct, and that in fact Mr. Cothren was acting as treasurer for the committee,” May wrote.
An immediate decision by the board could muddy Cothren’s potential political rebound after he resigned from his post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal that also led to Casada’s departure in 2019.
Since receiving a pardon from President Donald Trump late last year, Cothren has made overtures toward a state House bid for the District 71 seat held by Republican Rep. Kip Capley that takes in Lawrence, Hardin, Maury and Wayne counties. If Cothren refuses to pay any civil penalty levied against him by the Registry board, he would be ineligible to run for state office.
The state House qualifying deadline is March 10, which likely falls before the Registry board’s next regularly-scheduled  meeting.
The Registry board subpoenaed Cothren in 2022 after a former girlfriend, Sydney Friedopfer, testified he asked her to form the political action committee, listing herself as treasurer, so he could run it secretly. She also said in telephone testimony that Cothren told her she didn’t need to worry about responding to questions from the Registry.
Cothren refused to comply with the board’s subpoena and never appeared before the Registry, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Registry board sent the matter to the Attorney General’s office, which took it to Chancery Court to be enforced. It remained there until Cothren’s federal corruption case wrapped up with a presidential pardon following a conviction on multiple charges involving a bogus campaign vendor.
The Registry board also asked the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office to investigate the matter, and that was put on hold until Cothren’s federal case wrapped up.
The Faith Family Freedom Fund spent money donated in the 2020 campaign by a North Carolina restaurateur, whom the Registry was unable to locate, to pay for campaign ads attacking Tillis, a political enemy of Casada’s. Rep. Todd Warner of Lewisburg, who enlisted Cothren for political work, defeated Tillis that year, and two months later the FBI raided the offices and homes of Warner, Casada, Cothren and former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson. Smith, whose sentence was changed to one year of probation house before was slated to check into federal prison on Monday, continues to seek a pardon after pleading guilty and cooperating with federal prosecutors in their case against Cothren and Casada.
The Registry board initially audited the Faith Family Freedom Fund PAC because of a complaint filed by Greg Hazelwood, the treasurer for Tillis, who claimed the political action committee illegally coordinated with Warner’s campaign. Auditors were stonewalled but finally found Friedopfer, who registered the PAC, in Utah.

Brad Little gives his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, on the House floor at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The Idaho Legislature and our governor have noted the influx of disenfranchised Californians moving into our state. They have heard the boom of the economic growth. And they have asked, as Dorothy did, “Is this Kansas?” And they have said “Yes Dorothy, we are in Kansas.”
The Idaho Legislature and our governor have cut taxes so much we now face a budget deficit while our population grows. I know Gov. Brad Little thought this was unwise, but he signed it. Our Republican Legislature voted for this whole hog. We will pay. Our population increases and our state funding declines.
Idaho’s projected budget deficit estimated at $40 million heading into 2026 legislative session

Kansas did this. In 2012, the Kansas Legislature and Gov. Sam Brownback passed huge income tax cuts. The supply side people cheered. Grover Norquist, the pseudo economist who argued he wanted government to be so small he could drown it in a bathtub, was in ecstasy. The Koch Brothers, Texas billionaires who pull Idaho state legislators’ strings, grinned. The Kansas model would prove all their points.
But it didn’t.
Cutting taxes does not make an economy boom. It didn’t for Kansas. They depleted their reserves and struggled to fund schools. Idaho has this on the horizon.
Especially when tax cuts just benefit the wealthy and corporations. Us pogues drive the consumer economy, and we have not gotten these Idaho gifts. We are hurting. But our schools and our roads and our lives will suffer.
So how did the Kansas Experiment work out? Not so great.
Kansas is almost as Republican as Idaho, but Gov. Brownback ended up leaving the state to serve as “Ambassador at Large for Religious Freedom.” A Democrat succeeded him in the governor’s mansion in Topeka.
Idaho would never do that. And we don’t have a governor’s mansion.
I doubt Brad has international ambassadorial dreams.
He loves Idaho. And he knew these tax cuts were stupid. He said so. But he signed them.
Idaho has seen growth. People love the Treasure Valley. Do they need schools and roads? Maybe they are over 60 and just want a small ranchette. At least they have escaped the liberals in California.
Is this the Idaho Brad Little said he wanted?
No.
He said he wanted this to be a state where the kids born here would find good jobs and want to raise their  families. I can’t think of a higher aspiration. Three of my four daughters are Idaho taxpayers. I love this state too. It’s why this Idaho Democrat voted for him.
I realize such an endorsement might not be welcome. That’s his problem.
But then he signed the ruby slippers tax cuts. And he’s holding back money to balance the budget. That’s his job. But he did sign the bills. We will dip into reserves, so the pain isn’t felt this year, but it’s coming. The budget will be balanced. And we will feel it.
Brad knows state finances better than anyone. And he can see the coming crash. But he signed the bills.
The problem is the Idaho Legislature, who we elect from these bizarre districts. Our legislators write these laws.
But then Brad signs them.
We, the voters, need to be seeing this issue. Please study Kansas. They did the experiment. Why do we need to redo it here?
Maybe the problem isn’t with Brad or those clowns in the Capitol. It’s with us. We don’t learn.
Maybe we don’t care about Kansas.
Maybe we’ll just have to learn this lesson here in our beloved state.
We deserve the representation we vote for. And they, no we have brought this upon us. When it comes, look in the mirror and think what you/we could have done different.
For the twister comes.

(Photo of Blue Ridge mountains by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)In June, North Carolina launched its long-awaited program to rebuild single-family homes damaged by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina.
For state officials, it represented the most expansive, highest-stakes slice of an unprecedented hurricane recovery effort. The single-family program, funded with more than $800 million in federal grant money, would take years to complete. And it would be forced to follow a troubled homebuilding operation in the eastern part of the state, wracked by accounting woes and bureaucratic slog.
Six months later, the state now has a grip on the scale of that program as it prepares to close applications: more than 5,000 eligible submissions. A separate program, launched in mid-December, will rebuild small rental projects. Later in 2026, large rentals and workforce housing projects will be eligible for rebuilds.
Eager to distinguish themselves from a long-struggling recovery effort in the east, the state hustled to launch this program — “faster than we’ve ever done it in this state and faster than any state, for any storm, in ten years,” Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley said in an interview.
“We’ve got a big chunk of folks who are ready to go,” Lilley said of applicants in the single-family housing program. “I think in 2026, we’ll see a pretty significant increase in our pace in putting people through construction and closeout.”
The state in mid-December extended applications for the program through the end of January. Meanwhile, officials keep closely watching the numbers on tourism — the lifeblood of many western communities. And they continue to push FEMA and the federal government for more aid, amid increased frustrations with months-long delays.



A six-month sprint to get homeowners signed up
Applications were slow in the opening weeks of the program, as households first learned about its requirements and details. By Aug. 11, roughly two months after launch, the state had 862 active applications. (Applications that were deemed ineligible or inactive are not included in that count.)
Two weeks later, that number had almost doubled as the state and its prime contractor, Horne LLP, began to expand their outreach in western North Carolina. That included door-to-door canvassing and tables at community events. Outreach staff made more than 24,000 phone calls in addition to paid messaging like billboards, radio and social media.
Advocates, wary of alternative recovery efforts that might not come through for survivors, have aimed to recruit more eligible households in the final weeks. 
“A thing I am concerned about is there may be people who right now are counting on a different kind of program,” said Emma Smiley of Legal Aid of North Carolina, which has helped households apply to the program. “It might be Samaritan’s Purse, it might be a local church, something like that.”
Those nonprofit and religious groups have played a key role in recovery, taking on smaller repair projects on faster timelines than the state is capable of doing with federal funding. But Renew NC’s case managers and leaders alike have encouraged eligible homeowners to apply for the state program regardless to get their foot in the door.
The governor himself echoed that sentiment in early December, pleading for last-minute applications as the deadline approached.
“It’s not an onerous application at all,” Stein said during a press conference on Dec. 3. “We want people living in safe, habitable homes. Especially as we come into winter.”
As of late December, the vast majority of active applications for the program are under intake review, the first of eight phases. That includes a review of “duplication of benefits,” in which applicants have to prove that insurance and FEMA are not paying for the same aid — often the most laborious part of the application process. 
The state is hoping to have most, if not all, of applicants through the intake review by the end of Q1 of 2026, Lilley said. 
In the coming months, Smiley said attorneys would be particularly watchful for issues that pop up with heirship — or proof of property ownership that’s been passed down. Some western homes are generations old, without written deeds or formally drawn property lines. 
“We haven’t seen any of those cases so far, but it’s also very early days,” Smiley said. “So I expect that we will see them.”

FEMA buyout applications still pending in Washington
State officials began submitting applications for a key FEMA property buyout program in early February 2025. Almost a year later, they’re still awaiting approval within the agency’s layers of bureaucracy.
The initiative, called the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or HMGP, is designed to offer relief for landowners of destroyed or flooded properties. Those properties can be bought out entirely, elevated or made less hazardous with federal dollars.
Homeowners can’t apply for the program directly. Rather, local governments submit batches of homeowners’ applications, reviewed by the state, to FEMA. As of mid-December, North Carolina had submitted 585 total applications in 22 batches. Those requests total $218 million.
Earlier this year, shortly after the one-year anniversary of Helene, FEMA sent the state a letter saying it was eligible to get around $1.5 billion in federal funds through the program. But getting those projects approved to use that money is another matter.
“[Applicants] are in some cases paying mortgages on damaged or destroyed homes,” said Matt Calabria, who leads the governor’s team for Helene recovery. “So these delays are very acutely felt by so many of these families, who are essentially waiting in limbo until we get word from FEMA.”
The delay of the HMGP applications is among the longest bureaucratic slowdowns at FEMA, but it’s far from the only one frustrating state officials. 
Earlier this month, the director of North Carolina’s emergency management department and groups representing local governments in western North Carolina wrote to express their frustration with proposed changes to how FEMA reviews and approves Public Assistance applications, NC Newsline previously reported.
As of mid-December, the state still has no indication of when those buyout applications — or the more costly Public Assistance requests — will be approved, or whether they will be approved in the first place.
State is wary of ‘sluggish’ tourism in 2026, even amid positive recovery signs
Tourism, the engine of western North Carolina’s economy, has steadily recovered over the past year and culminated in a “leaf peeping” fall season that left state officials feeling encouraged about the region’s long-term health. 
But the state’s tourism head is still wary of broader economic trends that he said are almost certain to impact revenue over the coming year. North Carolina is still seeing a steady stream of visitors, Visit NC director Wit Tuttell said, but they’re spending less — on dining, attractions and “just about everything but hotels.”
“That’s not a great thing for the industry, because we really want these people to come here and spend,” Tuttell said. “People have kind of got this recession mindset, it seems. Even though we’re not in a recession, people are behaving like we are in one.”
Still, there are reasons for optimism in the mountains, even if the state won’t have exact data on spending for months. 
In particular, tourism officials have been pleased with an uptick in activity in smaller tourism spots. In the aftermath of Helene, there were widespread concerns that more rural locales would be unable to bounce back like Asheville and Boone. That hasn’t been the case.
“We’re seeing places like Burnsville, Spruce Pine, some of those places that were hit hard and don’t have as many resources – they’ve really done an excellent job of getting back together quicker than we expected,” Tuttell said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WNC-view-of-the-Blue-Ridge-Mountains-from-Biltmore-Kingdollar-1024x524.jpg,,,2026-01-06 06:12:16.094844

Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss nearly gave up football, won a Division II national championship and has shone since being unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight.
Their paths will converge in the desert at Thursday’s Fiesta Bowl, with a spot in the national championship game on the line.
“Only four teams have the opportunity to go play this week,” Beck said. “I’m super grateful for that.”
Beck has been building toward this since starring as a high schooler in Jacksonville, Florida.
The 6-foot-4, 225-pound pro-style passer won a national championship in 2022 — the Bulldogs’ second straight — as a backup to Stetson Bennett IV, learning as he went. Beck took those lessons onto the field, throwing for more than 7,000 yards and 52 touchdowns in the next two seasons while leading Georgia to 24 wins.

A knee injury kept Beck out of the Bulldogs’ College Football Playoff loss against Notre Dame in early 2025 and, after initially declaring for the NFL draft, he opted to transfer to Miami, a school with a potent offense and plenty of NIL cash to throw around.
He’s been a perfect fit.
Poised and steady, Beck has thrown for 3,313 yards and 27 touchdowns on 74% passing with 10 interceptions. He led the Hurricanes (12-2, CFP No. 10 seed) to wins over Texas A&M and Ohio State in the playoffs and is 36-5 as a starter as he winds down his college career.
“He’s very experienced, he’s been successful everywhere he’s been,” Ole Miss coach Pete Golding said. “He’s always had his teams competing at a championship level and being in the playoffs.”
Chambliss’ career took a different trajectory.
With no Division I offers out of high school, the quarterback from Grand Rapids, Michigan, opted to play at Ferris State, where he redshirted the first two seasons — the second due to respiratory issues. He considered transferring to a Division III school to give college basketball a try, but chose to give football one more shot.
Good decision.
Chambliss led the Bulldogs to the Division II national championship in 2024, leading to offers from numerous Division I programs. He chose to play at Ole Miss, figuring he would be a backup but at least have the DI experience.
Chambliss’ fate changed when starter Austin Simmons went down with an ankle injury during the second game of the season. Chambliss took off and kept going, throwing for 353 yards against Arkansas in his first start and playing so well he kept the starting job once Simmons was healthy.
The dual-threat quarterback put pressure on defenses all season, rocketing passes into tight windows with his strong arm while extending plays with his legs.
Chambliss has thrown for 3,660 yards and 21 touchdowns with just three interceptions on 66% passing, adding 520 yards and eight more scores rushing. He led the Rebels (13-1, CFP No. 6 seed) to a win over Tulane in the CFP opening round and picked apart Georgia in the quarterfinals with 362 yards and two touchdowns in a 39-34 win.
“He’s a limitless football player,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “Certainly, you could see on the sideline and watching some of the stuff on TV, his leadership skills and the way people gravitate to him. He’s had a tremendous impact on the program and plenty of respect for him.”

Melissa Gilpin remembers the first time she collected evidence for a rape kit — but not the woman who had been assaulted.  
That was the “worst thing” about her introduction in 2001 to a specialized field of forensic and compassionate care that she’s since dedicated her life to.  
“I don’t remember anything about the woman I was taking care of,” recalled Gilpin, now a sexual assault nurse examiner of more than 20 years who works at Med Center Health in Bowling Green. “I remember paying attention to the instructions on the kit, making sure the police officer got it.” 
She knew after that experience that she needed more education and resources so the next time a sexual assault survivor came to her emergency room, she was better prepared. She had to learn how to balance the human connection and the forensic exam. In 2004, she was finally able to take the class she needed to become a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE). 
Two decades later, Kentucky still needs to improve access to — and incentives for nurses to pursue — SANE education, a report released in December by the Legislative Research Commission shows. 
The report is the culmination of research sought by Rep. Rebecca Raymer, R-Morgantown, who in 2025 sponsored a resolution directing the LRC to study access to sexual assault nurse examiners across the state. Raymer wasn’t surprised by the report, which she said provides the General Assembly with a good foundation for addressing gaps outlined in it. 
“One of the reasons why we wanted to do the report is we knew there were gaps in coverage. I suspected that … urban versus rural was going to be a big part of it,” she said. “To do good legislation, you really need good data. So, I felt like before we just started passing bills, we really needed to see what that data looked like.”

The report shows an increase in recent years of nurses getting credentialed in sexual assault examination, but an urban-rural divide persists and 100 of Kentucky’s 120 counties do not have a SANE-ready hospital. Hospitals must have a sexual assault nurse examiner on call 24/7 to qualify for SANE-ready certification. 
Of those 100 counties without SANE-ready hospitals, 44 don’t border a county with a SANE-ready hospital, according to the report. This was among the most “concerning” findings to Raymer, she said. During the 2026 legislative session, she plans to introduce a bill that would create a statewide SANE coordinator, a recommendation that came out of the report.
This person would be housed in the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and would help more hospitals get SANE-ready, Raymer said. She also plans to add an appropriation request to make sure the position has adequate state funding.
“We’re still having those conversations of what that price tag would be,” she said, but: “I do plan on putting that in the bill.”
The number of SANE credentials increased from 296 in 2019 to 556 in 2025, according to the report, though Gilpin said that may not accurately represent access to this specialized care. 
“I know of at least a dozen who have those same credentials, and they’ve never taken care of a patient for various reasons,” she said. “So having those credentials doesn’t necessarily mean they’re working as a SANE anywhere.” 
Raymer’s proposed statewide coordinator would also keep a more accurate database of who both has a SANE credential and who is using that credential, she said.

Kentucky Board of Nursing Executive Director Kelly Jenkins said the report wasn’t surprising to her and the recommendations were “very thoughtful and very much in line with the work that’s already been underway.” 
For example, the report recommends hospitals should train all staff to work with sexual assault survivors. A law passed in 2025 already directed facilities to conduct such training. 
Sexual assault nurse examiners are “a very unique, dedicated, compassionate group of people,” said Jenkins. 
“I just have the utmost respect for SANE nurses,” she said. “They’re seeing somebody in their worst moment. It takes a lot to deal with that trauma, especially those that (handle) multiple facilities, so they’re being called out a lot. It’s a lot going through that trauma. They definitely have a lot of respect, for sure, from me. It’s … the gold standard of care for survivors.” 
Kentucky emergency departments are required by law to be able to examine, collect and report evidence of sexual assault and treat victims. Without a sexual assault nurse examiner with advanced forensic training on hand, though, the nurse using a rape kit may experience what Gilpin did in 2001 before she was certified as a SANE: A heavier focus on reading rape kit instructions than on caring for the patient in the room. 
Findings and recommendations 
According to the report: 

Access to training and the costs and time commitments associated with training are major obstacles to becoming a sexual assault nurse examiner. Burnout and lack of incentives for becoming a SANE are additional barriers to nurses qualifying for and maintaining their credentials.
Kentucky has  45 hospitals that employ at least one SANE full time, and 25 hospitals contract with at least one SANE for on-call services.
As of July 2025, there were 512 nurses with a SANE credential in Kentucky. Of those, 491 had a sexual assault nurse examiner adult or adolescent credential and 66 had a sexual assault nurse examiner pediatric or adolescent credential. There were 45 nurses with both credentials. These nurses were mostly concentrated in urban counties.
The number of SANE credentials increased from 296 in 2019 to 556 in 2025.
Six counties have 10 or more SANEs living in them. 
There are 81 counties with three or fewer SANEs living in them. Of those 81 counties, 30 counties have no SANEs living in them. 
As of October 2025, there were 25 SANE-ready hospitals in Kentucky. That number has increased steadily since 2017. 
As of October 2025, most SANE-ready hospitals were located in Louisville, Central Kentucky and Northern Kentucky. There are no SANE-ready hospitals west of Owensboro. 
There are 100 counties without a SANE-ready hospital, and of those, 44 counties don’t border counties with a SANE-ready hospital. 
From 2019 to 2024, there were 4,468 sexual assault forensic examinations that were logged in the Kentucky State Police kit tracking portal.

The report’s recommendations include: 

Hospitals should consider developing monetary incentives and specialized job codes to incentivize more nurses to become SANEs.
The Kentucky Board of Nursing should consider working with SANE training programs to make them more accessible to potential candidates.
The General Assembly may wish to consider requiring that hospitals have a sexual assault nurse examiner on call 24 hours each day.
All applicable medical providers should receive training that includes information on the treatment of survivors of sexual assault. 
Kentucky hospitals should consider developing potential monetary incentives and job codes for SANEs. 
The Cabinet for Health and Family Services and the Sexual Assault Response Team Advisory Committee should consider developing a statewide SANE coordinator position, which would coordinate the efforts of different state agencies and hospitals in order to increase access to sexual assault nurse examiners, promote standards in training and practice, provide technical assistance to build and maintain SANE programs, and to collaborate with community partners and appropriate state agencies.

SANE-Ready-Hospital-Map
Overall, the Board of Nursing, the Kentucky Hospital Association and Gilpin support the recommendations outlined in the report. 
The suggestion that hospitals provide a 24/7 SANE nurse, however, could be a challenge for some. 
“Although we think that is a great goal, and we’ve been trying to help work toward it for a long time, just (with) the reality of the financial situation of many of our very small hospitals, particularly our rural hospitals — I just would hate to have that probably-unfunded mandate in place,” said Deborah Campbell, the vice president for clinical strategy and transformation at the Kentucky Hospital Association. 
That recommendation, said Campbell, is “really the only one that gives me any heartburn.” 
Deborah Campbell is theVice President, Clinical Strategy and Transformation with Kentucky’s Hospital Association.
Creating job codes specific for SANEs could help ensure certified SANEs can work in that role.  
“Many of the SANEs now are working in labor and delivery, or the ED. They have their regular job, and the only difference in pay is if they sign up as ‘on call’ (for SANE work) outside of their hours, and then if they get called in,” Campbell explained. “Is that enough incentive for someone to do the training and keep up the continuing education that needs to happen?” 
Additionally, access to SANE education — and help paying for it — varies by location. 
“I think it is fair to say that if you are working in rural Eastern Kentucky and you want to go to a training, it’s not going to come to you,” Campbell said. “And it’s several days of training for just the didactic part of it. Either their hospital has to pay for them to go and have a hotel and food and travel expenses, or they have to have that burden themselves.” 
“If they have children, they have to have sitters or arrange for their family,” Campbell said. 
“It’s a bit burdensome, depending where you live,” she added. “That’s something that we really want to work on.” 
Having a statewide coordinator to connect survivors to resources, and SANEs with various facilities, as recommended in the report, would be a huge help, Gilpin and others said. 
“I would not be opposed to having such a position at the (Board of Nursing),” said Jenkins. Funding would have to align to make it happen, she said, but “it would just help align resources and try to cover some of those regional gaps that we’ve got.”  
“We know we need more training in the far east and far west,” she said. 
Hybrid training opportunities have and will continue to help bridge that gap as well, she said. 
“SANES are a vital role in providing care to citizens in the state,” Raymer said. “We would hope that nobody ever needs that type of care, but if we find our citizens needing that, I think that it’s an expectation that we make sure that that care is available to our citizens.”
Being a SANE in Kentucky: Part of the healing 
Gilpin, who is the clinical educator for the emergency department at Med Center Health, started her career as a sexual assault nurse with a clear goal: “I wanted bad guys to go to jail. I wanted to get good evidence so it could go to trial and put a bad guy in jail so they couldn’t hurt another person.” 
She’s learned over the last 20 years that real life justice is slow, if it happens at all. 
Now, she’s more focused on how her presence makes her survivor patients feel. 
A sexual assault exam is a success when “the person that I’m taking care of — that’s right there in front of me — is glad that they came, feels that coming to the hospital, having the exam was a positive, and they’re leaving knowing that they were cared for, knowing that they have a connection to what they need going forward to begin that healing process,” Gilpin said.

Still, the stress of seeing so many people — including young children who can’t yet talk about being assaulted — can wear with time. Gilpin has her own mental health “touchstones” that she uses to support her mental health. 
“I like to just be outside, walking in quiet, or spending time with family,” she said. “But I always encourage nurses who are getting into this field to have a recharge, to know when they need a break, to know when they need to talk to somebody else. And I think everybody deals with trauma and stress a little bit differently.” 
It also helps to stay connected to other nurses in similar roles, she said, who will understand the unique stressors of the job. 
“But I certainly encourage every nurse that takes this class: This is very difficult, and it compounds over the years, right?” Gilpin said. “All of the things that we hear and see; the worst part of what humans do to other humans. So I think that having other nurses who are in similar roles that you can talk these things through is very helpful, and then having a plan for your own mental health is super helpful, whether it is in exercise or in activities that just recharge you. I think that that is critical to not allowing this to sort of overtake everything that you do.” 
The hard truth, Gilpin said, is that rape and sexual assault are much more common than some may realize. 
According to the Kentucky Association of Sexual Assault Programs, around 39% of women in Kentucky will experience sexual violence at some point in their lives. Around 23% will experience a rape. And, about 18% of men will experience sexual violence in their lifetime, according to KASAP’s data, which only represents what is reported. 
“What I’ve learned over the years of doing this is this is so much more prevalent than we realize,” Gilpin said. “I learned early on in my career that a lot of the survivors that I served would disclose to me that this was not the first time that they had been assaulted. It may be the first time they sought help, or even felt comfortable telling anyone, but this wasn’t the first time they’d experienced rape.” 
Over time, Gilpin said, sexual assault nurses learn the skills needed to correctly gather evidence, which frees them up to show personalized compassion and humanity to their patients. 
“Collecting evidence is one aspect, and we need to do that and we need to do that well, but more importantly, we need to take care of that human being and ensure that we are helping that human on their path to healing, rather than re-traumatizing,” she said. “And that’s always the goal, that we’re not part of the problem, that we’re part of the solution and part of that healing process.”

Kennedy Profile in Courage Award that he received in 2024 for increasing voting days in Kentucky and protecting election integrity. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — Thinking beyond this new year to 2027, Kentucky Republican Michael Adams is weighing a complicated question — could he be the type of candidate who gets Kentuckians to focus on the state’s challenges instead of the national politics of the day. 
Adams, who was the top vote-getter in 2023 statewide elections and carried all but two of the state’s 120 counties, is about halfway through his second term as secretary of state, Kentucky’s top elections official. The 49-year-old from McCracken County earned praises from Republicans and Democrats alike on his election policies, but he told the Kentucky Lantern in a recent interview that he cares deeply about other issues too, like the state’s housing shortage and bettering education. 
At the national level, “there’s only one brand” for the GOP, Adams said, but a Kentucky governor’s race is different. 
‘Profile in Courage:’ Kentuckian Michael Adams honored for protecting election integrity

“I feel like at the state level, there’s a little more room for a Republican official or candidate to have an identity of his own, to have a brand,” he said. “There’s a little more room to be a nice guy, and to be modest in your style, and to be substantive.”
Adams said Kentucky Republicans should not “nominate somebody for a governor who is going to be seen as angry or partisan or difficult or unpleasant, nasty.” 
Controversies beset the last two Republican governors, he said, tarnishing their images, and both were defeated by Democrats named Beshear.
Kentuckians, Adams said, “want a nice guy to be the governor, to solve problems, to stay focused on state issues, to be the kind of person you can be proud of when there’s a disaster.” 
“I think people, including Republicans, want a reasonable, decent person who will go do the job, and I feel like there’s an appetite for that, and we see that in who wins these races,” Adams told the Lantern. “But it also comes down to: Would I have the funding available to get that message out right and remind people of what they like about me, and can I get voters to care about the stuff that I care about? I care about civics. I care about housing. I care about education. If we’re voting on stuff that’s not really about our state government, then I shouldn’t win.” 
How will Kentuckians view Trump next year?
Some Kentucky political observers think Adams could have a chance if he decided to run for governor. Trey Grayson, a former Republican secretary of state, said that he jokes “that we secretaries of state are good enough to become credible candidates in our primary, but never good enough to win it.” After leaving office, he was his party’s nominee for U.S. Senate, as was former Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, and they did not win. Bob Babbage, another Democratic secretary of state, lost a primary bid for governor in 1995. 
Yet, nationwide, secretaries of state have moved on to higher office. Grayson pointed to Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who was previously a secretary of state. 
Adams has had “a pretty high profile, probably the highest profile any of us have ever had in performing our job,” Grayson said. In Adams’ first term, he had to navigate access to elections amid the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, which was also a presidential election year. 
Also while he’s not the “most MAGA” Republican, Grayson noted that Adams has previously endorsed President Donald Trump and supported policies Trump cares about, like enacting photo ID laws for voting. 
“I think he’s got some credibility, having won a couple times,” Grayson said. “But the question becomes: can he convince people that he’s the kind of Republican that they want? And he won’t know until he tries.” 
Danny Briscoe, a Democratic political consultant, told the Lantern that Adams has earned respect across the aisle because he “hasn’t let politics interfere” with his job. 
Briscoe added that nationwide, politics are changing, pointing to the election of Zohran Mamdani as the next mayor of New York City with more than 50% of the vote. That “wouldn’t have fit the bill of any previous mayoral election that I can remember,” Briscoe said. 
Briscoe said U.S. Rep. James Comer would be “the Trump disciple” of a hypothetical 2027 GOP primary. The congressman has previously said he is interested in the 2027 race. 
However, if Trump’s popularity in Kentucky changes by then, that could be a disadvantage for Trump-aligned candidates, Briscoe said. The president has won elections in the Bluegrass state for nearly a decade, though he will not be on the ballot in 2027 and Republicans are hoping to maintain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. 
“Whether (Adams) can get elected or not depends on the mood of this state, and I think it’s a little too early to judge that, because a lot of it depends on Trump’s positives and negatives,” Briscoe said. “If he’s still popular, Comer would be the one to beat. If he’s unpopular, maybe Adams could do it.”
Legislative session
Heading into what will be the final budget legislative session of his last term as secretary of state, Adams said he would focus on things that can be improved, such as increasing state funding to county clerks, strengthening laws around personating election officials and ensuring funding for the Safe At Home program which protects victims of domestic violence.
Kentucky county clerks have hoped to attract more poll workers in recent election cycles. A big issue that often comes up is increasing the pay for poll workers, Adams said. A state formula that determines how much money county clerks get for elections “was set in the ’80s, and it’s never been adjusted for inflation,” he added. 
“I’m conservative. I don’t like to spend money, but it costs money to pay poll workers, and it’s hard to get people in the labor force today,” Adams said. “And when I was a poll worker 30 years ago in McCracken County, they’d pay me 100 bucks, and they pay the same 100 bucks today, 30 years later.”
Adams previously asked lawmakers to make it illegal in Kentucky to impersonate an election official and expressed concern about a political consultant using robocalls to mimic President Joe Biden during the 2024 primary. The calls encouraged Democratic voters in New Hampshire to not cast ballots in the primary. The consultant later received a $6 million fine from the Federal Communications Commission and faced criminal charges in New Hampshire because of a state law that makes it a crime to impersonate a candidate. 
Adams said that while he doesn’t know if voters fell for the scam, “it showed us what people are capable of doing.” 
A 2023 law established the Safe at Home program, which allows victims of domestic violence to hide their addresses when registering to vote without a protective order from a judge. It also allows the state Capitol to be the address on public records and lets those moving from out of state easily join the program.
Participation in the program has grown to more than 1,000 people, Adams said, but a small amount of money goes toward funding it each year. The dollars come out of a joint fund from fines for breaking laws and are split multiple ways. 
Adams would “like to have a stable fund for that,” and doesn’t think an extra appropriation would be needed, but his office needs authorization from lawmakers to touch restricted budget funds to reallocate dollars to the program. 
One issue he hadn’t yet decided on pursuing this session was pushing again for improving civics education in Kentucky. His office previously released a civic health assessment of the state, giving Kentucky a C grade as residents are generally more knowledgeable about civics than the average American, but there’s still room to improve. 
Adams made national headlines in November after sharing on social media that his office was getting calls asking why polls were closed in Kentucky. The state had no statewide elections in 2025. 
“We’re getting calls about polls being closed. They are closed because we do not have elections today. Kentucky votes next year,” Adams wrote on X. “You cannot vote today in Kentucky for the mayor of New York City or the Governor of Virginia. Sorry.” 
Adams told the Lantern that those calls “proved my point that it’s getting bad out there.” It also showed that more and more people aren’t getting local news from local journalists, he added. They instead are reading about elections and national news from elsewhere in the country. 
Adams previously called on lawmakers to implement civics education requirements for public school students, which led to instituting a graduation requirement for students to pass either a citizenship test or civics course. Adams said the law ended up being a “really watered down bill that just didn’t make a difference.”
Adams said he’s talked about the issue with lawmakers since then, but keeps hearing that it’s not a high priority for parents who contact lawmakers about issues. 
“Of all the things people are talking to legislators about, it’s just not on the list. It’s just not a thing that people are talking about right now,” Adams said. “There’s so many other things that compete, so we’ve not decided if we’re going to make a push for it or not. If so we’ll probably decide in the middle of the session.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5483-e1767656350741-1024x971.jpg,,,2026-01-06 05:56:45.501462

(Getty Images)Mark Batterson’s new book is a provocative read. Titled “Gradually Then Suddenly,” the author details how the biggest dreams sometimes seem as if they will take forever and then … POOF! … it happens seemingly overnight.  
One of my favorite examples from the book is Olympic gold medal winner Rowdy Gaines. Batterson reminds us that the United States boycotted the 1980 games in Moscow, which means Gaines trained for eight years in preparation for the 100-meter freestyle, a race that lasted less than a minute. Add up all the practice laps for those eight years, and you’ll see that he swam some 20,000 miles for a race that lasted 49 seconds. 
Gaines won that gold medal for the U.S. gradually before winning it suddenly.
When it comes to policy, wins for kids have been coming far too gradually. There have been too many “wait until next year” and far too few lightning strike wins. As the opening gavel falls on the 2026 General Assembly, our lawmakers must turn the “gradual pace” into 2026 “sudden action.” Kentucky’s kids need that pace — perhaps more now than ever. 
Our boys and girls need leaders in Frankfort who don’t just say they care, but who act with a sudden urgency on that commitment.
As laid out in the Blueprint for Kentucky’s Children 2026 priority agenda, Kentucky’s kids need budget investments to support kinship families and hard-hitting policies that reduce sexual abuse and exploitation. Our young people need budget investments to strengthen their legal representation and policies to promote housing and food stability. Young kids with disabilities need more responsive early childhood settings and our teenagers need real supports on issues from vaping to mental health.  
Kentucky needs to lift the well-being of our children in every corner of the commonwealth. Our kids need to win suddenly. While the latest KIDS COUNT Data Dashboard shows improvements in several indicators of child well-being, 1  in 5 young Kentuckians live in poverty and face food insecurity, among other immense challenges often exacerbated by where the child grows up.
For me the seminal question around the 2026 state legislative session is learning exactly where kids stack up in our legislators’ priorities. Are our kids going to get substantial, common sense and focused policy wins in 2026 or merely political rhetoric?
Batterson quotes the heroic Christian missionary Hudson Taylor about turning gradually into suddenly. Taylor asserts there are three stages of any great work: “First, it’s impossible, then it is difficult, and then it is done.” I, for one, am tired of hearing that this policy is impossible and that policy is difficult. 
Kentucky needs good policy for kids done, and done suddenly.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1408386651-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 05:56:45.501462

(Photo courtesy of Virginia DBE Transportation)States including Virginia are responding to changes by the U.S. Department of Transportation that removed the presumption that women- or minority-owned businesses are socially and economically disadvantaged. 
Now, every business owner in the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program must recertify and show evidence that they have faced actual disadvantage — regardless of race or gender. The change has prompted concerns from minority business owners and groups in Virginia, and calls for VDOT to better support entrepreneurs who have historically faced barriers. 
Future of federal support for Va. minority-, women-owned businesses in transportation in question

While the Virginia Department of Transportation has paused measuring progress toward Disadvantaged Business Enterprise goals, the agency said Monday it is actively supporting business owners by providing guidance to the transportation community and holding information sessions to help businesses understand and comply with the new federal requirements.
All DBE and Airport Concessions DBE firms, current and new, must submit a personal narrative and personal net worth statement to demonstrate they are socially and economically disadvantaged based on individual circumstances under the new federal rule.
Further, VDOT said it has stopped tracking progress toward DBE goals and has paused certain reviews until the Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity completes checks of all currently approved DBEs and makes the required updates to the certification process.
Joanne Payne, federal lobbyist and president of Women First, said VDOT is working hard under new rules, facing tight deadlines, and appears highly concerned about its responsibilities.
“I know that they have been very concerned and working as best they could possibly do under the rules and their authority to do what was best for the DBEs,” said Payne.
She said that after the federal agency changed the Unified Certification program — which allows small, disadvantaged businesses to get certified once and be recognized by multiple transportation agencies — liability concerns have also grown. These worries could trigger lawsuits, potentially caused by “subjective” evaluations, Payne said.
Virginia’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Transportation Association, which supports minority and disadvantaged businesses, was more critical of the state’s efforts. The association said VDOT is merely repeating guidance from the federal transportation secretary and not addressing the need for new opportunities for diverse business owners.
The association said this could be an area for incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger to address. Spanberger’s administration recently signaled support for diverse groups by appointing Sesha Joi Moon as the state’s diversity, equity, and inclusion officer.
“Our members need opportunities now. Some businesses are teetering and can’t wait six months or a year for a workable solution,” the association told the Mercury.
In November and December, the agency hosted an informational session on the new Interim Final Rule to update firms on key provisions and the reevaluation process. It also held an event on preparing personal narratives and required documents under the new DBE eligibility standards. The agency said it worked in collaboration with the Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity (DSBSD) and the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority (MWAA), to assist firms in understanding and preparing personal narratives.  
“As the certifying entities for Virginia, the agencies also have dissemination notification to firms of the recent changes affecting the DBE and Airport Concessions DBE (ACDBE) programs,” VDOT said in a statement.   
VDOT said it will provide updates on the program as additional information becomes available. If business owners or advocates have questions or concerns, VDOT’s Office of Civil Rights Division can be contacted at CRLMS@vdot.virginia.gov.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)One year after backup power systems at the city of Richmond’s water treatment plant failed to switch on following a winter storm and left residents without water for days, city officials showcased plant repairs and new protocols on Monday, and highlighted ongoing efforts to keep the region’s largest municipal water system flowing smoothly. 
Addressing reporters at the plant, Mayor Danny Avula said last year’s water crisis — which unfolded just a few days into his term — sparked his administration’s wholesale attempt to dismantle a culture of complacency and manage deferred maintenance. 
Roughly $7 million has been spent on immediate fixes to water pumps, the switch gear, and other repairs to make the plant less vulnerable to problems, Avula said. About $1.4 billion will need to be invested into water system upgrades over the next ten years, according to the city’s long-term plan. 
In an Oct. 8 letter, Avula requested $80 million over two years in the state budget. The money would have been used to help strengthen the water plant’s infrastructure, which serves over 500,000 people across Richmond, Henrico, Hanover, and Chesterfield counties. However, Gov. Glenn Youngkin did not include the funding in his final budget proposal that he presented to lawmakers last month.
“But the reality is we are an old city, we are the capital city,” Avula said. “There are more needs and so our job is to continue helping our state representatives understand that, and showing them that we’re going to be good stewards of that money when they give it to us.” 
If the state does not provide the funding, that cost will be passed on to rate payers to ensure the improvements are made. The city has not stated how much residents’ water bills would increase if the state does not come through with the funding. Still, there are a number of projects that are critical to the longevity of the plant that will be prioritized with or without state funding, officials said.
“When we start talking about not getting the funding and getting funding, it’s going to be a very difficult conversation about prioritization of which projects come to fruition sooner versus later,” said Richmond Department of Utilities Director Scott Morris. “It’s basically picking which part of your broken car you want to replace first.”
As part of the improvements following the crisis, Richmond has been working with the surrounding municipalities that rely on the water system to improve communication. There has also been a change in management and additional engineers added to the staff to help prevent last year’s mistakes being repeated.
Avula said the city’s conversations with Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s administration about the funding are ongoing.

Think of the Washington Monument. Imagine it sitting on the surface of the sea, with blades as long as a football field slowly spinning. It’s futuristic and white with rounded edges, like a rocketship. But there are no blasts or flares. There is no noise at all but calling gulls.


 
This story was originally published by Canary Media.

	Sitting on the stern of a shrimp boat in early November, this is what I saw. The captain steered us directly under one of two ​“pilot” turbines. In the distance, I saw foundations for 176 more, poking a few dozen feet out of the sea. The Hoover Dam came to mind, another landmark feat of energy engineering. Each new turbine will be roughly the same height as the famous dam, from blade tip to the surf below.


“Why do people think they are an eyesore? Doesn’t bother me none,” said the captain, Bob Crisher, a commercial fisherman. He’s in favor of the wind farm and believes it will bring down his electricity bills.


Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, America’s largest planned offshore wind farm, was then being built about 27 miles east of Virginia Beach. It’s slated to power up to 660,000 homes in a region with the highest concentration of data centers in the world. With energy demand skyrocketing and electricity costs rising, Virginia needs the last construction push on this project to go smoothly. The developer, utility Dominion Energy, promised the turbines would start feeding the grid by March 2026.


How quickly things fell apart.
Maine AG praises ruling declaring Trump’s offshore wind halt unlawful



Last month, the Trump administration ordered a pause on all five in-progress offshore wind projects in America — including Virginia’s — citing unspecified risks to ​“national security.” It was the largest blow yet to a once-growing industry that Trump has brought to its knees in just 11 months. While Trump spent much of 2025 slowing the incredible rise of renewables, his unrelenting war on so-called ​“windmills” has been more vicious and personal.


In many ways, Trump’s attacks on offshore wind this past year encapsulate this new era of politics. He throttles long-held norms in favor of retribution and personal grievance, acting with dizzying speed. He contorts facts and pushes officials in his administration to do the same.


Left in the wake are everyday citizens — including dozens I’ve interviewed over the past year — who are losing the prospect of good-paying jobs. They and their neighbors are also losing access to public goods like lower emissions, revitalized ports, reliable electricity, and a buffer against skyrocketing power bills driven by an AI boom.


Trump’s grudge against offshore wind began more than a decade ago, when he tried — and failed — to stop 11 turbines from being built within view of one of his Scottish golf courses. He has been disparaging offshore wind turbines as ​“ugly” and ​“eyesores” ever since.


He cranked up the intensity when he embarked on his second presidential campaign in 2023, branding big ocean turbines as dangerous. “[W]indmills are causing whales to die in numbers never seen before,” he said that year — a false statement. Still, attacking offshore wind seemed little more than an odd punchline for his campaign rallies. After all, the Trump administration backed the sector for much of his first presidential term, executing multiple offshore wind auctions that had been queued up by the Obama administration.


But Trump’s hyperactive second term has turned fringe movements and personal grudges into full-blown policies. Like his attacks on vaccines and higher education, his blitz on offshore wind farms is having far-reaching implications that will take years to fully enumerate.


Here’s some initial accounting: In-development wind projects have been paused, delayed, and paused again. One fell apart. Two are essentially mothballed after Trump sunsetted wind tax credits. Port revitalizations got cancelled. Developers lost billions. Related manufacturing is drying up. Tens of thousands of once-promised jobs may never be created. Workers already on the job are sitting idle.


One Trump-voting fisherman called the president’s anti-wind campaign ​“madness.”


But while vaccines and universities will endure through Trump’s political attacks, in one form or another, the U.S. offshore wind industry may not. Despite the ubiquity of offshore turbines in northern Europe and China, there is only one large-scale wind farm fully operational in American waters today. When Trump moved back into the White House, the industry was just taking off.


J. Timmons Roberts, a Brown University professor of environmental studies who tracks opposition to offshore wind, put it simply: ​“They’re killing the baby while it’s still in the cradle.”
 Dismantling offshore wind


When Trump’s first term ended, there were no federally approved plans for offshore wind farms. When President Joe Biden left office, there were nearly a dozen — and at least 40 more were in various stages of planning and early development in waters along the East Coast from Maine down to the Carolinas, across the Gulf of Mexico, and along the California coast.


But, on the first day of his second term, Trump signed an executive order that froze offshore wind permitting, blocking proposed projects that didn’t already have federal approval. And he ordered a new review of the projects that did have federal permits but were not yet fully completed, throwing their future into doubt. (The executive order was ultimately struck down by a federal court on December 9.)


Unease amongst state leaders, developers, and investors immediately took root.


Within days, the first permitted project began to fall apart due to ​“uncertainty” over federal actions. In late January, Shell — one of two developers of the Atlantic Shores wind farm slated to be built east of New Jersey — announced it was withdrawing from the project. New Jersey then abandoned plans to purchase power from the installation. The final blow came weeks later when Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency revoked a Clean Air Act permit for the project. One former EPA official called the move ​“unusual.”


Research cuts and funding clawbacks soon followed.


In May, Lincoln Varnum was called into his supervisor’s office at the University of Maine, where he worked as an instrumentation engineer. Varnum was one of nine employees laid off from the university’s high-profile engineering and offshore-wind research center due to the Trump administration pausing funding. The administration also cancelled federal funding for Maine’s first floating offshore wind array, which had been fully permitted; the project was then mothballed.


“I obviously got a little emotional in the meeting … Something that I cared about was getting terminated,” Varnum told me. ​“It was also the first time I had ever been laid off.”
He sees himself and others who’ve been working on offshore wind as collateral damage.

In the following weeks, Varnum, who once identified as a conservative, was hopeful that some Republican members of Congress would speak up about the funding cuts, but none of them did — not even Maine’s Sen. Susan Collins, a long-time offshore-wind supporter. He described Collins’ silence as ​“rough,” especially since he had voted for Collins in the past.


“We’re a poor state. We need industry. To have a new industry that is unique to us, floating offshore wind, now targeted by the feds … It feels like a kick in the teeth,” said Varnum.











We’re a poor state. We need industry. To have a new industry that is unique to us, floating offshore wind, now targeted by the feds … It feels like a kick in the teeth.


– Lincoln Varnum, former instrumentation engineer at the University of Maine




Trump yanked funding in other ways.


In September, the Department of Transportation pulled back $679 million for infrastructure projects that supported offshore wind, including one that would have cleaned up and revitalized a massive California port. Mandy Davis, a California resident and anti-wind activist, aligns herself with Trump’s false narrative that turbines harm the ocean environment. She was elated by cuts that might block turbine construction in California’s waters, but her joy was short-lived.


In November, when the Trump administration announced plans for new oil drilling off the California coast, she told me it was a ​“betrayal.”


New England communities, which spent over a decade preparing to build America’s first offshore wind farms, also felt betrayed. Prior to Trump’s December halt, two massive projects had been paused by the Interior Department earlier in the year. One of the projects, Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island, was already 80 percent completed.


“It’s like having the rug pulled out from under you,” Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and Trump voter, told me earlier this year. ​“Nobody understands why Trump did it. I don’t know what Trump’s agenda is.”


Revolution Wind had employed 80 local fishermen, including Morris, to help with construction. The project’s pause caused Morris and others to lose some of the part-time income that helps them pay their bills as fishing revenues dry up.


The stop-work orders for Revolution Wind and New York’s Empire Wind were each lifted or reversed after about a month. But some damage was permanent. According to Harrison Sholler, an energy analyst for BloombergNEF, the orders were a signal to companies that America is not a sound investment. Foreign firms had invested heavily in the sector, lost billions, and are now looking for the door.


Trump’s more sweeping wind halt last week only reinforced that assessment.
 What America lost


“What exactly will America have lost? How do you even begin to answer that question?” pondered Elizabeth Wilson, a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College.


We could start by looking at how much new electricity capacity won’t be added to America’s increasingly strained grid.


Before Trump was elected last November, BNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind to be built in the U.S. by 2035. BNEF’s latest forecast is for just 6 gigawatts by 2035 — and even that number could come down thanks to Trump’s latest pause.


Another lens is employment. Together, the five wind farms currently underway have been slated to generate about 10,000 jobs. Now some of the highly skilled workers who have already trained for those projects face an uncertain future. And the 77,000 offshore wind jobs that the Biden administration had projected the country would see in the coming decades may never materialize.


Varnum, the laid-off engineer, said that if Maine’s nascent offshore wind industry rises from the ashes sometime in the future, he ​“certainly would want to help. It’s not something I’m turning my back on.”


He has since found a job working for a hydroelectric company. But Varnum said he fears for America’s energy future and how far Trump might take his broader war on carbon-free energy. The president has already boosted fossil-fuel production and nuclear power while trying to tamp down clean energy. His political revenge against offshore wind may be paving the way for more.


“The guy torpedoes us on Day One and how far is he going to go? How far will this go?” wonders Varnum.
Wilson of Dartmouth says that Trump’s assault on offshore wind is ultimately a battle over facts and truth.
Republican lawmakers again ask Trump administration to revoke offshore wind leases in Gulf of Maine



Fossil fuel–backed activists and groups have for years been spreading misinformation about wind turbines harming whales. They lit the match and Trump fanned the flames. The president ranted and made false claims about offshore wind throughout 2025, in front of reporters, foreign heads of state, and the entire United Nations General Assembly


Meanwhile, his administration quietly axed over $5 million for research into the impact of offshore wind on the giant mammals, ending the best and longest-running studies on the issue, as Canary Media first reported.


Interior Secretary Doug Burgum justified the Trump administration’s pause of the Empire Wind project by claiming the Biden administration approved it based on ​“flawed & bad science” about impacts on marine life, but the Interior Department refused to share the report that supposedly backed that up. The project’s developer and Democrats in Congress are still waiting for an unredacted version.


“There’s no proof, right? There are no receipts,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, told me in June. He said the administration hid the report and then used the permitting process as a ​“political tool,” something he sees as typical of ​“a banana republic.”


Without new offshore turbines going up, millions of households across the Northeast will soon pay more money for dirtier and less reliable electricity. According to a recent report, offshore wind power could help keep the lights on year-round in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, especially during harsh winter weather when gas plants can fail. Cuts to planet-warming pollution, mandated by several East Coast states, are also now out of reach. All signs point to Trump’s second term creating a hotter and less affordable future for Americans.


Few people interviewed for this story expressed hope that the damage from Trump’s war on ​“windmills” could be reversed anytime soon.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderTwiggs County commissioners recently approved a massive data center project, sparking a legal battle and deepening distrust between citizens and their elected officials in the rural middle Georgia community.
The decision was made despite vocal opposition aired at a contentious public hearing and accusations that the process was improperly rushed to bypass a state review that was at the time paused.
The Eagle Rock Partners proposal was ultimately approved at a mid-September county commission meeting. A couple months later, a state panel in November officially added data centers to the list of large-scale developments that must undergo a regional impact review. Waiting “would kill” the project, Ken Loeber with Eagle Rock Partners told the commissioners at the time, but he did not say how. 
The Twiggs County data center project did not undergo this review process, which opponents argued should have been mandatory under the county’s own local laws. County residents, concerned that the commission rushed the rezoning process with few details, filed a lawsuit asking the court to overturn the approval, arguing that the county violated its own ordinances and that the commission’s actions “were an abuse of its police and zoning powers.”

The project was under consideration during a months-long window when the Georgia Department of Community Affairs had paused the developments of regional impact process, which the agency says is designed to be a communication mechanism for local officials – and not a state regulatory tool. According to information submitted by the developers, the data center would be built on about 300 acres of land, but there is no specific information regarding the facilities’ square footage or the amount of water it needs to operate, which would have been included in the impact review.
Rob Fricks, a Twiggs County resident and a lawyer in the lawsuit, speaks during the public comment period during the Sept. 18, 2025 commission meeting in Jeffersonville, Ga. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder
Rob Fricks, a Twiggs County resident and lawyer, said to the commissioners at a public hearing in the fall that developers were rushing to receive approval “while the dogs are away” and that the commissioners did not “have the facts” needed to advance the proposal.
“I don’t know if this is good or bad. I cannot make a decision because the only thing I heard is that which the applicant has provided, and you guys should not blindly make a decision because the citizens of Twiggs County … are relying on you guys to make an informed decision,” Fricks said. “If you vote in favor of this tonight, you are not making a good decision because you do not have the facts.”
But Kerry Howell, an attorney for Twiggs County, had a different interpretation of the county’s ordinance about which projects are subject to the regional review process and said that it did not apply while the process was paused for data centers. He said he disagreed “with any contention that it is not proper to go forward with the zoning application tonight.”
To win approval, the developer offered a series of financial concessions that were read aloud at the meeting. These included a guaranteed real property tax return of at least $175 million on the land and infrastructure, a $100,000 payment to the school district for career training programs, and another $100,000 to the county for fire, public safety, or recreation. The developer also agreed that the data center would not be a cryptocurrency mining operation, a condition added late in the process after a resident discovered the possibility and alerted the commissioners.
In the county’s December response to the lawsuit, the county pushed back against claims that its rezoning decision was made in haste or as a result of “fraud, corruption, or a manifest abuse.” The county also denied that the concerned citizens “have a substantial interest in the zoning decision” or that they “will suffer permanent, special, or irreparable injury and damage as a result of the zoning decision.”

The situation in Twiggs County, which is home to about 8,000 people, highlights the different approaches local governments in Georgia are taking to manage a surge in data center proposals with little guidance or regulation at the state level. Without state regulations, counties are adopting widely different approaches.
DeKalb County, for example, took a more cautious approach by passing a moratorium on data center applications and holding auditorium-packed town halls where residents could learn about their potential negative and positive impacts.
“The greater benefit may not be in only creating 30 to 70 jobs but in the revenue that you create as a result of the tax digest that could be utilized for revitalization of a community that has been in decline,” said DeKalb County CEO Lorraine Cochran-Johnson at an October town hall.
DeKalb recently extended its moratorium on data center applications until June 2026 and deferred proposed regulations at least until January to allow for further study. The proposed regulations would reclassify data centers from “minor” facilities to massive “campus” developments, which would require special land-use permits and restrictions to industrial zones.
This is playing out as the county faces significant community pushback against a proposed 1-million-square-foot data center in Ellenwood.

Nancy Lubeck, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Twiggs County government officials, said that local communities are left “flying blind” regarding the long-term impacts on the state’s power grid and water supply. She said that without a centralized system to track or limit the cumulative impact of these massive facilities on the state, their rapid growth could lead to a boom-and-bust cycle, leaving counties with resource shortages and abandoned infrastructure.
“Somebody needs to be watching to see what the impact is going to be overall,” Lubeck said. “How many of these things can Georgia safely support? And if nobody’s looking at that, then we could end up being in a lot of trouble.”
In nearby Monroe County, county officials unanimously raised concerns about the infrastructure demands of a proposed $8.4 billion data center in Forsyth, a city of about 4,300 people, warning that the massive development could strain local water supplies and county roads. The project’s DRI report projects the data center will require 1.5 million gallons of water per day, and commissioners questioned whether the city can meet this demand, saying that the city struggled to supply existing customers as recently as 2025.
“Major infrastructure would need to be done through Macon, Monroe County, and Forsyth to provide this amount of water,” Monroe County officials wrote in response to the Forsyth data center’s DRI report.
Local officials are often drawn to data centers because they can generate massive amounts of tax revenue. Some of them view data centers as a “cash cow,” a term Clint Mueller with the Association County Commissioners of Georgia used to describe their profitability, which can offset the tax burden on local residents. While the buildings themselves generate property tax, Mueller said that “the real money” comes from the personal property taxes on the computer equipment inside the facilities. Because this equipment is replaced every few years, it can provide a tax stream for the county.
“Probably the biggest positive aspect that a lot of county commissioners are looking at is they’re trying to lower taxes for their other residents, and they look at this as a sort of a cash cow to do that with, so that’s why they like them,” Mueller said.
The revenue can be transformative for local budgets. Cochran-Johnson told DeKalb residents that a data center investment of roughly $125 million per megawatt could yield $6 billion in real and personal property value over a 15-year period. That translates to about $27 million in annual tax revenue.

“Data centers are like the modern-day gold rush,” said Shane Short, executive director of the development authority of Walton County, who was invited to speak at the October town hall in DeKalb about how their local government addressed the proposals.
Counties seem to be racing to approve data centers, primarily because officials view the current boom as a finite “window of time” that could close. Mueller said there is a fear that if a county does not secure a data center now, the opportunity may be lost forever.
“I think we have a period of time where we’re going to kind of run out of new capacity,” Mueller said.

But instead of fishing for shrimp, black drum or blue crabs, these days the 77-year-old is an environmental activist looking for “nurdles”— tiny plastic pellets that are polluting beaches and waterways in Texas and around the country.
The minuscule spheres, typically less than 5 millimeters in diameter, are the basic building blocks of nearly all plastic products. But when they are mishandled during manufacturing or transport, they can slip through storm drains and into waterways, posing a health threat to both wildlife and humans. They are difficult to clean up, and act like sponges for toxins as they progress through the food chain.
An estimated 445,970 metric tons of nurdles make their way into oceans annually.
“They’re everywhere,” said Wilson, who is now executive director of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper, an environmental group focused on protecting Matagorda Bay, on the Texas Gulf Coast. “They’re a real threat to human health and the planet, and we’re trying to protect the communities and the fishermen and the bays.”

California enacted a law designed to curb nurdle pollution in 2007. Now the issue is gaining attention elsewhere: In 2025, legislators in Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia introduced bills.
But the threat of nurdle pollution is beginning to resonate even beyond such left-leaning states. In Wilson’s deeply conservative Texas, a coalition of environmentalists, fishermen, business leaders and local officials is pushing for more nurdle regulation, arguing that the pellets pose an economic threat to coastal communities.
State Rep. Erin Zwiener, a Democrat from the Austin-area town of Dripping Springs, said in an interview that even some in the plastics industry “want to see this issue get solved.” Zwiener has introduced nurdle bills during the past two legislative sessions and plans to do so again when the legislature reconvenes in 2027.
“I think some members of industry know the black eye they’re getting on this and would like to see some curtailment of the worst actors,” Zwiener said.
The plastics industry has long acknowledged that many nurdles leak into the environment. In 1991, it created a voluntary program called Operation Clean Sweep, under which participating nurdle-handling operations commit to certain practices to prevent spills.
Charlotte Dreizen, who oversees Operation Clean Sweep for the Plastics Industry Association, said more than two-thirds of U.S. plastics production occurs at a participating facility.
But Wilson and other critics say the program doesn’t include meaningful reporting requirements, oversight or consequences.
“They’re just being sloppy, and they can do better, but nobody’s making them do it,” said Wilson. “They obviously have to be forced into it.”










They’re a real threat to human health and the planet, and we’re trying to protect the communities and the fishermen and the bays.


– Diane Wilson, executive director of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper


In 2019, Wilson was a victorious co-plaintiff in a lawsuit that resulted in a record $50 million settlement against Formosa Plastics, a petrochemical manufacturer that illegally dumped billions of nurdles and other pollutants into Lavaca Bay and other Texas waterways. It was the largest-ever settlement of a Clean Water Act suit filed by private citizens. Instead of being awarded to the plaintiffs, the money went into a fund to pay for projects to reverse pollution in the affected waterways.
Now, Wilson is gearing up for another lawsuit: In December, she filed a 60-day legal notice of intent to sue Dow Chemical Company, alleging it has been illegally discharging plastic pellets from its plant near Seadrift.
Part of a larger problem
Nurdles are a type of microplastic pollution, but not all microplastics are nurdles. Microplastics also include microbeads, which are used as exfoliating agents in cosmetics and toothpaste, and tiny particles from broken-down plastic litter, packaging and synthetic fibers. Some are so small they can’t be seen without a microscope.
Microplastics have been detected in cities’ tap water, in bottled water, in rivers and throughout the Great Lakes. Scientists estimate that adults ingest the equivalent of one credit card per week in microplastics, and studies in animals and human cells suggest they could be connected to cancer, heart attacks, reproductive problems and other harms.
States need to keep PFAS ’forever chemicals’ out of the water. It won’t be cheap.

Nurdles are larger than many other microplastics. They can be seen with the naked eye, and their uniform shape and size make them easier to identify and collect. This past spring, volunteers scooped up nearly 50,000 plastic pellets over an 11-day period at more than 200 sites across 14 countries, 29 U.S. states and Washington D.C.
Texas sites, mostly on the coast, yielded the highest count: 23,115 nurdles. California (4,167), Michigan (3,681), South Carolina (3,094) and Ohio (2,851) also reported substantial amounts.
In the Upper Midwest, environmental advocates are rallying behind pellet-control legislation to protect the five Great Lakes that collectively serve as an economic engine for eight states.
“I think there’s concern up and down and all around in terms of making sure we can prevent this from having a devastating impact in our regions,” said Andrea Densham, senior policy adviser for the Alliance for the Great Lakes.
On the West Coast, nurdles washing onto the coast of Oregon from the Pacific Ocean can be so numerous that “it looks like pellets have become part of the sand,” said Celeste Meiffren-Swango, director of Environment Oregon. “More and more pellets are ending up in the environment and they’re not getting taken out of the environment.”
A question of economics
In Texas, which has at least 36 plastic production plants, Zwiener’s bill — which stalled in committee — would have classified nurdles as non-hazardous industrial waste, triggering record-keeping and containment rules. It also would have required plastics facilities to monitor surrounding waters and conduct monthly audits of spills.
A Slew of State Proposals Shows the Threat of ‘Forever Chemicals’

During a 2025 hearing on the legislation, Logan Harrell of the Texas Chemistry Council told lawmakers that the “industry is already voluntarily addressing the issue,” by improving how it responds to spills and doing more to prevent them. The bill “would result in overregulation and likely add complications based on some ambiguous language and other burdensome requirements,” Harrell said.
Though Zwiener’s bill and a companion bill in the state Senate failed to advance, supporters say the mood may be shifting as more plastic pellets show up on Texas beaches.
In October, organizations representing recreational fishermen, oyster harvesters, tourism groups and others sent a letter to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, urging him to direct the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to adopt standards to prevent the discharge of nurdles into waterways as part of its scheduled revision of water quality standards.
The letter emphasizes the potential economic impact of the pollution, noting that the state’s outdoor recreation industry supports nearly 300,000 jobs, $14 billion in salaries and adds $31 billion in total value to the Texas economy.
The agency was considering a ban on plastics discharges during its last revision of the rules in 2022, but reportedly backed away amid industry pressure. Abbott’s office and the agency declined to comment on the letter.
Community members from across the Houston-Galveston region, along with visitors to Galveston, Texas, joined Turtle Island Restoration Network for the statewide Nurdle Patrol. Together, participants collected and removed 1,216 nurdles from Galveston’s seawall beaches on Jan. 11, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Turtle Island Restoration Network)
No city in Texas is more dependent on clean beaches than Galveston, a coastal city of more than 53,000 that draws up to 8 million visitors each year. In October, the city council unanimously approved a resolution echoing the letter the fishing and tourism groups sent to the Texas governor.
“It’s been a problem, long term,” said Joanie Steinhaus, ocean program director at the Galveston office of the Turtle Island Restoration Network, a California-based nonprofit that advocates for oceans and marine wildlife. The group sponsors regular nurdle patrols on Galveston beaches, and volunteers have collected more than 17,000 nurdles in the past five years, according to Steinhaus.
Recently, the anti-nurdle effort has gotten a boost from J.P. Bryan, a prominent Texas oilman and historic preservationist who founded the Bryan Museum in Galveston. Bryan wrote a widely publicized op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, in which he shared his childhood memories of the beaches of Freeport, Texas, and called for action to curb nurdle pollution.
“For Texans who value both economic growth and environmental stewardship, addressing the scourge of plastic nurdles is not only an ecological imperative, but an economic necessity,” Bryan wrote.
“This problem needs solving, preferably by those causing the problem,” Bryan continued, “but if they won’t, then good government can and should prevent companies from causing economic and environmental damage through plastic pellet spills.”

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)As the current Ohio General Assembly goes into its second year in 2026, abortion will still remain a topic of legislation, in small efforts to change laws, and large attempts to codify or prohibit the practice.
Republicans and Democrats have clearly drawn their lines in the sand when it comes to where they’d like the state to go on reproductive rights, but the GOP supermajority certainly has the edge when it comes to hearing out bills on their side of the aisle.
A constitutional amendment was passed in 2023 with 57% of the vote, enshrining reproductive rights including abortion into the Ohio Constitution, but Republican lawmakers are looking at ways around that.
While Democrats introduced Ohio House Bill 128 in February to further drive home the amendment, including attempting to repeal laws that don’t align with it, Republicans introduced Ohio House Bill 370, which has been called another “personhood bill” because of its attempt to apply 14th Amendment rights to “preborn persons,” and repeal any state law that would “otherwise allow a person to direct, advise, encourage, or solicit a mother to abort her child.”
The bill emphasizes the U.S. Constitution’s overriding provision, taking precedent over anything the Ohio Constitution “contrary to it,” according to the language of the bill.
The Democrats’ bill does the opposite, seeing to repeal “archaic laws in our state that do not improve outcomes or access to care,” as bill co-sponsor Rep. Anita Somani, D-Dublin, put it when the bill was introduced.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While neither bill has seen a hearing since being assigned to their committee, this new year is likely to be more friendly to the GOP bill because of the party’s supermajority, though previous attempts at “personhood bills” haven’t fared well, and pro-abortion advocates say they are unpopular nationwide.
Somani previously introduced a similar bill to the year’s attempt, trying to repeal anti-abortion regulations in state laws, but that bill died at the end of the previous General Assembly, having only received one hearing.
The Dublin representative, who is also an OB/GYN, is pushing forward with attempts to further change language in state law with another bill, Ohio House Bill 245.
The bill seeks to change rules for the Ohio Parenting and Pregnancy Program, which provides grants to entities who help with pregnancy services and parenting education. Currently, the program specifies that those receiving grants must “promote childbirth, rather than abortion, through counseling and other services, including parenting and adoption support.”
The new bill would delete that language, along with a provision in the law that excludes entities from receiving grants if they are “involved in or associated with abortion activities, including providing abortion counseling or referrals to abortion clinics, performing abortion related medical procedures, or engaging in pro-abortion advertising.”
The bill removes anti-abortion language and adds text including abortion in the options allowed for counseling individuals who come to grant-funded facilities.
Information on contraception, reproductive health care, and sex education would also be allowed under the new bill.
The Ohio House Children and Human Services Committee received the bill in April, but have not held a hearing on it.
 Abortion, directly and indirectly
The General Assembly is considering other bills that directly and indirectly point to abortion care.
Before abortion is even considered, certain facilities may have to determine whether they can afford to continue, as a bill moves forward seeking to take away state Medicaid funds in the same way as a federal effort in the most recent budget bill.
Ohio House Bill 410 has had three hearings in the House Medicaid Committee since being sent there in September.
It cites language in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in its effort to prohibit federal funds from going to nonprofit organizations who received more than $800,000 in federal and state Medicaid payments in 2023.
Federal Medicaid cuts have already been named as the cause of Ohio Planned Parenthood clinic closures and staff cuts this year.
Multiple bills currently being considered by committees in the Statehouse have to do with informed consent, the requirement that patients receive state-mandated documents on specific risks of abortion procedures and potential civil action that could be taken against providers and facilities.
Ohio Senate Bill 309 was heard once in the Senate Health Committee in October. That bill would require doctors to provide patients with a written statement to sign on the risks of abortion services, except in a medical emergency.
It also states that patients and patients’ families could sue the physician, the health care facilities, or others if complications arise that weren’t disclosed before the procedure.
Ohio House Bill 347, referred to the House Health Committee in June, has also had one hearing in its effort to permit “elective abortion” only after a physician meets with a pregnant individual at least 24 hours before the abortion to “provide specific information and document the woman’s informed consent.”
This may put the bill in conflict with an ongoing court case that struck down a previous provision in state law requiring a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion procedure.
A judge in Franklin County blocked the provision in August 2024, citing the constitutional amendment on reproductive rights in his decision. The case will extend into at least the spring before a final decision is released.
The Ohio House bill also creates civil liability against a physician who violates the bill, liability that lasts up to one year after the abortion procedure, or one year after “reasonable discovery of harm,” according to the bill.
The measure also permits the State Medical Board “to adopt rules specifying adverse physical or psychological conditions arising from abortion that a physician must disclose as possible complications.”
The State Medical Board currently includes Michael Gonidakis, a former leader for the anti-abortion lobby Ohio Right to Life, who is still affiliated with the organization.
OB/GYNs and pro-abortion advocates have said patients are already informed of the risks of abortion before a procedure is done under the medical training and rules that exist for medical professionals. Studies show severe complications are statistically rare.

(Getty Images)Most of the tuition spending in the education freedom account program continued to go to private religious schools last school year, new numbers released by the Children’s Scholarship Fund indicate.
In total, $11.5 million of EFA money was spent on tuition in the 2024-25 school year, or about 57% of total EFA expenditures that year. A review by the Bulletin found the majority of that tuition spending went to religious institutions. The rest of the spending went to a combination of instructional resources, online educational programs, technology, home-schooling resources, and other spending categories.
Launched in 2021, the education freedom account program allows families of students who are not in the public school system to access state education funds to use toward private school and home-schooling expenses. The program currently provides an average of $4,900 per student per year. 
The program remains politically divisive: Republicans say it provides needed financial support for choices outside public schools, while Democrats say it is an improper use of money that should go to public schools.
With no legislative majorities to repeal the program, Democrats have in recent years called for financial accountability. 
In late December, the Children’s Scholarship Fund, the nonprofit organization that runs the program, released updated reports showing how much approved vendors received. The release came months after the organization took down similar reports for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, citing concerns over harassment of vendors. 
The new spending figures do not capture the latest expansion of the program. In June, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed legislation to remove the income cap on the program, but limit it to about 10,000 students. The December reports show a school year in which EFA recipients were restricted to households making up to 350% of the federal poverty level, or $102,200 for a family of four in 2024. 
Here are some key takeaways in the new spending reports. 
Private Christian schools continue to dominate tuition use
Of the $11.5 million that went toward tuition at 131 different schools, a majority went to religious schools, the numbers indicate. Of the top 20 recipients of the program, all but one was a Christian academy. Those top 20 recipients made up more than half — $6.8 million — of the total tuition spending.
The numbers follow a trend in EFA spending that has continued for years. And while the use of state funding for religious education has drawn Democratic objections — who cite the potential for discriminatory practices — the U.S. Supreme Court has approved the practice, ruling in 2022 that it is unconstitutional for states to block religious schools from accessing funding for which they would otherwise qualify. Republicans argue that denying the use of EFA funding toward a school because of its religious affiliation would be discrimination, and note that many of the most affordable options for private education are Christian. 
In New Hampshire, Portsmouth Christian Academy topped the list, receiving $543,000 in EFA money in the 2024-25 school year, or 2.7% of total EFA tuition spending. Trinity High School, Trinity Christian School Concord, Concord Christian Academy, Mount Royal Academy, Dublin Christian Academy, St. Joseph Regional School, Laconia Christian Academy, Claremont Christian Academy, and St. Christopher Academy, all received at least $300,000 in EFA funding that school year.
Religious education dominates online programs, too
For those EFA recipients not attending private schools, the reports indicate that religious education is still a major focus. 
For instance, two of the top three recipients under the category of “textbooks, curriculum and other instructional materials” are Abeka, a Bible-based home school education platform, and The Good and the Beautiful, a similar Christian-based website offering English Language Arts, STEM, and history courses. The two received about $131,000 and $120,000 in the 2024-25 school year, respectively.
And Liberty University Online Academy, a K-12 online program associated with the Episcopalian higher education institution in Virginia, received the second-highest amount of tuition amounts for online tuition payments, or $107,000 of EFA funds in total.
But the program also attracted many secular homeschool programs, too. The number one recipient in Liberty University’s category was Outschool, a website that provides virtual lessons for children.  
Some EFAs used for public school programs, college courses
As education freedom accounts become more well-known, some public schools are opting to recoup some costs through the EFA program. 
Sunapee School District, for instance, took in $14,510 in EFA money; Pembroke received $7,200; and Greenland $6,500. Other public school recipients included Bow and Dunbarton, Pinkerton Academy, Milford, Nashua, Henniker, Amherst, Timberland Regional School District, Dover, Hillsboro, Concord, Gorham, Berlin, Coe-Brown Northwood Academy, Governor Wentworth Regional School District, Mountain View Middle School, and Somersworth High School. 
EFA funds can be used to reimburse public schools for a host of courses and activities, from arts classes to sports. 
Community colleges also received EFA money to cover tuition for dual enrollment programs and other course offerings. New Hampshire Technical Institute received $6,613; Manchester Community College $4,864; and Nashua Community College $4,588. In total, the funding for community colleges amounted to $49,000. 
Some of the EFA money was spent on career technical education, with a large proportion aimed at health care jobs, the Children’s Scholarship Fund reported. 
Dance classes, skiing passes top list of extracurriculars
The numbers reveal a wide diversity of uses of EFA funds. One of the highest recipients of EFA funds in the category of “tuition and fees for summer education programs and specialized education programs” was Gunstock Ski Area, the Gilford ski mountain owned by Belknap County. Gunstock received about $63,000 in funds in the 2024-25 school year. 
Other recipients indicate the range in extracurricular use. The Concord Community Music School, Impact Gymnastics Academy in Bow, the Concord USA Ninja Challenge, and the Creative Dance Workshop Ultimate All Stars all featured in the top 20 extracurricular uses of the funds. 
Some families used EFA funds for driving schools, Boy Scouts of America, piano lessons, and circus lessons. 
Then, there were the material expenses. In that category, Amazon continues to dominate. The online retailer took 14.6% of the total EFA spending on textbooks, curriculum, and supplemental materials, and an additional 3.5% of spending on computer hardware and other tech services, for a total of about $3.6 million of total spending.
Some spending details withheld
While the new reports present broad spending trends, some information has been left out. 
Last summer, the Children’s Scholarship Fund removed the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school year vendor expenditure reports, according to records from the Internet Archive, which tracks website changes. In November, responding to questions from the Concord Monitor, Executive Director Kate Baker Demers said the organization was concerned the records would encourage harassment of the EFA vendors by those opposed to the program.
In interviews, Baker Demers told the Monitor and the Bulletin that the Children’s Scholarship Fund would upload the records by the end of 2025, but said it was considering removing the statistics showing how many individual orders a vendor received if it received fewer than 10 orders. Those statistics, which had been included in previous reports, could allow people to harass smaller vendors and potentially discern the EFA recipient families using those vendors, Baker Demers said. 
But the newly uploaded reports left out the number of orders for all vendors, not just smaller ones. While the total amount of EFA money going to each vendor is included, it is no longer possible to determine how many EFA recipients are using their funds for each vendor, nor what the average spend was per order. 
Administrative rules passed by lawmakers require the Children’s Scholarship Fund to upload certain numbers. According to Rule 803.02 (f) of the Department of Education’s rules for the EFA administrator, “A list of all approved education service providers shall be posted on the scholarship organization’s websites, reported to the department, and made easily accessible to the public to include education service provider name, eligible services, fee amounts received for services, and number of EFA students served.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/scanlon-ct-must-solve-its-medicaid-problem-now/,"Surging Medicaid costs and dramatically shrinking federal aid are a recipe for fiscal crisis, CT Comptroller Sean Scanlon warned Monday.","Surging Medicaid costs and dramatically shrinking federal aid are a recipe for fiscal crisis, state Comptroller Sean Scanlon warned Monday.
And while Connecticut’s chief fiscal watchdog didn’t call for changing state budget caps that hamper the General Assembly’s ability to solve the Medicaid dilemma, Scanlon said all solutions need to be reviewed.
“I think that every option should be on the table for us as we explore how to make sure that the million or so people who get Medicaid can continue to get that … health care that they need,” Scanlon said during a mid-afternoon online press conference on fiscal and economic trends.
“We have an overspending problem,” he said, “and 60% of that overspending right now is happening with Medicaid.”
An omnibus federal program run cooperatively with states, Medicaid in Connecticut supports medical and behavioral health services, substance abuse treatment, and nursing home and in-home elder care in Connecticut.
The state Department of Social Services’ $3.7 billion line item is one of Connecticut’s largest annual expenses, representing about 14% of the budget’s General Fund.
Enhanced federal funding ordered in response to COVID expired in 2023, but Medicaid demand has remained much greater than pre-pandemic levels, leaving Gov. Ned Lamont and the General Assembly struggling to keep costs under control.
The social services department overspent its Medicaid budget by almost $160 million two fiscal years ago and by more than $300 million last year, according to the comptroller’s annual reports. Lamont’s budget office already projects more than $110 million in cost overruns this fiscal year.
That’s challenging enough, Scanlon said. But President Donald Trump and Congress last July ordered federal Medicaid spending cuts of more than $900 billion nationwide by 2034, with states beginning to feel significant pain by 2028.
Analysts here haven’t projected yet how much Connecticut expects to lose, though the hit is expected to be significant. Further complicating matters, Scanlon said, pulling back Medicaid spending would be a huge mistake.
“We do need to make bigger investments in the Medicaid program,” he said, adding it would be more harmful — both to patients and to the state’s economy — if residents had less regular access to both primary and specialist care.
“It sounds somewhat counter-intuitive, but the more money you spend [up front,] the less money you spend” in the long run, Scanlon said.
At first glance, replacing tens or even hundreds of millions of vanishing federal Medicaid dollars each year is not an unsolvable problem in Connecticut.
The state has run up unprecedented surpluses topping $1.8 billion, equal to 8% to 9% of the General Fund, since aggressive budget caps were installed in 2017. But Connecticut has used those surpluses to build reserves and whittle down a considerable pension debt that still exceeds $33 billion, according to Lamont’s budget office.
And the fiscally moderate governor has been wary of adjusting these caps, despite criticisms from many of his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority that they divert too much toward debt and weaken health care, education, municipal aid and other core services.
In recent years, the legislature and Lamont have underfunded Medicaid, authorizing amounts that ignore clear growth trends in demand rather than using special procedures to override budget caps.
Instead, they allow the Medicaid program to operate at a deficit, then cover the cost overrun shortly before the fiscal year ends on June 30, when budget cap rules are more flexible about dealing with crises.
“I think that the issue that’s happening right now is less an issue of overspending and more an issue of under budgeting,” the comptroller said, calling on officials “to craft more realistic budgets.”
The Lamont administration has been researching options to contain the growth in Medicaid costs, though most of his fellow Democrats in the legislature agree with Scanlon that Medicaid spending needs to grow.
“We know we have a Medicaid problem,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, “and it’s something we’re going to have to address.”
But Osten said all state officials must acknowledge the full reality of the situation. Even as the budget caps are limiting spending, federal cutbacks on health care, nutrition and other human service programs likely will push demand for Medicaid-funded services to new heights, she said.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said only that the administration would release its next Medicaid funding proposal on Feb. 4 when the governor recommends his budget adjustments for the 2026-27 fiscal year to the legislature.
The goal, Collibee added, would be “to enhance affordability and opportunity for all Connecticut residents.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/scanlanscreenshot-1024x599.jpg,,,2026-01-06 05:12:29.709413

DeWine vetoed Ohio Senate Bill 50, but the bill passed the legislature with veto-proof numbers.

Lawmakers would need a three-fifths vote from each chamber to override the veto, meaning 20 votes in the Senate and 60 votes in the House. 
The bill passed in the Senate with 24 votes and with 62 votes in the House. 
The Ohio Senate would have to start the override process since state Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, introduced the bill.  
“That’ll be a conversation,” Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said when asked if the Senate will try to override the veto. “If we do, it will happen in January, in all likelihood.”
The Ohio Senate will be in session on Jan. 28.
Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, was glad DeWine vetoed the bill. 
“I sent (DeWine) a text and said bravo,” she said. “I think it’s a dangerous precedent to set. I think it opens the door to child labor in the state of Ohio.” 
A child’s first responsibility is to be in school and doing their school work, Antonio said. 
“I can think of a million different ways to encourage more people to come to the state of Ohio and work and have jobs here,” she said. “I don’t think we have to start with our children.”
Ohio law currently allows 14 and 15 year olds to work till 9 p.m. during the summer or during a school holiday, meaning they are not able to work past 7 p.m. on school nights.
In his veto message, DeWine said it would be “unwise” for 14 and 15 year olds to work that late on school nights. 
“I believe the current law has served us well and has effectively balanced the importance of 14- and 15-year-old children learning to work, with the importance of them having time to study,” DeWine wrote in his veto message. 
Ohio is unable to change the law without the federal government making changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
Ohio lawmakers also passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 3 which urges Congress to alter the Fair Labor Standards Act to let a teenager younger than 16 work between 7-9 p.m. during the school year if the teenager has their parent or guardian’s permission. 
The Ohio Restaurant and Hospitality Alliance was disappointed to see DeWine veto the bill. 
“Legislative initiatives such as Senate Bill 50 recognize the importance of employment in shaping future careers by fostering skills that cannot be taught in a classroom, including customer service, problem-solving and time management,” Ohio Restaurant & Hospitality Alliance President and CEO John Barker said in a statement to the Capital Journal. 
“These fundamental skills that young people learn in the workforce, especially within the foodservice and hospitality industry, are invaluable to their future.”
Extending working hours for children can have negative consequences on their academics, said Brianna Booker, policy associate for Children’s Defense Fund of Ohio. 
“If you extend working hours for young people, then they’re more likely to drop out of school or their grades are likely to suffer,” she said. “We’re putting the future of young people at risk for a short term economic relief for the state of Ohio.”
Booker said overriding DeWine’s veto would be bad for young people. 
“Children should not have to be the solution to adult problems and I think that if they make a choice to override the veto, they’re essentially making children responsible for adult choices,” Booker said. 
Ohio businesses can pay 14 and 15 year olds the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which is less than the state’s minimum wage of $10.70 per hour, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce.

(Getty Images) It is unhealthy to ask the average citizen, even if he or she is serving as a New Hampshire legislator, to understand the intricacies of nursing home reimbursement, but such an occasion has arisen given changes to Medicaid rates on Jan. 1.
Last November, nursing home providers found out that they would be experiencing, on Jan. 1, the first average rate cut since January 2015. It turned out that the state appropriation could not sustain a rate increase granted at the start of the fiscal year July 1.
To their credit, the Department of Health and Human Services came up with an innovative strategy. Nursing homes had volunteered a fee increase toward a legislative appropriation to retain a contractor to help Health and Human Services address a backlog in Medicaid applications. As luck would have it, the contractor selected is doing the work for far less than the appropriation, so the department recommended the surplus be used to mitigate Jan. 1 rate cuts. Gov. Kelly Ayotte, the Executive Council, and the legislative Fiscal Committee all approved the fund transfer. An average rate cut of 3.91% — or $10.36 per resident, per day — turned into an average increase of two cents per resident, per day.
However, an average does not tell the whole story, which is where things get wonky. Nursing home reimbursement is based upon the medical complexity of Medicaid residents as captured on a particular “picture day” — Aug. 31, 2025, in the case of the Jan. 1 rates. That medical complexity results in what is called a “case mix index,” or CMI, score.
The Medicaid CMI is then divided by the CMI for your residents paying privately or admitted, post-hospitalization, on Medicare. This is called the all-payor CMI. The state “rebased” the system to state fiscal year 2024, and it turns out that the all-payor CMI on Aug. 31, 2023, was a lot higher for many facilities than their Aug. 31, 2025, Medicaid CMI. I’m a liberal arts major, but I know that if your divisor is bigger than the number you are dividing into you’re going to end up with a negative number.
Thus, even with the fund transfer, many facilities were left with a rate decrease on Jan. 1 — some quite severe. Consider, for example, a small nonprofit losing almost $46 per resident, per day. A Keene for-profit facility with New Hampshire-based ownership lost $34.49 per resident, per day, or 11.49% of its funding. The Rockingham County Nursing Home lost $26.77 per resident, per day.  Examples abound of for-profit and nonprofit facilities alike taking enormous hits to their care funding.
No margin exists for these cuts. Upset that the price of eggs is higher, or that the price of beef is up 13% just since last January? Try feeding, say, 100 people each day. Hourly earnings in nursing homes have gone up over 35% since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and yet facilities are still struggling to recover their pre-pandemic workforces within constrained Medicaid means.
New Hampshire’s hospitals, too, have not gotten back to pre-pandemic staffing levels, creating workforce competition between health care partners in a landscape of scarcity — with the irony being that inadequate nursing home staffing creates a barrier to hospital discharges. On the health care workforce front, at least, our hope is that the $204 million Gov. Ayotte secured from the federal government in a Rural Health Transformation Program grant can bring some eventual relief.
In the near term, some respite must be found in the 2026 legislative session for the biggest losers in the Jan. 1 rate change, or care access will be further restricted (many facilities already have waiting lists) and outright facility closures will occur. And in the future we must consider the perverse repercussions of a methodology that, in effect, punishes facilities in their Medicaid rate for caring for those on Medicare, as a facility cannot be all-Medicaid without certain bankruptcy.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/medicaidtrump-1024x650.jpg,,,2026-01-06 04:59:07.923695

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)An Ohio judge is determining whether or not two retired teachers’ pension fund leaders should be punished for allegedly participating in a corruption scheme, but investigations into the men are still ongoing.
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Karen Held Phipps is set to decide if State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum should be removed from his position, and if he and former board member Wade Steen should be banned from ever returning to public pensions.
“It’s an erosion of confidence in the institution that safeguards retirement security for Ohio’s teachers,” Assistant Attorney General Chad Kohler said during the trial.
The scandal centers on Steen and Fichtenbaum and their relationship with startup investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
“What I was trying to do was to provide benefits that were promised to planned beneficiaries — that were taken from them, like the cost of living adjustment — and reduce expenses when we had excessive investment costs,” Steen testified.
Attorney General Dave Yost’s team has submitted its closing argument on a case we’ve been uncovering for years — an alleged $65 billion scheme inside STRS.
“The question at trial was did they violate their fiduciary duty to the retired teachers, and I think we unquestionably proved that and proved it over again,” Yost said in a one-on-one interview in mid-December.
How we got here
In May of 2024, the governor received a 14-page anonymous whistleblower memo alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS. In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The documents claim that they tried to convince STRS members to partner with them and provide them with $65 billion.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
All of this failed, and finally, a whistleblower reached out to state officials.
Days later, Yost filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract steering “scheme” that could benefit them. Yost started the investigation after the memo, now known as being prepared by STRS employees, alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been bidding on QED.
“Their promotion of QED—a two-person startup with no clients, no assets under management, no track record, no infrastructure, and personnel lacking sufficient experience—was not only a lapse in judgment,” Kohler wrote in his closing.
“It was a calculated campaign that disregarded fiduciary obligations, subverted board governance, and jeopardized the financial future of over 500,000 current and retired educators.”
The state said that Metcalf worked behind the scenes to try to illegally secure the deal, pointing out concerns that the board members were too close to him.
Communications obtained via a records request of a court filing reveal that QED associates consistently told then-board member Steen what questions to ask, gave him documents to propose, and pushed him to follow its plan.
Fichtenbaum joined the conversations, too.
“We’re trying to explain their idea,” Fichtenbaum said.
However, the defense argued that seeking advice isn’t a crime, and they were simply trying to get better financial returns for educators. They also had a focus on increasing their cost-of-living adjustments.
“We need a lot of money in order to restore the COLA, no question about that,” Fichtenbaum said on the stand.
Each of Fichtenbaum and Steen’s attorneys wrote in their closings that the state didn’t prove that they would gain anything financially from this, and no harm was done because the proposal never went through.
Both also adamantly said that they never really proposed $65 billion. This was disputed by the state.
Fichtenbaum’s lawyer, Richard Kerger, added that there is no rule about asking questions that someone else submitted, nor was it harmful that Metcalf was getting access to confidential documents.
“There is no indication that any harm whatsoever occurred from that,” Kerger wrote. “And it is quite likely the information was not entitled to the confidential stamp.”
Then, the attorney added that in the case Fichtenbaum had done something wrong, being removed from his role wouldn’t be “appropriate” because that isn’t fair to the educators who elected him.
Steen’s attorney, Norm Abood, argued that the former board member was a “hero” to pensioners, stating that this has been a sham case.
“‘I’m going to do a thorough and impartial investigation,'” Abood said, imitating Yost. “And [Yost] filed five days later, that’s when he filed this case. No investigation.”
The attorney general had been criticized by the defendants for the quick turnaround time.
“Every defendant I’ve ever prosecuted, civilly or criminal, has either said that I had improper motives, didn’t do the investigation right, screwed something up,” Yost said. “That’s what defendants do.”
This is just a civil case, but the Ohio Ethics Commission has been investigating for at least a year and a half. They would be able to refer criminal charges.
It’s not Yost’s jurisdiction, he said, but it may be warranted.
“I do think they acted unethically,” the attorney general said.
The OEC is unable to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, but we obtained subpoenas that the commission sent to witnesses.
“It’s not unusual for them to let independent legal processes work out before they duplicate a process,” Yost said.

(States Newsroom file photo.)This story was originally published by Canary Media. 

Extreme weather is making the grid more prone to outages — and now FirstEnergy’s three Ohio utilities want more leeway on their reliability requirements.


Put simply, FirstEnergy is asking the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to let Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., Ohio Edison, and Toledo Edison take longer to restore power when the lights go out. The latter two utilities would also be allowed slightly more frequent outages per customer each year.


An administrative trial, known as an evidentiary hearing, is currently set to start Jan. 21.


Consumer and environmental advocates say it’s unfair to make customers shoulder the burden of lower-quality service, as they have already been paying for substantial grid-hardening upgrades.


“Relaxing reliability standards can jeopardize the health and safety of Ohio consumers,” said Maureen Willis, head of the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, which is the state’s legal representative for utility customers. ​“It also shifts the costs of more frequent and longer outages onto Ohioans who already paid millions of dollars to utilities to enhance and develop their distribution systems.”


The United States has seen a rise in blackouts linked to severe weather, a 2024 analysis by Climate Central found, with about twice as many such events happening from 2014 through 2023 compared to the 10 years from 2000 through 2009.


The duration of the longest blackouts has also grown. As of mid-2025, the average length of 12.8 hours represents a jump of almost 60% from 2022, J.D. Power reported in October.


Ohio regulators have approved less stringent reliability standards before, notably for AES Ohio and Duke Energy Ohio, where obligations from those or other orders required investments and other actions to improve reliability.


Some utilities elsewhere in the country have also sought leeway on reliability expectations. In April, for example, two New York utilities asked to exclude some outages related to tree disease and other factors from their performance metrics, which would in effect relax their standards.


Other utilities haven’t necessarily pursued lower targets, but have nonetheless noted vulnerabilities to climate change or experienced more major events that don’t count toward requirements.


FirstEnergy’s case is particularly notable because the company has slow-rolled clean energy and energy efficiency, two tools that advocates say can cost-effectively bolster grid reliability and guard against weather-related outages.


There is also a certain irony to the request: FirstEnergy’s embrace of fossil fuels at the expense of clean energy and efficiency measures has let its subsidiaries’ operations and others continue to emit high levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide. Now, the company appears to nod toward climate-change-driven weather variability as justification for relaxed reliability standards.


FirstEnergy filed its application to the Public Utilities Commission last December, while its recently decided rate case and other cases linked to its House Bill 6 corruption scandal were pending. FirstEnergy argues that specific reliability standards for each of its utilities should start with an average of the preceding five years’ performance.
From there, FirstEnergy says the state should tack on extra allowances for longer or more frequent outages to ​“account for annual variability in factors outside the Companies’ control, in particular, weather impacts that can vary significantly on a year-to-year basis.”


“Honestly, I don’t know of a viable hypothesis for this increasing variability outside of climate change,” said Victoria Petryshyn, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Southern California, who grew up in Ohio.


In summer, systems are burdened by constant air-conditioning use during periods of extreme heat and humidity. In winter, frigid air masses resulting from disruptions to the jet stream can boost demand for heat and ​“cause extra strain on the grid if natural-gas lines freeze,” Petryshyn said.

“All the weather becomes supercharged,” Petryshyn said. ​“We can all expect stronger storms, stronger winds, and more frequent extreme weather that threatens grid stability.”


 Contributing to the problem?

FirstEnergy has a long history of obstructing measures that would both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate stress on the power grid.


In February 2024, the company abandoned its interim 2030 goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and said it would continue running two West Virginia coal plants. Before that, FirstEnergy backed plans to weaken Ohio’s energy-efficiency goals. And during the first Trump administration, the company urged the Department of Energy to use emergency powers to keep unprofitable coal and nuclear plants running.


FirstEnergy also spent roughly $60 million on efforts to get lawmakers to pass and protect House Bill 6, the law at the heart of Ohio’s largest utility corruption scandal. HB 6’s nuclear and coal bailouts have since been repealed, but the state’s clean-energy standards remain gutted.


Meanwhile, regulators have let FirstEnergy’s utilities charge customers millions of dollars for grid modernization, ​“which are supposed to support the utility’s ability to adapt and improve the electric grid to rigging challenges from climate change,” said Karin Nordstrom, a clean-energy attorney with the Ohio Environmental Council.


“However, FirstEnergy has not provided the same investment in energy-efficiency programs, which can help manage rising demand at lower cost than expensive capital investment,” Nordstrom said. FirstEnergy should fully exhaust those tools and customer-funded grid-modernization investments before regulators relax the company’s requirements, she added.


Limited transparency makes FirstEnergy’s plan even more problematic, according to Shay Banton, a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Earlier this year, Banton reported on grid disparities in FirstEnergy’s service territories that leave some areas more prone to outages.


“It feels too early for them to request leniency without proposing or implementing more comprehensive mitigations based on a detailed understanding of the root cause,” Banton said.


It’s also likely that FirstEnergy’s rate increase of nearly $76 million for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.’s roughly 745,000 customers, approved on Nov. 19, already accounts for some weather-related factors. This summer, spokesperson Hannah Catlett told Canary Media that ​“the Illuminating Co. service territory generally sees bigger storm impacts” than areas served by FirstEnergy’s other Ohio utilities.


“Our request to adjust the reliability standards is not a step back in our commitment,” Catlett told Canary Media this fall. ​“We are confident in the progress underway and remain focused on improving reliability through continued investment in the communities we are privileged to serve.”


But fundamentally, additional leeway for weather variation is unnecessary, said Ashley Brown, a former Ohio utility commissioner and former executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group. Averaging utility performance over several years — the way most regulators do as part of setting reliability standards — should already account for that.


“In fact, the standard should always be going up,” Brown added. ​“You should expect more productivity from the company.”

(Getty Images)My father was a brilliant communications professor who had a doctorate and earned tenure at the university where he taught. He wrote books that had been published and took many speaking engagements. He also served as a part-time pastor.
I would have never guessed that my dad would struggle with dementia because of his Parkinson’s disease. I watched my dad and his mind fade away. It was very distressing to me and my family. It’s very distressing to many families.
Dementia, along with memory loss and cognitive decline, affects millions in the United States. Many of them live in Kansas. Too many families are not prepared for this next stage and don’t know what to do. The other issue at play here is the high cost of assisted living and senior care. It’s almost like trying to purchase a high-cost apartment these days. Families are suffering.
My mom works part-time for Home Instead Senior Care. She does non-medical work and helps take care of seniors in their homes. My sister and I tease her by saying she is a senior taking care of seniors.
My mom’s clients love her. However, not everyone can afford services like in-home care. Home Instead does a fantastic job of looking after folks. To try to find care for a loved one is so difficult. It’s hard enough that the family member is struggling, but then to find affordable care is really a challenge.
To have a family member lose their former ability to think and process information is a harrowing experience. People struggle so much these days, and now there is so much dementia going on among the population. Families don’t know where to turn.
I felt as though part of me was gone when my dad’s mind started declining. It was difficult to communicate with him. He had been a brilliant thinker and teacher and now this? I turned to my faith for solace and comfort during those challenging times.
Families need to know they are not alone when a loved one is suffering with dementia, memory loss or cognitive decline. I know of men whose wives have died because of their dementia, and it has been quite a blow to their peace of mind. They had been power couples, and now they lost their true love. It’s simply tragic.
How can we help family members experiencing this grief with their loved one? How can we make sure that people who need help are taken care of by dedicated professionals? We need to reach out and check in on the family and take them a meal or ask how we can help. We need to help them know they are not alone.
There is comfort, there is solace. Let’s reach out and help those in need.

As the world slept, the U.S. dropped bombs in the middle of Caracas, captured a sleazy dictator and his wife, and declared that Washington would henceforth “run” Venezuela and appropriate its oil fields. 
From Mar-a-Largo, Donald Trump bragged on Saturday about the unprovoked warfare they launched unilaterally on a sovereign nation to commandeer it for ExxonMobil, Chevron, and other U.S. oil conglomerates.
All the shifting Trumpian justifications for lawlessly blowing up alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and ordering a large-scale military attack on Venezuela’s capital city to topple a “bad hombre” were simply cover for seizing the spoils of an oil-rich South American country. 
We have been dragged into another ill-defined, open-ended war on a ruse. Shades of Iraq, 2003. Back then the pretext was WMD’s or phantom Iraqi “weapons of war.” A “shock and awe” military campaign in Baghdad followed to overthrow another brutal dictator with another open-ended “nation-building” disaster that cost the U.S. dearly in blood and treasure. Over 4,400 U.S. soldiers died in the conflict with a price tag in the trillions. American troops are still there. But at least Halliburton, a massive U.S. oil service corporation, walked away with billions in profits.

It is déjà vu all over again in Venezuela, which has the world’s largest oil reserves. But there is one significant difference. 
In a grave abuse of power, (and defiance of the U.S. Constitution) Trump secretly took the U.S. to war on his own. Without congressional approval — or even knowledge. Without buy-in from the public. 
He acted without any checks or balances on his illegal use of military force to compel regime change, take Venezuelan oil and, as he repeatedly vowed, run the country indefinitely. 
He threatened sovereign nations in the region with similar action if they did not genuflect to him and insisted he was “not afraid to put boots on the ground.”  
Sorry, what?! Besides a power-hungry president on an empire-expansion kick in the Western Hemisphere and Big Oil on board for big dividends, exactly how are the interests of Main Street, America served by the Trump war on Venezuela? 
How has the U.S. military’s months-long buildup near Venezuela, bombing of Caracas and capture of Nicholas Maduro helped over 500,000 Ohioans whose health insurance premiums just went through the roof when ACA tax credits expired in 2025?
How do the billions of tax dollars spent on the U.S invasion/occupation of Venezuela alone, plus the hundreds of billions needed for long-term stabilization and reconstruction, and the estimated trillion for a decade of potentially protracted conflict/insurgency lower the cost of living in Ohio, increase the supply of affordable housing or bring down grocery bills? 
Not at all. 
How will running Venezuela fix Ohio’s shredded safety net decimated by Trump’s historic funding cuts to support systems like SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid, community health services, child welfare, and environmental programs? 
Not at all. 
How will a war of choice rescue overwhelmed food pantries in the state as more Ohioans lose benefits and go hungry? 
Not at all. 
“At a time when families here at home are struggling with rising costs, health care bills, and economic uncertainty, Americans should not be asked to take on the burden of governing another country,” said Ohio Democratic U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown, of Cleveland. 
Did “America First” Trump supporters vote for gratuitous U.S. military conquests in foreign countries at the expense of affordability, health care, and job creation? 
Not at all. 
As more learn that Venezuela is not, in fact, a major drug trafficker to the U.S. and that Trump pardoned a major drug trafficker to the U.S., the propaganda for going to war in South America may be a hard sell. 
Cincinnati Democrat Greg Landsman from Ohio’s 1st congressional district wants to know “what the threats were that could justify military action and putting Americans in harm’s way.”  
Other Democrats stressed the suffering of the Venezuelan people under Maduro did not give Trump the right to wage war on Caracas with no clear goals, explanation, or consent from Congress or the public. 
Most Republicans in the Ohio congressional delegation — save 7th District Rep. Max Miller — parroted the party line about Maduro being a bad guy who had to go for the good of Venezuela and America. 
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno hailed Trump, of course, for eliminating “a clear and present danger to our nation” despite evidence to the contrary. 
Only Miller noted, “History teaches that regime changes imposed from the outside rarely deliver peace, stability, or democracy. America’s role in the world is not to remake nations in our image.”
Scattered protests erupted in Ohio against Trump risking American blood for oil. 
Venezuela is chaotic and corrupt but not a demonstrated imminent security threat to the United States. 
I suspect protests may spread if Congress sits on its hands as Trump continues to issue direct warnings to Venezuela’s new leader and other heads of state in the hemisphere who get in his way as he eyes more territory to invade and pillage in our name. 
What do we get for his saber rattling and war-making besides a rerun of towering costs and grim casualties in a hot mess with no escape? We get Iraq 2.0 and a foreboding new year.

Coley, 51, thanked family members, friends and supporters, some of whom sported buttons with his name and picture on them. He also thanked the three other candidates who appeared Monday.
“I want to say thank you for allowing me to serve almost 12 years … among you pushing democratic principles throughout this county and throughout the great state of Maryland,” he said. “Let’s get to work.”

Coley, who started work this past summer as a deputy director in the county’s Department of the Environment, had two people speak on his behalf: Former Glenarden Mayor Obie Pinckney and County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D).
“I have to say all the candidates are well qualified, really good people. However, I’m here to support Derrick Coley,” Braveboy said. “As I look at it, he’s most ready to serve on day one.”
Once Gov. Wes Moore (D) receives Coley’s name, he has 15 days to appoint him to replace former Del. Jazz Lewis, whose resignation took effect Monday. Lewis stepped down to accept a job as a lobbyist for his alma mater, University of Maryland, College Park, and is leaving with just over a week to the start of the 20-26 General Assembly.
If chosen, Coley would work alongside fellow Democrats Dels. Tiffany Alston and Andrea Fletcher Harrison in the district that includes Fairmount Heights, Glenarden and Glenn Dale.

Ward ran for the District 24 seat in the 2018 primary election and came in fourth among 11 candidates vying for three seats in the District. She also came in fourth in the 2022 primary, when she trailed Alston by 101 votes.
“Service is not something I do seasonally. It is who I am,” said Ward, who is a community activist and founder and executive director of a nonprofit called Solid Foundation Inc.
According to the state Board of Elections calendar, the filing deadline is 9 p.m. Feb. 24.

The other two candidates Monday were Crystal Carpenter, chief operating officer at the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth based in Washington, D.C.; and Glenarden City Councilmember Cashenna Cross, who has also served as mayor. She works as a corporate planning officer with the National Security Agency based in Fort Meade.
The candidates were asked six questions each, such as how they would work with elected officials, community leaders and residents to build coalitions in the district.
Cross acknowledged society is in the digital age, but not everyone has access to modern technology.
“We send an email, and we think that’s enough,” he said. “But I’m from the old school, where we walk about and we meet and greet” people.
Carpenter said she’s already doing similar work such as serving as chair on the county’s Lynching Memorial Project.
“I’ve always ensured that our community came first,” she said. “We disagree sometimes, but I think coalition building is in my blood. It’s in my spirit. It’s what I do. Nothing’s going to change.”

Coley becomes the third person selected by the central committee to fill a vacant legislative seat in a little more than a month.
The committee convened Nov. 25 to choose Kevin Harris as a state senator to represent District 27, which includes portions of Prince George’s, Calvert and Charles counties. He replaced former Sen. Michael Jackson, now the State Police superintendent.
The committee convened more than a month later, on Dec. 30, to nominate Darrell Odom Sr. to serve as a state delegate in District 27A to replace Harris. Because that district also serves a portion of Charles County, however, the Democratic central committee there also has a say.
Charles County Democrats went in a different direction Saturday, choosing Yonelle Moore Lee, chair of the Charles County Board of Education.
Both Moore Lee and Odom will be sent to the governor, who will have to decide which person to choose as the next District 27A delegate.

Southern California Edison received 1,500 applications for its Eaton fire compensation program and only paid out 82 after close to two months.


After just over two months, Southern California Edison has drawn more than 1,800 customers to a compensation program meant to settle scores of lawsuits against the company over the deadly Eaton Fire. As of Monday, the company has made offers to 82 of those who applied,  Pedro Pizarro, CEO of Edison’s parent company Edison International, told CalMatters.
Fire survivors, who have been providing feedback to Edison since before it launched the settlement program  still have strong criticisms of the utility’s compensation effort, called the “Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program.” They complain that it requires participants to forego lawsuits against the company and blocks them from seeking further compensation for fire-related health claims. Many said the program’s payment caps, which limit the amount claimants can receive, were too low and enable Edison to pay less than the utility might otherwise owe should it be found responsible for the fire.  
The Eaton fire burned 14,000 acres of Los Angeles County in January and killed 19. While the official cause has not yet been determined, a leading theory is that Edison’s equipment sparked the blaze. The U.S. Department of Justice is among those who have blamed the utility for the fire.
Insurance money and personal savings are running out for people who lost homes, livelihoods and loved ones in the fire, they and their advocates say. Many are unhoused or facing housing insecurity. One survey estimated 80% of Altadena residents were still displaced by the fire as of October. The Eaton Fire Survivors Network, a prominent grassroots organization, called on Edison to provide up to $200,000 per displaced household “based on verified costs” to help cover housing costs.
“It’s Edison’s responsibility to solve all of this,” Joy Chen, executive director of the group, said. “It’s their fire.”
About $7.6 billion in insurance claims related to the Eaton Fire were paid out as of November, according to the California Department of Insurance, the most recent figures available. About 90% of the payout was for residential property.
Edison offered a collective total of $34.4 million to settle the 82 claims, and none of the offers were declined, it said.
About half of the claims that received an offer from Edison as of December, Pizarro said, were for total losses, and about half were related to smoke and ash damage. While he did not provide specific numbers, Pizarro said that the claims were spread across geography, income levels and home values. Many of those that have been made offers are part of the program’s fast-track option.
At a Dec. 16 press conference held by the survivors network, displaced residents spoke about how unstable housing and the loss of their homes has affected their lives. Gabriel Gonzalez, a plumbing company owner, lost his home, business and about $80,000 worth of tools in the fire. He lived out of his car for an extended period before receiving a small amount of financial assistance that helped him stay in a rental for a few months. But that money is expected to run out this month.
“As of the first of January, I’ll probably be back in my car,” he said at the event.
Pizarro told CalMatters that Edison will not be providing money to residents for housing outside of its compensation program, citing the need to validate expenses. The survivors network request for housing cost assistance was limited to verifiable costs. 
One criticism of the program was that children do not receive the same compensation as adults. Under the current version of the program, children receive between 50% and 65% of the compensation adults receive for a loss of their residency, depending on the damage category. If their primary home that they live in was destroyed, adults would get $115,000 and children would receive $75,000. These rates are slightly higher than a draft version of the plan Edison released in the fall.
An open letter at the time from the Eaton Fire Survivor’s Network said giving children less than an equal valuation to adults “treats their suffering as lesser when it is, in reality, greater.”
Pizarro said Edison went with a lower valuation because children often don’t receive as much as adults do under similar programs and adults “end up bearing more responsibility and more cost” for the household and “arrangements for the children.”
“The reality is that adults carry much more burden here,” he said, “and so it’s fair that they, you know, that we have more compensation targeted at the adults.” 
Another frustration those affected by the fire expressed was the requirement that participants waive their right to sue the company. Legal representatives of fire survivors who are suing the company cautioned that the settlement program through Edison could short people of any damages and suffering compensation a court might award, as well as potential long term health care compensation or monitoring. 
“We are approaching this as a way to settle litigation,” Pizarro said. “It is a form of legal settlement, and legal settlements are typically settlements of all matters, otherwise they’re not really, you know, they’re not really a conclusion to litigation.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_28.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184

Jose Angel Amezcua
Jose Angel Amezcua is a formerly  incarcerated firefighter from Salinas


On a cold January day at our fire camp in Northern California, I learned my crew was being sent south. On the bus, I kept wondering why they would need our help with a fire in the winter. 
As we got closer, I saw towering black smoke rising miles into the sky and spreading across the horizon. 
For the next three weeks, I was one of hundreds of incarcerated firefighters who helped battle and contain the deadly LA fires. During the blazes, I moved through ash-covered Eaton Canyon, creating fire breaks, hauling sandbags to prevent mudslides and clearing fallen trees and debris in Altadena. 
Before then, I had only fought wildland fires. I had never seen such devastation in a city. In  neighborhoods I saw homes and structures reduced to rubble and people trying to salvage whatever they could. It was heartbreaking to witness the destruction.
But it was also a stark reminder that I was right where I was supposed to be — helping to save the communities I had once harmed.
Early in my incarceration I knew I had to better myself, so I attended as many classes and groups as I could. Then the opportunity came to join a fire camp, which would allow me to leave the prison and spend time outside. I joined knowing I could earn time off my sentence — but what I gained was so much more.
I joined the Youth Offender Fire Camp Program at Growlersburg, a pilot program launched in 2023 that allowed young people under 26 to train as wildland firefighters, instead of being held in a high-security prison. At Growlersburg, I noticed a big difference from my time in prison: we had better food, better living arrangements and we got to be outside in the woods. 
The Cal Fire Captains treated us like equals. I trained as a handcrew firefighter, creating firelines to contain wildfires and clearing vegetation with hand tools. Then I started to fight fires.

Nothing can mentally prepare you for being on a fire line. You feel the adrenaline, and it pushes you to your limits. Fighting a fire means working 24-hour shifts, sometimes climbing mountains in the dark, using heavy tools to create a fire line. 
I didn’t realize our impact until, in a stereotypical moment, we helped a woman find her cat during a wildfire. That showed me the difference our work made in helping someone during their darkest moments.
Over time, I became a sawyer, someone who cuts down trees with a chainsaw. I began to enjoy the work and imagined a different future as I watched my crew members get released and become firefighters with Cal Fire’s support.
During the LA fires, the Rose Bowl became our base camp, where we were greeted with gratitude from elected officials, celebrities and community members. For the first time, we realized that people wanted to hear our stories, that the world saw us as more than our past mistakes. 
It was an incredible feeling to know our hard work mattered and that others believed we were deserving of a second chance.
At firecamp, the rehabilitation and reentry preparation classes I took with the Anti-Recidivism Coalition helped me get ready to come home and prepare for my next journey.  Fire camp reduced my 10-year sentence to 5½ years, and I came home from prison a few months ago. 
Since then I’ve been cherishing every moment with my family and my wife. Life on the outside is harder than I expected, but fire camp prepared me for the mental challenges of rebuilding my life. It taught me to push forward, no matter what.I had never held a job before. I came to prison at a young age. I never believed in my future. Now, becoming a firefighter is my calling. I’m working to expunge my record so I can keep saving lives and stopping fires from spreading.When people think of incarcerated people, they often see us as a danger, with our past mistakes magnified. Amid the smoke, ash, and destruction of the LA fires, people saw us as heroes, recognizing the good we could achieve when given a second chance. 
It’s been one year since the fires. California has raised wages for incarcerated firefighters and made the Growlersburg Fire Camp program permanent. During the LA fires, the attention to our stories showed that people want to see second chances given not just to firefighters, but to all incarcerated people working to turn their lives around.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/012225_Incarcerated-Firefighter_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,AI is stunting critical thinking,Robert T.F. Downes,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/ai-is-stunting-critical-thinking/,We can either defend the habits of mind a robust democracy requires or preside over the automation of thinking and the training of automations.,"“Just use ChatGPT.”  
 That’s the whisper in lecture halls, the temptation in browser tabs, and the callow counsel passed among today’s undergraduates as though it were an indispensable life hack, or even a godsend.   
More and more, large language models (LLMs) are becoming the silent co-authors behind too many “perfectly fine” paragraphs that look fluent and polished on the surface but are weightless, insipid, and shallow in substance. Put differently, generative AI capabilities tempt students to stop thinking after the initial prompt, producing vapid prose that sounds like thought while saying almost nothing at all.  
This view shouldn’t be read as alarmism. It’s prudence. Nor does it fall into the trap of personifying AI, as if the machine itself had motives or malice. It is simply an acknowledgment and description of consequences now plain to anyone who reads students’ written work for a living. When we outsource the agency of young learners, whose central task is curiosity and growth in an educational environment, rather than meeting workplace productivity quotas, we also outsource the formation of the mind.
 LLMs are undeniably useful. Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are accessible, fast, and relatively frictionless, handling tasks like summarization, translation, outlining, practice-question generation, and troubleshooting with ease. In the right place, they offer a real utility. But they ought not gain a strong foothold in pedagogy, for a tool’s value depends on what it displaces. When it displaces the very work education is meant to train — attention, judgment, synthesis, revision, and the willingness to sit with uncertainty — it doesn’t help at all. It hollows.  
 Educators don’t get to be neutral about that, especially those of us who insist that education is not simply a product, but a public good. In our classrooms, we can either defend the habits of mind a robust democracy requires or preside over the automation of thinking and the training of automations.  
 The reckoning has already begun. In a    Washington Post    article   published on December 12, 2025, professors explain how they are returning to oral and in-class, hand-written exams because take-home assessments have become so easy to counterfeit with generative AI. One professor quoted in the    Washington Post    article tells students that using AI to do the intellectual lifting is like “bringing a forklift to the gym when your goal is to build muscle.” She describes the classroom as a “gymnasium” and wants students “to lift the weights” themselves. Assessments conducted in live settings force students to own their understanding of course material, explain claims and concepts in their own words, and make their own connections, without a hidden prompt smoothing over gaps in comprehension.  
 The gymnasium metaphor deserves to stick, because it names the real danger of AI-in-education: i.e., not wrong answers, but atrophied faculties. You can still “lift the weight” with a forklift. You just won’t get stronger. And the more we, as educators, normalize the forklift, the more we quietly redefine the purpose of schooling, shifting the focus from cultivating the quality of creativity and critical thinking to producing quantifiable outputs that never probe beyond the superficial. Worse yet, our inaction will train students into a kind of learned helplessness: if the forklift is ever unavailable — offline, paywalled, restricted, or simply wrong — many will discover they no longer know how to lift at all.  
 Research is beginning to validate what teachers have been sensing. A    Microsoft Research study    published in April 2025 surveyed 319 “knowledge workers.” It reported that higher confidence in generative AI (as opposed to higher self-confidence) is associated with reduced critical-thinking effort, with people dropping the cognitive work of discovery and synthesis to supervise and verify an LLM’s output.   
 This finding does not constitute a moral indictment against those who use AI tools and benefit from productivity boosts. However, one must understand that efficiency is not the same thing as education. A polished paragraph is not the same thing as a formed mind.  
 There’s another loss we should put plainly out in the open: the detriment to the craft of writing itself. Students already tend to treat revising as a tedious task — something that “takes time” rather than something that clarifies thought and strengthens reasoned argumentation. This is a detriment precisely because drafting, editing, and rewriting are not simply cosmetic steps at window dressing the real work of jotting down one’s ideas. They    are    the real work.   
 We write to find out what we think. We revise to discover what our claims can actually bear. The sentence you cut, the transition you refine, the example you sharpen — none of these are mere ornaments on good writing. They are the mind training itself through reflection. A tool that promises to eliminate revision might save time and labor, but at what cost? For students, it can short-circuit the organic process by which ideas become arguments, and arguments become convictions disciplined by evidence.  
 Creativity is vulnerable, too, in a subtler way. The promise is that AI will “supercharge” imagination. The cost is that it can standardize it. A    paper    published this year in the peer-reviewed scientific journal    Nature Human Behaviour    reports that ChatGPT-assisted brainstorming tends to reduce idea diversity across groups — narrowing and homogenizing the range of available sources and solutions, even when individual outputs appear clever. Similarly, a    Science Advances    study    published last year found that generative AI can be useful for “creative writing,” while still making the overall pool of stories more similar. In other words, outputs are better-looking but less novel. This screams    inauthentic   .   
 The danger isn’t that students will stop producing. It’s that they’ll sow their various seeds of thought into a terrain only capable of producing rearrangements of the same thing, mistaking fluency for originality and coherence for creativity and understanding.  
 So yes: returning to tried-and-true methods is one option. In-class writing. Oral exams. Live defense. Not because we long for grading blue book exams, but because we’re serious about the mission and purpose of education.  
 However, educators shouldn’t respond by fortifying the old walls alone. We should also build smarter, more innovative classrooms that encourage students to interact with one another and actively grapple with the objects of knowledge before them.  
 This is especially urgent for those of us in political science, history, philosophy, and humanities departments, for we are explicitly charged with the duty of forming responsible, inquisitive, and informed citizens.   
 Our aim is not only for students to recite civics. It’s that they can appreciate and practice it. They should leave our courses with the ability to weigh evidence, interpret institutions, argue in good faith, and reach compromise, while concomitantly recognizing trade-offs, resisting manipulation, and revising their views with a budding sense of intellectual maturity.    Democracies    do not fail only because people lack information. They fail because people lose the habits of thought that underlie deliberation and informed consent.  
 That’s why, when designing my undergraduate Introduction to American Government course, I’ve opted to replace the midterm and final exams with a moot court and a mock Congress. The pedagogical aim of these exercises is active learning and interactive immersion. It moves students from rote memorization and recitation to collectively inhabiting the process and stakes of governance. For instance, in the mock Congress, students will certainly learn how a bill becomes a law, for we need a common vocabulary to conduct the exercise in the first place. The idea is that they will then apply what they have learned from our readings, not on paper but through first-hand experience with agenda-setting, coalition-building, bargaining, and the hard calculus of compromise.  
 This functions like an oral exam with an interactive twist that transforms the classroom into an animated learning community. It makes thinking public, accountable, and alive. Students cannot prompt their way through discussion or automate their intellectual courage.  
 The classroom should be one of the few places where students are expected to try, experiment, take intellectual risks, and fail with low stakes. These are all elements of personal and intellectual growth. When AI becomes the ever-present escape hatch, students lose permission to participate in this process. They stop drafting and start generating. They stop thinking and start submitting.  
 So here’s the call, educators. Fight back! Neither panic nor resignation will take us far. But thoughtful, creative design can. Bring back assessments that make thinking visible and accountable. Create assignments that involve trial and error and demand spontaneity. Defend the classroom as a civic workshop, a space where minds are trained for free inquiry rather than optimized for productivity.  
 If we don’t protect critical thinking now, we won’t merely see worse essays. We’ll see a weaker, incurious citizenry.

For attention and power, President Trump’s political campaigns and propaganda have been punctuated with repeated, frightening lies about immigrants, calling them rapists, terrorists, invaders, and murderers.  He falsely claimed they were replacing American workers, stealing their benefits, voting for Democrats, and even eating their neighbors’ dogs.
Responsible journalists have documented and analyzed his record as a serial liar.  The Washington Post documented 30,573 false or misleading claims during his first presidential term, an average of 21 per day.   The Los Angeles Times said during his first Presidential campaign that “Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has. 
Historian Douglas Brinkley stated that U.S. presidents have occasionally “lied or misled the country,” but none were a “serial liar” like Trump. And New York University’s professor of psychology Donnel Stern, said, Trump “lies as a policy,” and “will say anything” to satisfy his supporters or himself.  Stern, Donnel (May 9, 2019). “Constructivism in the Age of Trump: Truth, Lies, and Knowing the Difference.” 
Trump illustrated Stern’s assessment when the president instructed his former press secretary Stephanie Grisham, “As long as you keep repeating something, it doesn’t matter what you say.” To this end, Trump continues to claim falsely that the 2020 election had been rigged and that he never lost.
And though Trump’s supporters know that the president likes to cry “Wolf,” they’ve excused his lies the way adults may indulge those of a child.
As in Aesop’s fable, the good neighbors’ tolerance for these lies eventually runs out, and it seems Trump’s supporters, too, may have reached the end of their tolerance for his manipulating lies.
That’s because in this case, the wolf has arrived at the doors of the American public.  It has crept up on them in the form of rising inflation, grocery prices, housing costs, insurance rates, and the national debt.  It has pounced in the form of tariffs that Trump falsely promised would be paid by foreign countries but have come at the expense of American businesses and consumers.  This wolf has clawed at the social safety net, cut food stamps, and slashed Medicaid.  It has skulked into American towns and cities in the form of masked ICE agents who racially profile, terrorize, arrest, and deport their neighbors without due process of the law.  It has raided the Department of Education and left it a hollow shell.
And now just when Trump’s long-term supporters need the president to come running to their aid for a change, he has preposterously denied the wolf’s presence.  “We have no inflation,” the president declared in his nationally televised “60 Minutes” interview.  “Our groceries are down,” he lied.  According to the president, the economic wolf is a “hoax.”
Further, the president similarly has denied the wolf at the door of our allies.  After telling the monumental lie that he would end the war in Ukraine during his first 24 hours in office, the American President has instead reduced support for the victim of the Russian wolf’s attack that has killed the Ukrainian people, ravaged their lands, destroyed their infrastructure, kidnapped their children, and threatened the future of a democratic Europe. Perversely, Trump has instead secretly conspired with the Russian wolf to make future business deals with America, and to force Ukraine’s permanent subservience to the predator.
In other words, in an ironic twist to Aesop’s fable, the wolf now threatens the flock of the shepherd boy’s good neighbors. But instead of the shepherd boy shouting a warning and coming to their aid, he not only denies the wolf’s presence, but he colludes with the predator at the expense and peril of its innocent victims.
But now the American public has had enough.  The President’s favorability poll numbers have sunk, even within his own political party, and Democrats recently swept November elections.
Consequently, for the first time in his political life, Trump has indirectly admitted the truth, (of course for his own political survival.) He’s bailed out farmers hurt by his tariffs with taxpayers’ money.  He’s cut tariffs on some goods, like beef, coffee, tomatoes, and bananas, which amount to an admission of his lies about inflation, grocery prices, and the failure of his tariff policy.  
His consideration of extending Obamacare subsidies admits to the high cost of healthcare that threatens to economically devour his constituents.  He’s rehiring lawyers at the Department of Education to handle the backlog of discrimination complaints.  Perhaps most importantly, he has been forced to face the truth that nobody, including his supporters, believes anything he says.

April McClain Delaney (D-6th) said Monday that House Democrats “must imminently consider impeachment proceedings” against President Donald Trump for the unauthorized raid in Venezuela and his claim that the U.S. would “run” the county for the timebeing.
“This move follows a year in which he has illegally dismantled federal agencies, conducted cruel immigration raids against our neighbors – including American citizens – instigated an unlawful trade war, called for the execution of sitting Members of Congress, and now is escalating international tensions even further with military threats against Colombia and Greenland,” McClain Delaney said in a statement released by her office.
“These individual actions are impeachable offenses in their own right, but their ever mounting cumulative impact on our country’s stability and health puts everything in a new light. I now believe that our Democratic Caucus must imminently consider impeachment proceedings,” her statement said.
It’s a slight step forward for McClain Delaney, who said on her campaign’s X account Saturday that the invasion of Venezuela was an impeachable offense, but that, “Whether it makes sense to pursue impeachment as the best strategy to end this lawlessness is a tactical judgment that our Caucus needs to seriously deliberate.”
McClain Delaney’s statement comes as she faces a challenge from David Trone, the millionaire who held the 6th District seat before her. In announcing his bid for the seat last month, Trone made criticism of Trump the main pitch, saying while in the House he “confronted him [Trump] head-on — voting twice to impeach him and backing reforms to rein in his abuse of power. McClain Delaney responded by saying she has and would “continue to take on Trump’s assault on our government workers, defend our diverse community, protect choice and women’s reproductive rights, and work against inflation-creating tariffs.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The House tried to impeach Trump before, of course, twice sending articles of impeachment to the Senate, which refused to convict him both times. And that was when Democrats controlled the House and, for at least one of those votes, the Senate. With both chambers now in Republican hands, odds of an impeachment are shakier.
McClain Delaney may be the latest Democrat to call for impeachment, but she’s not the first: Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) and Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) filed impeachment motions in April and May, respectively — which Green followed with additional impeachment motions in June and December.
Wilkins passes torch
You can be chair of a committee, and you can be chair of a caucus, but apparently you can’t be both.
Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who will become chair of the House Ways and Means Committee when the General Assembly convenes next week, announced that because of that responsibility she will step down as chair of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland later this month. She has been caucus chair since December 2022, when she succeeded former Del. Darryl Barnes.
“From the outset of her leadership, Chair Wilkins brought a vision that was both expansive and grounded, strengthening the Caucus internally while elevating its stature within the General Assembly and across the state,” according to a statement from the caucus Monday.
Through three legislative sessions with Wilkins as chair, the caucus got more than three dozen bills signed into law, including bills creating a correctional ombudsman to assess Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services programs, allowing those incarcerated a second chance at release and expanding the authority of the state’s current Prescription Drug Affordability Board.

The Black Caucus made history in July 2024 when it convened its first-ever meeting in Harford County that was called by Del. Andre V. Johnson Jr. (D-Harford), the first state Black lawmaker from that county. The caucus also led a discussion last year on contested circuit court races, which some members supported and others did not. The measure was eventually tucked away, at least for now.
The caucus also endured some tough battles, such as the shock of Gov. Wes Moore (D), the first Black governor of Maryland, vetoing a bill in May to create a statewide Reparations Commission.
The legislature overrode that veto in a special session last month. That clears the way for a 23-member commission that will study the possibility of reparations in light of  specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction to Jim Crow eras, and examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from policies that led to discrimination. The commission is also charged with recommending appropriate reparations, from a statement of apology to monetary compensation or social service assistance.
Peña-Melnyk brings back Mizeur
Incoming House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) announced late Monday that she is bringing on former Del. Heather Mizeur as her communications director, along with a number of additional committee appointments.
Mizeur, a Democrat, represented Montgomery County in the House from 2007 to 2015, when she ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for governor. She moved to her Eastern Shore farm where she hosted a podcast that featured guests ranging from Democratic former Sen. Barbara Mikulski to then-Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, before running unsuccessfully against Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) in 2022.
Peña-Melnyk said she is bringing Mizeur on for her focus “on disrupting division and bridging the differences that fuel polarization in politics, She believes democracy is not sustained by rhetoric alone, but through daily acts of faith in one another—expressed in how leaders listen, speak, and show up in moments of challenge.”

“She brings unique skills to our communications team that will help humanize public leadership, lower the temperature of public discourse, and ensure our work reflects clarity, restraint, dignity, and truth,” said Peña-Melnyk, who was elected to the House in the same class as Mizeur. “At a time when trust in democratic institutions is fragile, how leaders communicate matters profoundly.”
Peña-Melnyk also announced the creation of a House Study Group on Economic Stability, which will evaluate policies and programs aimed at reducing poverty and improving economic stability, with a particular focus on “the needs of working families who earn too much to qualify for assistance programs but lack a meaningful safety net,” according to a release from her office.
The 12-member committee will be co-chaired by Dels. Robbyn Lewis (D-Baltimore City) and Lily Qi (D-Montgomery).
Peña-Melnyk also named the members of a new rural caucus, to be co-chaired by Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-Upper Shore) and Del. Natalie Ziegler (D-Howard and Montgomery, that will be charged with bringing concerns of the Eastern Shore, Western Maryland and Southern Maryland to the table in Annapolis, she said.

(Annie Knox, Utah News Dispatch)For members of Utah’s Venezuelan community who have long hoped to see the country’s socialist government brought down, Patricia Quiñonez described the United States’ capture of President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend as having a “bittersweet taste.” 
“More than 25 years fighting for the return of democracy, to defeat the dictatorship, and it happens under a foreign military intervention,” Quiñonez, who runs Utahzolanos, a social media outlet and community, said Monday.

“We are deeply grateful that the United States is supporting us in the fight for freedom and that Maduro and his wife are now imprisoned, but the weight of uncertainty overwhelms us, preventing us from celebrating as we would like,” Quiñonez told Utah News Dispatch. 
Now the community is left to wonder what will happen to its members seeking asylum in the U.S., she said, and what will become of the South American nation, its government, economy, and oil reserves. 
That the capture of Maduro occurred without notice or approval from Congress troubled about 50 protesters who gathered Monday in downtown Salt Lake City, chanting “No blood for oil” and echoing similar demonstrations across the nation.  
“It really is shocking, and it can’t shock us into silence. It has to shock us into action,” Sarah Buck, a protest organizer with Salt Lake Indivis
ible, told the group outside the Wallace F. Bennett Federal Building. 
The group urged Utah Sens. Mike Lee and John Curtis to vote in favor of legislation before the U.S. Senate that would block further military intervention without congressional authorization.

Outside the senators’ offices in Salt Lake City, demonstrator Kathy Van Dame, of Murray, held a sign that said “No war for oil.” 
“I’m afraid we’ll wind up with something that’s like Afghanistan and Iraq,” Van Dame said. She added that her mind was on her own relatives serving in the U.S. military. 
“It upsets the international rule of law,” Van Dame said of the strike. “It goes along with Putin and Xi’s idea of the new world order, that might makes right.”
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox shared a social media post Monday from Vice President JD Vance, in which Vance defended the strike and said “The United States, thanks to President Trump’s leadership, is a great power again. Everyone should take note.” 
“This is exactly right,” Cox said on the social media site X. “I’m grateful to @POTUS for taking decisive action to confront narco-terrorism and hold bad actors accountable, including in Venezuela.”

Wes Moore (D). It's the first time Moore and AFSCME have missed the Dec. 31 deadline to reach agreement on annual salary increases.","Gov. Wes Moore spoke to a gathering of state workers represented by AFSCME at a Sept. 9, 2025 event at the University of Maryland, College Park. (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The largest union in state government said it has rejected a contract proposal offered by Gov. Wes Moore.
The announcement came hours before Moore, a Democrat, announced reaching an agreement with unions representing six other groups of state employees. The failure to reach an agreement with AFSCME Council 3 represents the first time Moore’s administration has missed the annual Dec. 31 deadline to reach agreement on annual salary increases.
“AFSCME Maryland Bargaining Team members did not accept Governor Moore’s proposal that continues to lag behind the rate of inflation and understaff state services,” the union said in a statement. “Throughout bargaining, the administration had offered wage increases that did not keep up with inflation and failed to fully correct the AFSCME wage scales that lag behind a majority of state employees.”
Over the last several months, the union has taken to social media to highlight the state of contract negotiations and urge members to pressure the governor by contacting his office. The union represents about 50,000 workers statewide with more than half of those working in state government positions.
Two days before Christmas, the union ramped up pressure and unveiled a series of unfair labor practice complaints it had filed against the administration.
A spokesperson for the governor said at the time that Moore “has consistently stood up for Maryland’s workers, making clear that supporting labor and protecting our workforce are central to this administration’s work.”
Maryland union files unfair labor practice claims against the state

But Moore also faces another difficult budget year.
Last year, Moore and the legislature raised $1.6 billion in taxes to close a projected $3.3 billion structural budget gap. The solution was meant to fill that hole and offer a $300 million cushion for the coming year — a brief election year respite before having to face crushing deficits driven by required spending on K-12 education.
Another component of that effort was a buyout program. More than 300 employees took a payout to leave their jobs. In all, the state eliminated more than 500 positions including 170 that were vacant.
But last fall Moore and lawmakers were told those efforts fell short. The state again faces a $1.5 billion budget gap in the coming fiscal year.
A legislative panel is recommending that Moore hold the line on hiring except in critical positions. Such a recommendation adds another hurdle to Moore’s promise to rebuild state government.
On Monday, Moore’s office said it reached agreements with six other labor unions. The agreements include a 2% on average pay increase for more than 11,000 state employees, according to a statement issued by Moore’s office, which said the raises will cost roughly $37 million.
“These economic agreements represent an important step and are the result of months-long good-faith negotiations, reflecting a shared commitment between the State and its labor partners,” Moore said in a statement. “Our goal has always been to balance fair compensation with fiscal discipline. At a time when families and governments are both facing real financial pressures, the State of Maryland is continuing to prioritize the employees who work in service of Marylanders every day.”
The state negotiates annually with various unions on salary increase for the coming year. The deadline for such agreements in Dec. 31.
The statement said Moore “remains committed to reaching agreements with all employee organizations and looks forward to continuing discussions in the spirit of collaboration and transparency.”

The unions agreeing to contract terms were the American Federation of Teachers — Healthcare, the American Federation of Teachers — Maryland School for the Deaf, the Fraternal Order of Police for Maryland Transporation Authority officers, the International Association of Fire Fighters for firefighters at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, the Maryland Professional Employees Council and the State Law Enforcement Officers Labor Alliance.
AFSCME, however, was unsatisfied with Moore’s offer.
The union said in a statement it wanted raises that kept pace with the rate of inflation, provided additional pay increases on top of the cost-of-living offerings, and offered more job security for state employees.
In a statement, the union said it offered Moore “proposals that raise revenues, curtail wasteful spending and procurements, as well as combine duplicative programs that would generate millions in savings. Despite these efforts, the Governor has not embraced these suggestions.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_2115-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-05 22:11:44.188103
,New Jersey Monitor,2026-01-06 01:59:16+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,NJ panel advances bills aimed at shielding immigrants from federal agents,Sophie Nieto-Munoz,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2026/01/05/nj-bills-immigrants-federal-agents/,One of the bills would codify a 2018 state order that restricts when local law enforcement can help federal immigration agents.,"Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Ellen Park said the legislation is “about the future of New Jersey.” (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A group of Assembly lawmakers advanced a trio of bills Monday afternoon intended to protect New Jersey immigrants from federal immigration enforcement.
The broadest bill the Assembly Judiciary Committee approved would codify the 2018 Immigrant Trust Directive, an order from the Attorney General’s Office that restricts when state, county, and local law enforcement can aid federal immigration authorities. Immigrant advocates have urged lawmakers to codify the directive, noting that it could be withdrawn unilaterally by a future attorney general.
“This is about the future of New Jersey, not just America,” said Assemblywoman Ellen Park, a Bergen County Democrat whose voice broke as she cast her vote in support.
All three bills passed in a party-line vote, with the committee’s two Republicans voting no.
The bills were introduced last week, in the waning days of the current legislative session. The next session begins on Jan. 13.

In a statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson cited the story of an undocumented man accused of killing a mother and her 11-year-old daughter in a drunken driving crash in Lakewood last year. The Trump administration has used the story before to target New Jersey’s practice of restricting when local law enforcement can aid federal immigration agents.


“This tragedy is far from the only example of illegal aliens killing innocent bystanders. The New Jersey legislature should focus on protecting law-abiding citizens, not the criminal aliens who kill them,” Jackson said.

The hearing for the much-anticipated legislation was moved to a larger room in the Trenton Statehouse to accommodate the hundreds of people in attendance. Some people watched from two separate rooms, and legislative staff had to print more slips because of the number of people who wanted to testify.
Immigrant advocates and local activists who spoke during the three-hour hearing said New Jersey’s immigrant communities are plagued with fear because of President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation effort. The legislation would make New Jerseyans feel safer, they said, because it would allow them to report crimes to police without fearing they themselves would end up charged with immigration-related crimes.
“When your child’s classmate is struggling with their friend who has a missing parent, when people are too scared to report a crime or seek assistance, when a teacher finds empty seats in their classroom, or when grocery stores and restaurants find that foot traffic has gone down, when health care professionals see fewer people coming in for preventative care — all of those are impacts on all of us,” said Ami Kachalia of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.

The bill’s provisions would:

Prohibit law enforcement officers from engaging in “racially influenced policing,” including stopping someone based on their actual or suspected citizenship status and asking someone’s immigration status unless relevant to an investigation.
Bar state, county, and local police from assisting in federal civil immigration enforcement.
Require law enforcement agencies to create procedures to address certain visa certification requests from potential victims of crime or human trafficking, and post those procedures on their websites.
Mandate that prosecutors inform criminal defendants of immigration consequences.
Require law enforcement agencies to annually report their interactions with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to be published on the state Attorney General Office’s website.

Amy Torres, head of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, noted that the directive has been in place for nearly a decade. Under the directive, people have felt free to report their landlords for not turning on the heat, report their employers for wage theft, or come forward as the victims of crime without fearing they would get arrested by federal immigration agents.
Monmouth County Prosecutor Raymond Santiago said that since the shift in immigration enforcement over the past year, there has been less cooperation from victims and witnesses over fear of retaliation. Years of increased trust from some communities has “evaporated” because of ICE activity in neighborhoods, Santiago said.

Francesca Chabla, an immigration attorney with immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New Jersey, said she’s received countless calls from clients who are unsure whether they should enroll their children for free and reduced lunch programs out of fear that they could be targeted. Many residents don’t know who to trust, she said.
Chabla said the package of bills would provide clarity not only for residents, but for immigration attorneys who can “confidently tell the community members that they can safely access health care, schools, and food pantries” without fear of losing their due process rights.
States like California, Illinois, and Washington have passed similar legislation, Kachalia noted.
One of the other bills advanced Monday would require the attorney general to develop policies for so-called sensitive locations that would be barred from assisting or participating in federal civil law enforcement, and it would prohibit enforcement on their premises. The locations include health care facilities, public schools, and domestic violence shelters, among other places.
The third bill would bar government entities and health care facilities from requesting or collecting certain information from residents unless “strictly necessary” to assess eligibility for the requested public service. The information would include a person’s immigration status, place of birth, social security number, and individual taxpayer identification number.
For more than a year, Park and some of her Democratic colleagues have pushed for passage of a separate bill, called the Immigrant Trust Act, that includes provisions from the three bills advanced Monday. The older bill has languished, and Park said it was easier to get support by breaking the bill into three parts. She sponsored two of the three bills advanced Monday.
“I think if we were to put this all in one bill, it would’ve been too much to kind of comprehend and digest … so I think it was just better formatted for three pieces of legislation,” she said.
The Republicans on the committee — Assemblywoman Vicky Flynn (R-Monmouth) and Assemblyman Bob Auth (R-Bergen) — questioned whether the bills would withstand legal scrutiny. Auth read aloud a description of the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, which bars states from regulating the federal government’s actions.
Auth asked a housing attorney who said she represents tenants who are scared of reporting bad landlords what the “genesis of that fear is.”
“What is it? What’s causing the fear? If you’re here as a citizen, you go to court, you get equal justice, right? If you’re here as a resident alien and you go to court, you get equal justice, right? So what is the problem?” Auth asked her.

Karen Bennett of Stone Mountain resigned effective Jan. 1, and Monday was the last day for Rep. Lynn Heffner of Augusta. The House and Senate are set to gavel in Monday for a legislative session set to last through early spring.","Former Rep. Karen Bennett of Stone Mountain has been charged with allegedly taking advantage of a program meant for people who lost their jobs because of the pandemic. Official Georgia House of Representatives photoA Democratic state lawmaker resigned her seat days before she was charged with fraudulently receiving nearly $14,000 in unemployment benefits intended for people who lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Former Rep. Karen Bennett of Stone Mountain became the second Georgia House Democrat accused of illegally exploiting the program after Covington Rep. Sharon Henderson was arrested and charged on similar grounds last month.
Bennett holds a doctorate in physical therapy and the allegations center around her company called Metro Therapy Providers.
According to a charging document from the U.S. District Court in Atlanta, in May 2020, Bennett applied for federal pandemic relief funds listing two employers, the state General Assembly and Metro Therapy.
According to the document, Bennett stated in her application for pandemic unemployment relief that her job included providing in-home physical therapy services and that she was unable to perform her job because of pandemic guidelines. Prosecutors say those were lies.
“Before the pandemic her actual role with Metro Therapy was an administrative one and she worked from her home office; she did not provide in-home services for clients,” the charging document reads. “She was not prohibited from reaching her home office because of the pandemic. She was able to continue working as usual from her home to support Metro Therapy throughout the pandemic, and the therapists who provided actual services to clients were able to continue their work after a brief disruption.”
Bennett faces one count of making false statements in connection with the benefits.
Prosecutors also allege Bennett did not disclose that she had separate employment through a church, which paid her $905 each week she was claiming pandemic benefits.
According to court documents, Bennett pleaded not guilty and was released on $10,000 bond. She did not immediately respond to a call and email seeking comment Monday evening.
In a resignation letter to Gov. Brian Kemp, Bennett, who was first elected in 2012, did not give a reason for her departure.
“I am proud of the work accomplished by the Georgia General Assembly when we came together to advance policies that strengthened our state and improved the lives of all Georgians,” she wrote. “Serving in this capacity has truly been a labor of love and one that I will miss.”
Henderson’s future in the chamber is uncertain. She was charged with fraudulently collecting more than $17,000 in pandemic unemployment benefits but has not resigned.
Henderson maintains her innocence, and in a statement posted to social media, asked supporters for donations to help her fight what she called wrongful accusations.
Another Democratic state lawmaker, Rep. Lynn Heffner of Augusta, resigned effective Monday citing damage to her home from Hurricane Helene and the state law requiring representatives to live in the districts they represent.
“As recovery efforts have continued, the rebuilding process has reached an impasse, creating uncertainty that makes it difficult to confidently maintain constitutional residency while continuing legislative service,” Heffner wrote.
Prior to her election in 2022, Heffner served in the U.S. Army and worked as director of motor vehicle registration in Richmond County. She sat on committees including the House Committee on Defense and Veterans Affairs.
The House and Senate are set to gavel in Monday for a legislative session set to last through early spring.
With the two departures, the House now includes 98 Republicans and 79 Democrats. A vacancy left by the death of Canton Republican Rep. Mandi Ballinger is set to be filled with a special election runoff Tuesday between Republican Bill Fincher and Democrat Scott Sanders.
Kemp will declare special elections to fill the seats. As of Monday, Kemp’s office said no timeline has yet been set.

(Photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)The end of 2025 meant the end of federal tax credits that helped keep health insurance costs down for some 190,000 Marylanders, but it wasn’t the end of all help for those policy holders.
The state, anticipating the possible loss of federal assistance, set aside millions this year and next. And state officials gathered Monday to urge people to take advantage of the state’s Easy Enrollment program, which could help families get connected to more affordable health care by checking a box on their state tax forms.
“As the clock struck midnight on Dec. 31, thousands of Marylanders greeted the New Year not with cheers, but with increased anxiety,” Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) said at the Center for Urban Families in Baltimore Monday. “With increased worry and concern at the prospect of going without health insurance because they are now facing higher health insurance premiums.”
Lierman joined other state officials and health care advocates to raise awareness of Easy Enrollment, which has helped thousands of Marylanders get connected to affordable insurance over the five years since its launch. Under the program, Marylanders can check a box on their state tax return saying they are interested in learning about their health care options through the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The exchange then reaches out with information about available health insurance options and whether those households qualify for subsidies to bring those costs down further.
Advocates say Easy Enrollment is especially important due to the expiration of a popular COVID-19 era expansion of a federal tax credit under the Affordable Care Act, which will lead to a hike in health insurance costs. State fiscal analysts estimated that the expiration of the federal advanced premium tax credits would mean the loss of about $150 million to Maryland.
In anticipation of that, legislators created a state-based health insurance subsidies program, aimed at countering some of the federal cuts. The state program is not expected to generate more than $75 million this year, half the federal loss, so the state program was oriented towar lower-income families. Some will see the same savings they got from the federal program, while others may not be eligible for a state subsidy.
The expiration of the federal Enhanced Premium Tax Credit is expected to lead higher premiums for some 20 million Americans who directly benefited from the assistance through the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, the end of the tax credit has already led to increases in the private insurance market, with Maryland regulators approving an average 13.4% premium rate increase this year.
State OKs 13.4% average premium hike for state’s health care marketplace plans

That’s why lawmakers like Health and Government Operations Vice Chair Bonnie Cullison (D-Montgomery) urge Marylanders to use the Easy Enrollment option on their state tax forms to see if they qualify for more affordable health care coverage.
“The Easy Enrollment program was designed to use government processes to the absolute benefit of Marylanders,” Cullison said. “When given information from the Comptroller’s office … the exchange can quickly determine the eligibility for free or reduced health care options — or help folks compare plans that will best meet their needs.”
Vincent DeMarco with Maryland Health Care All coalition announced a $100,000 informational campaign to help uninsured Marylanders learn about the Easy Enrollment option, as those who qualify for Medicaid can still get enrolled in health care coverage.
“If you’re uninsured and you missed Open Enrollment, and you’re eligible for Medicaid – check the box at tax time and you could get enrolled,” DeMarco said. “It is especially important now.”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said any effort to make access to insurance easier can help combat changes coming to health care through the Republican-controlled Congress and the Trump administration.
“Because they rolled those (expanded tax credits) back, allowed them to die at midnight on Dec. 31,” Van Hollen said, “as a result, 20 million Americans will no longer get the benefit of that tax credit. They’ll see their premiums go through the roof.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tax-forms-1.jpg,,,2026-01-05 21:56:54.189774
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 01:28:19+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s Grand Old Party tries to go viral with mockery of Lamont,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/05/ct-gop-ned-lamont-pizza-video/,The CT GOP opened a digital advertising campaign with a 1-minute video portraying Gov. Ned Lamont as indifferent to the high cost of living.,"Facing strong headwinds in the midterms, the Connecticut Republican Party opened a digital advertising campaign Monday with a 1-minute video portraying Gov. Ned Lamont, a wealthy Democrat seeking a third term in 2026, as indifferent to the high cost of living in Connecticut.
The piece offers a mocking twist on the Lamont administration’s light-hearted marketing campaign declaring “Connecticut home of the pizza capital of the United States,” a boast on social media and on some highway signs at the Connecticut border with New York.
“You know, Ned Lamont is, we think, channeling his inner Marie Antoinette and [saying] ‘Let Connecticut eat pizza!’” said Ben Proto, the chair of the Republican Party.
Proto said the campaign, at least initially, would be “mostly organic, our social media.” The state GOP has not been a reliably effective player on social media, unable or unwilling to engage in posts with the potential to go viral, fueled either by humor or outrage.
The piece was shown to reporters at 1 p.m., copies provided on thumb drives — not online. The video was not posted on the party’s Facebook or Instagram pages for nearly four hours. It did not appear on the party’s rarely updated X account.
It can be seen here. on the GOP’s Facebook page.

Proto said the party was ramping up with the start of 2026, when the governor, the other statewide constitutional officers, the General Assembly and the U.S. House delegation will be on the ballot. He said the party was quick to defend the Trump administration’s arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro against criticism from Connecticut’s Democratic senators and one of its congressmen.
“We’re doing far better on social media,” he said.
Proto was elected in June 2021 as state party chair, an increasingly ill-defined job in an era when political power and influence has migrated to Super PACs — even more so in Connecticut, where the GOP controls no levers of government and has been unable to win a congressional race for 20 years.
“What I’ve really learned over the last four and a half years is what my job is and what the job of this party is,” Proto said. “And the job of this party, ultimately, is not to define the issues. That’s up to the candidates. Our job is to help our candidates amplify their message. And we know the message on our side is that the Democrats have made this unaffordable.”
The press conference at the party’s headquarters in Middletown was a rarity.
“The election cycle has officially begun,” Proto said. “Some will say it started the day after the November elections, and that’s true, because that’s the day Ned Lamont found the word ‘affordability’ in his vocabulary. Prior to that, it didn’t exist. And we all know that the issue here in Connecticut is affordability, as it is across the country.”
Acting as a surrogate for the Lamont campaign, state Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, waited outside the GOP headquarters to insist that emphasizing the cost of living is not without risk for Republicans who mostly have remained silent over the trade war that President Donald Trump is waging against economic rivals and allies alike, his suspension of job-producing off-shore wind projects, and his support for the expiration of tax credits that will produce an increase in health costs under the Affordable Care Act.
“I just thought it was a stunning display, incredibly out of touch at a time when the country is reeling from tariffs from Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington, the same week that health insurance prices for tens of thousands of Connecticut residents just tripled because of Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington,” Lesser said.
Each of Trump’s presidential victories have been followed by Republican losses in Connecticut.
When Trump first took office in January 2017, Republicans were on the rise at the General Assembly. They still were a minority but strong enough to influence fiscal policies, including the adoption of stronger spending caps as part of a bipartisan budget deal in 2017.
The GOP held 18 of the 36 seats in the Senate and were only five short of the 76 seats necessary for a majority in the 151-member House. Democrats made huge gains in 2018, and they now outnumber Republicans by at least 2-1 margins in each chamber of the General Assembly.
As was the case after Trump’s first election, Democrats flipped control of municipal governments in 28 communities in November, the first general election since his return to the White House. Proto said his goal for 2026 was progress, not a legislative majority.
“I do not expect that we are going to have 19 senators and 76 members of the House come January of 2027,” Proto said. “It’s an incremental change. And how do we bring about incremental change? You bring about incremental change by changing a couple of districts.”

Mayor Justin Elicker named Assistant Chief David Zannelli to step in as acting chief. The mayor held a 6:30 press conference with the department’s three assistant chiefs to answer questions about the development. (Click here to watch a video of the press conference.)
Police officers discovered that money was missing from the confidential informant fund and told the department’s three assistant chiefs, Elicker said at a press conference held Monday evening at police headquarters at 1 Union Ave.
The assistant chiefs Monday morning confronted Jacobson, who “admitted to taking the funds for personal use,” Elicker said. The confrontation took place in the chief’s office. The assistant chiefs relayed the information to city Chief Administrative Officer Justin McCarthy, who then notified the mayor.
Elicker subsequently told Jacobson on Monday that he was going to be placed on administrative leave because of the allegation. Jacobson retired instead.
The mayor praised the officers for stepping forward: “When they saw something wrong, they did the right thing.”
“Rest assured that the process does work,” Zannelli said.

“We don’t have any information that anyone else was involved in this theft,” Elicker said.
Elicker declined to say how much money was stolen and over what time period, given the ongoing nature of an investigation into the matter.
The city informed the state’s attorney’s office, which along with state police will now determine whether and how to pursue a criminal probe.
Jacobson can retire and collect a pension, but that pension might be in jeopardy in the case of a criminal conviction, Elicker said in response to a question from the press. He noted that it’s “very early” in the matter.
Police union attorney Marshall Segar said he was disappointed by the news. “We’ll see where the investigation goes,” he said.
The mayor and chief had scheduled a 2 p.m. press conference to address Sunday’s double-fatal car crash in Westville. The press conference was cancelled moments before it was set to begin.
Jacobson became the city’s chief in July 2022 after serving in an interim capacity. He earned wide respect for his connections to people in the community on all sides of law enforcement, for his support of officers, and for his work with federal and state agencies partnering with New Haven police.
Days before he officially took over the job, his decision to provide fast, complete information about police misconduct that led to a transported suspect being hospitalized and paralyzed helped calm what could have been an explosive public crisis. That incident “opened my eyes that we needed change as a police department,” Jacobson subsequently reflected, as he pursued policy changes for handling of prisoners.
“We talk about it in dog years: Being chief [for a year] in New Haven is like seven years if you were chief somewhere else,” Jacobson reflected about the daily pace of intense developments in a 2024 radio interview.
“I remember a time six months into the job where I said, ‘Man, I don’t know if I can take this. It’s very stressful. It’s wearing on me.’ I just wanted to slow down. I wanted it to be quiet. Then I realized it’s never going to be quiet. It’s how I approach each issue.”
Jacobson has also worked to replenish the ranks of officers after years of departures.
Jacobson could not be reached for comment for this article.
Asked for comment at Monday’s full Board of Alders meeting at City Hall, Board of Alders President Tyisha Walker-Myers spoke highly of Jacobson’s tenure as police chief.
“He led the police department in a way that made me proud,” she said. “He worked along with the board when we talked about community policing, police officers who know the community. … I lived through the ’90s policing. It’s a totally different feel. We’ll be fine — no one person does it by themselves. We’ll continue doing the things that he started.”

Mark Baisley, right, seen speaking outside the Ralph L. Carr Colorado Judicial Center in Denver in December 2023, is running for a seat in the U.S. Senate. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state Sen. Mark Baisley is ditching his campaign for Colorado governor to run for U.S. Senate instead. 
Baisley, a Woodland Park Republican, announced on a conservative podcast this week that he will challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper in November. He leaves behind a crowded GOP primary field for Colorado governor, where he said the electorate “will have some good choices there for moving forward with a new governor.”
“My focus is now on the United States Senate, where I frankly feel more suited,” Baisley told Brandon Wark of Free State Colorado. “I’ve been in the Legislature for seven years, this is my eighth year now, and it would be transitioning to the legislature at a bigger stage in Washington D.C. rather than in Denver, Colorado.”

Baisley is the most experienced Republican to enter the 2026 race for the Senate. Janak Joshi, a Republican former member of the Colorado House of Representatives and past candidate for Colorado’s 8th Congressional District, is also running for U.S. Senate. Other Republican candidates include Montrose County Commissioner Sean Pond, George Markert and Dathan Jones. 
Colorado state Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat, is also challenging Hickenlooper. Baisley said he hopes the internal battle for Democrats in the June primary will benefit his campaign. Other Democratic candidates include attorney Karen Breslin, software engineer Brashad Hasley and accountant A.J. Zimpfer.
Hickenlooper, a former Colorado governor and mayor of Denver, beat former U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican, by 10 percentage points in the 2020 election. Hickenlooper’s campaign characterized Baisley as “too extreme for Colorado” and said he joins a group of Republican candidates campaigning to “prove who would be more loyal to Trump.”
Baisley did not respond to a request for comment from Newsline. 
Other Republican candidates running for governor include state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, state Rep. Scott Bottoms, Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell, Bob Brinkerhoff, Jason Clark, Jon Gray-Ginsberg, Kelvin “K-Man” Wimberly and Will McBride.
Greg Lopez, who briefly represented Colorado’s 4th Congressional District in Congress following former U.S. Rep. Ken Buck’s resignation, announced Monday he will continue his campaign for governor, but as an unaffiliated candidate. 
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser are running in the Democratic primary for governor. Colorado hasn’t had a Republican governor since Gov. Bill Owens left office after the 2006 election.

Rep. Hageman, who’s running to replace Lummis, has been mum on the military strikes and Maduro’s capture.  
The post Wyoming’s Barrasso, Lummis back Trump’s Venezuelan invasion, Hageman silent appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s two senior members of Congress are backing the Trump administration’s military strikes on Venezuela and the capture of the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro. 
Republican Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis posted statements over the weekend on social media that called Maduro a “narco-terrorist” and thanked the U.S. military, which carried out the Saturday raid on Caracas. 
“Maudro is a dictator, a narco-terrorist, and an indicted criminal in the United States,” Barrasso posted on X. “Venezuela, America, and the world are safer with this dangerous dictator removed from power.”
Likewise, Lummis posted on X that she was “grateful to President Trump for his decisive leadership and to our military and law enforcement personnel who executed this operation with extraordinary courage and skill.” 
“Peace through strength works,” Lummis wrote. “Maduro will finally answer for his crimes in American courts.” 
Maduro had led Venezuela since 2013. But many countries, including the United States, refused to recognize him as a legitimate head of state. In 2024, the Biden administration accused Maduro of stealing the presidential election, citing “overwhelming evidence” that his opponent, Edmundo González Urrutia, won. 
A 2020 U.S. indictment accused Maduro of overseeing “Cartel de los Soles,” which the Trump administration has described as a violent drug organization. However, a range of specialists in Latin American criminal and narcotics issues, including former Drug Enforcement Administration officials, maintain that “Cartel de los Soles” is instead a figure of speech, dating back to the 1990s, for Venezuelan military officials corrupted by drug money. Since the 2020 indictment, both the Trump and Biden administrations offered millions in reward for information leading to his arrest. 
At least 80 people were killed, including military personnel and civilians, during the Caracas raid, the New York Times reported. No Americans were killed. Following Maduro’s removal, Trump announced the United States would “run” the country for an indefinite period.
But Venezuelan leaders gathered Monday for a swearing-in ceremony to project independence in running their country, the Associated Press reported. 
Republican Rep. Harriet Hageman, who recently announced plans to run for Senate now that Lummis is retiring, has so far not made a public statement on the invasion, via the press, press release or social media. Neither her campaign or congressional press contact responded to WyoFile’s request for comment by publishing time. 
Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who is running to replace Hageman in the  U.S. House, released a statement backing the invasion. 
While most conservative, congressional lawmakers have voiced support for Trump’s actions, some have raised concerns that such a strike supersedes Congress’ authority to declare war. 
“If the President believes military action against Venezuela is needed, he should make the case and Congress should vote before American lives and treasure are spent on regime change in South America,” Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, said on the House floor last month as the chamber considered a pair of resolutions to force Trump to secure approval from Congress before attacking Venezuela. 
Both resolutions failed. Massie reposted a video of his floor comments Saturday following the raid. 
“Let’s be honest about likely outcomes. Do we truly believe that Nicolás Maduro will be replaced by a modern-day George Washington? How did that work out in Cuba, Libya, Iraq or Syria?” Massie said in his comments last month. 
The Kentucky Republican also expressed skepticism about the Trump administration’s stated motivation behind the strikes. 
“If it were about drugs, we’d bomb Mexico, or China, or Colombia,” Massie said. “And the President would not have pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández. This is about oil and regime change.”
Last month, Trump pardoned Hernández, the former Hondruan president, who had been convicted in the U.S. for helping smuggle more than 400 tons of cocaine into the country. 
“They basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country,” Trump told reporters. “And they said it was a Biden administration set-up. And I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.”

(Courtesy of Stephen Ausmus/Animal Research Services, USDA)LINCOLN — With a recent case of bird flu confirmed in a commercial flock in Nebraska’s Butler County, state officials are reminding poultry owners to monitor for and protect their birds.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Inspection Service confirmed the late December case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in a chicken flock of about 144,600 commercial laying hens in Butler County.
Since November, other bird flu cases have been confirmed in small backyard flocks in Keith, Howard, Washington and Scotts Bluff Counties, state ag officials said in a statement Monday.
“While these cases are not unexpected and coincide with the ongoing wild bird migration and what we are seeing in other states, it does serve as an important reminder for Nebraska poultry producers to stay vigilant in protecting their flocks,” said state veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley. “Producers should know and monitor for HPAI symptoms and follow strict biosecurity practices, which can significantly reduce the risk of the disease affecting their flocks.”
HPAI is a highly contagious virus that spreads easily among birds through secretions, infected food, water and manure. It can spread in various ways including by equipment and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.
Symptoms include lack of energy and appetite, decreased egg production and diarrhea. HPAI can survive for weeks in contaminated environments. It can cause sudden death in birds even if they show no other symptoms.
Resources are available for poultry producers at nda.nebraska.gov/animal/avian/ and from the USDA at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza. Poultry showing signs of HPAI or unusual death should be reported to the NDA at 402-471-2351 or the USDA at 866-536-7593.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The commissioner of Alaska’s Department of Family and Community Services has departed that position to take a job with the Trump administration.
Kim Kovol has accepted a job with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced last week. Her last day working for the state was on Friday, and Tracy Dompeling, the department’s deputy commissioner, assumed the role of acting commissioner, the statement said.
The department’s primary divisions are the Division of Juvenile Justice, the Alaska Psychiatric Institute, the Alaska Pioneer Homes and the Office of Children’s Services.
Kovol was the first commissioner of the Department of Family and Community Services, which was created in 2022. Up to then, its functions were part of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. Through an executive order, Dunleavy split that department into two: the Department of Health and the Department of Family and Community Services.
In his statement, Dunleavy said Kovol was a “strong and dedicated leader” for the redesigned department. “As the first Commissioner of DFCS, she built a foundation focused on service, accountability, and support for Alaska’s most vulnerable populations. I thank her for her service and wish her every success in this next role,” he said.
Kovol said she was honored to have served in that role. “I am incredibly grateful to the staff, partners, and communities who have supported our work. Together, we have made meaningful progress for Alaska families, youth, and elders, and I will always be proud of what we have accomplished,” she said in the statement.

Kovol’s last day working for the state was Jan. 2. She has taken a job with the U.S. Department of Health and Social Services.

	Kovol is the second Alaska department head to leave state service to join the Trump administration. Almost a year ago, Emma Pokon left her position as commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation to become the Pacific Northwest regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Dunleavy in May chose Randy Bates to be the department’s new commissioner. Bates was formerly director of DEC’s Division of Water.
With Kovol’s departure, there are now five state departments with leaders who currently lack legislative approval.
In addition to Bates, Dunleavy has named commissioner-designees for the Department of Law and the Department of Natural Resources. Dunleavy in August named Stephen Cox, a former U.S. attorney in Texas, as Alaska’s attorney general, replacing Treg Taylor, a Republican who is running for governor.
Dunleavy also named John Crowther, a DNR veteran, as his choice to be permanent commissioner. Crowther became acting commissioner after John Boyle resigned from the position in October.
Bates, Cox and Crowther are subject to legislative confirmation after lawmakers convene later this month for their 2026 session.
The state Department of Revenue is currently being led by an acting commissioner, Janelle Earls, who assumed the job in August after Adam Crum left the commissioner post. Crum is another Republican candidate for governor.
Dunleavy has not yet named his choices for the commissioner posts at the Department of Revenue or the Department of Family and Community Services, said Jeff Turner, the governor’s spokesperson. Earls and Dompeling are currently acting commissioners and it is not clear whether the governor will name commissioner-designees for those positions, he said.
Dunleavy is in the last year of his second term. He is term limited and may not run for reelection.

White, a Republican and one of the most powerful government officials in the state, held the closed-door press conference inside his office at the Capitol. White conducted a question-and-answer session with numerous members of the media about the 2026 legislative session that begins Tuesday, according to a press release obtained by Mississippi Today. 
The decision by the speaker’s office followed a Mississippi Today exclusive report in April that White, his staff and some of their spouses were treated to a trip to the 2025 Super Bowl by a sports-gambling company. After that story was published, Mississippi Today was removed from the speaker’s press distribution list, and his office stopped responding to requests for comment 
But Monday marked the first time that Mississippi Today, a credentialed member of the Capitol Press Corps and the largest newsroom outlet in the state, was denied access to a press event in the speaker’s office attended by numerous media organizations. 
Minutes before the press conference started, Tammy Cowart, White’s assistant, emerged from his office with a clipboard and asked reporters if they had been invited. When Cowart asked a Mississippi Today reporter which news outlet he worked for, she said she would need to check with other staffers before letting him inside.  
“They sent out an exclusive invitation out to attend this. If you’re not on my list, I’ll just have to check, because you’re not on there,” Cowart said. 
She then said the event was not a press conference, but a “specific Q&A.”
The event was not an exclusive interview. Numerous media organizations attended, including print, broadcast and radio outlets.  
Cowart then returned to the speaker’s office and came out again minutes later to inform Mississippi Today’s reporter that he would not be allowed into the press conference. 
“I checked, and it’s not an open press conference. It’s invitation only. You’re not on my list, you didn’t get the invitation, so you won’t be allowed in,” Cowart said. 
Cowart said other news outlets were also not invited to the press event, but declined to say which ones. 
A press release announcing the event and reviewed by Mississippi Today, said “only media directly receiving the media advisory” would be invited to attend. 
“Mississippi Today is the largest newsroom in the state, and our journalists are careful to cover the news accurately and with context,” Mississippi Today Editor-in-Chief Emily Wagster Pettus, who covered the Mississippi Legislature for 31 years for The Clarion-Ledger and The Associated Press, said in a statement Monday. 
“We and other news organizations are the eyes and ears of the public at the state Capitol,” she said. “It is petty and wrong for Speaker Jason White — or any other elected official — to cut off media access.”
Layne Bruce, executive director of the Mississippi Press Association, said in a statement Monday that White’s office should “treat all press outlets fairly.”
“We would urge the speaker’s office to open its doors and allow representatives from all press outlets to be included,” Bruce said. “We believe that in the spirit of transparency, and since this is taking place in a public building that is funded by the taxpayers, it is only proper.” 
Bruce also pointed out that Mississippi Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, also a Republican, took questions about his legislative agenda from media outlets, including Mississippi Today, at a luncheon just hours before the event in White’s office. 
The denial of press access in Mississippi comes amid broader tensions between the federal government and the press. Under the Trump administration, the White House has restricted Associated Press journalists from certain presidential press events after the outlet refused to adopt administration-preferred language, a move the AP has described as retaliatory and a violation of press freedoms. Separately, the Pentagon has altered press access rules, prompting concern from major news organizations that new restrictions limit independent coverage.
In a statement to the Clarion Ledger, White said: “The Media Q+A hosted in my office today was an invitation-only media opportunity, not an open, public press conference.” 
Charlie Mitchell, an attorney and former newspaper editor who has taught media law at the University of Mississippi, said White’s decision raised questions about whether the speaker has complied with the First Amendment.
“The speaker may have been thinking about his complete discretion when it comes to interviews and responding to inquiries, Mitchell said. “If, for instance, he wanted to return a phone call to one journalist and not another, that’s perfectly OK. Press events are very different.”
The scenario could parallel a federal court decision in favor of the AP, which “made clear the First Amendment does not allow officials to exclude credentialed journalists from otherwise open press events.”
Mississippi Today received an audio recording of the speaker’s press conference from multiple organizations that attended the event. The news outlet reported on the speaker’s comments along with those made hours earlier by Hosemann on the 2026 legislative session. 
Taylor Spillman, White’s spokesperson, did not respond to multiple questions sent via text message and email about the decision by the speaker’s office to bar Mississippi Today from its press conference and remove it from its media distribution list. 
Spillman and Cowart were both photographed on the trip to the 2025 Super Bowl with White. DraftKings, a sports gambling giant pushing for the legalization of mobile sports betting in Mississippi, confirmed with Mississippi Today that the gambling industry paid for the game-day tickets.  
Mississippi Speaker of the House Jason White, some staff and spouses attended the Super Bowl.
Spillman and her husband, Trey Spillman, documented Super Bowl festivities on social media.
A day after the Super Bowl, Trey Spillman took to social media to thank DraftKings for the experience. 
“Unforgettable experience at Super Bowl LIX. Thank you @draftkings for the hospitality! #sports”
But after Mississippi Today asked the Spillmans about the trip, the social media post was changed to remove any mention of DraftKings and the company’s “hospitality.” 
“Unforgettable experience at Super Bowl LIX. #sports,” the edited post reads. 
The sports gambling lobby, as it has done in other states, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Mississippi politicians trying to convince them to legalize mobile sports betting. 
The issue is likely to become another priority for the House this legislative session.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/07125657/Jason-White-2.jpg,,,2026-01-05 19:11:43.704027

(U.S. Coast Guard photo, Courtesy Clean Gulf Associates)The Trump administration has assessed what it’s calling the largest civil fine ever for an offshore oil spill in 2023 off the Louisiana coast.
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration sent notice Dec. 31 to Panther Operating Co. of Houston that it has proposed a $9.62 million fine for the failure of its Main Pass Oil Gathering pipeline system. An estimated 1.1 million gallons of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico when a connector on the pipeline malfunctioned, allowing oil to flow for more than nine hours, according to the agency. The leak was visible nearly 20 miles off the Mississippi River Delta. 
Panther Operating Co., a subsidiary of Third Coast infrastructure, has 30 days to respond to the notice to explain how it will address the leak, contest the allegations or request a formal administrative hearing. Company representatives did not respond immediately to a request for comment Monday. 
According to the notice, a Panther controller was aware of the leak at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 15 based on pressure gauge observations and noted a zero flow rate for the pipeline five hours later. However, the controller did not order the pipeline shut down before his shift ended the next morning at 6:00. His replacement called for it to be closed around 6:30 a.m., which was 13 hours after the pressure issues were first noted, the agency said.
No new or continuous oil flow was reported after Nov. 21, 2023.  
The U.S. Coast Guard, the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator’s Office and the state Department of Wildlife and Fisheries conducted response and cleanup activities after the spill until April 2024.
The notice from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said Panther Operating Co. failed to account for underwater landslides and tropical storm impacts on the Gulf seabed in its maintenance of the pipeline. 
“PHMSA’s focus on safety and holding operators accountable when they fail to comply with federal safety regulations will never change,” PHMSA Administrator Paul Roberti said in a news release. “It is important for pipeline operators to remain vigilant in their operations to prevent these types of failures or there will be serious consequences.”

His keen understanding of sports, deep journalistic connections to coaches and athletes and conversational storytelling style have won Cleveland legions of admirers during his 60-year career. This is the 15th time he has been named sportswriter of the year – more than anyone in the state.
In announcing its awards Monday, the association also named Ross Dellenger, senior college football reporter for Yahoo Sports, as the 2025 National Sportswriter of the Year.
This is the first such honor for Dellenger, who grew up in Biloxi. He is a graduate of Mississippi State University and a former sportswriter for the Clarion Ledger. Dellenger started working for Sports Illustrated in 2018 and moved to Yahoo Sports in 2023.
Cleveland is a Hattiesburg native and University of Southern Mississippi graduate. He has worked for the Hattiesburg American; the Monroe News Star World in Louisiana; the Jackson Daily News and The Clarion-Ledger as a reporter, editor and columnist.
He has been Mississippi Today’s sports columnist since 2016. He and his son, sportswriter Tyler Cleveland, host the Mississippi Today podcast “Crooked Letter Sports.”

Rick Cleveland is in Arizona this week to continue covering the most successful football season in Ole Miss history. The Rebels play Miami on Thursday in a college football playoff semifinal in the Fiesta Bowl, with the winner advancing to next week’s national championship game.
During the past few weeks, Cleveland has thoroughly covered the Ole Miss coaching turmoil, as Lane Kiffin departed for rival LSU, defensive coordinator Pete Golding was named the Rebels’ new head coach and Ole Miss defeated higher-ranked Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day.
His columns over the past year include a sharply-worded piece about the obscene amounts of money that college coaches continue collecting after they’re fired; an insightful description of how former NFL player Tommy Kelly became the head football coach at Jackson’s Lanier High School and led the Bulldogs to their best season in years; and thorough coverage of Mississippi’s only PGA tournament, the Sanderson Farms Championship.
Cleveland is a member of both the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and the Mississippi Press Association Hall of Fame, and he is from a family of sportswriters. His late brother, Bobby Cleveland, was a longtime outdoors writer for The Clarion-Ledger.

That’s according to a new report released Monday by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute that was commissioned by the Clark and Christine Ivory Foundation. 
According to the report,only 50.3% of Utah third graders in 2025 had grade-level proficiency in readying. Earlier grades saw similar rates. 
Reading proficiency also varies widely, the report says, from below 30% to above 70%. “Large gaps” exist for English-language learners, students with disabilities, Hispanic and Latino students, and economically disadvantaged students show significantly lower proficiency rates, the report says.

Last month, Gov. Spencer Cox and first lady Abby Cox highlighted a need for improved reading and literacy for young learners. Cox made it a centerpiece issue in his budget recommendation, which he announced at the Salt Lake County Library in Kearns. 
As part of his budget proposal to the 2026 Utah Legislature, Cox recommended using $80 million for paraeducator grant programs. That includes $60 million for “targeted behavioral interventions in K-3 classrooms” and $20 million for reading support in elementary schools that have not met the statewide proficiency benchmark of 70% of third graders reading at grade level.
During his budget announcement, Cox also urged lawmakers to follow the example of Mississippi, a state that once sat at the bottom of national elementary literacy rankings and now ranks near the top. A policy known as the “Mississippi Miracle” requires third graders to score high enough on a reading test before advancing to fourth grade.

Cox, during his budget recommendation, called on Utah lawmakers to pass a similar law. 
“We’ve implemented some of the things that have happened in Mississippi, (but) we need to implement the rest of those things and get everybody pulled together,” the governor said. 
The Gardner Institute report included a section on the “impacts of third-grade retention” policies, pointing to states including Mississippi, Indiana and Florida. 
“A large body of research has examined these test-based retention policies and show that most retained students experience reading gains, though long-term outcomes are mixed,” the report says. “That said, more recent evaluations occurred in states that provide extensive supports alongside retention, making disentanglement of reading retention and intensive interventions difficult.” 
However, “the strongest evidence suggests that the supports students receive when flagged for retention — not retention alone — primarily drive the improvement,” the report said. 
By passing SB127 in 2022, Utah lawmakers have set a statewide goal of 70% third-grade reading proficiency by 2027. The bill requires the State Board of Education to administer programs to improve early literacy in K-3 kids, which came with an estimated price tage of more than $9.1 million in ongoing funding and $9.4 million in one-time money to hire staff and provide training, according to its fiscal note.

“State and district implementation of SB127 continues in phases, reflecting the time required for the state board of education, schools, districts, and preparation programs to adopt new materials, strengthen training, and build capacity,” the Gardner Institute report says. “Research shows that the impact of early literacy reforms depends not only on policy design but also on consistent, high-quality implementation, underscoring the importance of continued attention to fidelity, monitoring, and support.”
Cox, however, also said “70% is too low of a goal.”
“It should be 100%. We know we can get there,” he said. “We’re seeing it in places like Mississippi.” 
The report’s author, Andrea Thomas Brandley, senior education analyst at the Gardner Institute, wrote in the report that research shows strong early literacy skills help “build the foundation needed for lifelong learning.” 
“Early childhood literacy is not just an academic benchmark; it is the cornerstone of a child’s future success,” Thomas Brandley said in a prepared statement. “The ability to read proficiently by third grade profoundly impacts a student’s entire educational journey, their economic opportunities, and their capacity to engage fully in civic life.”
The governor, first lady Abby Cox and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson are scheduled to hold a Literacy and Reading Symposium on Tuesday in Ogden, aimed at discussing “practical ways to strengthen literacy and get more kids and adults reading,” according to the governor’s office. 
Last month, Abby Cox said social media has created a “big hole” in kids’ and adults’ lives that needs to be filled with books. 
“It’s not unconnected to social media,” Abby Cox said. “The issues that we’re having with literacy is a direct result of us not reading and children not having access to books and not being read to.”

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho state Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, announced Monday he has been appointed co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s powerful budget committee ahead of the upcoming 2026 legislative session.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The appointment is important because Tanner must immediately begin addressing state revenue shortfalls and projected budget deficits as soon as the new legislative session begins next week. 
As the new co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, Tanner succeeds outgoing state Rep. Wendy Horman. In December, Horman announced she would resign from the Idaho Legislature to take a job with the federal government in Washington, D.C.
JFAC is a powerful legislative committee that sets every budget for every state agency and department. 
In his press release, Tanner said he would help lead the Idaho Legislature’s budget process by focusing on fiscal constraint, limiting government growth and applying accountability to agency spending. 
“Serving as Co-Chair of JFAC is a serious responsibility to Idaho taxpayers,” Tanner said. “Every dollar appropriated represents money trusted to us by working Idahoans. That trust demands discipline, accountability, and a firm commitment to spend only what is necessary — and nothing more.”
 As state faces projected budget shortfall, Tanner says Idaho must balance its budget

The 2026 legislative session starts in a week on Jan. 12. Traditionally, the two co-chairs of JFAC are among the most powerful and influential legislators in Boise.

Tanner will work alongside Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, who will return as the other co-chair of JFAC during the 2026 legislative session. 
This year’s budget process will face even more scrutiny than normal because of state revenue shortfalls that are occurring following five years of tax cuts approved by the Idaho Legislature. After several years of consecutive multimillion dollar state budget surpluses, Idaho’s state budget is projected to end the current fiscal year 2026 and next year with budget deficits, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The latest state budget report projects Idaho’s state budget will end the current fiscal year 2026 on June 30 with a deficit of $40.3 million. But this year is only the start. The budget deficit could increase by more than 10 times that amount next year. 
In his announcement, Tanner emphasized that Idaho must find a way to balance its state budget.
“Idaho families balance their budgets every day, and state government must do the same,” Tanner said. “When revenues fall short, lower-priority programs must be reduced and agencies held fully accountable. Government should work to keep money in the pockets of Idahoans, not locked inside bloated bureaucracy.”
The Idaho Legislative Services Office reported in the fall that the projected state budget deficit for fiscal year 2027 could be $555.2 million. In late November, the state’s top budget official, Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff, told the Sun that the state may need to come up with an additional $600 million to $1 billion for the fiscal year 2027 budget to pass a balanced budget, conform with federal tax changes championed by President Donald Trump and still leave an ending cash balance to guard against additional budget uncertainty. 
Notably, the Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget and prohibits the state from running a budget deficit where expenses exceed available revenue. 
State legislators and officials from Gov. Brad Little’s office have said that state officials will intervene during the 2026 legislative session to prevent the state from running a budget deficit. Although plans have not been made public, the most likely tools for avoiding a budget deficit include implementing new, deeper budget cuts and/or tapping into state savings and reserve accounts. 
 Moyle offered prominent JFAC role to Tanner, a second term legislator

Although Tanner’s appointment was widely expected in political circles, the choice to promote Tanner to budget co-chair may have been a slightly unconventional pick in a legislative environment that historically values experience and seniority.
In his second term in the Idaho Legislature, Tanner was not the most experienced Idaho House member serving on JFAC. JFAC Vice Chairman Steve Miller (who has five total, nonconsecutive terms of office in the Idaho House), Rep. Dusting Manwaring, (who has four total, nonconsecutive terms in the Idaho House) and Rep. Rod Furniss, (who is serving his fourth term) all have more legislative experience and JFAC experience than Tanner. 
By contrast, Horman had completed five terms in the Idaho Legislature and was the most experienced Republican on JFAC when she was named JFAC co-chair heading into the 2023 session. 
However, Tanner is an ally of House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, and has served as House assistant majority leader on the Republican leadership team with Moyle.
Moyle, as speaker of the Idaho House and the highest ranking member of the Idaho House’s leadership team, took the lead on appointing committee chairs and filling vacancies atop of committees. 
Efforts to reach Moyle and Tanner were not immediately successful on Monday, but Moyle told the Sun last month that loyalty would be a factor in his decision. 
“I like to pick chairmen that are loyal, that work hard and that have what’s best for Idaho at heart,” Moyle said in a Dec. 19 interview. “To replace Wendy (Horman) is going to be tough. The fact is, between you and me, nobody can replace Wendy.”
In his press release, Tanner did not directly address whether or not he will continue to serve as assistant majority leader in the Idaho House now that he has new responsibilities with JFAC. Tanner told Idaho Reports in December that he would give up his assistant leader position if he became JFAC co-chair. Over the past 15 years, members of Idaho legislative leadership teams have not also served at the same time as co-chairs of JFAC.

Vermont’s legislative session this year will be one for the ages. Can lawmakers pull off the generational transformation of the public education system they started last year, or will they take an easier way out? What state programs will be on the chopping block during an agonizing budget cycle? How will electeds try to counteract the neverending stream of policy changes coming out of Washington, D.C.? Is affordability just a talking point, or could Vermonters see real relief?
On top of this session’s heavy issues, it’s also an election year. Do lawmakers dare pass potentially unpopular policies months before their names are on the ballot?

In the know
So what’s on tap this week? Legislators convene for the new session on Tuesday, Jan. 6, for the start of the second year of the biennium. In theory, that means lawmakers should hit the ground running. In practice, that’s to be determined.
Last Friday, just days before the session’s kickoff, Gov. Phil Scott appointed two new legislators to fill vacancies. John Benson will take over the Senate seat of Orange County Republican Larry Hart. In the House, Val Taylor will fill the seat being vacated by GOP Rep. Jim Harrison, which covers Killington, Chittenden, Mendon and Pittsfield. Both new lawmakers are Republicans, too.

Off to the races
Molly Gray, the former Democratic lieutenant governor who also ran, unsuccessfully, for a seat in Congress, wants her old job back.
Gray announced her campaign for the state’s second-highest office Monday morning at a coffee shop in the South End of Burlington. She also released a slate of endorsements from nine current senators and 22 current House members, among them Senate President Pro Tem Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central.
Also on Monday, after Gray’s announcement, a second candidate signalled he may enter the race. Ryan McLaren, a former aide to U.S. Sen Peter Welch, D-Vt., told VTDigger he was “seriously considering” running for lieutenant governor.
Republican John Rodgers, the current LG, has previously said he would run for reelection in 2026.
Meanwhile, Deputy State Auditor Tim Ashe is seeking his office’s top job. 
Ashe, a Democrat/Progressive who previously served as Senate President Pro Tem, announced late last week that he is running this year to succeed his boss, State Auditor Doug Hoffer. Hoffer — who is also a D/P — is stepping down after a dozen years as the top state government watchdog. 
In a press release, Ashe said he would “work with the executive and legislative branches to identify risks to Vermonters’ interests, such as financial mismanagement, inadequate preparation for weather-related emergencies, and the policies of President Trump.”

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Fifty immigrant detainees at a New Mexico jail say they’ve been largely unable to receive or send mail, including time-sensitive legal documents, for more than a month, according to letters provided to Source New Mexico.
Detainees at Torrance County Detention Facility from Mexico, Venezuela, Cameroon, Cuba, Portugal, Belarus, India, the United Kingdom and other countries signed two open letters dated mid-December that Source New Mexico received via email Friday.
“The postal service (USPS) is not working, or is working very poorly and intermittently,”  the letters say in Spanish. “This is very damaging and detrimental to us (ICE detainees) because we cannot, for example, receive essential evidence for our defense within the proper timeframes, nor can we send important and vital documents such as appeals, habeas corpus petitions, and others. For example, this past week the mailperson came only once to deliver mail and never to pick it up.”
A CoreCivic spokesman denied the allegations regarding the mail interruption.
The uproar over mail at the facility in Estancia occurs as the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency begins paying private prison operator CoreCivic about $300,000 more per month to provide services under a modified contract county officials approved without debate last week.
Until the contract abruptly expired Oct. 31, 2025, ICE paid CoreCivic about $2.1 million a month to house detainees. It did so via an agreement with Torrance County, which receives the payments from ICE and then passes them along to CoreCivic.  
The contract’s abrupt expiration ended those payments and prompted renewed calls from advocates and U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, for ICE leaders to explain what authority the agency had to continue housing detainees at the jail without a contract in place. He never received a response, according to his office. 
Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

ICE and CoreCivic refused to say what prompted the expiration or why it took so long to negotiate an extension. Then on Dec. 30, the Torrance County Commission met to approve a new contract that pays CoreCivic $2.4 million a month, backdated to Nov. 1 through April of this year. 
The modified contract also appears to allow the company to reduce its staffing requirements to 85% of what is typical, though ICE, CoreCivic and county officials did not respond to Source’s questions about the provision. 
Detainees and advocates at Innovation Law Lab, a Portland-based immigrant advocacy group that conducts weekly jail visits, told Source NM the mailroom issue has been ongoing for more than a month. They say it resulted after an employee who used to run the mailroom left without being replaced. 
Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, told Source that CoreCivic should not be receiving more funding when it has not been adequately providing services. 
“It is absolutely egregious that CoreCivic would be rewarded with a more-lucrative contract, while they’re simultaneously failing to meet their contractual obligations, including the most basic tenets of due process,” he said. 
Brian Todd, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, told Source on Monday, in response to a list of questions submitted last week about the inmates’ complaints about the mail service, that their allegations are “false.” For other questions about the extended contract, he referred Source to an ICE spokesperson, who did not respond to a request for comment. 
Private prison operators like CoreCivic that subcontract with ICE to house detainees are contractually obligated to provide adequate mail services, according to ICE’s Performance-Based National Detention Standards. The standards say detainees “shall be able to correspond with their families, the community, legal representatives, government offices and consular officials consistent with the safe and orderly operation of the facility,” and that incoming and outgoing letters shall be held for no more than 24 hours.
Newly released data shows sharp decline of inmates at New Mexico ICE facility 

Alexie Taylor, the brother of Jamaican detainee Andre Taylor, told Source New Mexico on Monday that mail delays put his brother in jeopardy of being deported. Public records show a judge issued a final deportation order on Nov. 17, giving Andre Taylor 30 days to file an appeal. 
According to his brother, Andre Taylor prepared all the necessary materials by Dec. 9, more than a week before the Dec. 17 deadline, and paid express postage to deliver his appeal to the federal Board of Immigration Appeals in Virginia. Alexie Taylor said that according to his brother, the jail staff did not send the document until Dec. 18.
Two weeks later, ICE transferred Andre Taylor from Estancia to a detention facility in El Paso, which is often the last stop before deportation. He’s being held there now and exploring what options remain, if any, to plead his case to the appeal board about missing a deadline through no fault of his own, Alexie Taylor said. 
Todd at CoreCivic did not immediately respond to Source’s question about Andre Taylor’s case. But the alleged mail delay is just the latest violation his brother has faced in more than eight months of detention, Alexie told Source, “so honestly I’m not surprised,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3109-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 18:58:22.563937

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceCourt of Claims Judge Sima G. Patel on Monday denied the state of Michigan’s request to rehear a motion to toss a lawsuit filed by cannabis industry advocates against the 24% wholesale tax on marijuana which took effect on Jan. 1.
In October the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association filed a lawsuit against the state, arguing that the Legislature’s decision to create a 24% tax on wholesale marijuana violates the state constitution by modifying the 2018 law established when Michigan voters approved a ballot proposal legalizing recreational marijuana in Michigan. 
Industry advocates have also warned that the tax would bring irreparable harm to Michigan’s marijuana industry, forcing small retailers out of business and pushing buyers into the black market. 
In her early December ruling, Patel largely rebuffed arguments from industry advocates, denying the association’s request to block the wholesale tax from taking effect alongside its request to have the case resolved without a full trial. 
However she did permit the case to move to trial, raising questions on whether the Legislature’s decision to create the tax violates the intent of the initiated law, partially denying a similar request from the state to resolve the matter without moving to trial. 
While the state filed a motion to have their request reconsidered, Patel denied it on Monday, determining that there had been no palpable error in her previous ruling and reemphasizing that questions of fact remained around the new tax violates the purpose of the 2018 law.
“It is not certain on this record whether the 24% wholesale excise tax will impact prices to the extent purchasers will be driven to the illicit marijuana market,” Patel wrote. “Discovery is required to examine how the tax will impact the purposes of the [voter initiated law.]”
Rose Tantraphol, the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association’s spokesperson, called Monday’s decision a win for voters and the industry. 
“In issuing this order, the court recognizes the serious questions about whether this discriminatory tax violates the intent of the cannabis legalization that Michigan voters approved in 2018,” Tantraphol said. “We’re looking forward to making our case that this tax will push Michiganders, who are already feeling stretched financially, into the illicit market.”
In a separate filing, the association has asked the Michigan Court of Appeals to hear the case, arguing it would allow them to pursue the full range of arguments they made in their initial lawsuit.

Though Wyoming politicos regard Trump's actions as necessary, oil executives do not anticipate immediate windfall.
The post Venezuela takeover has Wyoming oil industry bracing for market changes appeared first on WyoFile .","Soon after Saturday’s military raid in Caracas and the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump said the U.S. will “run” Venezuela for the time being, and that U.S. oil companies will “spend billions of dollars” to fix the country’s oil infrastructure and presumably increase oil sales.
Many politicos assert that wresting access to Venezuela’s oil — the world’s largest reserves — from adversarial nations such as China and Russia is ultimately an advantage for the U.S. Trump’s actions drew praise from Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming. 
Yet, the situation doesn’t immediately appear to be a windfall for Wyoming or its producers.
“I don’t know that many of the smaller or even intermediate-type companies are going to want to go down to Venezuela,” said Peter Wold, a partner in Casper-based Wold Oil Properties. “That would be a big jump.
“We would not be interested in doing that,” Wold added. “We have attempted international drilling and production, and it’s difficult. It takes a lot bigger company and deeper pockets than anything that we’ve got.”

More practically, Wold indicated, oil producers big and small rely on strong market prices and production fields where there’s political stability to ensure a return on investment. He agreed with recent assessments that it will take years to stabilize and significantly increase Venezuelan oil production. And if that happens, it may be to the detriment of Wyoming producers that provide a significant source of tax revenue in the state.
“I think any kind of increase in production [in Venezuela] is going to see a reduction in the price of crude oil, and that would impact Wyoming’s oil and gas producers,” Wold said.
A glut in global oil supply sapped U.S. market prices for much of 2025, according to federal sources, including a 15% drop in spot prices for Wyoming producers from October 2024 to October 2025, according to a University of Wyoming analysis. 
“We’re getting close to marginal prices here where people are going to cut back on their drilling capitalization,” Wold said, noting that spot prices in the low $50 per barrel range gives many operators pause when it comes to coaxing production. The daily spot price that most Wyoming producers track stood at about $57 per barrel on Monday.

For now, oil market watchers are generally on edge as the aftermath of U.S. actions in Venezuela still plays out globally.
“Oil is a global commodity and, as such, any shock to the system will impact prices,” Petroleum Association of Wyoming Vice President and Director of Communications Ryan McConnaughey told WyoFile via email. 
“It will likely take more than $100 billion in investment and 10 years of stability before we see much in increased oil exports from the South American country,” McConnaughey added. “We at PAW believe that the best case for national security, environmental responsibility and economic prosperity is to continue development of natural resources right here at home, regardless of external factors.”
Chevron is the only major U.S. producer active in Venezuela. While the company had been active in the Cowboy State for decades, it shed most of its assets here about 10 years ago. Two other global producers with historic ties to Wyoming, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, mostly exited Venezuela under then-President Hugo Chavez, according to national reports. ExxonMobil operates the Shute Creek gas plant in western Wyoming, while ConocoPhillips has divested much of its Wyoming assets. 
Though final calculations have not yet been tallied, Wyoming oil production was on track to total about 106 million barrels for 2025, likely securing a spot among the nation’s top 10 oil-producing states, according to state data. About 80% of the state’s oil production comes from the Powder River Basin in the northeast.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s $340 million settlement with the owner of the Conowingo Dam can now move forward, after a group of Eastern Shore counties dropped their challenge of the deal.
The withdrawal came less than a month after the administrative appeal was originally filed. Officials at the Maryland Department of the Environment, which brokered the key settlement deal, had lobbied hard for the handful of counties to back down.
That’s because the appeal had the potential to derail or delay the funds from dam owner Constellation, which are designated for various environmental projects. The state negotiated to receive the funds in exchange for issuing the hydroelectric dam a crucial water quality certification, which it needs in order to obtain a 50-year license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
“We are very excited to move out of the courtroom and into action. After nearly a decade of legal challenges we can now put this $340M to work to accelerate progress on the Bay,” wrote Maryland Department of the Environment spokesperson Dave Abrams in a statement. “Thank you to the local governments who worked closely with us to reach this resolution. We are all on the same team and will work closely with them and other stakeholders as we move forward.”
After Maryland officials promised counties they could have input on the rollout of the environmental projects in the settlement, several counties pulled out in late December. Cecil County — which hosts the dam and has complained about the impacts of sediment build-up — was the final hold-out, but dropped out on Friday.
“Over the holidays, MDE and Cecil County Government held productive, transparent discussions that clarified the settlement and secured assurances on Upper Shore project focus, municipal reimbursement for sediment and debris damage, front-loading $18.7 million for dredging studies, and Cecil County’s participation in an advisory council with other Shore counties. As our concerns were addressed, we felt comfortable withdrawing our appeal,” wrote Cecil County spokesperson Robert Royster in a statement.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The counties had expressed frustration that they were not given input on the settlement arrangement until after it was made final. But the negotiations were confidential, because they were also meant to resolve litigation between the state, Constellation and several waterkeepers groups who intervened. The Eastern Shore counties did not intervene in that legal battle.
The appeal was filed by an advocacy group called the Clean Chesapeake Coalition, which includes many Eastern Shore county officials who have long voiced frustration with the dam’s impact on the environment, and specifically the Chesapeake Bay.
The dam, which was built in 1928, once trapped damaging pollutants racing down the Susquehanna River, which contributes about half of the bay’s fresh water, and serves as its largest tributary. But now, the reservoir behind the dam is essentially full, meaning it can no longer trap sediment, and can release large amounts during storm events, with the potential to bury underwater life, and carry harmful nutrient pollution along with it.
Under the settlement, Constellation will put tens of millions of dollars toward tree and underwater grass planting, improvements to fish passage, trash and debris removal and invasive species remediation.
But the agreement also includes provisions about an oft-discussed but controversial strategy for dealing with the dam’s sediment: dredging. Over the next 25 years, Constellation will pay $18.7 million into a fund focused on dredging. But first, all eyes are on an upcoming study from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which will assess whether dredging the Conowingo reservoir is advisable.
If the Army Corps determines dredging is feasible, Maryland can use the funds from Constellation to conduct further study or begin the permitting process for dredging. If the Army Corps deems dredging inadvisable, Maryland can designate the money for other environmental purposes.
For now, though, Constellation will be focused on obtaining its 50-year license from FERC after a federal court reversed the last one. That occurred because Maryland had not issued a water quality certification for Conowingo, instead waiving its right to do so. This time, Maryland has issued the certification, and is aiming for its conditions to be incorporated into the dam’s new federal license to operate.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC06857-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 18:58:22.563937

(Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Three more confirmed cases of measles have been reported in Nebraska’s Platte County, bringing the total reported over the past week to four, state health officials announced Monday. All four are in the same household.
Two of the cases still are in the infectious stage, which lasts nine days, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. So far, the state health agency reports no evidence that the spread of the highly contagious airborne disease moved into the larger community.
Due to privacy concerns, state health officials offered no further information on the affected patients or household. The initial case was reported Dec. 30 and involved an unvaccinated child with a history of travel to Arizona.
As a result, the East Central District Health Department will host vaccine clinics this week: Monday, Jan. 5, from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at 4321 41 Ave. in Columbus and Friday, Jan. 9, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. at 822 15 St.
DHHS officials said in a statement that immunization is the most effective way to protect against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. 
Children should receive the first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age, followed by a second dose between four and six years of age, health officials said. DHHS recommends Platte County parents of infants ages 6 to 11 months consult their healthcare provider to discuss early MMR vaccination.

Dr. Sydney Stein, the state epidemiologist, encouraged all Nebraskans to contact their healthcare provider to check their vaccination status against measles. 
“If you have not had two doses of MMR vaccine, talk to your healthcare provider or local health department right away,” she said in a statement.
There is no specific treatment for measles. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of Dec. 31, a total of 2,065 cases of measles had been reported in 2025, and three deaths had been confirmed. 
Last year’s number was reported as the highest annually since measles was declared eliminated in the country in 2000.
State officials have said individuals present at the following public places on the dates provided could have been exposed: 

Shell Creek Baptist Church in Columbus, Dec. 24, 4:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.

The state asks individuals who were at those spots between those times to fill out a risk assessment survey. Those needing help filling out the survey or with internet access are encouraged to call East Central District Health Department at 402-562-8969.

A federal judge on Monday declined to dismiss one of three criminal charges facing Rep. LaMonica McIver, a Democratic congresswoman who is accused of assaulting federal agents outside a Newark immigration detention facility last year.
The decision comes nearly two months after the same judge denied McIver’s pretrial motions to dismiss the other two charges. McIver has filed notice that she is appealing the earlier order.
In the new, eight-page decision, U.S. District Court Judge Jamel K. Semper rejects McIver’s arguments that her actions are shielded by the U.S. Constitution’s speech or debate clause, which protects lawmakers from prosecution for official legislative actions. McIver has argued that she was at migrant jail Delaney Hall on the day in question to perform oversight duties and cannot be charged with a crime for what transpired during the visit.
“The Court cannot find that Defendant’s alleged conduct was legislative in nature,” Semper wrote. “Her conduct was not tied to potential legislation or any other policy-making purpose.”
Oversight visit brings Rep. McIver back to migrant jail at center of her criminal case

McIver is accused of assaulting officers during the chaotic scene that unfolded outside Delaney Hall on May 9 when agents moved to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka for trespassing (a charge that was later dropped). Prosecutors later charged McIver, alleging she shoved officers as they detained Baraka.
McIver was indicted on three counts. Semper in November allowed counts one and three to move forward, but said he needed to learn more facts before deciding whether count two should be dismissed.
Monday’s ruling says Semper initially believed that the officer at the center of count two’s allegations initiated contact with McIver by preventing her from entering Delaney Hall’s property. But video later introduced as evidence shows McIver initiated physical contact with the officer, according to the ruling.
McIver, who joined Congress in 2024, pleaded not guilty in June and last week said she plans to appeal Semper’s earlier ruling on her motions to dismiss the charges. She faces up to 17 years in prison if convicted on all three counts.
Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“From the beginning, I’ve fought back against this administration’s cruelty and attempts to silence dissent—this appeal is the next step in the fight. The Trump administration’s case is dangerous, baseless, and designed to stop me from doing my job. I won’t,” she said in a statement last week.

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)State Rep. Carla Cunningham, the Charlotte Democrat who sparked controversy in July 2025 with a House floor speech castigating immigrants, filed a petition Monday asking a Mecklenburg County judge to remove Sheriff Garry McFadden from office.
Mecklenburg Co. Sheriff’s Office Public Information Manager Sarah Mastouri said the sheriff is aware of the complaint, but declined to comment.  
According to the petition, McFadden called Cunningham to lobby her not to vote to override Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of House Bill 318, which requires sheriffs to hold ICE detainees without a warrant for 48 hours. 
McFadden had been a vocal critic of the bill, which he said would damage his office’s relationship with the immigrant community in Mecklenburg County and lead to higher jail costs. 
According to Cunningham’s sworn affidavit, McFadden said to her that the people in her district would “come after” her if she voted to override the veto, and said, “I don’t want to see you get hurt; you live in my county.”
Cunningham, the affidavit says, understood those statements to be “a threat by McFadden to either physically harm her, or to withdraw or refuse her any protection from members of the public who would physically harm her.”
The petition alleges that McFadden was attempting to extort or bribe Cunningham to change her vote to override the veto. 
Cunningham’s controversial floor speech during H318 veto override vote angered many immigrants and advocates as well as members of her own party, who accused her of working with Republican leaders to undermine the governor. 
Cunningham has said she received violent threats and had to hire private security in the aftermath. The longtime lawmaker is facing several primary challengers in March.
NC Newsline asked Cunningham’s spokeswoman Kate Payne if the lawmaker had a recording or any other evidence of the conversation. Payne did not immediately respond. 
The petition was jointly signed by several former sheriff’s office employees who also accuse McFadden of misuse of resources, retaliation against whistleblowers, understaffing the detention center and other alleged misconduct.
The filing of the complaint comes the same day N.C. House Republican leaders announced they’ve subpoenaed McFadden to appear before an oversight committee Jan. 22 to testify about the killing of Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte transit in August 2025, and to answer questions about allegations that he is still promoting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in defiance of a state law prohibiting them.
McFadden, a Democrat in his eighth year as sheriff, is seeking a third term in 2026.

Net general revenue totaled $618.6 million, which was $7.8 million below December 2024 collections and $5.8 million below the forecast amount, the Department of Finance and Administration said.
The state’s net revenue for the fiscal year, which began July 1, totals $3.4 billion. That’s nearly $103 million above forecast.
Arkansas has consistently lowered corporate income taxes over the past few years. As of June 2024, the top corporate income tax rate is 4.3%, a decrease from 5.1% since April 2023.
Corporate income tax collections in December totaled $78.1 million, a decrease of $3.4 million from December 2024 and $5.5 million below the forecast amount.
Gross general revenue and individual income tax refunds were both above projected amounts, according to the report. Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson called the state’s revenue collections stable. 
“The department will issue an updated forecast in late January for the remainder of fiscal year 2026 and for fiscal year 2027 in preparation for the upcoming fiscal legislative session,” Hudson said in a statement. 
Arkansas lawmakers are set to return to the Capitol in April for a legislative session intended to focus primarily on the state’s budget.

(USDA/FPAC photo by Preston Keres)An animal tested positive for brucellosis in Gallatin County, the state Department of Livestock reported in late December.
The state received confirmation that the animal was positive on Dec. 24, and the herd has been quarantined and an epidemiological investigation is “ongoing,” a news release said. 
The Department of Livestock does not identify the species of animal as a rule for confidentiality.
Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that can spread between animals, attacking their reproductive system, and can cause abortions in pregnant cattle, elk and bison. The disease can be transmitted to humans, though Montana hasn’t had a positive human case in nearly a decade.
The surveillance areas are in southern and southwestern Montana, and are mostly areas near Yellowstone National Park. Some Yellowstone bison and elk test positive for brucellosis and can move up and intermingle with populations not in the park boundary.
While the source of the brucellosis transmission is not currently known for the Gallatin County animal, all 14 prior tests have come back as transmission from elk, the press release said.
The positive test is the 15th since 2010, when the Designated Surveillance Areas were put in place, the release said. The most recent case, prior to the Gallatin County one, was in Beaverhead County last year.
“Detections of brucellosis are inevitably burdensome for an operation,” Dr. Tahnee Szymanski, state veterinarian, said in a release. “Our goal at Montana Department of Livestock is that the work that (Designated Surveillance Area) producers do on an annual basis can be leveraged towards a highly tailored and focused investigation that reduces the impact to an operation when brucellosis is found.”
The state also outlined what disease investigations look like in the release, saying they may look as far as three years back in the herd’s history to see if the disease can be traced to  any other herds.
“In this case, the affected herd does not utilize shared grazing, has a minimal number of herds that run adjacent, and conducts voluntary annual whole herd testing, resulting in a relatively small scope investigation,” the state press release said.
The Gallatin County animal in question was caught via “voluntary whole-herd testing” and was pregnant at the time of the positive test. 
The animal “was removed from the herd before she was able to spread the disease through an abortion or during calving,” the release said, allowing the herd to be quarantined with “no expected impacts” to routine management practices.
Montana is considered to be brucellosis free, called “Class Free,” an important designation in the beef industry — if the state didn’t have it, livestock exported from anywhere in the state would need to be tested. Right now, only animals in what are called “Designated Surveillance Areas” are tested, to the tune of about 100,000 tests per year. It’s not cheap either — those tests ring up to more than $600,000 annually. 
Vaccinations of cattle against brucellosis are also required to be performed by a licensed veterinarian. Vaccination requirements also apply to seasonal grazers.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/52101044245_24d4c26759_k-1024x617.jpg,,,2026-01-05 18:12:28.217469

(Photo by David Talukdar/Getty Images)Fairfield’s Maharishi Foundation USA is suing a former student of transcendental meditation, claiming unfair competition and trademark infringement.
Maharashi University USA Inc. is suing Leif Bjelland of Missoula, Montana, and his company, Transcend Today, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
The foundation and its predecessors and affiliates have been providing instruction in transcendental meditation for 60 years. The foundation claims the practice is a proprietary form of meditation that can only be taught by the foundation’s program and its licensees and that the phrase “transcendental meditation” has been trademarked.
According to the lawsuit, Bjelland was a student in the program around 2020, attending trainings and workshops offered by the foundation. As a student, Bjelland is alleged to have completed a form in which he agreed the transcendental meditation techniques he learned would be for his own personal use and that he would not “instruct or impart the transcendental meditation technique” until he was certified by the foundation to do so.
The lawsuit claims Bjelland subsequently applied for a “Transcend Today” trademark to sell hoodies, T-shirts, sleep masks, yoga tops, baseball caps and beach hats, while offering single- or multisession workshops in what his Montana company calls “Heroic Breathwork.”
In its lawsuit, the foundation claims the name “Transcend Today” is “confusingly similar” to the foundation’s trademarked designs, and that it is being used to compete with the self-improvement, health and personal development services for which the foundation uses its trademarks.
The lawsuit alleges Transcend Today informs prospective clients and customers that the business operates “at your home over Zoom” and that it functions “over Zoom within the spaces you feel most comfortable.” As a result, the foundation claims, Transcend Today has caused its products to be sold in Iowa while infringing on the trademarks of the foundation.
According to the lawsuit, legal counsel for the foundation informed Bjelland in August 2025 that his “Transcend Today” trademark infringed on those of the foundation and that while Bjelland initially agreed to cancel his “Transcend Today” trademark, he later changed course and decided to maintain it.
The foundation alleges it has “been damaged, and is likely to be further damaged, specifically through the loss of competitive advantage in the market and revenue associated with sales regarding or participation in its transcendental meditation programs.”
Bjelland has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach him for comment.
On his website, Bjelland describes himself as a “breathwork facilitator, TEDx speaker, and founder of Heroic Breath.” The site describes Heroic Breathwork as a “sound-driven breathwork experience” that can calm the nervous system, reduce anxiety and enhance self-awareness.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota’s dairy industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades, but an industry leader warned Monday that maintaining the momentum could depend partly on the number of workers allowed into the United States.
During a Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary panel discussion focused on the state’s dairy industry, Tim den Dulk, a dairy farmer and processor, was asked if uncertainty around labor is a concern. The federal government has implemented stricter immigration enforcement during the current Trump administration.
“We expect it to be extremely difficult to find employees, especially if we don’t allow more laborers in,” den Dulk said.
The dairy industry in the state has been affected by immigration enforcement actions. Drumgoon Dairy, near Lake Norden, lost 38 of its 50 employees this summer after a federal Department of Homeland Security audit flagged workers for inaccurate, outdated or incomplete proof of U.S. citizenship or permission to work in the country.
Noem’s South Dakota neighbors hit with an immigration audit that decimates their workforce

Former Gov. Dennis Daugaard moderated the Monday discussion and opened it with a look back at the dairy industry’s growth. The number of dairy cows in the state increased 165% from 2006 to 2025, and is expected to grow another 18% this year to 253,475 cows. Most of the growth has taken place along the Interstate 29 corridor in the eastern part of the state. Panelists said the growth has helped generate jobs and broaden the state’s agricultural economy.
However, without a reliable pipeline of workers, den Dulk said the industry’s recent growth could be hard to sustain.
“We could pay some people $35, $40 an hour to milk a cow, and I still don’t think we would get them to be milkers for a 12-hour shift, five to six days a week,” he said. 
South Dakota also has the nation’s lowest unemployment rate, at 2%.
Jake Anderson, plant director at Bel Brands USA in Brookings, discussed the company’s ongoing expansion aimed at doubling production of its Mini Babybel cheese wheels. Anderson said a key strategy for staying competitive in the job market is positioning the company as an employer of choice, including offering higher wages.
“Certainly, it is something that we do need to keep an eye on,” Anderson said of workforce challenges. “It is certainly on the top of a lot of organizations’ minds.”

Upper Missouri Waterkeeper has sued the Montana Department of Environmental Quality alleging an unconstitutional failure of public process and lack of environmental review for a major sewer pipeline in Big Sky.
Waterkeeper, a nonprofit with a mission to protect and restore water in the Upper Missouri River Basin, said the DEQ is taking up smaller portions of a major regional wastewater system individually, but it said the agency must review the project as a whole.
Waterkeeper recently announced a Gallatin County District Court judge found the DEQ didn’t take a “hard look” at water quality impacts on the Gallatin River in a different case the nonprofit had filed about a proposed subdivision.
Also in Gallatin County District Court, the most recent lawsuit brings challenges related to the new pipeline that’s part of the larger Gallatin Canyon Sewer Project, a regional wastewater collection, treatment and disposal plan the plaintiffs estimate will push disposal gallons per day from as much as 120,000 to an estimated 600,000.
The plan is jointly proposed by the Gallatin Canyon County Water & Sewer District and Big Sky County Water & Sewer District. The DEQ has permitting and review authority over it.
The lawsuit said the pipeline project entails roughly 5,000 linear feet of sewage line and a second, treated effluent main line (two pipelines) adjacent to Highway 64 and running parallel to “reaches of the West Fork Gallatin River.”
The project collects sewage in Big Sky’s Canyon Area, a development corridor along the Gallatin. It moves it for treatment up to the Big Sky County Water & Sewer District, and then moves the treated wastewater back to the Canyon Area for disposal through a groundwater discharge permit being considered by the DEQ, the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit alleges the DEQ has failed to provide for meaningful public participation in the project, in violation of the Montana Constitution, and it’s making decisions before completing an analysis of significant environmental impacts.
The lawsuit also alleges the project could increase harms to the middle segment of the Gallatin River, already impacted with algal blooms, and even be a detriment to drinking water for people downstream.
Parts of the river are considered impaired by the Environmental Protection Agency.
In a statement, Guy Alsentzer of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper said the DEQ is blocking the public from participating in decisions that have significant public interest and deserve transparency.
For example, an impairment determination and related restoration plan for the Gallatin River drew more than 1,000 public comments, the lawsuit said.
“Massive infrastructure projects being approved behind closed doors, without public participation, is antithetical to democracy,” Alsentzer said in a statement. “DEQ is stacking the deck by considering pieces of a regional wastewater system in isolation.
“The public deserves — and the Montana Constitution guarantees — a transparent decision-making process that reviews the whole picture.”
He said the pipeline is integral to a pending new municipal-scale discharge permit application, but the public is being illegally shut out of decisions about it.
The lawsuit said the nonprofit only learned about the DEQ’s decisions in November from a public records request it filed under the Right to Know of the Montana Constitution.
But that was months after the DEQ approved a critical application for the pipeline, one at which the project would become viable or would stop, the lawsuit said. And the approval took place June 18 without any public notice or public participation opportunities and without any published environmental reviews, the lawsuit said.
It alleges the DEQ failed to perform any review under the Montana Environmental Policy Act, or MEPA, for the pipeline project, and it also failed to complete a review of the larger wastewater project.
In fact, the lawsuit said DEQ has been reviewing multiple segments of the same project, without meaningful environmental review or public participation, in an action the plaintiff alleges is a “systemic failure” that ignores the potential the overall project could be “cumulatively significant.”
In an email, a spokesperson for the DEQ said the agency does not typically comment on litigation and does not have comment at this time.
The Waterkeeper is asking the court to declare the DEQ violated the right to know and right to participate under the Montana Constitution; that it violated MEPA by failing to perform environmental analysis and by segmenting its reviews of the wastewater project; and that its “informal pattern” of exempting smaller projects from public participation requirements is unconstitutional.
The Waterkeeper also asks the court to vacate the approval of the pipeline project application and remand it for public processes. It asks the court to stop the DEQ from authorizing any action connected to the wastewater project until after it has completed environmental reviews.

The 32-page SB 1052, filed Monday by Vero Beach Republican Sen. Erin Grall, instructs public colleges and universities to exclusively admit students who are “citizen[s] of the United States” or “lawfully present therein.”
It also would prevent migrants illegally in the country from participating in state-funded adult general education programs, which include classes for GED and English as a second language that help “adult learners gain the knowledge and skills they need to enter and succeed in postsecondary education,” as defined on the Department of Education’s website.

This builds off of a provision in a Feb. 2025 law that nixed all in-state tuition for undocumented college students.
Grall’s bill comes amid a crackdown on undocumented immigration that surged in early 2025 when President Donald Trump re-took office. Trump’s administration soon imposed a deportation quota for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, increased the cost for certain work visas, and supported states like Florida that are building their own detention centers.
Florida became the first and only state to require all 67 counties to enter into 287(g) agreements, which are state- and local-level partnerships with ICE.
SB 1052, which doesn’t have a companion measure in the House yet, also would strike the requirement for a gender-equity plan in intercollegiate athletics.
Although the measure still demands universities comply with the Title IX prohibition on discrimination in athletic programs, the Florida College System would not have to draw up plans to consider equity in sports offerings, participation, availability of facilities, scholarship offerings, and funds allocated for administration, recruitment, comparable coaching, publicity and promotion, and other support costs.
This would rewrite a 2001 state law requiring these plans as extensions of Title IX protections.
Grall’s bill includes a waiver certain tuition fees for active members of the Florida State Guard.
Grall’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The classroom in Brown University’s Barus & Holley building where a shooting killed two students and injured nine others will remain walled off and sealed away in the upcoming spring semester, school officials announced Monday.  
“We know that resuming operations in Barus & Holley is particularly sensitive, and extensive work has taken place over the Winter Break to alter operations,” the school’s President Christina H. Paxson wrote in a letter Monday, adding that some of the spring semester’s engineering and physics classes will be relocated due to the closure of two lecture halls and eight classrooms in the building.
Paxson announced Monday that Brown is embarking on another initiative to process the campus’ collective trauma: Brown Ever True, a broad effort to strengthen the school’s mental health and community support offerings after the Dec. 13 shooting. 
Paxson wrote that Brown Ever True will consolidate certain university resources, programming and services to assist students, staff and faculty in what she described as the “gradual process” of recovering from the traumatic event.  
“The effects of Dec. 13 may surface in uncertain ways,” Paxson wrote. “And ‘recovery’ will at times seem elusive.” 
The university’s new initiative will be “informed by medical and public health experts and scholars who specialize in trauma,” Paxson wrote, and it adopts efforts at other colleges that have experienced similar tragedies. Brown Ever True will incorporate ideas and feedback from across student organizations and Brown’s administrative units — including campus life, human resources, and the college’s School of Public Health — to “help ensure that the initiative reflects what our community needs to heal and move forward,” Paxson added.
Paxson’s announcement comes roughly two weeks before the start of the school’s spring semester. The winter session began on Dec. 20 and will end on Jan. 20, a day before the spring semester begins. Paxson wrote that the recovery initiative is meant to prepare the Brown community ahead of the new semester and to help them feel safe in their surroundings.
Over winter break, Paxson wrote, the school is offering remote options for students such as TimelyCare Teletherapy and BetterHelp, and she stressed that counseling services and staff will be readily available to students when they return to campus later this month.
The university has also widened its support for employees. Faculty and staff could access an additional dozen counseling sessions through the end of 2025 via the school’s Employee Assistance Program, and the university is working with its provider Spring Health for similar offerings in 2026. 
Additional sessions and programming focusing on resiliency will be organized through the school’s diversity office and faculty in the Warren Alpert Medical School, with more details to arrive via the Brown Ever True website. The website currently includes an evolving, searchable list of on- and off-campus resources including 24/7 hotlines, counseling providers, chaplains, and mindfulness and meditation sessions.
Additionally, the university is planning a service for sometime in late January to remember Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, the two students who were killed in the attack.
“While all the injured students now have been released from the hospital, they and so many others continue to navigate through very real challenges of coping with tragedy,” Paxson wrote.
As of Monday morning, all nine students who were hospitalized with gunshot wounds had been discharged, according to Rhode Island Hospital spokesperson Kelly Brennan.
New carpets and paint 
A Dec. 23 letter from Brown’s Provost Francis J. Doyle III specified that the “sensitive areas” in the Barus & Holley building will remain inaccessible for now, as the school is being “mindful of the concerns that many community members have raised about continuing to use those spaces.”  
Among these spaces is lecture hall 166, where the shooting happened at the end of a review for an economics final. Barus & Holley mainly houses physics and engineering classes in addition to research activities. 
Room 166 and 168 will be sealed off — secured behind new walls and emergency access doors, Doyle wrote — and have their basement level access cut off. Eight classrooms and the hallways, bathrooms and entrances adjacent or close to the shooting site will be inaccessible, Doyle wrote, and basically hidden from view. 
“None of the closed areas will be visible to occupants and users of adjacent spaces, and no one will be able or allowed to enter those spaces,” Doyle wrote. “Nearby first-floor hallways that have a similar look and feel to the closed spaces will be updated with paint and carpet to change that look and feel.”
The school has not made any long-term decisions regarding the classrooms’ future, but Doyle noted that “the future of that area of the building, including consideration of appropriate memorialization, will be made over time in consultation and conversation with the Brown community.”
The Barus & Holley building comprises 117 laboratories, 150 offices, 15 classrooms, 29 laboratory classrooms and three lecture halls. 
While “most of the building remains generally closed while this work is ongoing,” Paxson wrote Monday, a “limited” number of people who will need to work in the non-restricted areas of the Barus & Holley, plus other physics and engineering research spaces on campus, are expected to regain building access before spring semester.
Doyle noted in his letter that “[t]he remainder” of Barus & Holley plus the “vast majority of the School of Engineering and Department of Physics complex will reopen in time for the spring semester,” while the closed areas will remain “inaccessible to everyone.”  
The non-restricted areas are expected to have their general access restored by Jan. 20, according to Paxson’s letter.

Steps to enhance campus security 
Alongside the mental wellness initiative, Brown’s new interim top public safety official  — the former Providence police chief Hugh T. Clements Jr. — announced on Dec. 30 a lineup of elevated public safety measures.
Under Clements’ leadership, the school is installing more security officers across academic buildings, residence halls, and events. The increased staffing will roll out in phases, Clements wrote, and will be “aligned with the ramp-up of operations and the increase of students, faculty and staff on campus as we transition from the lesser density of the holiday break and Winter Session, to the Jan. 6 end of the administrative Winter Break and resumption of medical school courses, to the start of the second semester on Jan. 21.” 
Brown will deploy additional officers via “coordinated mutual aid from partner agencies and well-trained private security resources” to ensure coverage of campus areas as needed, Clements wrote. 
“Buildings also will continue to require card access, a key or displaying a University ID for entry,” Clements wrote.
Also on Clements’ to-do list before the spring semester: Transitioning all buildings with key access to card access, expanding and installing cameras on blue light phones, and adding more surveillance cameras and panic buttons in select locations across campus.
Clements assumed his interim role on Dec. 22, when Brown announced it was temporarily suspending police chief Rodney Chatman amid a pair of investigations into the shooting commissioned by the school’s governing body, the Corporation of Brown University. Chatman’s leave was preceded by a no-confidence vote in Chatman from the school’s police union in October 2025, the Brown Daily Herald reported then.
Clements promised a change in public perception during his tenure: “[Y]ou will see a public safety leadership team that listens and acts,” Clements wrote. “Over the coming weeks, I will be active across campus listening, learning and working alongside colleagues to ensure that our approach is responsive, thoughtful and grounded in care for the people of this community and the values of Brown.”
“Our goal is not to create a campus defined by fear, but one defined by preparedness, vigilance and mutual care,” Clements added. 
The corporation commissioned two reviews from outside firms: One examining what happened leading up to the shooting and its aftermath and the school’s response and a more thorough assessment of Brown’s entire security systems and policies. Both are ongoing, according to Paxson’s most recent letter.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN —  Nebraska officials explored the statewide implications if the U.S. gets involved in a major war or “armed conflict” as part of a new state report issued this month on external threats. 
Gov.  Jim Pillen briefed the press Monday on the new legislatively required annual threat assessment. He was joined by Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, and Adj. Gen. Craig Strong at the Nebraska National Guard Air Base. 
The report comes after four meetings last year of the 11-member, legislatively created Committee on Pacific Conflict, required by a 2024 law from State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln. The group met to discuss the state’s vulnerabilities in agriculture, infrastructure, telecommunications and cybersecurity with experts. It includes four lawmakers, the lieutenant governor and the adjutant general. 
Kelly, a former prosecutor, said this year’s report focused on agricultural security. The report focuses on who owns farmland in the state and how it’s being used — especially land near military installations. Kelly said the committee will look into how the state should respond to “any threats by bad actors here in Nebraska when it relates to our farm security and our economy and our citizens.”
“We know that here in Nebraska, our defense starts with the 44 million acres of land that are in ag production,” Kelly said.
Strong praised another 2024 law, authored by state Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara, which updated an 1889 state law prohibiting certain entities from purchasing Nebraska ag land, primarily people and corporations with ties to countries that the U.S. Commerce Department deems foreign adversaries.

Bostar and U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., a former speaker of the Legislature, had highlighted the need to prevent foreign adversaries from buying land near military installations.
Nebraska is home to key U.S. military infrastructure, including Strategic Air Command near Omaha and to 80 intercontinental ballistic missile launch facilities and nine alert facilities, all serving national security.
Much of the press conference Monday discussed China and the national and state security threat of being too reliant on Beijing. Nebraska has passed its own laws focused on foreign adversaries that have partly focused on the country. 
Pillen said the U.S. has “been duped that we can buy happiness by buying cheap crap from China” and that the “greatest form” of security for the state is buying from “Main Street Nebraska” instead.

Last year, the state committee described China as a threat to Nebraska. Then, as now, Pillen and legislative leaders have expressed concerns about Chinese ownership of American ag land. Pillen has issued executive orders restricting state agency use of Chinese technology. 
Kelly highlighted one order from 2023, calling Nebraska is an “adversary-free zone” because of Pillen banning the use or download of “applications, software, and platforms created or owned by affiliates of the Chinese Communist Party on state networks and devices.” 
The governor said it’s “extraordinarily important that we really recognize we have severe foreign adversaries.”
“China wants to take us out. Iran wants to take us out. North Korea wants to take us out. Venezuela wants to take us out,” Pillen said. 
Asked by reporters about the U.S. capturing of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Pillen said he is  “incredibly proud of what the president’s done in going to Venezuela and getting a radical terrorist out of our hair.” 
The governor also said, “Nebraskans don’t need to worry about selling soybeans to China, because of the state’s “value added agriculture.” Nebraskans can raise and process 300 million bushels of soybeans, despite no “Nebraska soybeans going on barges to China.” Nebraska farmers are bracing for another tough year, plagued by low corn and soybean prices, which many ag experts blame partly on President Donald Trump’s trade war with China and other international ag customers. 
“We have to roll up our sleeves and not be duped anymore,” Pillen said. “So if anybody’s buying anything from China, stop it today … That’s important to get it across to all Nebraskans. Stop it today. We have to win this.”

Sign up for Chalkbeat Tennessee’s free newsletter to keep up with statewide education policy and Memphis-Shelby County Schools.
Most Tennessee public school students who use Education Savings Account vouchers aren’t leaving low-performing public schools, while ESA students overall are underperforming their public school peers in both academic achievement and growth.
Tennessee Comptroller Jason E. Mumpower’s office released these findings Monday in the first comprehensive review of the program.
The comptroller’s report also found that the Tennessee Department of Education has not yet established parameters for removing private schools with repeated low academic performance, nor could it provide documentation “used to measure schools’ performance or counsel schools that have multiple years of low academic performance.”
Republican lawmakers passed the Education Savings Account program in 2019, though legal challenges delayed implementation until 2022. The program was the precursor to the 2025 universal voucher program, which GOP lawmakers are already looking to expand this year after 20,000 students were enrolled last fall.
The ESA program could be limited to 12,500 enrollees under state law this school year, with a cap of 15,000 set to kick in next year. But the program has never been fully utilized, with just 3,693 students enrolled in the current school year.
The ESA program was designed to benefit public school students: First-time ESA applicants in 2022 had to be moving from a public school, entering kindergarten, or transferring into Tennessee from another state.
In 2022, 66% of ESA students came from a public school, and 33% were entering public school.
Tennessee Republican contends more details needed on voucher rollout

By the next school year, lawmakers had made a change to “grandfather” some students into the program who had attended public school at least one year since 2019, the year the law was passed. Those students accounted for 31% of ESA students. Overall, 15% of 2023 ESA students were entering kindergarten, 38% were coming from public schools, and 14% had reenrolled in the program.
In 2024, nearly half of all ESA students had reenrolled in the program, 28% came from public schools and 14% were entering kindergarten.
The program was a signature issue for Gov. Bill Lee, who has supported additional school choice policies as a way for parents to choose higher-achieving schools.
The comptroller’s report indicates this is not necessarily happening. The program was targeted at districts with a relatively high number of Priority schools, a federal designation for schools that underperform in certain categories. In practice, that meant the ESA program could only be implemented in Shelby, Davidson, and Hamilton counties, large districts that often have as many high-ranking, or reward, schools as priority schools.
“Most schools that students are leaving to participate in the ESA program are neither reward nor priority schools, which would indicate their performance is neither among the highest or lowest of public schools in the state,” the comptroller’s report states. “When considering schools that have received state and federal designations, more ESA students are leaving reward schools than priority schools.”
This varies significantly by county, though. In Davidson County, 80% of ESA students who previously attended public schools attended schools with A, B, or C letter grades, and 18% of students came from schools that received a D or F letter grade. In Memphis, 58% of students previously attended A, B or C-graded schools.
In Hamilton County, 50% of ESA students previously attended public schools with D or F grades.
The comptroller’s report also found the state education department did not do enough to advertise the ESA program to low-income students, a requirement in state law.
Overall, students receiving ESA money performed worse on the state’s standardized tests than students in public schools, although ESA students outperformed their peers in Memphis-Shelby County schools last year. The comptroller’s report also notes that scores from students receiving ESAs have increased over time.
Meanwhile, virtual schools participating in the ESA program for the first time last year performed worse than both private schools with ESA students and local public schools. Just 20% of ESA students enrolled in virtual schools were proficient in English language arts, and just 17% were proficient in math.
Parent satisfaction with the program remains above 95%, but the comptroller notes only 15% of participating families actually provided feedback on the program last year.
There could be major changes to ESAs this year. The comptroller report suggests lawmakers reconsider eligibility requirements and where the program is targeting, noting other districts like Knox County Schools could be drawn in.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Cameron Sexton wants to eliminate the income limit and enrollment cap altogether for the program and open it up to all students in the current three counties.
This current income cap is 200% or less of the federal income eligibility to receive free school lunch, which would be $83,590 this year for a family of four. Around 76% of families in ESA-eligible counties are already eligible for the program, according to an EdChoice analysis.
The ESA this year provides around $9,747 per student, which fell below the average tuition cost by about $3,000 for participating private schools, the majority of which were religiously affiliated.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia Senate President Randy Smith has named Sen. Patricia Rucker to the new position of assistant majority leader, according to a news release Monday. She’ll also chair the Senate Committee on School Choice.
Rucker, R-Jefferson, currently serves on the Agriculture, Government Organization, Health and Human Resources, Judiciary, Rules, and Transportation and Infrastructure committees. She previously served as chair of the Senate’s Committee on Government Organization and the Committee on Education.
“Going into a new session, I knew that I wanted a strong leadership team that would be able to guide us through whatever challenges come our way,” Smith said in the news release. “Sen. Rucker’s years of service and experience combined with her expertise in critical policy areas like education make her a natural fit for a role that gives her even more of an opportunity to be a leader.”
The Committee on School Choice operated under former Senate President Craig Blair, R-Berkeley, but had not been operational during the 2025 legislative session. The resurrected committee will focus on the needs of children and families in West Virginia who are pursuing educational options outside of the traditional public school environment, including homeschools, microschools, public charter schools and private and parochial schools, according to the news release. 
The 2026 legislative session starts Wednesday, Jan. 14.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Despite criticisms from establishment Democrats and Republicans alike, former Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan opened the new year by saying he believes there is a path to victory for him leading toward the governor’s office, even as he stares down a daunting three-way contest between him, as an independent, versus the duopoly candidates who still need fight through a summer primary.
But Duggan, who officially became a full-time gubernatorial candidate after Detroit Mayor Mary Sheffield was sworn into office last week, still needs to make his policy case to a wide swath of Michigan voters before the November general election, and that includes many voters who are already locked in to vote for whichever Democratic and Republican candidates win out in the August primaries.
A media roundtable he hosted on Monday gave Duggan one of his first chances to do that in the new year, touching on his stance regarding AI data centers, which he said he is for with some caveats, raiding the state’s K-12 fund to pay for other priorities, which he is against, and whether he would stand up to or be cozy with the federal government and President Donald Trump, to which he has been a bit more elusive.
Either way, Duggan said no longer being mayor of Detroit allows him to refine his messaging and meet with “people who feel like they’ve been forgotten, who have been fed up or left out.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I’m going to be campaigning every day,” Duggan said. “When I’m talking to people in these communities, they aren’t talking about the nonsense in Washington. They actually want to know why their kids don’t have vocational training in their high schools; why reading levels in this state are slipping; why the young people are moving out and why, when their kids are ready to get jobs, they can’t afford housing in their communities.”
Duggan’s reasoning for why he left the Democratic Party last year in order to run as an independent gubernatorial candidate has been written about many times before. Although he still has to explain that decision to voters, who might view it as more politically advantageous than sincere, Duggan can now begin to shift his focus to talking policy instead.
Still, there are plenty of questions about whether he can pull in enough voters to elevate him from a big city mayor to becoming Michigan’s governor, and what he’ll do now that some key Democrats who have supported him in the past have turned on him in his indie era.
Case in point: the Rev. Horace Sheffield III, father to Mayor Sheffield, said he plans to endorse the eventual Democratic nominee in the gubernatorial hunt and not Duggan. That announcement came after Duggan vehemently endorsed now-Mayor Sheffield to replace him in Detroit.
Duggan was asked if he expected Mayor Sheffield to reciprocate, and if he was concerned over more key Democrats taking the reverend’s position.
The former mayor did not appear worried, at all.
“I got endorsed by more than 100 African American ministers, not just from Detroit, but from Flint and Lansing and around the state, including most of the prominent ministers in southeast Michigan,” Duggan said. “I won’t get every single endorsement … and those folks don’t need to bother paying attention to the campaign for the next 10 months. They’ve already made up their minds. I’m talking to the people who are troubled by the direction things are headed.”
Duggan has carved out an interesting group of Republican donors who have now supported his campaign, and the Democratic Party in Michigan has been pushing with full force to note that and other issues they have with Duggan and his campaign.
Just before Duggan’s roundtable event, Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel lambasted the former mayor on a number of issues during a call with reporters, including his coziness with Trump and his acceptance of money from Republican donors. Hertel was joined on the call by state Reps. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor) and Joey Andrews (D-St. Joseph).
Union battles at Detroit Medical Center may shadow Duggan’s 2026 bid for Michigan governor

Hertel went on to say that Duggan has supported Trump’s health care cuts, refused to condemn Trump’s trade war with Canada and brought up his history of union busting allegations while leading the Detroit Medical Center before he became mayor.
“Let’s be clear, this campaign is nothing but an expensive and self serving ego trip on a road to nowhere,” Hertel said Monday. “Duggan has been consistently in last place with no path of winning a general election. He’s proven one thing, and it’s that he can’t be trusted to fight for Michiganders or stand up to protect our state from the worst of the Trump administration, while Trump and Republicans are causing prices to skyrocket and people lose their health care.”
While Hertel and the party has not endorsed a candidate for governor and won’t until after the August primary, Rheingans and Andrews have both endorsed Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, the frontrunner on the Democratic side of the race.
In response, Duggan said: “for a guy who doesn’t think I can win, he sure is spending a lot of time talking about me.”
“Curtis Hertel has a tough problem. We just had a Democratic trifecta for two years of complete Democratic control,” Duggan said. “Curtis Hertel has got to cover for the fact that Democrats don’t stand for anything, except they’re against Republicans. So he’s got the slogan of vote blue no matter who. He’s going to push it nonstop. And I’m a threat to that. … I’m pretty sure Curtis is going to continue to be obsessed with me.”
Duggan elaborated on what he believes went wrong during those trifecta years of 2022-23.
“I sat down with the Detroit legislators and said, ‘This is our chance. Let’s have a statewide affordable housing plan. Let’s deal with the schools, let’s deal with vocational training, let’s deal with long term secure mental health beds. Our police officers in this state are too often the first line of response to mental illness,” Duggan said. “They didn’t get any of those things done. They were so busy fighting with the far left that wouldn’t compromise with the moderates. And of course, they wouldn’t dare take some Republican votes. … And so you saw what happened in lame duck [in late 2023]. It blew up, and they all went home without getting anything done.”
One reporter noted that Duggan’s team reshared a post from the conservative outlet The Midwesterner questioning whether Benson would find a reason to exclude him from the ballot.
Asked if he thought Benson would do so, which would be abuse of her office, Duggan ducked a direct answer. 
“I’m going to file so many signatures, nobody’s going to bother to try to have me disqualified,” he said.
Other policy odds and ends
Moving away from his issues with Democrats, Duggan was asked if he would pledge to not raise taxes, but did not do so. He said new services might come up.
On Hertel’s insistence that he was for Trump’s controversial economic policies that have affected Michigan’s neighbor to the north, Duggan said he has criticized the tariff policies aimed at Canada. He also said that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was similarly attacked for going to Washington, working with Trump and acquiring a new fighter mission for Michigan’s Selfridge Air National Guard base in Harrison Township.
“If [Whitmer] can be attacked by Democrats [for not] being hard enough on Trump, I won’t let it bother me,” he said.

Republicans have called for the U.S. Department of Justice to monitor the November election given that Benson is on the ballot and her office controls the state’s elections, as the GOP has ginned up unfounded worries that she might meddle with the results. Benson has scoffed at the assertion, noting Michigan’s decentralized election system where ballots are counted by local clerks.
Duggan said he was confident that city, township and county clerks would do their jobs well and accurately count the votes.
A hot topic of late has been the numerous AI data center projects that have been cropping up across the state and Whitmer’s embrace of those projects. Residents from all walks of life have by and large opposed the facilities, their environmental impacts, land-use issues, and electrical power problems that have the potential to drive up rates.
Duggan noted that the issue is emblematic of the deep divide he sees between how Democratic and Republican politicians view the issue versus the people of the state.
“We have to build data centers to be competitive on the jobs of the future, but there needs to be a single statewide standard with leadership that says there will be no electrical rate increase on the existing residents, that the data warehouse will be guaranteed to pay those rates,” Duggan said. “There can’t be water being taken out of the water system and taken back. There’s got to be a closed loop system to protect the environment, and the local community has to have a say in it. You can’t override their objections. We should have a clear standard in this state that says this is how it works.”

It is an election day.
Sanchez, a Democratic member of the city’s Common Council, and Republican Jamie Vaughan are on the ballot in a special election for the 25th House District. 
They have competed with the weather, darkness that falls before 5 o’clock, and the distractions of holidays as much as they have against each other.
The off-cycle early-winter election is one of two this month for vacant seats in the state House of Representatives, each in districts that favor Democrats —overwhelmingly so in the 25th. The best showing by a Republican in the district over the past decade was 29.9% of the vote in 2024.
On the other side of Connecticut, voters go to the polls Jan. 13 in the 139th House District of Ledyard, Montville and Norwich. Republicans have been more competitive there, winning 47% of the vote in the midterm elections of 2018 and 2022.
Campaigns for special elections are sprints, condensing what typically occurs over the better part of a year into no more than 56 days. State law requires the governor to issue a writ of special election within 10 days of a vacancy, with the election to follow exactly 46 days later.

“I’ve got eight weeks to hammer out 10 months” of campaigning, said Vaughan, the Republican nominee in 2024. 
The tools employed in a special election are those found in any local or state election: door-to-door campaigning, direct mail, text messages, digital ads and social media. Vaughan also has spent $2,669 for billboards, his name and face looming over Route 9.
“It’s everything you would do normally — except on a condensed time frame,” said Mike Farina, a Democratic campaign consultant.
Sanchez and Vaughan each opened campaigns right before Thanksgiving after Bobby Sanchez, also a Democrat, resigned from the General Assembly to begin a two-year term as New Britain’s new mayor. He, too, first won the legislative seat in a special election in January 2011.
There have been no debates.
In the 139th, Democrat Larry Pemberton and Republican Brandon Sabbag are competing for the vacancy left by the death of Rep. Kevin Ryan, D-Montville, on Nov. 23. A third candidate, Mark Adams of Norwich, is suing to get on the ballot as an Independent Party nominee.
Vaughan and Sanchez are evenly matched on finances: Both are relying on public financing that provided grants of slightly more than $27,000. But Democrats outnumber Republican by more than a 3-1 margin in New Britain, and Vaughan said split is closer to 5-1 in the 25th.
Sanchez, 50, who moved to New Britain from Puerto Rico in 1994, has other advantages. The 25th House District is 56% Latino, and she had been elected five times to the council, most recently in November.
On Saturday afternoon, she campaigned door to door near Willow Park, where a housing project stood when she first came to the city. She encountered two men on the sidewalk, reminding them in Spanish of the election. Both promised to vote. She said her pitch at the doors is simple.
“I just won election as a councilwoman, my fifth, And I’m introducing myself again, saying that I’m running for state rep,” Sanchez said. “And I always tell people, anyone that needs a ride to let to let me know.”
Early voting was light: 72 Democrats, 26 Republicans, 20 unaffiliated voters and three registered Independents had cast in-person, early-voting ballots. Another 22 Democrats, six Republicans and seven unaffiliated had cast absentee ballots.
Turnouts in special elections tend to be low, drawing mainly the voters who also turn out for municipal elections. 
Vaughan, 51, a graphic artist who has lived in New Britain his entire life, other than a stint in the Marines, said he greeted volunteers Saturday morning with donuts, coffee and door-knocking assignments in a borrowed conference room.
The volunteers included Rep. Joe Polletta, R-Watertown, and Rep. Nicole Klarides-Ditria, R-Seymour. He was grateful for the help from the lawmakers and state party, but he wished the GOP was able to do more.
Republicans were not lining up to run after Bobby Sanchez won the open mayoral office, succeeding Republican Erin Stewart, one of the two declared Republican candidates for governor.
“I was like, ‘Yeah, you know what? Let me jump back in.’ We didn’t have anybody to really run in the district,” Vaughan said. “We need a voice.”
On Saturday, rather than go door-to-door, Vaughan drove to the homes of Republican voters who have turned out in part elections. 
At one stop, he ducked beneath the branches of the overgrown evergreens on either side of an unshoveled sidewalk leading to the home of an 81-year-old widow, a Republican who contributed $50 to his campaign in 2024.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A new political party hopes to gather enough signatures to appear on this year’s ballot.
The Sooner State Party must gather 35,000 signatures by Feb. 20 to become a recognized political party, said co-founder C.J. Webber-Neal.
Webber-Neal said supporters have gathered 22,000 signatures.
The Sooner State Party formed in July and has about 45 members, he said. If approved, the party plans to open its primaries to independent voters for every election, he said.
Currently, independent voters are barred from participating in all state’s partisan primary elections after the State Election Board last year determined no party submitted the proper paperwork to open its primaries.
State law presumes partisan primaries are closed to unaffiliated voters unless a political party notifies the state Election Board within a specific time frame that it will open them to independents, who are not a recognized political party. 
Democrats had previously opened primaries to independents, while Republicans and Libertarians had not.
Webber-Neal said when news broke that independents couldn’t vote in any partisan primary, the group received so much website traffic that it crashed their site.

Webber-Neal said the Sooner State Party is more aligned with independents than Democrats, Republicans or Libertarians. 
Webber-Neal said the Sooner State Party supports tribal sovereignty and abortion rights.
It also supports the Second Amendment and responsible gun ownership, he said.
The “party is not trying to go to the extreme and putting a bunch of bans on weapons, because that is an infringement,” Webber-Neal said. “But we do believe in responsibility. We do believe that if you take the responsibility to purchase a firearm, you should also take the responsibility to be able to know how to use that firearm.”
The party does support some of the state’s recent tax cuts, but believes reform is needed, he said.
The group also supports increasing the minimum wage to make it livable, he said.
The party does not yet have an official position on LGBTQ+ rights, but has formed an affiliated caucus to create one.
Generally speaking, the Sooner State Party does support LGBTQ+ rights, he said.
The Libertarian Party was the last to gain access to the ballot in 2016 and has retained that access, said Misha Mohr, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Election Board.
“There have been a number of groups that have attempted to get on the ballot over the years,” she said.  
Oklahoma law allows the formation of new political parties if supporters can collect signatures from at least 3% of the registered voters who cast ballots during the previous gubernatorial election.
In order to continue to exist, a political party then must have a candidate receive at least 2.5% of total votes for a statewide elected office in one of the two preceding general elections, according to state law.

“This partnership creates an incredible outdoor laboratory for hands-on learning,” said Buena Vista University President Brian Lenzmeier during an event celebrating the new partnership in the fall. “The Boettcher family has stewarded this land with exceptional care across generations, and we are deeply grateful for their trust in BVU. By sharing this legacy with our students, they are helping shape meaningful educational experiences rooted in purpose, service, and stewardship.”
Programming at the center will start “as soon as spring weather permits,” said Buena Vista University Senior Director of Marketing and Communications Megan Ogren in an email.
Iris Boettcher, owner of the Boettcher family farm, also spoke during the event, according to the release, saying the partnership between her farm and Buena Vista University fits both with the work her family has done and the future of agriculture. The release stated the Boettcher family has “demonstrated a strong commitment to conservation and responsible land stewardship” over the years, focused on soil health, water quality and conservation.
The Boettcher family farm spans 160 acres, Ogren said in an email. It is enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program, a voluntary program run by the federal Farm Service Agency that promotes planting vegetative cover over “environmentally sensitive” land.
“This farm has been in our family for over 150 years, and I have worked to honor the land and my ancestors through sustainable care of the soil and river,” Iris Boettcher said in remarks at the event. “I am inspired by BVU’s mission to learn through experience, and I hope this partnership provides an experimental lab for faculty and students to design innovative, sustainable, and regenerative agricultural practices.”
Lenzmeier added in his remarks that the work of the family farm “reflects the history, values, and future of agriculture in Northwest Iowa,” and he hopes the partnership and center inspire future “agricultural leaders and environmental stewards.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A bill that would expand the state’s corporate tax incentive programs by billions and extend new tax subsidies to Newark’s Prudential Center was advanced by Assembly lawmakers Monday over the objections of critics.
The measure, which won 10-2 approval from the Assembly’s economic development committee, would pour an additional $2.5 billion into the state’s marquee tax incentive programs and extend up to $300 million in state subsidies for renovations at the Newark arena. Assembly members Dawn Fantasia (R-Sussex) and Alex Sauickie (R-Ocean) voted no.
“It’s at the point where it needs to have major renovations in order to not only make sure the only professional sports team that New Jersey has, which is the New Jersey Devils, can continue to play, but also so that they’re able to compete and bring in different spectators and bring in different shows,” bill sponsor Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex) said.
Tax incentives for the publicly owned Prudential Center’s redevelopment faced resistance.
Though some witnesses praised safeguards in the bill that would allow the state Economic Development Authority to rescind awards under certain circumstances and require firms receiving incentives to make some public disclosures, they questioned whether the project would actually bring benefits to New Jersey.
“Almost every independent and neutral assessment of sports arena subsidies is that they are a bad deal for public investment broadly speaking,” said Peter Chen, a senior policy analyst at progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. “They almost never pay back the promised revenues, and when looking at municipality or countywide revenues, they tend not to make any effect at all.”
The bill would require the Prudential Center’s renovation to generate economic activity equal to at least 150% of the tax incentives it receives. Because awards are capped at 80% of a project’s costs or $300 million, whichever is less, the requirement could mandate the Prudential Center generate $450 million in economic activity.
Jake Reynolds, president of the New Jersey Devils and the Prudential Center, told the panel the arena had more than $680 million in annual sales and generated $30 million in state tax revenue and $4.5 million in Newark taxes annually.
Reynolds argued that investment is needed to keep the arena in good repair and competitive with other stadiums in the region and country.
“With the age of the building and the 23 million visitors that have continued to come through the doors since the opening, along with the more than 3,000 events we have hosted there, it has taken a toll on the facility’s infrastructure,” Reynolds said. “The time has come for a full-scale renovation.”
Though New Jersey’s constitution bars the Legislature from passing special tax legislation — bills that single out localities for special treatment, positive or negative — language in the bill advanced Monday would guarantee that only the Prudential Center is eligible for the award.
To be eligible for incentives, a venue must seat at least 15,000 and have operated for at least 15 years in a city with an international airport in a non-coastal county with at least 550,000 residents and a density of not less than 3,000 people per square mile.
New Jersey has only two international airports, Newark Liberty International Airport and Atlantic City International Airport, and Atlantic County does not meet the population or geography requirements.

Separate provisions expanding funding for the Aspire program, which provides gap financing, and the Emerge Program, which provides per-job tax credits to boost job creation, drew some opposition from witnesses, both over their breadth and the timing of the bill’s movement.
Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of New Jersey Citizen Action, cautioned lawmakers against advancing the bill outside of budget negotiations, noting the state already plans to spend about $1.5 billion more than it brings in through taxes during the current July-to-June fiscal year.
Outlays could expand that deficit in the budget lawmakers are set to approve in June, and the loss of federal funding and programs could further strain New Jersey’s finances, Jaborska said.
“We are in for a very brutal budget. Our communities that we serve … are already dealing with the loss of so many supports and benefits and programs, so you are talking about taxpayer dollars going towards these wealthy corporations, 3 billion dollars’ worth, at a time when we’re going to have a hard time balancing our budget heading into next year,” she said.
Other witnesses hailed the $11.5 billion tax incentive programs as boons for the state’s economy and said they need more money because existing funding had been drawn down since lawmakers created them in late 2020.
“[Aspire] is really chugging along, and has quite a robust pipeline of projects. At the end of 2025, as a result of that, we have run out of tax credits,” said Tony Pizzutillo, a lobbyist for the New Jersey chapter of the National Association for Industrial and Office Parks, a commercial real estate advocacy group.

Another bill advanced Monday would require film production companies receiving tax credits from the state to only use domestically produced original music and scores in their work.
Industry representatives cautioned that the bill could make New Jersey film production less affordable. The American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada argued the requirement would ensure taxpayers see the benefits of their tax dollars, a view that found some support among lawmakers.
“Tax credits are supposed to create in-state and in-country jobs, strengthen regional economies, and generate returns for taxpayers. When productions outsource music recording abroad, that purpose is undermined,” Fantasia said.
Assemblyman Brian Bergen (R-Morris) voted no.
Because tax incentives affect state revenue, the bills would need to advance through the Assembly Appropriations Committee before reaching the chamber’s floor. Senate companions for both bills have yet to reach the floor in the upper chamber. The new legislative session begins on Jan. 13.

Patrick Morrisey wants to accelerate cuts to the state’s personal income tax, and he’ll ask lawmakers to get behind the idea during the upcoming legislative session.  “I wanted to make clear that one of our top priorities during the session will be tax cuts and tax simplification, and I think that’s important because West […]","Gov. Patrick Morrisey announces a tax relief package proposal that includes a cut to personal income taxes on Monday, Jan. 5, 2026 in Charleston, West Virginia. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Gov. Patrick Morrisey wants to accelerate cuts to the state’s personal income tax, and he’ll ask lawmakers to get behind the idea during the upcoming legislative session. 
“I wanted to make clear that one of our top priorities during the session will be tax cuts and tax simplification, and I think that’s important because West Virginians are still feeling the impact of inflation,” the governor said Monday during a press conference at the state Capitol.
The legislative session starts Jan. 14 in Charleston, West Virginia.
Under previous Gov. Jim Justice, the Legislature cut personal income taxes by about 27% in recent years through bills and a trigger-based reduction plan. 
The tax cut trigger formula — passed by lawmakers in 2023 — put a system in place where income tax cuts will be triggered gradually if the state meets revenue goals. It measures general revenue collections in a fiscal year compared to 2019. If collections are ahead of that year, it activates the trigger for a tax cut.
West Virginia didn’t meet the revenue goal in this past fiscal year to trigger the tax reduction, so Morrisey said he’ll work with lawmakers to move forward with a cut. In the past, some Republicans in the Legislature have been hesitant to cut taxes without hitting the trigger.  
Morrisey’s goal is at least a 5 to 10% personal income tax reduction.
“I’ve had conversations with the House and Senate leadership, and I’ve expressed my interest in working closely with them on getting something that passes,” he said.
Personal income tax is West Virginia’s largest source of state revenue.
Morrisey said he believed the state could “deliver meaningful tax relief without sacrificing essential services” due to his administration’s work on agency budgets and cutting what he called inefficient spending. 
His administration has already asked state agencies to cut their budgets by 2% 
“I think we’re in a position to deliver real tax relief that strengthens families, supports our businesses and really continues to position West Virginia well in this backyard brawl effort,” Morrisey said, noting that Kentucky and Ohio have cut their income tax rates.
Kelly Allen, executive director at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the governor’s proposed tax cut was “a surprising development” after the state didn’t hit the tax cut trigger. 
“This is saying we can actually jump out ahead of the triggers and enact deeper income tax cuts as his own six year financial plan says we’re facing hundreds of millions of dollars in budget deficits in upcoming years,” she said.
Allen estimated that a 5 to 10% income tax cut would result in a $1 a week more for West Virginians. 
“We’ve had years of tax cuts that have not brought promised growth, but instead have caused austerity and cuts to public schools, infrastructure and child care. Greater investments in those amenities and services are all things that would move the needle more on affordability for everyday West Virginians and strengthen our overall economy,” she said.
The state’s general revenue collections are about 5% above estimate — $128 million more than estimated, the governor said. The number has been driven by personal income tax strength and consumer sales tax collections.
“We had a good close to 2025 and our fiscal projections are significantly above where we thought they would be,” Morrisey said. “This is very positive news, (and) I think, a direct result of so much of the hard work that our administration has put in over time.”
Morrisey also wants to expand the state’s tourism development tax credit with the goal of increasing lodging to support the state’s growing tourism industry. 
State Treasurer Larry Pack has urged lawmakers to eliminate state income tax on overtime and tips. President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” included provisions for no taxes on tips and overtime effective through Dec. 31, 2028.
“President Trump championed a policy at the federal level that would allow workers to deduct overtime and qualified tips from their federal tax return,” Pack said in a news release in November.

On December 30, US Health and Human Services deputy secretary Jim O’Neill announced the Administration for Children and Families froze all payments to Minnesota and that payments throughout the US would require “justification and a receipt or photo evidence” before funds are sent to states.
The changes are meant to address “the blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country,” O’Neill said in a December 30 post on X.
“Funds will be released only when states prove they are being spent legitimately,” he said in the post.
Massachusetts officials have not received any new guidance from the Administration for Children and Families related to Child Care Financial Assistance funds, Early Education and Care Commissioner Amy Kershaw said Monday during an appearance on “The 9:30 Call,” a virtual call hosted by Strategies for Children that gathers early childhood and care system stakeholders. The Bay State is also not facing any disruptions in payments to Child Care Financial Assistance, which helps low-income families pay for child care.
“Obviously we are incredibly concerned about families across the country and in Minnesota who may lose access to Child Care Financial Assistance based on acts by the federal government,” Kershaw said.
The state appropriates funds for the Child Care Financial Assistance program, which the Department of Early Education and Care manages, at the beginning of the fiscal year. Then the state seeks reimbursement from the federal government. Kershaw noted funds have already been appropriated for fiscal 2026, which ends June 30.
The federal announcement came after a video surfaced on YouTube alleging fraud in child care in Somali communities in Minnesota. Kershaw said none of those allegations have been proven. She also said there have been similar videos posted in Massachusetts and other states like Ohio, California and Washington.
“Intrepid journalists have made shocking and credible allegations of extensive fraud in Minnesota’s child care programs,” O’Neill said in a YouTube video posted on December 31. “We believe the state of Minnesota has allowed scammers and fake day cares to siphon millions of taxpayer dollars over the past decade.”
O’Neill said he has sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz demanding a “full 360 review” of child care centers including attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations and inspections. The Administration for Children and Families also launched a dedicated fraud reporting hotline and email address, Alex Adams, assistant secretary of the agency, said in the video.
A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said the federal “Defend the Spend” initiative applies to all states. The initiative, launched last year through the Department of Government Efficiency, has been expanded to include ACF payments, according to a December 30 post on X from user “DOGE_HHS” and reposted by DOGE. Since March 2025, the initiative only applied to HHS discretionary payments.
Over the coming days, the system will expand to “support itemized receipts and photographic evidence, and make all data/receipts, where possible, available to the public,” the agency said in the post.
Funding for Massachusetts Child Care Financial Assistance totals about $1.087 billion for fiscal 2026, according to a December report from the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. In fiscal year 2025, the program covered more than 66,000 children. The state covers most of the costs and in recent years, funds from a statewide income surtax instituted in 2023 have gone toward the program. In fiscal 2026, federal funds accounted for more than $293 million of the program, according to the state.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/daycare1-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 16:57:50.761121

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislative Democrats want state government to do more to help Indiana families deal with rising costs.
House and Senate Democrats announced Monday proposals for repealing the state’s 7% sales tax on residential utility bills and increasing state funding for child care programs.
Democratic leaders said families are facing a “cost-of-living crisis” and that they would push for the Republican-dominated Legislature to provide relief for the growing expenses for utilities, medical care, housing and child care.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, declared during a speech as legislators returned to the Statehouse for their two-month 2026 session that “Hoosiers are getting nickeled and dimed to death.”
“Our public policy this session should not insult Hoosiers by suggesting that their household budget outlook is their fault,” GiaQuinta said. “If our agenda is rejected this session, you’re suggesting that Hoosiers would be able to achieve their American dream if only they had pinched pennies a little better.”
Democrats targeted the Braun administration’s actions to not enroll any more children into the program for taxpayer-funded child care until at least 2027 and slash the payment rates to day care centers.
They argue the state has enough money to end the waitlist of some 30,000 children for the low-income program and that Indiana’s economy is being hurt because parents can’t join the workforce.
Their push for additional child care funding comes after new projections show that the state’s cash reserves could grow to nearly $5 billion by the middle of 2027 — more than double what was anticipated when the new state budget took effect in July.
But legislative Republicans are also considering whether to go along with tax cuts that President Donald Trump pushed through Congress last year in what was dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” 
An analysis from Braun’s administration estimates that total state tax breaks on businesses and individuals could top $900 million over the next two years if the Legislature were to conform state tax law with all the federal changes.
Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, said the state has the resources to help residents facing a financial squeeze.
“We can get this done,” Yoder said during a news conference. “We can come together and really have a conversation of what is the biggest return on our investment, and we will see those specifically in child care investments, pre-K funding.”
Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, said many day care centers around Indiana are facing closure because tightened state funding, which she argued would compound the state’s child care shortage.
“This should be an issue we can work together on,” Hamilton said. “That’s critical infrastructure that helps our employers, that helps our families.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AE5FE72B-3917-41CC-8A6C-850A451EFF5D_1_201_a-1024x620.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 16:57:50.761121

(Provided by the S.C. DOT)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster is asking legislators to spend an additional $1.1 billion on road projects to keep up with inflation costs, he announced Monday in a preview of his total budget recommendations.
That’s nearly as much as legislators have spent on roads and bridges in the past four years combined, according to the announcement.
Construction costs have surged nationally in recent years, and repairs and improvements to roads and bridges weren’t spared. The problem is especially acute in places like South Carolina, where fast-growing populations mean more traffic and wear-and-tear on existing roads, according to a news release from the governor’s office.
McMaster’s full budget suggestions are expected next week, when the Legislature returns to Columbia for the 2026 session.
Revenue estimates updated in November provided the Legislature nearly $2.5 billion in additional money to spend in the fiscal year starting July 1. That breaks down to $1.7 billion in unspent reserves and above-expectation tax collections so far this year — meant for one-time expenses — and $734 million from continued economic growth available for ongoing expenses, according to the state Board of Economic Advisors.
McMaster’s request would consume more than 60% of the one-time money — what’s considered budget surplus. And with proposed reductions to the state income tax potentially decreasing revenue collections in the coming years, McMaster says it’s important that legislators dedicate a huge chunk of that existing surplus toward fixing the roads.
“Our population is skyrocketing, and inflation is driving up construction costs, creating potential delays,” McMaster said in a statement. “We can’t make more time, but we can use this new surplus money to keep road projects moving and on schedule.”
Revenue hasn’t kept up with the cost of inflation, Secretary of Transportation Justin Powell wrote in a December letter to the governor.
Stuck in traffic? SCDOT has a new plan. And a price tag.

To illustrate his point, Powell pointed to the 28-cent gas tax every driver has paid per gallon since 2022, the completion of a six-year phase-in.
In 2017, when the Legislature passed a law that gradually increased the per-gallon tax by 12 cents, one penny per person per gallon could pay to pave 114 miles of two-lane highway. In 2025, it could pave 87 miles, Powell wrote.
Of the approximately $1.1 billion, $600 million would help pay for ongoing interstate projects with increased price tags, $400 million would help fund repairs to the state’s aging system of bridges, and $150 million would allow new projects to move ahead, Powell wrote.
Without the money, projects already underway could take years longer than anticipated, Powell wrote. The longer a project takes, the more expensive it becomes, he added.
“As SCDOT has seen, these delays only lead to additional cost increases, a vicious cycle that is challenging departments across the nation as they work to deliver critical infrastructure,” Powell wrote.
That includes two interstate widening projects: One would complete the widening of I-26 between Columbia and Charleston to three lanes each way. The other would widen the first 10 miles of I-95 from the Georgia border to U.S. Highway 278 in Jasper County. The cost of both projects has spiked since 2022, with the 70-mile I-26 project surging from just over $2 billion to $3 billion and the I-95 project going from $977 million to nearly $2.3 billion, according to Powell’s letter.
Another major interstate project, Columbia’s Carolina Crossroads, saw a significant increase as well, from $2.1 billion in 2022 to $2.8 billion by the end of 2025, Powell wrote. The project is expected to fix the notorious snarl of interstate ramps more commonly called Malfunction Junction.
Along with funding ongoing improvements, the money could help get two new projects off the ground, Powell wrote.
The agency plans to eventually widen Interstate 85 between Anderson and Oconee counties and Interstate 77 in York and Chester counties. With $75 million, the agency could begin pre-construction design work, making it easier to apply for grants that could allow construction to begin sooner than the anticipated earliest start date of 2035, Powell wrote.
Another $75 million could pay for a study on how to improve parts of interstates 26, 85 and 77 near Charlotte, also moving up the start date from 2035 at the earliest, Powell wrote.
On the North Carolina side of the border, transportation officials are working to upgrade 11 miles of highway, including adding express lanes and reconstructing interchanges and bridges, in an effort to reduce congestion, according to the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
The rest of the money would go toward repairing and replacing bridges.
Three years ago, then-DOT Secretary Christy Hall asked legislators for a $1 billion commitment for bridgework over five years. But legislators declined to include any additional money for bridges in their final 2023-24 budget package. Then the emergency closure of Interstate 20 days before Christmas in 2023 highlighted the need.
Last summer, the Legislature approved a second installment of $200 million for bridgework. Weeks after the budget took effect, a large chunk of a weight-restricted bridge in Pickens County collapsed. It is expected to reopen next month.
Of the state’s 8,450 bridges, more than 2,800 are more than 60 years old, which is when many need repairs or replacement, according to Powell’s letter. Around 80 bridges were closed as of Dec. 4, when Powell sent his letter, he wrote.
The $400 million designated for bridgework over the last two years added to the $239 million the agency already spent annually, allowing the addition of 278 bridges to its list for imminent repairs.
In its budget request, submitted last September, the agency sought $300 million — rather than $200 million — for the third bridgework installment.
McMaster’s office uses agencies’ requests to craft the governor’s recommendations.
In an attempt to save some money on future repairs, the department’s request also asks legislators for $25 million to transfer state-owned roads to local cities and counties, reducing the number of miles the state must manage.
South Carolina has the fourth-largest state highway system in the country, despite ranking 23rd in population, according to the Department of Transportation. Moving smaller roads to local ownership would free up staffing and money the department could dedicate to interstates and major highways, according to the agency’s budget request.
Similar “road buyback” proposals have been unsuccessful, with local governments unwilling to take on the financial responsibility.  The DOT is asking the Legislature for the authority to negotiate with local governments on payments for such transfers. Lawmakers would then have to approve the list.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BeamMoving2-1024x573.jpg,,,2026-01-05 16:57:50.761121

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)With the 2026 legislative session set to start in a week, Iowa House Democrats introduced their plan Monday to tackle one of the biggest issues heading into the year — how to lower Iowans’ property taxes.
Republican leaders, including Gov. Kim Reynolds, have said changes to Iowa’s property tax system are at the top of the list for issues lawmakers will consider as they reconvene next week. Reynolds and members of the Republican trifecta at the state Capitol have spent the past few months meeting with local government officials and community leaders as they work through ways to lower property tax burdens for Iowans.
While there is not a clear consensus from Republicans on what property tax legislation they will introduce, House Democratic leaders unveiled their proposal at a news conference Monday.
Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the proposal involves four components: freezing property taxes for people age 65 and older, tripling the Homestead Tax Credit, limiting property tax growth to 4% annually and providing state support for public safety workers’ retirement funds. Jacoby said while transitioning to this new system, the measure would provide two years of “immediate relief” through rebates of $1,000 for homeowners and $500 for renters.
By limiting property tax growth each year, the Democrats’ plan would provide “certainty” to both taxpayers and the local government entities that rely on these taxes, like schools, cities and counties.
“Our plan offers effectiveness — a word that you’ll hear often this year from House Democrats,” Jacoby said. “And, hopefully in a bipartisan way with Republicans, we want a policy that’s effective. Our plan will work, and Iowans will feel the effects immediately.”
In addition to the rebates, Jacoby said the proposal would offer immediate savings for Iowans through an increased Homestead Tax Credit. The credit for qualified homeowners is based on a portion of the homestead’s actual value. The plan would increase the tax credit from an average of $200 to $300 per household to $500 to $600 per household.
Other parts of the plan, he said, like limiting property tax growth, will provide more long-term cost savings for Iowans by ensuring that each year, costs can only rise a certain amount. Under the 4% growth cap, each $1,000 of property tax costs could grow to a maximum of $1,040 the next year, he said.
Freezing property taxes for seniors — “not by means, not by formula, simply by age,” Jacoby said — will also give older Iowans more assurance that they can afford to remain in their homes.
“Many seniors would like to stay in their home,” Jacoby said. “Many people would like to move, but they can’t afford the property tax liability if they move up. This way, it offers certainty that we will also open up the housing stock in Iowa.”
Jacoby said the exact costs of some parts of the plan, such as the rebates and senior tax freeze, were still being discussed with requests out to the Legislative Services Agency, Iowa League of Cities and the state Association of Counties for estimates. However, he said he expected some funding for the rebates to come from the Iowa Taxpayer Relief Fund.
Some components of this proposal were also introduced by House Democrats as legislation in the 2025 session, which did not receive a subcommittee hearing.
The property tax measure discussed most last year was Republican leaders’ plan to eliminate Iowa’s “rollback” system of calculating property taxes and make other changes to limit tax growth. Jacoby said he believes Republicans’ proposal is to “eliminate rollback and somehow make up for it — but that is economically impossible.” He also criticized the idea of limiting property valuations, which he said was a “dangerous path” to start on.
Jacoby said he has spoken with Republicans, including the new House Majority Leader Bobby Kaufmann, about how to approach the subject of property taxes from a bipartisan perspective.
“We’ve seen over the years that the things that have been done from the Statehouse have been totally ineffective, and in fact, they’ve hurt more,” he said. “I will say this, we do have positive relationships with people across the aisle … that are very interested in an effective plan.”

The overhaul is effective immediately, meaning that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend vaccines against 11 diseases. What’s no longer broadly recommended is protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high-risk, or if their doctors recommend them in what’s called “shared decision-making.”
Trump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won’t result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the move increases confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.
The change came after President Donald Trump in December asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising its guidance to align with theirs.
HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an “outlier” in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.
Among those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and HPV.
“This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a statement Monday.
Medical experts disagreed, saying the change without public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.
Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.
“You can’t just copy and paste public health and that’s what they seem to be doing here,” said O’Leary. “Literally children’s health and children’s lives are at stake.”
The new guidance also reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against human papillomavirus from two or three shots to one for most children, depending on age.
The decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.
“Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,” said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25358718659191-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 16:57:50.761121

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Trump administration is sending another 2,000 agents and officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations, according to a CBS News report.
The deployment, which is said to have begun Sunday, would make Minnesota and specifically Minneapolis the focal point of President Donald Trump’s nationwide effort to deport millions of immigrants. The CBS report quotes an unnamed former law enforcement official who notes that “the number of HSI agents being sent to Minneapolis is roughly equivalent to the entire HSI workforce assigned to the state of Arizona ” — underscoring the administration’s intense emphasis.
Protestors squared off with federal officers — and sometimes local police — at raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul in 2025. Law enforcement officers have used crowd dispersal tactics like pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets and sound cannons.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota and three Minnesota-based law firms recently sued federal immigration authorities, alleging that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and their leaders are routinely violating the constitutional rights of the people protesting their actions.
The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE as the agency ramped up raids in Minnesota, especially in the state’s large Somali community, as part of a targeted operation ordered by the Trump administration.
Both Minneapolis and St. Paul are sanctuary cities, meaning their local police do not question residents’ immigration status or enforce immigration law, which is a federal responsibility. But both police departments have helped immigration authorities control the large crowds of protesters that have convened outside of raids.

Trump late last year directed immigration authorities to reexamine the green cards — granted to people with legal permanent residency — of people from “countries of concern,” including Somalia.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FirstFile_011-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 16:12:16.268968

Previously the age cutoff was 26. (Getty image) One of Rhode Island General Treasurer James Diossa’s resolutions for 2026 is to create 1,000 active savings accounts for residents with disabilities without jeopardizing their federal benefits.
That goal may become reality now that Rhode Islanders whose disabilities began before age 46 are eligible to open accounts under the state’s Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) program.
Created under the Obama administration in 2014, ABLE accounts allow Social Security beneficiaries to save money for future qualifying needs, such as housing, education, transportation, health, prevention and wellness, employment training and support, assistive technology and personal support services. Earnings grow tax-deferred and withdrawals are tax-free when used for qualified expenses.
Accounts are owned by the beneficiary, but managed by the Pennsylvania-based financial service company Ascensus. Their management is overseen by the Rhode Island Office of General Treasurer.


Looking to learn more on ABLE accounts? 
General Treasurer James Diossa will take part in a virtual seminar hosted by the Paul V. Sherlock Center on Disabilities at Rhode Island College at noon on Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026


Before the start of 2026, ABLE accounts were limited to people who had a qualifying medical condition that began before their 26th birthday. The change to allow people up through the age of 46 was approved through the federal ABLE Age Adjustment Act, which was signed into law in 2022.
“Treasury is committed to helping people with disabilities build lasting financial security,” Diossa said in a statement. “Thanks to the federal expansion of ABLE eligibility, more Rhode Islanders can save for everyday needs and long-term goals without risking essential benefits.”
Kevin Nerney, executive director for the Rhode Island Developmental Disabilities Council, welcomed the age increase now taking effect.
He said he hopes that the expansion will entice more Rhode Islanders with disabilities to start saving. Diossa’s office noted 777 active ABLE accounts in mid-December. 
“We want people to be able to save money and do the things they want to do in their lives,” Nerney said.
The treasurer’s office did not have any projections on how many more accounts may open statewide. Grace Voll, a spokesperson for Diossa’s office, said the treasurer hopes to see 1,000 active accounts by the end of the year.
The National Disability Institute estimated around 6.1 million more Americans would be eligible across the country under the program’s recent expansion.
Beneficiaries can contribute up to $20,000 a year into an ABLE account in 2026. Total assets in an account can reach $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income benefits. 
“But $100,000 with proper investment, might pay more than what your SSI is,” Nerney noted.
Even small contributions can go a long way, he added.
“For some people, a little as $100 a month could have a significant impact on their quality of life — even if it’s just to use an Uber to see their friend every week,” Nerney said.

Miller  Credit: Mississippi University for Women
Nora Miller will retire on June 30 after more than seven years as president of the Mississippi University for Women. 
In an announcement on Monday, Miller noted her ties to the university, also known as The W, which includes her time as a student there in the 1980s. 
“This is a deeply personal decision, made with gratitude and pride,” Miller said in a news release. “The W has shaped my life in profound ways — as a student, as an administrator and for the past seven and a half years as its president.”
The Board of Trustees for the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning will guide the leadership transition process for the Columbus university.
Before becoming the W’s 15th president, Miller served as the university’s chief financial officer, senior vice president for administration as well as vice president for administration. July will mark her 25th year at the W, where she also received her bachelor’s in accounting.
Under Miller’s leadership, the W increased enrollment by over 2,000 students in 2025 and fended off a merger with Mississippi State University. MUW’s nursing program posted the highest pass rate for nursing programs in the state at 99.36% last year.
Miller has spent a majority of her career in public service, working as supervising senior auditor at the state auditor’s office and as the director of budget and financial analysis and the director of internal audit at IHL. 
When the State Board of Education was considering moving the Mississippi School for Math and Science off the campus of the W, Miller spoke out against it. She has also worked to make the university more affordable for Mississippi students. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she moved 75% of classes online and opened up 31 spaces for quarantine on campus in 2020.
“I am proud of the momentum we have built and confident in the university’s future,” Miller said in a statement. “There is important work ahead, and I look forward to continuing that work together in the months to come.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/06042841/3X0A3465-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-05 16:12:16.268968

(Photo via Getty Images)Proposed legislation from a state agency would give the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission the authority to take action against unlicensed gambling sites.
State officials said if passed, the bill would give the commission authority to issue cease and desist orders to the “bad actors” that scam Iowans for information, money or run unregulated, offshore markets. The bill has been filed by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing in advance of the 2026 legislative session, which begins Jan. 12.
Tina Eick, the gaming commission’s administrator, said under current law, the commission does not have the “clear authority” to take action against anyone other than the casinos and sports books that it currently licenses. 
“When Iowans gamble on unlicensed platforms, they’re putting their money and their personal information at serious risk,” Eick said. “So we’re trying to be proactive here.”

According to the latest report from the American Gaming Association, Americans wager more than $673 billion annually in illegal and unregulated gambling markets. The illegal market, according to the report, has grown 22% since 2022. The association attributes the increase to the rise in iGaming, or online gambling, illegal sports betting and unregulated skill games, or unofficial slot-like machines. 
Unlicensed vendors also skirt state taxes. According to the association’s report, the illegal market leads to an estimated loss of $15.3 billion, annually, in state gaming tax revenue.
What does illegal gambling look like? 
Eick said the state encounters three main types of illegal gambling. 
The first kind are companies that spoof or pretend to be a legitimate business to try and steal information. Eick said these bad actors will usually have a website address that looks just slightly off from the casino or legitimate business they are trying to impersonate. 
Online casino gambling is not legal in Iowa, so Eick said if a local casino is reaching out and advertising online games, “that’s a fake.” 
The second kind of bad actor is an online casino operator advertising sweepstakes that offer a cashout in cryptocurrencies. Eick said the commission receives complaints about these companies because when people go to cash out their winnings, they are unable to receive the money. 
Offshore sports betting companies also pose a problem in Iowa, Eick said. These companies are not licensed in Iowa and therefore do not have to follow the same rules that licensed operators have to follow. Eick said this means the offshore companies offer wagers on “things that aren’t legal in Iowa” and raise “integrity concerns.” 
By contrast, Eick said the licensed market is regulated by the commission for the benefit of the state and for the people who participate in the games. 
“We have a strong regulatory system that ensures the games are fair,” Eick said. “We hold those operators accountable – their information and their funds are secure, and then they have responsible gaming, self exclusion programs in place, and then we tax them. They pay their fair share of taxes to Iowa.” 
The bill allows the commission to issue cease and desist orders and obtain injunctive relief on parties offering these unlicensed types of gambling.
Under current law, she said the only thing the commission can really say is “buyer beware” and encourage Iowans to check the websites they are on before entering personal and financial information. 
Eick said the commission regularly hears complaints from Iowans who have been scammed by these types of illegal gambling operations, which is why the commission wants to find a solution. 
“The bottom line is, illegal gaming undermines the public trust and puts Iowans at risk,” Eick said. 
Prediction markets still an unknown factor 
Eick hopes the bill could “clean up” some of the simple exploitations happening in the gambling market, but there are some newer types of online gambling that will be more difficult to control. 
One of those is sports prediction markets, which allow users to trade contracts based on the future result of real-world events. For example, rather betting on whether the Cyclones will beat the Hawkeyes, users can bet on whether or not the Cyclones will win. The same type of predictive markets have existed in the past in topics such as politics, but predictive markets have recently become more popular in sports betting. 
In late December, the sports betting app FanDuel, launched its own prediction market platform. Kalshi and Crypto.com were early adopters of the model, and are regulated by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which allows the trading to occur without state licensing. 
Lawsuits around the model have cropped up in several states, and attorneys general from 38 states, including Iowa’s Brenna Bird, signed a friend of the court brief in a case between Kalshi and Maryland’s Lottery and Gaming Control Commission, arguing the prediction market model “threatens the States’ longstanding ability to protect their citizens.” 
Eick said the questions the commission has on prediction markets have “some overlap” with the questions it has on the “clearly illegal” gaming markets.

“It lacks some of the consumer protections that we see in the regulated gaming industry that we currently have in Iowa,” Eick said.
Eick said the prefiled bill is not meant to regulate predictions markets in Iowa, because that issue is “more complex.” 
Eick said she’s not sure the legislation will get passed, but at the very least, the bill is a “conversation starter” to find solutions that will keep Iowans safe when they gamble. 
“For the integrity of the industry, and so that Iowans don’t lose faith in the regulated and secure market, we need to do something about these other markets,” Eick said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)T.S. Eliot claimed “April is the cruelest month.” Obviously he wasn’t an administrator in South Dakota’s public education system.
For anyone concerned about school funding in South Dakota, December is the cruelest month. That’s when they find out what sort of increase, if any, education will receive in the governor’s budget.
Once they digest that news, the rest of the month can be spent worrying about what sort of bright ideas lawmakers will present in the January legislative session about changing the school funding formula or the exciting new ways that the school system can be used to right the wrongs of society.
Governor aims tax credit at private schools
For public schools this year, November wasn’t all that great a month, either. That’s when Gov. Larry Rhoden announced that the state was signing on to the education tax credit program that was part of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.” For some reason the governor was eager to join the program, even though the fine print on the tax credit won’t be ready until 2027.
While the $1,700 tax credit can be used for public school programs, that clearly wasn’t Rhoden’s target audience when he made the announcement. “I’d just as soon give those dollars to a private school than Uncle Sam,” Rhoden said in a South Dakota Searchlight story. “I think they know how to spend it a little wiser than the federal government.”
Maybe the governor’s enthusiasm for a tax credit that doesn’t exist yet is based on the fact that more families in South Dakota are choosing private schools or home schooling. Alternative education in this state has increased 216% since 2015.
No increase for education in governor’s budget
Dec. 2 was a dark day for education, state workers and health care as the “big three” found out that Rhoden’s budget didn’t include a funding increase for any of them.
The governor blamed flat sales tax revenues for the lack of a funding increase. Those who advocate for education and health care point to the fact that not keeping up with inflation will actually serve as a funding cut as they must choose how to make due with flat funding while expenses continue to go up.
This is a curious political tactic for Rhoden. He was the last to enter the race for the Republican nomination, and now one of his first acts as a candidate is presenting a budget that’s sure to be upsetting for many South Dakotans.
Property taxes in the legislative crosshairs
When the Legislature convenes next week to start considering Rhoden’s budget — January is perhaps public education’s second cruelest month — one of the top assignments will be finding a way to relieve the pressure on property taxpayers. Along with state funding, property taxes are a main source of public school funding.
A summer task force assigned to find ways to cut property taxes concluded its work with 19 recommendations. Some of the ideas that didn’t get the endorsement of the task force will also likely end up in bills for the Legislature to consider.
In just about every legislative session, public schools find their funding the target of some legislator who hasn’t been in a classroom for 30 years but thinks he knows what’s best for education. As a special treat, this year public schools will face an entire legislative session where a major source of their funding is subject to the whims of legislators.
As the governor and lawmakers champion the needs of alternative education and prioritize the complaints of property taxpayers, they run the risk of losing track of the importance of public education. With a long state history of making funding for public education a priority, the current mood runs the risk of giving more significance to other matters. That would be a mistake. Public education should be among the state’s highest priorities, not just a political football to get tossed around every December and January.

Trump vetoes Miccosukee flood protection, citing tribe’s opposition to ‘Alligator Alcatraz’

In a statement to the Phoenix, the tribe wrote that it has “long supported President Trump’s commitment to Everglades restoration for the benefit of America’s public lands.”
“The Tribe has a constitutional duty to protect and defend the Everglades ecosystem, our traditional homelands. We never sought to obstruct the President’s immigration agenda. Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments,” Chairman Talbert Cypress wrote.
He added that the tribe was “disappointed to learn that the White House vetoed a measure intended to mitigate restoration impacts on a Tribal village.”
The bill, HR 504, called upon the Secretary of the Interior and the tribe “to take appropriate actions to safeguard structures within the Osceola Camp from flooding events.”


The Osceola Camp in the Everglades is a residential area for the Miccosukee tribe but not part of its federally reserved area. The tribe says the camp “faces serious flood and environmental risks.”
The bill, introduced nearly a year ago, four days before Trump’s second term began, also would have expanded the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include the Osceola Camp.


Trump vetoed the bill by Miami Republican Rep. Carlos Giménez despite widespread congressional support.
Politico reported Monday that the House will vote Thursday whether to override two vetoes, one being HR 504. That outlet reported “senior House Republicans and Democrats generally expect the chamber will approve the overrides in a rare rebuke of Trump.” However, “Less clear is whether either override vote would have enough support in the Senate.”
The second veto was a bill relating to federal funding for a Colorado water pipeline, also sponsored by a Republican. Democrats there believe the veto was politically motivated, Colorado Newsline reported.
In his veto letter, the president blamed the tribe for having “actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”
The tribe is part of a lawsuit against the state, claiming planners behind an immigration detention center in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” failed to follow federal environmental regulations in constructing the 3,000-bed facility.
“The measure reflected years of bipartisan work and was intended to clarify land status and support basic protections for tribal members who have lived in this area for generations — before the roads and canals were built, and before Everglades National Park was created. It was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests,” Cypress wrote.
Trump, via his veto letter published Dec. 30 by the White House, said the tribe during former President Joe Biden’s administration sought “special treatment from the Federal Government.”
“My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration’s policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country,” Trump wrote.
The Tribe said it will continue to collaborate with Congress and the Florida delegation and the federal government.
The statement from Talbert Cypress pointed out that former longtime Chairman Billy Cypress “enjoyed a friendship with President Trump and was an early supporter of his campaign in 2016.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-15-090534-1024x509.png,,,2026-01-05 16:12:16.268968

A message seeking comment was left with Collins on Monday.

Collins chairs the Education Policy Committee and serves on the Education Ways and Means Committee.
Collins first took office in 2010, defeating Democratic candidate Drama Breland with 56% of the vote in the Republican wave that year. In 2018, she defeated Democrat Billy Jackson with 61.6% of the vote. 
During her time in office, Collins sponsored the Human Life Protection Act. The law, signed by Gov. Kay Ivey in 2019, created a near-total abortion ban in Alabama, including in cases of sexual assault. The law makes it a Class A felony, punishable by up to 99 years in prison, for a person to perform an abortion in the state, except in cases of a threat to a mother’s health; if the woman had a mental illness that could result in the death of her child, or if there was a fetal anomaly that would result in stillbirth or death.
Collins, who had previously sponsored legislation known as “fetal heartbeat” bill that would effectively ban abortion at six weeks’ gestation, said at the time of passage that the law was intended to create a legal challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case that established federal protections for abortion rights. 
“I have prayed my way through this issue and this bill, because it was hard to give up heartbeat,” she said. “I believe we can’t get a heartbeat bill until we get Roe v. Wade turned over.”
The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case out of Mississippi, making abortion effectively illegal in Alabama. Collins was hopeful that lawmakers would be willing to move to a “heartbeat” bill that would ban abortions after six weeks, but other members of Legislature weren’t interested. 
Only seven abortions were performed in Alabama in 2023, but that did not stop the demand for abortion care. Georgia reported that about 3,300 Alabama women in 2022 and another 3,300 Alabama women in 2023 had abortions in that state.
Collins also helped pass the Alabama Literacy Act in 2019 that funded reading coaches and reading programs around the state while allowing students who failed to pass a reading test at the end of third grade to be held back if they did not complete a course. 
The Alabama Literacy Act requires students to read on grade level by the end of third grade. Since its passage, Alabama has seen improvements in literacy scores who take the Alabama Comprehensive Progress (ACAP) test.
In August, there were 55,930 students who took the Alabama Comprehensive Progress (ACAP) in May. Of that number, 88.4% of them were on or above the benchmark score to be considered “proficient” in reading.
Collins also sponsored a law in 2024 that provided criminal and civil immunity to clinics providing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) services. The bill came about after the Alabama Supreme Court declared that frozen embryos were persons and that their destruction would allow parents to collect damages under an 1872 law. The ruling led many IVF clinics in the state to suspend operations.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Terri-Collins-Feb-29-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 15:58:25.947232

Carlos Giménez.A little over 48 hours after U.S. troops removed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power, top Florida Republicans say they are certain that democracy is coming to the South American nation.
But they admit there is no clear pathway to making that happen and that there could be “detours” along the way.
In Doral, home to one of the largest Venezuelan populations in the U.S., Florida’s two U.S. GOP senators — Rick Scott and Ashley Moody — along with South Florida U.S. Rep. Carlos Giménez spoke at a press conference Monday labelled “Celebrating a New Day of Freedom for Venezuela.”
They all cautioned the enthusiastic audience that while they believed the U.S. government is intent on working to transition in Venezuela from an authoritarian government to a democracy, it will take time.
“The road ahead is not clear,” said Giménez, a Cuban American lawmaker who represents all of Monroe County and the southwest portion of Miami-Dade County.
“But the road ahead may have some detours there that will lead to freedom, democracy, for the people of Venezuela, and I’m sure freedom and democracy to the people of Cuba and to the people of Nicaragua as well, and a new emphasis by the United States on maintaining democracy and peace in our hemisphere.”
Sen. Scott said that while the world certainly looks different than it did three days ago while Maduro was still in office, the transition to a democratic government is “going to take a lot of work. It’s going to take a lot of people in Venezuela to bust their butt to make this happen. But they want to make it happen.”
Maduro has been charged on four criminal counts that include narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices. He pleaded not guilty to those charges in federal court in New York on Monday.
Florida Democratic response
Although many congressional Democrats have called Maduro a “brutal dictator” and “an authoritarian,” they have also called Saturday’s military actions illegal and outside the bounds of the president’s constitutional authority.
In South Florida at least, removal of Maduro was met with support by some Democrats, although with caveats.
“The capture of the brutal, illegitimate ruler of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who oppressed Venezuela’s people, is welcome news for my friends and neighbors who fled his violent, lawless, and disastrous rule,” said South Florida U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a statement.
“It is my hope that this marks the end of a horrific chapter for the Venezuelan people,” added Miami Democratic state Sen. Shevrin Jones in a statement released on Saturday.
“There is no question that Nicolás Maduro was a brutal dictator who oppressed the people of Venezuela for far too long. Miami-Dade County is home to a large Venezuelan population, many of whom fled their country to seek safety in the United States because of what they endured.”
Both Wasserman Schultz and Jones criticized the Trump administration for bypassing Congress in removing Maduro, however.
Other Florida Democrats were more critical of the move.
“I shed no tears for Maduro’s loss of power,” said Central Florida U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost. “But I do shed tears for the destruction of our own democracy. Authoritarians like Donald Trump will always seek justification to break the law in order to start foreign wars for unclear reasons. Congress cannot give him an inch, or there will be much more reckless behavior that endangers lives and allows him to consolidate more power.”
“Allegiance to the U.S. Constitution is not a quaint notion that can be ignored by Trump even when it comes to corrupt Nicolás Maduro,” said Tampa Bay area U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor. “Trump’s justification for regime change and a takeover of Venezuela are unsubstantiated. Trump recently pardoned a convicted drug trafficker Juan Orlando Hernandez and has provided no evidence drug trafficking from Venezuela presents an imminent threat to America’s national security.”
Moody said Monday that that she has been disheartened to hear the criticism from Democrats, saying that “some of  my colleagues immediately start being the mouthpiece of a criminal without understanding the historical facts that led us to this day, and without understanding the law that allows the United State to go after a drug trafficker that cooperates with cartels.”
In her statement, Wasserman Schultz added that the military action now allows Venezuelans to seat “their true democratically elected president, Edmundo González.”
González was the opposition candidate who ran against Maduro in 2024. While electoral authorities in Venezuela claimed Maduro had won a third term in office, then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was clear González won the most votes.
Respect for Maria Corina Machado
Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, has also called on González to be recognized as the rightful leader of the nation. Some analysts have said Machado herself should now rule the country, but Trump seemed to slam the door on that possibility over the weekend, saying that while Machado was a “very nice woman,” “she doesn’t have the support within or respect within the country” to lead Venezuela.
That wasn’t the attitude of the Florida Republicans who spoke Monday.
“She is an incredible woman. She has unbelievable courage,” said Giménez, who added that he and fellow South Florida U.S. Rep. Maria Salazar recently travelled to Oslo to meet with Machado when she received the Nobel Prize. “Do I believe that she has the respect of the Venezuelan people? Absolutely. And she would have been elected the president of Venezuela had Maduro not kicked her off the ballot.”
Scott added that Machado “will be part of the leadership of Venezuela, and I think she’s well respected by Venezuelans.”
Delcy Rodríguez, who has served as Venezuela’s vice president since 2018, was sworn in Monday as the country’s interim president. She is considered a longtime confidant of Maduro and initially criticized the U.S. operation as a violation of the United Nations’ founding charter. However, on Sunday night she offered “to collaborate” with the Trump administration, as reported by the Associated Press.
Giménez said that while it wasn’t ideal that Rodríguez was now in control, it’s probably best for the situation right now.
“Am I happy that Delcy Rodríguez is there? No, I’m not happy … but understand this: The number one thing is to make sure that we don’t have chaos and bloodshed in Venezuela. And so, you have to have a transition to democracy. That’s going to take a while.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-1024x556.png,,,2026-01-05 15:58:25.947232

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)North Carolina faith leaders gathered at the General Assembly in Raleigh Monday to advocate for policies they believe will improve the lives of all North Carolinians in the new year.
The legislature was not in session Monday. They’re scheduled to begin a short session in March and may not address many of the issues advocates highlighted. But Reverend Dr. Floyd Wicker of the People’s Fellowship of North Carolina said the group wanted to speak out in the face of voter suppression, chronic underfunding of public schools, and a health care system which has become unaffordable for far too many.
“To the lawmakers in the General Assembly who wish to suppress our voices and erase all of the gains our dear ancestors fought so hard for us to attain, let it be known we will do all that is in our Holy Ghost power to organize to a better, more equitable North Carolina,” said Wicker.
Geraldine Alshamy, a 72-year-old social justice minister and founder of Mary Magdalene Ministries, braved Monday’s chilly temperatures to advocate for disadvantaged students.
“When lawmakers fail to pass a state budget, it hits not only Black, brown and poor children hardest. It hits all children everywhere,” said Alshamy.
Alshamy grew up in rural Wilson County during the early days of integration. She sees similarities between those days and how schools are being funded now.
“Access to education was promised, but never delivered. We are still at those same times. Support and resources were withheld, and communities were told to make do,” she said.
Alshamy said without appropriate funding, more students in North Carolina struggle with behavioral health problems, and teachers who are not trauma-informed are able to provide little support.
“Every time early intervention is denied, the cost is simply shifted to the courts, law enforcement, prison, and broken families,” said Alshamy.
Republican state legislative leaders have often pointed out that the state’s spending on education has grown every year for the past decade. But the increases have not kept pace with inflation or need, and North Carolina now ranks 48th among all states for per-pupil spending.
Kate Daley with the nonprofit Down Home NC joined the group to advocate for health care funding.
“North Carolina state budget is the last of all 50 states to be passed, still tabled after our legislators left unfinished business,” said Daley. “It remains to be seen how our lawmakers will respond to the billions of dollars missing in federal spending for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.”
Daley said North Carolina will be challenged this year to fill the gap left by federal budget cuts and the state’s shrinking tax revenue.
“Affordable health care, SNAP, and public education are on the line for North Carolina more than ever before, and the time has come to end our state’s corporate tax cuts,” said Daley.
Whether to pause scheduled cuts to state personal and corporate income taxes is one of the sticking points that led to a budget impasse between state House and Senate Republicans in 2025. There’s no indication they’re any closer to an agreement yet.

Tyler Daye, Common Cause N.C.’s policy and civic engagement coordinator, said he was frustrated legislators did not have time to finish a state budget in 2025, but did have time to redraw congressional district maps giving Republicans an advantage in the first congressional district.
“They made the decision to manipulate our voting districts to protect themselves and their friends in power. And legislators went after the only truly competitive congressional districts in the state,” said Daye.
Daye said by ignoring historical voting patterns, legislators have made it more difficult for Black voters in the state to have their voice heard.
“This is cheating,” he said. “It is disgraceful, shameful, and it should be illegal.”
Daye said his organization would again make the case this year for an independent redistricting commission.
“This gerrymandering, or a better word for it, election fraud, election manipulation, must be stopped,” Daye said. “It is disintegrating the integrity of North Carolina’s elections.”
Alshamy knows lawmakers may not choose to address many of the group’s issues this spring. But she remained hopeful – and offered elected officials a stern reminder.
“Leadership is not measured by how much power you hold, but how you protect the citizens of this state,” she said. “I urge you to choose wisely. Choose courage over convenience. Choose children over ideology.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Geraldine-Alshamy-and-faith-leaders-1024x494.jpg,,,2026-01-05 15:58:25.947232

A 23-year-old with a physical and mild mental disability reached out for help from one of Mississippi’s free civil legal organizations after suffering violence and mental abuse from his wife, including a beating that required surgery. 
A judge granted the man a divorce, allowing him to live a life free from abuse, according to client success stories shared by the Mississippi Center for Legal Services Corporation.  
Such free services may be in jeopardy for low-income people in Mississippi and across the country. The U.S. House of Representatives has proposed a 46% cut to the Legal Services Corporation, which funds organizations such as Mississippi’s around the country. Both of the state’s free legal services organizations receive at least two-thirds of their funding from the federal nonprofit. 
In Mississippi, that could mean loss of legal services for over 14,000 individuals, according to estimates by the Legal Services Corporation.
Cuts could lead grantee organizations like the center, which serves people from Jackson to the Gulf Coast, to consider reducing staff, closing offices or scaling back programs, said Sam Buchanan Jr., the center’s executive director. He said the cuts would be devastating for clients.
The center and its companion organization, North Mississippi Rural Legal Services, serve low-income residents. Tight budgets and resources have always meant at least half of all people don’t get the help they need.

“Each year we rely on Congress to fund us at an appropriate level so that we can provide the services that we should be able to provide,” Buchanan said in an interview at the center’s Hattiesburg office, one of four in the center’s service area. 
This year, the center received $3.4 million from the Legal Services Corporation, which is about $500,000 less from the previous year because funding is based on Census counts. Recent counts have shown a decline in Mississippi’s population. 
On average, the two legal service organizations close 4,000 civil cases a year ranging from domestic abuse protection orders, child custody, evictions and employment cases to access to public benefits. 
Both legal service groups work with residents whose income is at or below 125% of the federal poverty guidelines. That’s under $20,000 for a single household and about $33,000 for a household of three. 
“(For) a household, if you operate at a certain income level and you lose 46% of your household income, you’re going to be faced with hard choices,” Buchanan said about potential cuts to the Legal Services Corporation. 
“Do I provide shelter? Do I provide food? Do I provide utilities? So for an organization, it’s the same thing, you have to decide.” 
It’s the same kind of choices some of the center’s clients found themselves in during the 43-day government shutdown as funding for food benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was paused. 
In September, the House and Senate appropriations subcommittees proposed funding for the Legal Services Corporation, going against President Donald Trump’s call to eliminate the organization altogether. 
The House proposed a $300 million appropriation – nearly half of LSC’s funding from 2025 – and the Senate proposed $566 million. 
Legal Service Corporation funding falls under appropriations for commerce, justice and science. 
As of November, Congress has not approved that appropriation. The new fiscal year begins in January, so appropriations would need to be made before then. 
The Mississippi Center for Legal Services Corporation has about 46 full- and part-time staff, including 13 attorneys. Ideally, a legal service center would have two attorneys for every 10,000 eligible people. Buchanan estimates that in reality one attorney serves every 20,000 eligible clients. 
Legal aid providers from around the state met in August to discuss the potential funding threats to free civil aid. 
Some of the potential solutions included recruiting private lawyers to provide pro bono service and encouraging lawyers and recent law school graduates to consider working in underserved areas such as the Delta. 
Despite a potential loss of federal funds, Buchanan said Missisisppi’s free civil legal service organizations want to help, whether that is through providing legal advice, representation or other assistance. 
“I think it’s important that people know that we’re still here, that we are still fighting a good fight and that we’ll continue to do so and that we just need people to understand that from our view point, it’s important that people have equal access to justice, and we are one of the agencies that does that.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/19125836/08.19.25-Sam-Buchanan-Gayla-Carpenter-Sanders-MinnieHoward-069-copy.jpg,,,2026-01-05 15:12:25.043807

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Customers of South Carolina’s two large, private power companies could see their electric bills go up in 2026 — the second time in two years that utilities have hiked base rates.
It has been 16 months since Dominion Energy’s South Carolina customers last saw their rates increase. Now, the Virginia-headquartered company is headed back before state utility regulators seeking to raise base electric rates again.
If approved by the state Public Service Commission, residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month — considered the industry standard — would see another $20 tacked on to their current monthly bill, Dominion’s regulatory manager John Raftery told the SC Daily Gazette. That would take average bills from about $157 a month to just shy of $177, starting in July 2026.
This does not include potential increases for cost of fuel, which can be added to bills along the way.
Dominion’s ask comes on the heels of rate hikes approved for Duke Energy customers across the Upstate and Pee Dee.
And electricity costs have been on the rise nationally, not just in South Carolina.
Utility rate increase requests and approvals totaled more than $34 billion in the first nine months of 2025, according to PowerLines, a nonprofit focused on lowering utility bills. That’s almost double the $16 billion in requests and approvals over the same period in 2024.
The national average price of electricity rose faster than inflation in 2025, and government forecasters at the U.S. Energy Information Administration expect that will continue through this year. But the increases have not hit as hard in South Carolina and many other Southeastern states when compared to the West Coast and Northeast.
Dominion is asking for the increase, which would bring in $332 million more annually from all 820,000 customers it serves across the Lowcountry and Midlands. Utility officials say that will help cover $1.4 billion worth of investments made to the utility’s South Carolina system since March 2024.
That includes:

$500 million spent on the lines that carry power directly to people’s homes and businesses
$270 million spent on large transmission lines that move power around the state
$515 million on power plants and hydropower produced at Lake Murray
$120 million on Hurricane Helene recovery

Utilities’ annual spending on the network of poles and wires that deliver power to customers has nearly tripled over the past two decades, according to U.S. Department of Energy data, as large portions of the electric grid near the end of their 50-year life spans. As climate change drives more frequent storms, fires, heat waves, and cold spells, companies also are having to do more to make the grid more resistant to natural disasters.
Some of those improvements to the transmission lines and a coal-fired power plant near Goose Creek are required by federal energy and environmental regulations, said Keller Kissam, president of Dominion’s South Carolina operations.
Others replace smaller, aging plants that are six decades old and hydro equipment that hasn’t been updated in nearly a century, Kissam added.
Dominion’s spending over the last two years is nearly equivalent to the $1.6 billion it spent in the five years prior. Kissam pointed, in part, to the rising cost of copper, steel and aluminum — all of which goes into the parts and components the utility uses in its power lines and equipment. The company also has added 23,000 new customers in that time.
“I would rather fight a Category 4 hurricane than file a rate case,” Kissam said.
But the company also is collecting less than half of the 9.94% rate of return regulators allowed it in 2024. That rate of return is how Dominion attracts investors willing to front the capital the company needs for construction, Kissam said.
Dominion is, in turn, asking regulators to up that return rate to 10.5%.
Duke Energy
As for Duke Energy, the average residential customer in the Pee Dee will see their bill rise by about $11 a month — from $154 to $165 for 1,000 kilowatt-hours of energy — starting in February. State utility regulators signed off on the rate hike on Dec. 12.
The increase for customers in the Upstate, approved Dec. 31, is far less — less than $1 more per month on average starting in March. But those customers still have a bump that has yet to take effect from a previously approved rate hike. That increase of $6.42 per month for the average residential customer comes in Aug. 1, 2026.
In all, Duke has about 857,000 customers in the Palmetto State.
As part of the deal, Duke will set aside funds, raised from investors, for customers who need help paying their bill when facing financial hardship — $750,000 annually for two years in the Pee Dee and $1.5 million annually for two years in the Upstate, according to the South Carolina chapter of the AARP.
Duke also agreed to take part in a petition asking regulators to review how large energy users — those that consume 50 megawatts or more — are charged for producing the power they require. The provision is aimed at the growing number of large data centers and manufacturing operations coming into South Carolina.
In turn, regulators are allowing Duke a 9.99% rate of return.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/electric-meter-1024x752.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 14:58:02.281897

(Stock photo by Oliver Helbig/Getty Images)Carrying an open package of medical marijuana, hemp, or THC products, including beverages, in a car, would be illegal and could lead to suspension or possible revocation of a patient’s access to medical marijuana under a bill that’s been filed in the Senate.
Fort Myers Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin filed SB 1056 Monday, eight days before the 2026 regular legislative begins.
Martin’s bill would give law enforcement the green light to search a vehicle based on the “plain smell” of edibles, hemp, marijuana, or THC beverages by creating a new statute that provides “legislative intent.” In doing so, the bill aims to blunt the effect of an October 2025 Florida Second District Court of Appeal ruling that the smell of marijuana alone is not enough to establish probable cause for a police search because marijuana no longer is illegal.
Because the ruling was in conflict with one of its previous rulings, the appeals court certified the question of whether the legalization of medical marijuana and hemp in Florida means the “plain smell” doctrine, which allows searches based solely on the smell of marijuana, still is valid. 
Sen. Martin didn’t immediately reply to Florida’s Phoenix’s request for comment on the bill.
The ban on the carry of open medical marijuana products applies to both drivers and passengers, although it wouldn’t apply to paying commercial passengers or passengers on buses or passengers in self-contained motor homes that are longer than 21 feet. The definition of “open container” mirrors the definition of open container for alcohol.
The bill has different penalties for drivers and passengers who break the law.

There are 929,655 medical marijuana patients in Florida, Office of Medical Marijuana Use data show.
Both drivers and passengers who violate the law could be charged with a noncriminal moving traffic violation and suspension of their medical marijuana identification cards, which enable them to buy the product. And both drivers and passengers who repeatedly violate the law could have their access to medical marijuana permanently revoked.
A driver who breaks the law a second time could be imprisoned for up to 90 days and forced to pay up to a $500 fine or both. Jail time for a third offense for a driver would be increased to up to six months and the potential fine upped to $1,000.
Police won’t have to wonder whether the driver or passenger owns the open product. Under the bill, an open container of edibles would be considered to be in the possession of the driver unless it is located in a locked glove compartment, locked trunk, or other locked part of the vehicle, or is in the physical control of the passenger.

(Photo from Joe Powers Facebook page)The leader of Rhode Island’s Republican Party is stepping down, less than one year after winning a second term in a contentious and competitive internal election. 
GOP Chairman Joe Powers announced his resignation on Sunday — though it doesn’t take effect until Jan. 15 — citing the demands and rigorous travel schedule of his paid job as a business consultant.
“The role of Chairman demands constant focus and daily engagement, especially moving into an election year, neither of which Chairman Powers can provide at this time,” the party said in a press release.
Powers, 55, was first elected to the top position within the state’s Republican Party in March 2023, after losing his campaign to unseat Democratic Sen. Frank Lombardi in the 2022 election. The 55-year-old Cranston resident won a second, two-year term in March 2025, fending off challenger Jessica Drew-Day in an animus battle over the future of the state’s small Republican presence. The 2025 election was also the first time a challenger attempted to unseat an incumbent GOP chair in 30 years.
In an interview Monday morning, Powers said he had no regrets about running for reelection in 2025, despite his decision now to step away.
“We worked our tails off trying to put together a foundation,” Powers said of his time as party leader. Under his oversight, the GOP updated its bylaws for the first time in 20 years, and filled all the seats on its six party standing committees, which oversee finances, messaging, rules and other tasks.
But he has struggled to balance the full-time party leadership role — one he said demands 60 hours weekly — with his day job. Powers said his business consulting practice began ramping up a year ago as he took on new clients, increasing “exponentially” within the last six months.
He penned his public resignation letter on Saturday from Tampa, Florida, where he was traveling for work. By Monday morning, he’d left the Sunshine State, stopping through Texas and ending in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He spoke to Rhode Island Current, and called in for a scheduled interview on WPRO host Tara Granahan’s Monday morning radio show, from his hotel room.
Unlike media interviews, though, the work of the state party leader requires a physical presence — attending all of the half dozen executive committee meetings throughout the year, and intermittent pop-ups at the many municipal meetings, candidate trainings and fundraisers that occur each month. 
“It’s too important for Rhode Island, especially Republican Rhode Islanders, not to have somebody who can have their hands, or at least their shadow, on all the work and all the goings on inside the party,” Powers said to Granahan.
Powers also highlighted the “highly contested” state and local elections — including general officers and all 113 members of the Rhode Island General Assembly — approaching in November.
“I would take it personally if I squandered it because I couldn’t participate,” Powers said in Granahan’s show. 
Two Republicans, Aaron Guckian and Elaine Pelino, have publicly announced they are running for governor, while Republican James Loughlin is vying for the lieutenant governor position. The state GOP has not endorsed candidates in the November elections yet, but is offering campaign training, promotional and fundraising support to anyone interested.
Just 14% of the state’s 744,618 registered voters identify as Republicans, according to data from the Rhode Island Department of State. 
But the Ocean State’s historically solid blue appearance has turned toward purple, with 40% of state voters backing Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election — the highest support for a Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush was elected in 1988. The red wave has yet to appear on Smith Hill: All of Rhode Island’s general office holders and 98 of 113 state legislators are Democrats.
During the 2025 GOP party elections, Drew-Day criticized Powers for not spending more time and effort recruiting candidates for state and local offices. Drew-Day, 48, of South Kingstown, co-founded an independent political action committee in 2022 to fill the gap, claiming to have supported more than a dozen Republican candidates in 2023 and 2024.
The battle between the two partners turned competitors — Drew-Day was first vice chair to Powers from 2023 to 2025 —  grew hostile in the final days leading up to the March 2025 election. The Warwick event itself featured allegations of voter disenfranchisement and local police being called to escort one member of the West Warwick Republican Town Committee out of the venue, although he was not arrested.
Drew-Day has since declared her intent to challenge Democratic Rep. Carol McEntee for the seat representing parts of South Kingstown and Narragansett in the November 2026 election. She ran and lost to McEntee for the same seat in 2022 and 2024.
Powers’ resignation, prompting a special election within 30 days, might make Drew-Day change campaigns. 
“I’m an organizer,” she said in an interview Monday. “I love people. And as I said before, I thought I could do a better job.”
She hasn’t made up her mind yet on switching to a run for GOP chair.
Powers declined to comment on Drew-Day’s prospective candidacy for the leadership role.
“Everyone has an opportunity to put their name in,” he said. “I’m not endorsing anybody until I see the full spectrum of candidates.”
Powers had already called a few potential candidates on his own to gauge their interest in taking over, but none could commit to the hours and effort required, he said. Powers declined to name the people he contacted when asked by Rhode Island Current.
Allyn Meyers, a former state Senate candidate who lives in Tiverton, might also be considering a run, according to news reports. Meyers could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday.
The full list of contenders won’t be revealed until the internal meeting sometime on or around Feb. 15, when 130 state and local Republican delegates will be asked to vote on their new leader. Niyoka Powell, first vice chair, will call the special election, serving as acting chair in the interim.
Powell did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
Powers will continue as chairman emeritus within the party’s State Central Committee, which offers him voting rights in party elections.

Gov. Phil Scott made two appointments to the Vermont Supreme Court, naming one former top federal prosecutor and another currently serving in that role for Vermont to fill the open spots on the state’s high court.  
Scott, a Republican, announced in a press release Monday the appointments of Christina Nolan, who served as U.S. Attorney for Vermont from 2017 to 2021 during the first President Donald Trump administration, and Michael Drescher, who served as the acting U.S. Attorney for Vermont, in Trump’s second administration.
Nolan and Drescher fill vacancies on the five-member Vermont Supreme Court following Justice William Cohen’s retirement late last year and Justice Karen Carroll’s retirement a few months earlier. The appointments require the confirmation of the state Senate.

“These appointments are important to maintain the trust of Vermonters in a fair and independent legal system,” Scott said in the release. “Christina and Michael both demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to public service, the rule of law, justice and will be great additions to the Court.”
Nolan, of Burlington, has worked in private practice for law firm Sheehey Furlong and Behm following her stint as U.S. Attorney for Vermont. She ran an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2022, losing in the Republican primary. 
Nolan had joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont in 2010, and she was later unanimously confirmed for the top post in the office by the U.S. Senate in 2017. 
“This is an opportunity like no other to continue to make a positive difference in the lives of Vermonters and to uphold the rule of the law and the Constitution,” Nolan said in the release. “I am humbled by the Governor’s confidence in me and by this new opportunity to serve the state I call home.”
Drescher, of Hinesburg, has worked as a federal prosecutor in Vermont for more than two decades, taking over as the top federal prosecutor in the state last year after Trump took office. Drescher held the role first as the acting U.S. Attorney for Vermont. 
Late last year, after he served the maximum amount of time allowed by law in that acting role, his title changed to First Assistant U.S. Attorney, though he insisted he was still in charge of overseeing the office in Vermont.
It’s unclear why Trump did not put forth Drescher’s name for confirmation to the U.S. Senate for the role of U.S. Attorney for Vermont on a permanent basis. The U.S. Department of Justice website currently lists the U.S. Attorney for Vermont post as vacant. 
In his role as the top federal prosecutor in Vermont, Drescher has taken the lead in enforcing many of the policies in Vermont of the U.S. Justice Department under Trump, from immigration enforcement to filing federal charges that carry the death penalty for the first time in cases in the state in years. 
“I have spent the last 30 years working with and appearing before Vermont judges in state and federal courts,” Drescher said in the release Monday announcing his appointment to the Vermont Supreme Court. 
“Drawing on that experience,” Drescher added, “I pledge to help lead a court system in which everyone is treated with dignity and respect, justice is administered fairly and efficiently, and individual rights are protected.”
Scott said in the release that the names of both Nolan and Drescher were forwarded to him on a list of candidates deemed well-qualified by the Judicial Nominating Board.

The Iowa Board of Nursing alleges that on Dec. 3, 2024, licensed practical nurse Rachel Blair of Windsor Heights was working at an unspecified Urbandale care facility when the medication count was reported as being off during her shift, indicating the staff was unable to account for missing drugs.
According to the board, the facility was missing one fentanyl patch. During that same shift, the board alleges, Blair “fell to her hands and knees and struggled to stand.” Paramedics were called to the scene and administered Narcan — a drug commonly used for emergency treatment of an opioid overdose — to Blair.

As a result of that incident, the board recently charged Blair, 35, with misappropriating the medications of a patient or agency, then agreed to settle the case by providing Blair with a warning that any future violations could result in some form of disciplinary action. As part of that settlement, Blair agreed to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program and to comply with any requirements of the program.
Blair’s nursing license remains otherwise unencumbered by any restrictions on her practice.
In 2020, the board charged Blair with attempting to initiate a sexual, emotional or business relationship with a patient. According to the board, Blair was working at a county jail in April 2019 when she participated in personal telephone calls with an inmate. “At times, the calls were sexually explicit in nature,” the board alleged.
According to the board, Blair was then fired from the jail for providing “treatment” for an inmate despite the lack of a physician’s order, and for admitting to having “feelings for an inmate.”
Court records show that a Polk County Jail inmate at the time told jail officials that a nurse, later identified as Blair, had been providing tobacco, drugs and sex to an inmate known as “Casper.” According to a search warrant application filed by the sheriff’s department, Blair admitted to providing “Casper” with unordered, undocumented “massaging treatments,” approximately 15 times over four to six weeks, in a private treatment room.
According to the warrant application, a subsequent review of the jail’s recorded telephone calls uncovered communications between Blair and the inmate that included “sexual content and comments referencing a personal relationship.”
A review of text messages then uncovered 199 written exchanges between Blair and the inmate, according to the warrant application. The messages also included 21 photos of Blair, the sheriff’s department alleged. In addition, the warrant application alleged that money had been deposited into the inmate’s account three separate times by depositor “Clare Loren” — Loren being Blair’s middle name and the name associated with the text messages attributed to Blair.
According to the application, Blair admitted destroying potential evidence in the case during the initial stages of the sheriff’s investigation of the matter.
In that case, the Board of Nursing suspended Blair’s nursing license pending the completion of a mental health evaluation and also required her to complete an educational course on professional boundaries.
At the end of the suspension, Blair’s license was placed on probation for two years.

(Courtesy photo)The Democratic primary race for Montana’s Western Congressional District is getting more crowded.
On Monday, Missoula smokejumper and union leader Sam Forstag announced his entrance into a field that already has two declared candidates.
“It’s become too damn hard for most Montanans to afford basic things like housing, healthcare, childcare, and even groceries,” Forstag said in his campaign announcement. “I’m running for Congress because I’m done pretending the rich and powerful are going to take care of us. We take care of us.”
Forstag graduated from the University of Montana where he was a student senator with the Associated Students of the University of Montana (ASUM) and was elected ASUM president his senior year.
He has worked for the U.S. Forest Service for several years, including as a smokejumper, the elite wildland firefighters that parachute into rugged, remote terrain.
“I know what it’s like to work a thousand hours of overtime and still be holding on by my fingernails,” Forstag said in his announcement video, adding that he’s “trained to deal with a crisis.”
Forstag currently serves as vice president of the NFFE-FSC Local 60 Union, which represents roughly 800 Forest Service workers across the Lolo, Bitterroot and Custer-Gallatin National Forests.
Drawing on his experience as a firefighter and local organizer, Forstag spoke during the “Fighting Oligarghy” rally led by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in Missoula last spring, advocating for public lands and public service workers.
In his campaign announcement, Forstag blamed U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, the Republican incumbent in the race, for “getting millions richer, cutting taxes for corporations and his rich friends while the rest of us fall further behind.”
Zinke won two elections in Montana as the state’s sole at-large representative before he was selected as President Donald Trump’s Interior Secretary during the first Trump term. Zinke resigned amid several federal probes that found he broke ethics rules.
But when the latest census gave Montana an additional seat in Congress, Zinke, who is from Whitefish, ran for the state’s western seat in 2022, winning by 3.5 percentage points. He was reelected in 2024 by nearly eight points.
The Cook Political Report currently rates Montana’s western district as “Likely Republican” with a +5 margin. The state’s eastern district, represented by freshman Rep. Troy Downing, is rated as “Solid Republican” with a +15 margin.
However, midterm elections tend to favor the political party out of power, and state and federal elections throughout 2025 showed a marked swing away from GOP candidates.
A perceived competitiveness of the western district has opened the gates for Democrats to jump into the race. Currently, Russ Cleveland, of St. Regis, and Matt Rains, of Simms, have entered the race, both touting similar backgrounds in agriculture and as veterans.
It is also widely expected that Ryan Busse, who lost a race against Gov. Greg Gianforte last fall, will enter the race, following a poll that circulated assessing a head-to-head matchup between Busse and Zinke.
Forstag has not run for political office outside of UM, and is one of two political newcomers in the primary field as of right now.
“This campaign is about making sure that every Montanan can work a good job and afford a roof over their head, healthcare, childcare, and a good retirement,” Forstag said in a statement.
“For too long, politicians in both parties have left working people behind, trying to turn us all against each other while they rig the system in favor of corporations and rich donors. We can do better than that. We’re up against a lot of money, but if we pull together and work hard, we can fix these systems so that they work for all of us.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/unnamed-12-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-05 13:57:20.250825

(Courtesy HCA)New Mexico’s Health Care Authority will receive $211.5 million in federal funding aimed at shoring up health care delivery for roughly one-third of the state’s residents who live in rural areas.
The award marks the first of five funding rounds authorized in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that President Donald Trump signed last year. The bill required states to submit applications by early November for their part of a $50 billion appropriation for rural healthcare improvements.
New Mexico’s application sought $1 billion over the next five years, including $200 million in the first round, for five rural health care initiatives. The initiatives aim to improve rural access to medical specialists; increase the number of community health programs; train more health care workers; reduce financial strain on hospitals; and establish a rural health data-sharing platform. 
“The funding will strengthen the hospitals and clinics that are lifelines in our communities. New Mexico’s award is above the national average, and we’re ready to put these resources to work for the families who need them most,” Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo said in a statement about the award.
NM’s biggest farmers’ market manager says SNAP cuts will be ‘devastating’

New Mexico received $11.5 million more than it requested, which HCA spokesperson Marina Piña told Source New Mexico resulted from the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service’s “independent” funding methodology that considered the state’s rural healthcare needs and the plans it put forward to address them.
New Mexico received the 13th-most funding in the country, according to CMS data. Texas got the most, receiving a little over $280 million, and New Jersey had the smallest award, approximately  $147 million.
The state’s application noted that 26 of New Mexico’s 33 counties are rural, and their residents tend to have higher rates of heart disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease than their urban counterparts, while often being forced to travel between 50 and 100 miles for basic health care services. 
Eight of out 27 rural New Mexico hospitals are at risk of closure, according to a 2025 analysis the application cited, with four facing “immediate risk [of closure] absent intervention.” Four other federally qualified health centers have closed in recent years, as well. 
Several state Republicans have lauded the funding award as a necessary investment in rural health care. Still, independent estimates show the federal spending bill will cut rural Medicaid spending overall by $137 billion over the next decade. 
In addition to demonstrating the need for the funding, the state also had to address how it intends to comply with the Trump administration’s policy priorities, including aspects of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s agenda. 
For example, states had to confirm whether they intend to have schools implement the “Presidential Fitness Test,” which Kennedy’s uncle John F. Kennedy spearheaded as president in the late 1950s. New Mexico officials said they would pursue legislative and regulatory changes to implement the test in schools by 2029. 
The application also required states to describe their plans for medical licensure compacts, which have emerged as a top issue during New Mexico’s upcoming legislative session as a way to address the state’s doctor shortage. Unlike its neighboring states, New Mexico does not participate in many of the key medical compacts that enable easy license transfer between states for a variety of health care professions.

State officials wrote they intend to push the Legislature to pursue compact approval for doctors, emergency medical service providers, psychologists and physicians’ assistants during the upcoming session. 
Sen. Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) recently told Source that he expects the Legislature to approve compacts for doctors and social workers at the upcoming session, but that other compacts are still being worked out. 
While the state’s application agreed to pursue adoption of a new statewide fitness test and medical compacts, it said it “does not plan to pursue” another of Kennedy’s priorities: prohibiting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients from buying junk food. 
Officials wrote that the state provides “robust educational opportunities” for SNAP recipients about healthy food choices and incentivizes recipients to buy nutritious food through, for example, programs at farmers’ markets.
Piña told Source that CMS did not penalize the state for its responses to those questions.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kari-Armijo-HSD-e1698169804163-999x1024.png,,,2026-01-05 13:57:20.250825

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., announced her reelection campaign Monday in a video posted to social media.
In the video, Fedorchak is described as someone who supports the “America first” agenda and will keep North Dakota as her “top priority.”
“As a fourth-generation North Dakotan, I want the very best state and nation — for my kids and for yours,” Fedorchak said in a social media post. 
This will be Fedorchak’s first reelection campaign for North Dakota’s only U.S. House seat. She defeated Democratic-NPL Party candidate Trygve Hammer during the 2024 general election with 69% of the statewide vote and won the five-candidate Republican primary election with 46% of the vote.
During her first year in Congress, Fedorchak introduced the Ending Intermittent Energy Subsidies Act, which aimed to curtail federal subsidies for wind and solar projects. Portions of the act were included in the 2025 Republican budget reconciliation package, the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act, that was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July.
She also voted in favor of the House Republican health care proposal in December, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, which includes a transparency provision targeting pharmacy benefit managers, cost-sharing reductions and expands access to association health plans. The health care bill does not extend the Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits. The bill is under consideration by the U.S. Senate.
Trump endorsed Fedorchak’s reelection bid in a social media post in August.
When asked if she plans to seek the North Dakota Republican Party’s endorsement at its state convention in March, Kate Roberts, a spokesperson for the Fedorchak campaign, said North Dakotans “expect the state party” to stand with Trump’s endorsed candidate.
In December, former-Republican-endorsed U.S. House Candidate Alex Balazs announced he will challenge Fedorchak for the state’s lone U.S. House seat. Balazs finished fourth out of five Republican candidates during the 2024 primary election with 4% of the statewide vote.

His death created a vacuum in my heart and soul.
Grief rushed in to fill it.
This is painful to write. It conjures the joyful moment when this precious little boy came into our lives—and how, over time, we watched that joy slip away, replaced by anxiety and alcohol addiction.
Addiction and mental illness are real. So is recovery—through introspection, diagnosis, treatment, and support.
No, people battling these brain diseases cannot simply “stop” and get over it.
Addiction will kill you. And it will rip the heart and soul from those who love you, as parents, family, and friends struggle to provide encouragement for treatment—along with love and support—while trying not to feed the fire of addiction.
I love my son. Even when I was angry and sad about some of his behaviors and choices.
I—his mother—and his friends all tried to support his sobriety. In the end, perhaps we wanted it more for him than he wanted it for himself.
Yes, I second-guessed my parenting—how I let my son down, how I disappointed him—while intellectually and professionally knowing that alcoholism is a disease, and the disease is not me.
Be clear: addiction and mental health issues skip no ZIP code. They do not care about titles, economic status, professional degrees, or the power one thinks they possess. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Few families escape the horrors of trying to secure the help, care, and support needed on the long road to recovery for someone they love.
The national tragedy—the alleged murder of actor and producer Rob Reiner’s parents, Michele and Carl Reiner, by their son who reportedly battled mental illness and addiction since adolescence—brought this pain flooding back.
If you are shaking your head thinking, “Not me,” don’t be so sure. Just wait.
The news is devastating. You soon realize how helpless you are unless—and until—your loved one chooses recovery and sobriety. And even then, that choice is only one moment, one day at a time.
Alcohol—and stigma—kill
Michigan’s rate of alcohol-related deaths is slightly higher than the national average.
In 2023, alcohol-involved traffic crashes resulted in 297 fatalities. The annual per capita death rate from excessive alcohol use in Michigan increased by more than 40 percent between 2015 and 2019. An average of 4,548 deaths each year in Michigan are attributable to excessive alcohol use.
Nationally, more than 178,000 deaths—approximately 120,000 men and 59,000 women—are attributed to excessive alcohol use.
A tremendous loss of love and life.
I still feel a tinge of shame and stigma when admitting this painful family truth. That stigma—yes, it is there—hurts as well.
Stigma remains a major barrier to people getting the behavioral health care and support they need.
I have spent years working in the behavioral health field, serving as Michigan’s state mental health director under former Governor James Blanchard, and as president and CEO of the Detroit Wayne Integrated Health Network.
I know better.
And yet, I admit the fear, embarrassment, shame, and judgment still cling to me like cheap cigar smoke in a darkened bar. We must defeat stigma if we are to give people a real chance at life.
Personally and professionally, I have witnessed the joy that comes when individuals are ready for help and the health care system is there to meet them. I have also felt deep pain watching disease prevent people from accessing help—or worse, when a bureaucratic and underfunded system failed them.
We can—and must—do better.
Today, my grief comes in waves: disbelief and denial, anger and guilt, moments of comfort, and the search for ways to move forward—not on— as I gradually adjust to and accept this profound loss.
The sadness slowly evaporates, though despair still lingers beneath the surface, replaced more often now by memories of love, acceptance, forgiveness, and gratitude for the time Daniel and I had—rather than the time we did not.
As a society, we must do better.
We must educate people that help is available, provide resources to strengthen chronically underfunded public mental health systems, and eradicate the stigma that prevents people from seeking help.
I owe my ongoing recovery from this tragic loss to three invaluable community resources:

DNR personnel may examine the fish’s internal organs or take a piece of fin tissue for DNA analysis and aging.
Lake sturgeon are one of the oldest species in the Great Lakes. While they were previously considered threatened due to habitat loss and overfishing, the DNR partnered with Sturgeon for Tomorrow, Michigan State University, Tower-Kleber Limited partnership, the Bay Mills Indian Community, the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians to rehabilitate lake sturgeon populations in Black Lake. 
Over the past two decades, lake sturgeon populations in Black Lake have increased due to rearing and stocking efforts, research and the protection of spawning adults, and the DNR expects this trend to continue.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-05 18:19:25+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘We need to pray and fast’: Mississippi’s child care providers await guidance on voucher funding freeze,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/05/child-care-vouchers-providers-concern/,"Cantrell Keyes, director of Agape Christian Academy World, talks about her academy in Jackson on Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Cantrell Keyes thought the Trump administration’s decision to freeze federal funding for child care was “fake news.” 
On New Year’s Day, the Jackson-based child care provider said several of her colleagues in the business called her to ask if it was true: The federal government had decided to freeze funding that helps low-income families pay for child care – and keeps hundreds of Mississippi day cares like Keyes’ afloat. 
The stated reason? Right-wing influencer Nick Shirley’s unverified and viral YouTube video that claimed Somali-run day care centers in Minnesota were taking the federal funds but serving no children – allegations that state has contended with and sought to address for more than a decade. 
“I just could not imagine that our president would not have the mindset to secure services for children and not understand that this would be affecting businesses,” Keyes said. “That’s why I couldn’t believe that that is even real.” 
It’s too early to tell how the decision, announced in an X post on Dec. 30, will impact Mississippi’s already fragile child care industry. Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary for the U.S. Department of Human Services, wrote in the X post that the federal agency would withhold funding from all 50 states until a state could provide “a justification and a receipt or photo evidence” of proper spending. 
“We need to pray and fast,” said Keyes, who predicts she could not stay open for longer than a month if the voucher she receives for nine families were to be delayed.

The Mississippi Department of Human Services – the state agency that distributes federal funds for child care vouchers to providers — doesn’t yet know the impact either, according to a statement from spokesperson Mark Jones. 
It’s possible the agency already collects all the information federal officials will ask for, Jones said, due to its already “strong monitoring of child care facilities” that receive the voucher. But over the weekend, Jones said the agency had received “no official message or guidance” from the federal government regarding the funding freeze. 
“I have a litany of questions that we are anticipating needing answers for clients and providers,” Jones wrote. “Remember, we heard about this from the media on New Year’s Eve. We have as many questions as anyone.” 
On Jan. 5, the federal government announced it was rescinding rules that permitted states to pay providers without verifying attendance logs, which Jones said Mississippi already collects. 
Not only do the vouchers help low-income families afford tuition, the payments keep providers’ doors open in an industry with unworkable economics, said Cathy Grace, the early childhood program specialist with the nonprofit North Mississippi Education Consortium.
Grace, who has worked in child care for nearly 50 years, said this freeze is unprecedented. 
“If you have any sense of economic development or community development, you have to have the worker bees or you won’t have a community,” she said. “The worker bees are the ones that are going to get hit if they don’t have a place for the kids.” 
On X, the Trump administration said that the freeze is an effort to prevent fraud allegedly occurring in Minnesota from happening across the country. 
But in Mississippi, providers, advocates and MDHS agree: The child care industry does not suffer from widespread fraud. In interviews, all noted it would be difficult for providers to successfully commit the scheme described in Minnesota – taking funds without serving children. 
That’s because of fraud controls the Mississippi Department of Human Services – which doles out the federal funds to child care centers in the state – adopted in the wake of the scandal involving the social safety net program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, to monitor its spending, Jones said. He cited the agency establishing its first compliance program that, among other things, routinely checks monthly payments to providers against their attendance logs. 
“We already do everything that is being flagged” in Minnesota, Jones said. 
MDHS normally reimburses child care providers around the 15th of the month, according to the agency. To be reimbursed, Keyes said she has to submit a monthly ledger to the department reflecting her attendance rolls for the children she’s served. 
There is a downside to this method of fraud prevention, Keyes said. But the voucher follows a child, so if a family disenrolls from Keyes’ facility or moves their child to another facility, MDHS stops sending her the tuition payment.

Sept. 5, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett will resign next week, he announced in a brief email to students, faculty and staff on Monday, leaving UNL nearly six months short of his initial contract.
Bennett, who started at UNL in July 2023, will resign Jan. 12. He led the campus through $27.5 million in budget cuts in the fall, including nearly $7 million in academic program eliminations or mergers approved by the University of Nebraska Board of Regents at a Dec. 5 meeting. The remaining cuts were still in progress as of last month.
“I am writing to share that I will conclude my service as chancellor on Jan. 12,” Bennett said in the opening line of his email.

Bennett’s salary this year was $732,000.
Dr. Jeffrey Gold, president of the NU system, tapped Kathy Ankerson, who retired Dec. 31, 2024, after serving as UNL’s chief academic officer, as UNL’s next interim chancellor. Ankerson previously served as dean, associate dean and professor in UNL’s College of Architecture.
‘Well for the future’
In a separate message, Gold told the NU community he is grateful for Bennett’s service, including his work to stabilize UNL’s financial position, strengthen fundraising and advance student success and retention. Bennett highlighted that work, too, in his departure email. Gold said Bennett’s work has helped position UNL “well for the future.”
“We understand that the news about Chancellor Bennett is one change on top of many other changes,” Gold said. “It will be critical that every member of our UNL community has the opportunity to share their thoughts and help to shape our path forward.”

Gold said he and Ankerson plan to hold several listening sessions, details of which will be shared soon. He said he remains “confident” in UNL’s future, in part with campus budget challenges addressed and UNL nearing joint accreditation with the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
Bennett did not give a reason for leaving UNL but said he believes in the “transformative power of higher education.” 
He indicated he would remain in education, though he didn’t specify whether that would still be in the Cornhusker State. He came to UNL after serving nearly 10 years as president of the University of Southern Mississippi.
“I look forward to exploring opportunities on the horizon that will enable me to elevate mission and purpose in support of student success,” Bennett said.
Contract was set to expire June 30
In November, Bennett became the first UNL chancellor to receive a “no confidence” vote from UNL faculty. The historic vote overwhelmingly passed, 60-14, in part due to concerns over Bennett’s handling of budget challenges.
Bennett declined multiple times to directly address the UNL Faculty Senate action, telling the Examiner after December’s regents meeting UNL had “a lot of work to do” with implementation.
“We’re going to do that with a lot of care and concern for everybody who’s impacted,” he said last month.

Bennett’s contract was originally set to expire June 30. In October, he told the Examiner he desired a contract extension but did not know if or when that might occur.
Gold said at the time he supported an extension but cautioned that it was a decision ultimately left to the regents. In December, Bennett said the situation hadn’t changed.
“You got to talk to the boss about that,” Bennett said Dec. 5 when asked again if his contract would come up for a vote soon. It’s unclear what changed in the month since.
Regent Paul Kenney of Amherst, chair of the NU Board of Regents, said Monday that the board had not discussed Bennett’s contract as a group and that the board had heard “rumors” he might leave before July but “didn’t really know what would happen.” He called Bennett a friend and wished him well.
“I mean, he’s looking to do other things,” Kenney said of Bennett. “Kathy will be a very, very good acting chancellor in his absence, so we’re happy about that, so things ought to go pretty smoothly.”
‘Highest honor and privilege’
In his email, Bennett highlighted a UNL tenure he said stabilized campus enrollment after years of decline, set new records for first-year student retention and six-year graduation rates and enhanced research. He also touted innovation and creative scholarship, advancing statewide extension and natural resource development that includes agriculture and animal welfare, achieving record fundraising milestones and developing “a plan for financial sustainability.”

Bennett extended his “heartfelt gratitude” to faculty, staff, extension-based colleagues, members of the executive leadership team and NU system leaders. He also thanked alumni, donors and friends of UNL.
Addressing UNL’s “outstanding students,” Bennett said each brings to UNL, Lincoln and Nebraska energy, enthusiasm, optimism and determination that he said improves local communities, Nebraska and the world. He described them as“an inspiration to us all.”
“It has been my highest honor and privilege to have served as your chancellor,” Bennett said. “You are the reason we are all here, and I look forward to witnessing how you will embody our belief that every person and every interaction matters, as you change the world for the better.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan is resigning after she was convicted last month of a felony for helping a man avoid immigration enforcement agents in the county courthouse. 
Dugan submitted her letter of resignation to Gov. Tony Evers on Saturday, writing that serving as a judge has been “the honor of my life.” 
“Behind the bench, I have presided over thousands and thousands of cases — with a commitment to treat all persons with dignity and respect, to act justly, deliberatively, and consistently, and to maintain a courtroom with the decorum and safety the public deserves,” Dugan wrote.
Dugan was convicted last month of felony obstruction of justice following a four-day federal trial. The split jury also found she was not guilty of a related misdemeanor. 
The case against her stemmed from an incident at the courthouse April 18 in which she directed an immigrant appearing before her who was in the U.S. without legal authorization through a side door out of her courtroom while federal agents waited in the hallway outside to arrest him. Agents later apprehended the man outside the building. 
Since her April arrest, Dugan’s case has drawn national political attention as an illustration of the Trump administration’s efforts to increase immigration enforcement in ways that many critics say are heavy handed.  
Following the verdict, Wisconsin Republicans demanded that Dugan resign immediately, citing state law that forbids anyone who has been convicted of a felony from serving as a judge. She has been suspended from duty since her arrest. 
Dugan has not yet been sentenced and her legal team has signaled they’ll make a broad and lengthy appeal effort. But Dugan wrote in her letter that the people of Milwaukee County need a permanent judge on the bench. 
“I am the subject of unprecedented federal legal proceedings, which are far from concluded but which present immense and complex challenges that threaten the independence of our judiciary,” Dugan wrote. “I am pursuing this fight for myself and for our independent judiciary. However, the Wisconsin citizens that I cherish deserve to start the year with a judge on the bench in Milwaukee County Branch 31 rather than have the fate of that Court rest in a partisan fight in the state Legislature.”

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)New analysis of federal and state data by the Maine Center for Economic Policy shows the number of Canadians visiting Maine has plummeted since President Donald Trump’s inauguration and as a result economic activity in Maine’s border communities has shrunk significantly.
Since January, Trump has made a number of antagonistic moves towards Canada, from imposing tariffs, accusing the country of allowing fentanyl smugglers to operate unhindered, to threatening to annex the country as the “51st state.” Canadians have responded with their own tariffs and boycotts of American-made products and travel to the United States. 
Because of the president’s immigration policy, many people are afraid to visit the US. Some Canadian students at the University of Maine at Fort Kent and Presque Isle have chosen to complete courses online rather than face increased scrutiny when crossing the border for classes.
The impact of this deterioration in US-Canada relations is materializing on the border in Maine and other states. Since Trump’s inauguration in January through November, almost 750,000 fewer people have crossed the land border into Maine. The largest year-over-year drop-off occurred in April, when there were 35% fewer crossings than in the year before. Since then, visitation has increased somewhat, but crossings were still a quarter lower than expected in November.

Separate data collected by the Canadian government, which records the nationality of travelers crossing the border, reveals this decline is almost entirely driven by Canadians staying away from the US. Between February and July, 367,000 fewer Canadians crossed the Maine-New Brunswick border than the year before, while the number of travelers of other nationalities was just 7,000 fewer. 
The Canadian boycott of Maine has had repercussions on the state’s economy, especially in areas near the border. Fewer Canadian visitors means less money spent in local stores and restaurants. While the Maine Office of Tourism reports Canadians accounted for just 5% of the state’s tourists in 2024, this likely only captures a portion of the Canadians who typically visit Maine — and those visitors have the greatest impact in communities along the border. 
Spending data from Maine Revenue Services show taxable retail sales in the areas of Maine along the Canadian border saw a 3.3% slump in spending between February and August of 2025 compared to the year before. This contrasts with the rest of Maine, where spending rose 1.0% in the same time period. The effect was larger in the restaurant and lodging sector, where sales in border regions were down almost 5%, and up 1.7% in the rest of the state. The area around Biddeford and Old Orchard Beach, which is famously popular with Canadian tourists, also saw a decline in restaurant and lodging sales compared to last year.  
The data show just how damaging President Trump’s rhetoric and policies have been to Maine communities. Many small businesses run on very small margins, and a 3-5% drop in sales can create serious trouble for their finances. The data also demonstrates the way in which Maine and Canada are intertwined economically, especially in border communities. Some of these same areas have struggled economically for years and are the kinds of places President Trump promised to help. Instead, his aggressive foreign policy, chaotic approach to tariffs, and inhumane immigration crackdown have served to make these parts of Maine more isolated and economically worse off.

Mark Kelly for illegal orders video,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pentagon-will-try-penalize-arizona-sen-mark-kelly-illegal-orders-video,,"WASHINGTON — The Defense Department will attempt to downgrade Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly’s retirement rank and pay, seeking to punish him for making a video along with other Democrats in Congress, who told members of the military they didn’t need to follow illegal orders. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth originally threatened to recall Kelly from military retirement and court-martial him for his participation in the video, but announced Monday that the department would instead try to downgrade his rank of captain as well as his retirement pay. “Captain Kelly has been provided notice of the basis for this action and has thirty days to submit a response,” Hegseth wrote in a social media post. “The retirement grade determination process directed by Secretary Hegseth will be completed within forty five days.”Hegseth added that Kelly’s “status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.”Kelly wrote in a social media post that he planned to challenge Hegseth’s attempt to alter his retirement rank and pay, arguing it’s an attempt to punish him for challenging the Trump administration. “My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head– all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,” Kelly wrote. “Generations of servicemembers have made these same patriotic sacrifices for this country, earning the respect, appreciation, and rank they deserve.”Kelly added that Hegseth’s goal with the process is to “send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn’t like, they will come after them the same way. It’s outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.”Constitutional protectionMembers of Congress are generally protected under the speech and debate clause of the U.S. Constitution, which states that unless a lawmaker is involved in treason, felony and breach of the peace, they are “privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.”The Defense Department letter of censure to Kelly alleged that his participation in the video undermined the military chain of command, counseled disobedience, created confusion about duty, brought discredit upon the Armed Forces and included conduct unbecoming of an officer. Hegseth wrote in that letter that if Kelly continues “to engage in conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline, you may subject yourself to criminal prosecution or further administrative action.”Allegations of misconductThe Department of Defense posted in late November that officials were looking into “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly for appearing in the video. It didn’t detail how Kelly might have violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice but stated that “a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.” Hegseth referred the issue to Navy Secretary John Phelan for any “review, consideration, and disposition” he deemed appropriate. Hegseth then asked for a briefing on the outcome of the review “by no later than December 10.”Kelly said during a press conference in early December the military’s investigation and a separate one by the FBI were designed to intimidate the six lawmakers in the video from speaking out against Trump. The lawmakers in the video, who have backgrounds in the military or intelligence agencies, told members of those communities they “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” they said. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”The other Democrats in the video — Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, Pennsylvania Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and New Hampshire Rep. Maggie Goodlander — are not subject to the military justice system. Trump railed against the video a couple of days after it posted, saying the statements represented “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”",,,,2026-01-05 13:12:16.281733

Results are good so far, but some want quality assurances codified into law.","For years, Connecticut residents who receive benefits through the Department of Social Services have dealt with arduous wait times whenever they need support from the agency’s call centers. 
Bobby Berriault, who receives SNAP food assistance and Medicaid benefits, said he spent nearly two hours on hold one day in October trying to resolve a billing issue. His first call dropped after 41 minutes on hold. When he tried back later that day, he waited another 48 minutes before reaching someone.
Berriault considers himself luckier than most. 
Many people don’t have two hours to spend on the phone, he said. Plus, Berriault lives in New Haven, where he said it’s easy enough to hop on the bus and head to the city’s DSS resource center if he can’t get through on the phone. But, he knows there are people who don’t live on bus lines or close to one of the agency’s physical locations.
“The only way that they’re going to be able to get the services that they need to survive is by connecting with someone on the phone. That’s why this issue is really important,” Berriault said.
The agency recently launched a new, modernized phone system meant to address the long wait times. Deputy commissioner Easha Canada said they’re already seeing results. 
“Providing a dignified experience for the 1.2 million people in Connecticut who are serviced by DSS is really, really important to this administration,” Canada said. “We’re really excited about some of the improvements that we’re seeing already.”
In October, the average wait time to get a simple question answered — such as, “Did DSS receive my SNAP application?” or “When will my Medicaid eligibility be determined?” — was 43 minutes. In the first 10 days after the new phone system launched, average wait times fell to just under seven minutes at the nine locations where it was implemented. Call abandonment rates dropped from 48% to 22%. 
The new system includes several features that the old system did not. Instead of sitting on hold, people can leave a voicemail and specify a convenient time to receive a call back. They can also use simplified menu options to indicate the issue they need addressed, so they don’t end up speaking to a Medicaid specialist if they need help with SNAP. 
All 12 call centers will have the new system by the end of January, Canada said.
What took so long?
Berriault has been receiving DSS benefits since 2009 and he said wait times have been an issue since the state implemented a centralized call center in 2013. Before that, each enrollee worked with a dedicated case worker who was familiar with their situation.
“You didn’t call the main number for DSS. You just called your case worker,” Berriault said. “It was a much better system.”
Sheldon Toubman, an attorney with Disability Rights CT, said DSS has never managed to find a sustainable solution for the wait times. Whenever the issue hits a crisis point, the agency hires more staff. But the call center positions have high attrition rates, and the issue inevitably arises again once people leave those roles. 
Advocates are encouraged by the new phone system but they want to see quality assurances guaranteed by law. Some are calling for lawmakers to establish performance metrics for the call centers during the 2026 legislative session. 
Ahead of November’s special session of the General Assembly, Toubman sent a letter on behalf of 24 organizations to legislative leadership calling for statutory requirements to be set at 90% of calls answered within 60 seconds by a human — a metric that mirrors the department’s standards for its contractors.
DSS spokesperson Jalmar De Dios said the agency “supports transparency and accountability,” but that vendors can rapidly scale operations in a way that a state agency cannot.
“Any expansion of performance metrics should be to meaningfully improve service delivery and the client experience rather than creating expectations that do not reflect the operational realities of a public service agency,” De Dios said in an emailed statement.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, who heads up the Human Services Committee with Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, said the two haven’t yet discussed such legislation. But she said she’s interested in a long-term fix for the problem, which she said Gov. Ned Lamont and his budget staff at the Office of Policy and Management have failed to provide.
During the COVID-19 emergency, Connecticut used federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act to staff up the call centers, and wait times improved, Gilchrest said. But when that funding lapsed, the state didn’t replace it, and DSS had to cut call center staff from 125 employees to 40. 
Gilchrest said she’s appreciative of recent improvements but wants to see the issue remain a priority. 
“Many of us were beating that drum and OPM did not put the money in,” Gilchrest said. “We needed this for a while, and I don’t want it to go away.”
De Dios said the ARPA funding was specifically meant to assist with a temporary projected uptake in call center volume as a result of Medicaid “unwinding,” a period beginning in March 2023 where COVID-era eligibility expansions expired and many people were expected to lose coverage. 
Both Toubman and Gilchrest want DSS to establish the number of staff it needs for the call centers to run efficiently and then regularly report how many staff they have, including government employees and vendor partners. 
DSS currently has 59 staff members to handle simpler requests, known as “tier 1,” up from 40 at the beginning of last year, according to De Dios.
Toubman said a permanent fix is particularly important given the new burdens that new federal legislation, H.R. 1 — also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill — places on DSS. New SNAP eligibility requirements began in November. In 2027, Medicaid work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks will also go into effect.
“It’s going to be imperative that there’s a good system where scared people, or people who get terrible notices, can go for help to understand what’s going on,” Toubman said.
Canada said the agency is working to meet these demands. It’s already contracted with a vendor to help with increased call volume following the SNAP changes. Staff are updating systems to be able to perform streamlined income verification for gig workers, as well as pull in education enrollment data to verify future community engagement requirements for Medicaid. 
And in response to Berriault’s recommendation that the call center return to a case worker model, Canada said nothing is off the table.
“As we’re looking at the One Big Beautiful Bill, we’re evaluating new ways of working,” Canada said, including new technologies and processes. But the agency hasn’t yet “landed on what that should look like,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1119_SR_DSSCallCenter_052-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 13:12:16.281733

DeSantis, often hyperactive on social media, was one of the few state leaders who’d stayed quiet in the first days following the operation — even though the Sunshine State boasts the largest Venezuelan community in the nation.
On Monday, he broke his silence.
“We’ve seen the country of Venezuela suffering under the yoke of Marxist ideology, first with Hugo Chávez and then with Nicolás Maduro,” DeSantis said, speaking alongside members of the Florida Cabinet at the entrance to the detention facility his administration has been calling “Deportation Depot” to announce more than 10,000 arrests of undocumented migrants.
“You will be hard pressed to find a reign as destructive as the Chávez-Maduro reign has been; taking a country that has been prosperous with an abundance of resources and basically destroying it and making it so that it’s miserable, repressed, and now one of the poorest countries,” he added.
Late Saturday night, American forces captured Maduro and his wife and brought them to New York. Both were arraigned in federal court on drug trafficking charges.
Doral in South Florida is home to the largest Venezuelan community in the United States. More than 34,000 of its 81,000 residents are of Venezuelan descent.
What was the conference about?
DeSantis called the news conference to celebrate the continuance of Operation Tidal Wave, a detention round-up launched in late April that initially captured more than 1,000 undocumented migrants. Of the updated total as of Monday, DeSantis said, 63% had past criminal charges.
Built at the defunct Baker Correctional Institution in Sanderson — midway between Gainesville and Jacksonville — the state opened “Deportation Depot” mid-September to assist in mass detentions and deportations. It can accommodate 1,310 beds and is expected to hold as many as 2,000 people in a temporary capacity.
It’s been the launch point for 93 deportation flights containing 2,926 people since the center’s opening, DeSantis said.
The North Florida facility came two months after President Donald Trump joined Florida Republicans in opening “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades, the nation’s first state-run detention center.
The state has also been planning for months to open a third center called the “Panhandle Pokey,” but DeSantis said Florida officials are “still waiting” for the Department of Homeland Security to approve it.
He added that Florida may open a fourth detention center in southern Florida. The governor said he’s looking at a number of options but wants to make sure it would “make sense” both in terms of finances and capacity.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security awarded Florida in September a $608 million reimbursement grant for costs associated with the detention and deportation of migrants. This came months after Florida became the first — and only — state to require all 67 counties to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The anti-undocumented immigration sentiment sweeping Florida politics was both inspired by and mirrored in the White House after Trump took office in January 2025. Trump, beginning his second term, emphasized sealing the southern border as a top priority for his administration and removing migrants in the country without official permission.
Florida Republicans heartily agreed. The GOP-dominated Legislature passed a comprehensive law in early 2025 — weeks after Trump’s inauguration — creating state-level penalties for illegally entering Florida, mandating the death penalty for noncitizens who commit capital crimes, and nixing in-state tuition for undocumented college students.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0904-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 13:12:16.281733

Tim Walz ended his campaign for a historic third term on Monday amid mounting pressure from members of his own party and intense attacks from Republicans over widespread fraud in state-run social services programs.

 Gov. Tony Evers statement on Walz decision to suspend campaign
Gov. Tony Evers released the following statement on Gov. Tim Walz ‘s announcement:
“Tim has always been a good friend and a good neighbor to us across the river, and I’m incredibly grateful we’ve had the opportunity to serve as governors of our states together. I’ve always appreciated our friendship, Tim’s wit and candor, and how relentless he is about working to improve the everyday lives of Minnesotans and people across our country.
“Most of all, Tim is a devoted husband and father, and he is a dedicated public servant who’s spent his career putting others before himself—and that’s just as true today as it’s ever been.
“Kathy and I are thinking of Tim and Gwen and the kids today, as we know how important family is when making these kinds of decisions. We’re grateful to call them friends.
“I look forward to working with Tim in the days and months ahead as we continue getting good things done for the people of our states.”


	
[/infobox]Walz defended his record in a statement and said he was certain he could win a third term, but couldn’t give his entire attention to rooting out fraud while running a campaign.
“I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work,” Walz said in a statement.
Some Democratic-Farmer-Labor elected officials have quietly worried for months that Walz’s name at the top of the ticket would hand Republicans the governorship for the first time in 15 years and sink Democrats’ prospects down the ballot.
Walz met on Sunday with U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who expressed her interest in running for governor, The New York Times reported. Other possible Democratic candidates include Attorney General Keith Ellison and Secretary of State Steve Simon
A slew of Republicans have already entered the race including House Speaker Lisa Demuth, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and former congressional candidate Kendall Qualls.
Walz spent 12 years in Congress before winning the governor’s race in 2018. After the DFL won control of both chambers of the Legislature in 2022, Walz signed in the law the most significant progressive agenda in at least a generation, including free school meals for all students; paid family and medical leave; and the legalization of marijuana.
He burst onto the national political stage in 2024 after former President Joe Biden abandoned his campaign for re-election and then-Vice President Kamala Harris selected Walz as her running mate. Walz became a frequent target of President Donald Trump, whose attacks continued even after Trump won the presidential election.
Walz announced in September that he would run for an unprecedented third, four-year term, after deliberating for months. The assassination of Walz’s friend and close ally, House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman in June, forced Walz and his family to weigh the potential costs of another four years in office.
Trump’s attacks on Walz ratcheted up in recent months as national Republicans learned about the wide-scale fraud that has taken place in Minnesota’s social services programs during his tenure, including the highly-publicized Feeding Our Future scandal, in which fraudsters pocketed hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars intended to feed children during the pandemic.
In December, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson announced new fraud charges in state-administered Medicaid programs, estimating that fraudsters have stolen as much as $9 billion in government funds. Walz disputed Thompson’s estimate, painting it as a political attack.






Read Gov. Tim Walz’s full statement:
Good morning, and Happy New Year.
Like many Minnesotans, I was glad to turn the page on 2025. It was an extraordinarily difficult year for our state. And it ended on a particularly sour note.
For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state’s generosity. And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.
I won’t mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St. Paul, and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place. They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family. They’ve already begun by taking our tax dollars that were meant to help families afford child care. And they have no intention of stopping there.
Make no mistake: We should be concerned about fraud in our state government. We cannot effectively deliver programs and services if we can’t earn the public’s trust. That’s why, over the past few years, we’ve made systemic changes to the way we do business.
We’ve gone to the legislature time and again to get more tools to combat fraud. We’ve fired people who weren’t doing their jobs. We’ve seen people go to jail for stealing from our state. We’ve cut off whole streams of funding, in partnership with the federal government, where we saw widespread criminal activity. We’ve put new locks on the doors of our remaining programs, and we’ve hired a new head of program integrity to make sure those locks can’t be broken.
All across the state, Minnesotans are hard at work on this problem. Advocates, administrators, investigators are on the front lines defending the integrity of our state’s programs, and I want to thank them for their efforts.
There’s more to do. A single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar too much to tolerate. And while there’s a role to play for everyone – from the legislature to prosecutors to insurance companies to local and county government – the buck stops with me. My administration is taking fast, decisive action to solve this crisis. And we will win the fight against the fraudsters.
But the political gamesmanship we’re seeing from Republicans is only making that fight harder to win.
We’ve got Republicans here in the legislature playing hide-and-seek with whistleblowers.
We’ve got conspiracy theorist right-wing YouTubers breaking into daycare centers and demanding access to our children.
We’ve got the President of the United States demonizing our Somali neighbors and wrongly confiscating childcare funding that Minnesotans rely on.
It is disgusting. And it is dangerous.
Republicans are playing politics with the future of our state. And it’s shameful. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: We welcome ideas from anyone, in any party, who wants to help us continue to stay ahead of the criminals.
And we welcome the involvement of the federal government. I’m grateful to the career professionals at the U.S. Attorney’s office and the FBI who are helping us win this fight.
But I cannot abide the actions of the political leadership in Washington – these opportunists who are willing to hurt our people to score a few cheap points. They and their allies have no intention of helping us solve the problem – and every intention of profiting off of it.
Which brings me to this: 2026 is an election year. And election years have a way of ramping up the politics at a time when we simply can’t afford more politics.
In September, I announced that I would run for a historic third term as Minnesota’s Governor. And I have every confidence that, if I gave it my all, I would succeed in that effort.
But as I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all. Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.
So I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.
I know this news may come as a surprise. But I’m passing on the race with zero sadness and zero regret. After all, I didn’t run for this job so I could have this job. I ran for this job so I could do this job. Minnesota faces an enormous challenge this year. And I refuse to spend even one minute of 2026 doing anything other than rising to meet the moment. Minnesota has to come first – always.
That’s what I believe servant leadership demands of me. And as an optimist, I will hold out some hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will consider what servant leadership demands of them in this moment. We can work together to combat the criminals, rebuild the public’s trust, and make our state stronger. But make no mistake: If Republicans continue down this path of abusing power, smearing entire communities, and running their own fraudulent game at the expense of Minnesotans – we will fight back every step of the way.
I’m confident that a DFLer will hold this seat come November. I’m confident that I will find ways to contribute to the state I love even after I’ve left office next January. But there will be time to worry about all that later.
Today, I’m proud of the work we’ve done to make Minnesota America’s best place to live and raise kids – from our new paid leave policy to our child tax credit to our free lunch program.
And I’m doubly proud of the incredible team we’ve put together to make that vision a reality. Thank you to every member of my staff, and every state employee, who’s part of this fight. We need you on the job to tackle the important work ahead.
Most of all, I want Minnesotans to know that I’m on the job, 24/7, focused on making sure we stay America’s best place to live and raise kids. No one will take that away from us. Not the fraudsters. And not the President. Not on my watch.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Court of Appeals website)TOPEKA — The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of a lawsuit filed on behalf of a Kansas Army National Guard soldier alleging she was fired from a civilian job in violation of federal law offering employment protection to individuals deployed for military service.
The decision by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals sought clarity to the definition of “employer” in terms of whether the Finney County Health Department and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment were responsible for maneuvering in 2010 that ended Staff Sgt. Stacey Gonzales’ employment as a disease intervention specialist.
The appellate court said a federal district court judge improperly dismissed in 2024 the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2022 alleging KDHE engaged in “reckless disregard” of federal law — the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 — implemented to shield employment rights of military servicemembers.
The Court of Appeals’ decision in late December reversed the district court’s summary judgment in favor of Kansas and sent the case back for further proceedings.
The district court judge had concluded KDHE wasn’t Gonzales’ employer, but the appellate court held the definition of employer under USERRA also covered entities that exercised control over employment opportunities of employees.
“The record evidence … allows a reasonable finding that KDHE retained the requisite level of control over Gonzales’s employment opportunities to be a USERRA employer,” the appellate court said. “The district court’s order granting summary judgment is therefore reversed.”
Gonzales, of Garden City, sought through the Justice Department suit lost wages and benefits as a result of KDHE’s decision to end grant funding to the Finney County’s disease prevention program and the ultimate termination of her employment.
From 2001 to 2010, Gonzales served as Finney County’s local disease intervention specialist. She intermittently had military obligations, during which she was absent from the civilian job. Gonzales deployed overseas twice to Iraq and once to Kuwait during her time in the National Guard.
In the disease specialist job, the Court of Appeals said, Gonzales was supervised by local and state personnel. Her salary and benefits were determined and paid by Finney County, the appellate court said, but her day-to-day work, training and performance evaluations involved significant oversight from KDHE.
When KDHE decided not to renew the Aid-to-Local grant in 2010 due to perceived performance deficiencies, Finney County terminated Gonzales’ position.
“The evidence indicates KDHE had some influence on the hiring of Gonzales in 2001 and the elimination of her position in 2010,” the Court of Appeals said. “Whether that rose to the level of KDHE being a USERRA employer by having sufficient control of Gonzales’s employment opportunities was something the district court did not adequately address.”
Attorneys representing the state of Kansas argued the Justice Department’s “expansive” interpretation of USERRA suggested the definition of employer could mean the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention also was Gonzales’ employer because grant funding for the job in Finney County originated with the federal agency and was passed through the state to the county.
However, the Court of Appeals discounted that theory and outlined evidence Gonzales’ evaluations were limited to a “joint venture involving both Finney County and KDHE.”
“The district court’s summary judgment ruling was driven by its erroneous view of the grant relationship between KDHE and Finney County,” the appellate court said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Denver-court-of-appeals-2.png,,,2026-01-05 12:57:05.578583

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa by Nima Gharavi, a YouTuber and self-described “registered wrestling official” with the National Collegiate Athletic Association, Illinois High School Athletic Association, Illinois Elementary School Association and other entities.
The lawsuit names as a defendant Allyson Schwab of the Cedar Falls area, a photographer who allegedly has a substantial social media following for the youth wrestling content she produces.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In his lawsuit, Gharavi alleges that for many years, he has created videos of youth wrestling matches, initially for the exclusive use of wrestling officials. Gharavi says he subsequently created a public YouTube channel to share his passion for the sport and called it Midwest Wrestle. That channel now has more than 175,000 followers on YouTube, Gharavi claims.
At some point, the lawsuit alleges, Gharavi realized that some websites with which he has no connection had copied, without his knowledge or permission, video content from Midwest Wrestle and posted it to third-party websites that contained pornography or other objectionable content.
As a result, Gharavi submitted hundreds of formal “take-down requests” to various websites, asking them to remove his content from their sites, and also served 11 subpoenas to various website hosts and platforms, seeking information on those who had pirated his videos.
In December 2023 and January 2024, the lawsuit alleges, Schwab published multiple posts to her X (formerly Twitter) account, encouraging parents to watch out for “suggestive” online videos of youth wrestling matches that were generating hundreds of thousands of views.
“This makes me sick and why I got this convo going,” Schwab allegedly wrote in one post. “So many parents don’t know their kids are on someone’s YouTube… No reason a 46kg youth girls match should have 2.6 million views … The kids think it’s normal to have 400k views on their video from a local youth or hs tournament…”
The lawsuit states that while Schwab’s posts did not explicitly name Gharavi or Midwest Wrestle, details in her posts corresponded to Midwest Wrestle’s viewership. For example, the lawsuit claims, Midwest Wrestle was the only YouTube channel to have garnered 2.6 million views of a 46kg youth girls wrestling match.
At about the same Schwab posted her comments, Gharavi was “ejected” from the Midlands Championships wrestling tournament by Northwestern University Head Wrestling Coach Matt Storniolo, the lawsuit alleges, asserting that Schwab had essentially accused Gharavi of conduct that “warranted denial of credentials by schools and tournament directors.”
After Gharavi was ejected from the Midlands Championships, Schwab “reached out to Coach Storniolo, unprompted, to praise him for ejecting Mr. Gharavi,” and called him her “hero,” the lawsuit asserts.
The lawsuit goes on to allege that in the ensuing months, several athletic organizations canceled or declined to renew their contracts with Gharavi, a third party published Gharavi’s home address on social media alongside the false allegations, and Gharavi was the target of threats and an attempted home break-in.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for defamation, invasion of privacy by painting Gharavi in a false light, intentional infliction of emotional distress and tortious interference with business relationships.
Schwab has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Schwab for comment.

On Monday, the Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection announced in a news release that it entered into a consent agreement with Bitcoin Depot, which operates Bitcoin kiosks, to recover $1.9 million that third-party scammers defrauded from Mainers through those kiosks.
Additionally, Bitcoin Depot will fully comply with Maine consumer protection laws to operate as a money transmitter in the state as part of the agreement. 
This agreement comes after Gov. Janet Mills signed emergency legislation last June that limits daily transmission amounts and caps fees and exchange rates at virtual currency kiosks. The legislation also provides redress for consumers.
In addition, Mills has signed other legislation to protect Maine consumers from third-party scammers, including the Maine Money Transmission Modernization Act in 2024. 
Linda Conti, superintendent of the credit protection bureau, credited Maine’s new consumer protection laws for allowing the state to reach the agreement with Bitcoin Depot and recoup those losses. She specifically mentioned the “unhosted wallet provision under Maine law, which requires money transmitters to employ new technologies to ensure that Maine consumers own and control their virtual wallets.”

The U.S. House Appropriations committee, responsible for regulating government expenditures, proposed in September to eliminate the National Institute of Nursing Research and all Nursing Workforce Development programs, except the Nurse Corps. The programs represent the only dedicated federal funding for nursing education.
The cuts align with the Trump administration’s request to eliminate Title VIII programs but have yet to be approved by Congress. The official federal budget is currently set to be passed by Jan. 30.
 Potential for impact to patient care

According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, the National Institute of Nursing Research received $197.693 million in federal funding, with $1,607,363 dedicated to research in Missouri during fiscal year 2024. It is the only institute that exists solely to support nursing research, typically done by nurse educators and practitioners.
“We view it as an integral component to the ecosystem of nursing education and research,” said Josh Adams, director of policy and regulatory affairs at the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
That impact extends beyond academia.
Lori Popejoy, dean at the University of Missouri’s Sinclair School of Nursing, said research plays a direct role in improving patient care.
“Everybody in the sphere of healthcare, research and education, is concerned with delivering the best quality care they can, and part of the research enterprise is discovering new, efficient, effective ways of doing that,” Popejoy said.
Adams expressed similar concerns about what’s at risk for health care professionals.
“I think the impact would be losing those insights and a forward momentum that is part of the enterprise of science in general, but in health care, we are always working to try to deliver better, higher quality health care to as many people as possible. I think losing the research that informs how we do that would be incredibly detrimental,” Adams said.
 Nursing Workforce Development programs

The Nursing Workforce Development programs live under Title VIII in the Public Service Act, reauthorized in 2020. The programs provide federal grants to support nursing education, expand the nursing workforce and strengthen access to care in underserved communities.
Its elimination would result in a nearly $50 million decrease nationally from the current funds of $305.472 million for these programs, resulting in funding levels that have not been seen since FY 2020. Missouri received $4,795,783 in Title VIII funding in FY 2023.
One of the programs that has already been canceled is the Nurse Faculty Loan Program, a key component of the Nursing Workforce Development portfolio.
The program provided low-interest loans to graduate nursing students who planned to become faculty members. Those who went on to teach full time for up to four years could have as much as 85% of their loan balance, including interest, forgiven.
“For myself, I used the Nurse Faculty Loan Program, and some of my student loan funding was cut due to change in the Presidential Office,” said Karina Floyd, director of nursing at Stephens College. “I don’t know if I would’ve pursued an MSN and Ph.D. in nursing if I knew the government would move the student loan contracts and delete the programs.”
Both Floyd and Popejoy, leaders of nursing schools in Columbia, expressed concern about the consequences of this cancellation, saying that it not only hurts current nursing faculty students, but could also deter prospective graduate nursing students from continuing their education.
“When I finished my Ph.D., I had a John A. Hartford Foundation pre-doctoral scholarship, and it covered all my education and a stipend,” Popejoy said. “I walked away from my graduate education without any debt because of that scholarship. That’s the best-case scenario for students. And there’s fewer and fewer of those opportunities privately available.”
Floyd said that nursing programs are already reporting that students are pausing or giving up plans for advanced nursing degrees due to the debt cap.
“If this continues, it will directly weaken the education-to-workforce pipeline at every level, not just graduate programs,” she said.
“You’re strangling it at the beginning, and that pipeline just narrows all the way through,” Popejoy added.
Both education advocates and administrators recognize how vital this funding is to help improve access to health care across the state and the country.
“Title VIII funding was created to strengthen the national nursing workforce, particularly in moments of high demand,” Floyd said.
She said reducing support now could worsen existing shortages.
“Hospitals depend on nurses who pursue graduate preparation to become faculty, managers, clinical educators and advanced practice clinicians. When graduate education becomes financially out of reach, the pipeline of future nurse educators shrinks, and that directly limits how many new nurses can be trained,” Floyd said.
“It ultimately affects Missouri patients and the safety and stability of our health care system. As schools of nursing work toward expansion to meet workforce needs, these reductions risk slowing or preventing that growth precisely when the state needs more nurses, not fewer,” she added.
While Congress returned to work this week, they still have time to potentially reinstate funding for the National Institute of Nursing Research and Title VIII programs and deny the president and the House Appropriations Committee’s requests to eliminate this funding.
Both Popejoy and Adams are encouraged by the level of support from the public and nursing advocates like the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
“I think that there’s enough push from the agencies nationally on Congress, and we’re seeing a huge amount of blowback and frustration from the public,” Popejoy said.
“We saw reasonably positive funding support coming out of both the House and the Senate,” Adams added. “There was some separation in what they were comfortable allocating, but there’s support for these programs.”

Photo by Heerea Rikhraj/New Mexico In Depth)Dr. Alana Williams watched her medical malpractice insurance premiums nearly double between 2018 and 2023—from $44,908 to $77,394.
The Albuquerque OB-GYN faced a choice: keep performing gynecological surgery and watch her costs climb, or scale back her practice to survive.
She chose survival. When Williams stopped offering surgery in 2024, her premiums dropped to $16,463.

This story was originally published by New Mexico In Depth.

“I had to drop it to sustain my independent practice,” Williams said.
Her former partner made a different choice. After paying $72,346 in insurance premiums in 2024, she left the practice to join Lovelace hospital, where the hospital covers physician insurance costs.
OB-GYNs care for women during pregnancy and childbirth and treat the full range of pelvic and gynecologic health issues across a woman’s life. The work often involves high-stakes care for two lives at once, making the specialty particularly vulnerable to lawsuits. They’ve long carried some of the highest malpractice insurance costs of any medical specialty nationwide. But what was already expensive in New Mexico has become dramatically worse.
In recent years, premiums have surged. Since January of 2022, rates across specialties have increased by about 40%, according to a presentation to state lawmakers in November by the state’s Superintendent of Insurance. New Mexico OB-GYNs pay nearly double what their counterparts in surrounding states pay for malpractice insurance. Their premiums are $107,961, on average, compared to $59,133 in Arizona, $48,966 in Colorado, and $60,707 in Texas.

Superintendent of Insurance Alice Kane pointed to complicated 2021 reforms to the Medical Malpractice Act as one culprit for the sharp increase.
Among the  reforms, damage caps for individual providers were raised from $600,000 to $750,000. Perhaps most dramatically, lawmakers raised, over five years, the maximum malpractice damages a hospital can owe for pain, suffering and other non-medical losses from $600,000 to $6 million in 2026.
And while independent providers remain covered by the state fund that helps pay large verdicts and medical costs, lawmakers phased hospitals out of the fund starting in 2027. The state fund had begun to run a deficit that studies for the Legislature ascribed to large malpractice awards against hospitals. So now, hospitals, or their insurers, will be on the hook for all of the damages awarded to patients who sue them.
These changes significantly increase the financial risk for hospitals that employ many OB-GYNs.
What remained unchanged was another source of potential costs: past or future medical care needed by the plaintiff because of the negligence of the doctor in the event the physician loses in court.
Also unchanged was the lack of caps on punitive damages, which insurers usually don’t cover in their policies. These are the awards that juries give to punish bad behavior—reckless, willful or even malicious conduct that leads to harm—rather than to compensate the victim.
Providers, both independent and hospitals, are on the hook for punitive damages. They need to pay out unless they find an insurance company willing to cover them.
The Doctors Company, which insures the majority of independent physicians in New Mexico, raised its rates by 20% in 2022, the year following passage of the reforms.
Independent OB-GYN doctors like Dr. Steve Gough are struggling. He said he paid $92,000 in 2024 and expects his rate to increase by at least 15% in 2025. “Despite the insurance rates going up, my salary hasn’t doubled to accommodate,” he said. Gough said he knew of several OB-GYNs who’ve left the state because of increasing insurance rates.
The stakes are high when it comes to maternal care.
Data show that New Mexico was losing OB-GYNs before the insurance spike in recent years. Between 2017 and 2021—before the Medical Malpractice Act reforms passed—the state lost 22% (or 63) of its OB-GYNs, according to the 2023 New Mexico Healthcare Workforce Committee Report.
As of 2024, at least 33% of New Mexico’s counties have no access to OB-GYNs or prenatal care, according to the March of Dimes—making them “maternity care deserts.” Nearly 18% of women in New Mexico lack access to birthing hospitals within 30 minutes of where they live, compared to the national average of 9.7%, according to the March of Dimes report.
Rural hospital administrators and state officials cite multiple factors for the lack of maternal care access, especially in rural areas: dwindling rural populations that mean fewer births, low Medicaid reimbursement rates that don’t cover costs, the expense of maintaining specialized staff around the clock regardless of patient volume, and changes in federal funding that reduced payments to rural hospitals starting in 2020.
“We’ve had several hospitals close their obstetrics wings, as a result of needing to make some changes for their own operating costs,” Lorelei Kellogg, acting Medicaid Director at the New Mexico Human Services Department, told New Mexico In Depth in 2024.
Malpractice insurance costs can compound these challenges, particularly for rural facilities already operating on thin margins. “The premiums are just too expensive to maintain,” said James Kiser, CEO of Holy Cross Medical Center in Taos.
The state has taken some steps since 2021 to more precisely target reforms. In 2023, lawmakers  lowered damage caps for most independent outpatient facilities so they wouldn’t face the same liability as hospitals. And during the 2024 legislative session, lawmakers appropriated $15.4 million in one-time subsidies to help offset medical malpractice insurance costs for individual providers and independent group practices, according to the Office of Superintendent of Insurance.
But finding lasting solutions has proven contentious.
Nick Autio, general counsel at the New Mexico Medical Society, said the complexity of the insurance industry makes solutions elusive. “We don’t have enough data to know. If we had a well-funded task force from the Senate, with actuaries involved and people with actual expertise, we can start getting to a solution.”
“All the actors involved in this space need to sit together and come up with solutions,” he said.
For Williams and Gough, the stakes are clear.
“What’s left is that there are less and less independent providers in the state that will be able to provide these services,” Williams said.
Gough sees the impact daily in his exam rooms, as pregnant women describe the lengths they go to for basic care.
“There are lots of negative things that we’re going to see as fewer and fewer hospitals in our state elect to do obstetrics,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AlanaWilliams-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 11:56:57.228080

But the state’s Democratic representatives in Congress said Trump bypassed legislative branch approval to launch a military strike that has the potential to destabilize Venezuela – even if they agreed that Maduro was a dictator.
The Venezuelan president’s 2024 reelection was determined by many countries, including the U.S., to be illegitimate, while he has been characterized by the administration as the leader of a drug cartel. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who was also captured in Saturday’s raid, were brought to New York to face a U.S. indictment on narco-terrorism and conspiracy charges originally levied in 2020. 
Trump said in a news conference Saturday that the intention was not to necessarily free the Venezuelan people from Maduro’s rule, but rather to secure the nation’s vast oil resources. He added that American petroleum companies would ultimately finance the rebuilding of Venezuela’s oil infrastructure.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also signaled that nations like Cuba could face similar treatment.
Trump says US ‘will run’ Venezuela during transition after capture of President Maduro

In Michigan, key congressional Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate denounced the move.
U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield) said in a statement that the U.S. should not drag itself into another “forever war that puts American servicemembers in harm’s way and has no end in sight.”
“The president said the United States will now run the nation of Venezuela,” Peters wrote. “The American people did not ask for this. There’s no question that Maduro was a bad actor in the region, but that does not grant the administration unilateral authority to wage war without Congressional authorization. I’m also deeply concerned this action could embolden our adversaries like Russia and China to attempt to remove the legitimate leaders of U.S. allies around the world.”
Peters demanded that the Trump administration “immediately provide Congress and the American people with the legal justification for this mission and how they plan to ensure it does not lead to the destabilization of Venezuela and the entire region.”
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly), who has become one of Michigan’s foremost critics of Trump’s domestic and foreign policies, said Trump’s break-neck military action against Venezuela “continues the signature trend of his presidency: relentless focus on foreign entanglements and looking tough abroad, so as to distract from what’s happening to Americans’ pocketbooks. “
“So instead of action on health care costs or housing or energy bills, Americans get military action in Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, the Caribbean, the Pacific, and now a long-term engagement in Venezuela,” Slotkin said. “Despite all the talking points to the media — and by Cabinet members directly to senators last month — this was never about stopping the drug cartels. If it were, President Trump wouldn’t have pardoned drug kingpin Juan Orlando Hernández, and he’d be going after Mexican cartels that move the fentanyl that’s killed hundreds of thousands of Americans — not fishing boats full of cocaine or, ultimately, the Venezuelan oil fields.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Slotkin added that Trump’s only aim was for regime change and an oil grab.
“Maduro is a bad man, and the people of Venezuela deserve better,” Slotkin said. “But we know that regime change isn’t as simple as removing one leader. While there are comparisons to the arrest of Manuel Noriega in Panama in 1989, let’s not forget that the U.S. sent in over 27,000 troops and lost 23 servicemembers in the process. … The bottom line is that President Trump wants to look tough by attacking countries abroad to distract from his failure to attack the core issue of the cost of living at home.”
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Brimingham) decried Trump action without congressional approval.
“I’m grateful our service members made it home, but they never should have been sent on this mission in the first place. Michiganders don’t want more wars,” Stevens said. “I voted to put a stop to Trump’s military buildup in Venezuela, and I will work with my colleagues in Congress in the coming days to demand answers and accountability.”
That said, Stevens said the people and the Venezuelan people are safer with “Maduro’s violent regime out of power.” Still, she said Trump was essentially forcing Michiganders to cover the “billions of dollars it will take to rebuild and run Venezuela. Taking over another country while Americans can’t afford their rent and groceries is unacceptable.”
U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) said the opposition to military action against Venezuela and the kidnapping of Maduro wasn’t just about legal technicalities.
“It’s about the American people having a voice in decisions that could put our service members at risk and commit our tax dollars to conflict,” Scholten said in a statement.
U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Shri Thanedar, both representing Detroit, said the action was unconstitutional and violated international law.
“These are the actions of a rogue state,” Tlaib said in a statement on social media.

Trump’s illegal and unprovoked bombing of Venezuela and kidnapping of its president are grave violations of international law and the U.S. Constitution. These are the actions of a rogue state.
The American people do not want another regime change war abroad.

The state’s Republican members of Congress were far more congratulatory of Trump and what they called decisive executive action to rid the world of a dictator and an alleged drug trafficker – however, the narrative has moved away from allegations of Venezuela moving fentanyl into the U.S. to cocaine.
“(Maduro) was a transnational criminal and illegitimate dictator who directly enabled violent cartels to flood our country with illicit drugs, profit off the deaths of countless Americans, including friends of mine, and eliminate his political opponents,” said U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) in a statement. “I pray for the people of Venezuela, who have long suffered under the brutal rule of the Maduro regime. It is my hope to see them rise up and lead their country in a new direction of self-determination, peace and prosperity.”
Barrett, however, did ask that the president now work with Congress to obtain proper authorization for the continued use of military intervention in Venezuela, “a constitutional power specifically reserved for Congress,” Barrett added.
“I’ve also lost too many friends to open-ended nation building conflicts, and I spend each day in Congress reflecting on the total human cost of armed military intervention,” Barrett wrote. “Venezuela is not Afghanistan, but we still must demand clear and precise end goal objectives with a firm discipline against mission creep.”
U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) thanked the military for carrying out the operation with “skill and courage,” but also called on social media for the U.S. to recognize Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, “the rightful winner of the past election, as President and work with him in this time of transition until the Venezuelan people can hold a free and fair election.”
Trump, however, has indicated the U.S. will work instead with Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, who has since been installed as Venezuela’s interim leader.
U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), also brought up the specter of the forever war in the context of Venezuela, but unlike Barrett, James praised Trump for doing in “four hours” what other presidents took multiple terms to achieve in Afghanistan and Iraq – a bit of a misnomer considering the Iraq and Afghan wars ended in large U.S. death tolls, disastrous pullouts and the situation in Venezuela is far from resolved.
“I voted for this!” James wrote jubilation on social media.

Me and my buddies fought in a 20-year war because Bush and Obama couldn’t get done in four terms what Trump just got done in four hours.

Various military experts and pundits have weighed in on the strike, a decision that was carried out on the order of Trump and not gut-checked by members of Congress, who wield the sole lever to issue war powers to the president.
Trump’s administration has said that his cabinet had precedent to take action against Maduro, citing the 1990 decision from then President George H.W. Bush to detain former Panamanian President Manuel Noriega, which was aimed at securing the Panama Canal for Western interests.
NPR reported that the similarities stop there, given that U.S. troops left swiftly and handed over power to a popular opposition faction that was ready to take control of Panama. 
Trump has insinuated that the U.S. and its oil partners would “run” Venezuela until it was “safe” to engage in a “proper and judicious transition.”

Darby, Pennsylvania
Died Dec. 25, 2025
Colchester, Vermont
Details of services
A memorial service is planned for spring.

Suzanne Chant, 74, of South Burlington, died on Dec. 25, 2025, alongside family and friends, after a long illness.
Suzanne is survived by her children Gerry Canavan and wife Jaimee Hills, Patrick Canavan, and Ariel Chant and partner Will Willoughby. She was “Susu” to grandchildren Hannah, Zoey, Dalton, and Connor, and step-granddaughters Jalyn and Peyton.
Suzanne leaves her sister Kathy and husband Richard Yawarski; sister-in-law Gail St. Pierre; brother-in-law Marty Rawson; nieces Heather, Eileen, Elizabeth, Katie, and Colleen; and her nephews Michael, Chris, Chris, and Robert. She also leaves an in-law family to whom she became as close as siblings: Catherine Chant and Stephen Belitsos, Barbara and Paul Colton, Elizabeth Chant and Jill Burley, Paul and Anne Chant, Daniel and Jodie Chant, and Kirsten Chant; nieces Sarah, Margaret, Emily, Libby, Jacqueline, and Jessica; and nephews Brady, Thomas, Luke, Drew, and Ethan.
She was preceded in death by her husband Stephen Chant, brother Joe St. Pierre, sister Connie Rawson, brother-in-law Timothy Chant, and nephews Andrew and Ronny.
She was born Sept. 29, 1951, the second eldest of four to Joseph and Katherine (McCloskey) St. Pierre. She was born in Darby, Pennsylvania, grew up in Colonia, New Jersey, and studied English and French, graduating from Newark State College (now Kean University).
Suzanne met Steve, the love of her life, in the early 1990s, on the online network Prodigy, where both were early personal computer users. Suzanne and Patrick relocated from New Jersey to Vermont to share life’s adventures with Steve and Ariel. Gerry joined in on vacations and many special times.
Besides being a loving wife, proud mother, caring sister and affectionate grandmother, Suzanne was a poet, an artist, a quilter, an avid reader, and a lover of music. She loved traveling near and far with her partner in creativity, Steve. They loved driving around New England, holding hands, trying their luck at diners, auctions, craft fairs and bookstores.
For many years, they would take an annual summer break from work and family and go to Moosehead Lake in Maine, each with a pile of books for entertainment. In retirement, they discovered the joys of cruising and island-hopping in the Caribbean, even taking back-to-back cruises one year that gave them a full month at sea. In other years, they got their break from Vermont winters in St. Nevis and Bonnaire.
Suzanne and Steve were crazy in love from the day they met. They delighted in their passions for words, art, music, their children and each other. She was loved by many others for her intelligence, her generosity, her strength and her sometimes-gentle and sometimes-fiery spirit. She will be missed by everyone who knew her.

(File photo courtesy of Coastal Carolina)COLUMBIA — An unmanned underwater research vehicle, an event center to train hospitality students and an institute centered around federal defense research are among items on South Carolina colleges’ budget wish list for the coming year.
In all, public universities and technical colleges are seeking $2.3 billion in additional state aid for the fiscal year starting in July, according to a review of budget requests.
Legislators won’t approve colleges’ full requests, but the plans are a preview of higher education priorities across the state.
Coastal Carolina students to build satellite in state’s 1st college space program

For Coastal Carolina University, those priorities include a buildout of South Carolina’s first university-run space program.
Since March 2023, Coastal Carolina professors and about 80 science and engineering students have worked to plan and build a satellite. Now it’s time to launch the shoebox-sized satellite into orbit, where it will circle the planet 15 times a day from roughly 1,200 miles up.
The Conway-based college is asking legislators to set aside $450,000. But the school also wants to take things a step further, with a $900,000 underwater research vehicle.
The unmanned vehicle and satellite will work in tandem collecting images and data from above and below the Atlantic Ocean and South Carolina’s blackwater estuaries.
“Coastal systems are vital to the state’s economy and culture, supporting fisheries, ecotourism, and economic development,” the college’s request reads. “The data collected will enhance our ability to assess ecosystem resilience and provide early warnings for environmental stressors.”
Coastal Carolina scientists and students will track environmental changes driven by storms, flooding, drought, and other natural events. They’ll also monitor impacts to habitats and movements of key marine species, such as shrimp, crabs, oysters, red knots, red drum, sharks, turtles, dolphins, and whales, according to the college’s request.
Tech schools build
While Coastal Carolina’s request appears out of the ordinary, it’s far from the most expensive.
The technical college system is collectively seeking $743 million for projects across its 16 college campuses, accounting for a third of the total newly requested. Most of it would pay for construction projects.
High-dollar projects include $80 million to move the medical campus of Florence-Darlington Technical College out of downtown Florence, giving the college room to grow its training programs in high-demand health care fields.
Midlands Technical College and Spartanburg Community College are asking for $60 million and $65 million respectively to demolish and rebuild a student center and an administrative building, according to documents provided by the state Department of Administration.
And Denmark Technical College, the state’s only historically Black tech school, is renewing a $35 million request for new lab and classroom space. The college, located 35 miles east of the Savannah River National Laboratory, wants to train more of the cybersecurity and energy professionals needed by the federal nuclear research lab in an effort to attract more students and grow the school’s enrollment.
A focus on health care
MUSC Health seeks $350M for new, top-tier cancer center

Budget asks from the Medical University of South Carolina and the University of South Carolina round out the top three largest requests.
Most of MUSC’s $418 million request is for construction of a top-tier cancer center in downtown Charleston, the first of its kind in South Carolina.
And about half of USC’s $307 million ask would go to further the flagship university’s own health care ambitions.
That includes one-time money to move the pharmacy school to the university’s new medical campus that’s under construction in downtown Columbia’s redeveloped BullStreet District.
The school also wants annually recurring dollars to operate the new, taxpayer-funded neurological hospital and a series of clinics across the state that specialize in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.
More sought by SC research universities
USC to establish center for civics education, following national trend

Beyond money for the medical campus, USC is asking for annual operating dollars to run a newly-formed center focused on teaching civil debate and civics lessons. It wants more money to continue a four-way, multi-year research partnership between USC, Clemson University, South Carolina State University and the Savannah River National Laboratory. And it’s asking for funds to continue and expand its efforts around artificial intelligence.
Across the USC system, other major requests include a new nursing education center in Beaufort, complete with simulation labs, and the renovation of an event center in Spartanburg to train hospitality students in the Upstate.
As for Clemson, its request tallies $193 million in additional aid.
That includes $20 million for its National Security Institute, with the goal of growing the $30 million in annual research it does with the U.S. Department of Defense.
In its request, Clemson highlighted its military roots. The school, originally known as Clemson Agricultural College, opened in July 1893 as an all-male, all-white military college. It wasn’t until 1955 that the school began admitting non-military students and women.
Clemson also is renewing requests for projects the Legislature either didn’t fund or partially funded. That includes $60 million for next-generation computing center, $35 million for a new science laboratory and $20 million to expand a genetics research lab.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Campus_Beauty-26-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-05 11:13:18.692856

Undefeated Indiana, which slobber-knocked Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl ranks as the solid favorite at +130 entering the semifinal games. That means that if you wager $100 on Indiana to win it all, you would win $130 if the Hoosiers actually do it.
Rick Cleveland
If you watched Indiana’s dismantling of Alabama, you probably get it. Hard as it was to fathom Indiana (historically the worst team in Division I football) hammering proud Bama, seeing was believing. Indiana treated Alabama like Alabama treats Louisiana-Monroe.
Vegas oddsmakers like Miami next best. The money line on the Ole Miss’s semifinal foe is +315. Wager $100 and win $315 if the Hurricanes prevail. Miami, the only two-loss team remaining, probably ranks as the second betting choice because of the way the Hurricanes handled Ohio State (24-14) in the semifinals.
Next on the oddsmakers’ list is Oregon at +320. And then bringing up the rear and decidedly so at +550 is Ole Miss, despite its impressive 39-34 victory over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. You can bet $100 on Ole Miss today and earn $550 if they beat Miami and then the Indiana-Oregon winner in the national championship game.
Why are the Rebels so decidedly the underdog? Well, for one thing, they started the season that way. 
Texas, Georgia and Ohio State were the preseason favorites. Penn State, Alabama, LSU, Clemson and Notre Dame all ranked far ahead of the Rebels. 
And then there’s the coaching chaos that happened just before the playoffs began. Pete Golding is two games into his head coaching career and has a staff that is largely spending preparation time at two different schools.
I have no other explanation for why the odds are so stacked against the Rebels. Ole Miss statistically dominated Georgia much more than the final score indicates. Take away Georgia’s second quarter scoop-and-score touchdown – the game’s only turnover – and Ole Miss wins much more comfortably.
Ole Miss isn’t playing like a team with coaching issues. If anything, Lane Kiffin’s abandoning a team beginning a playoff run has seemed to invigorate the Rebels, drawn them even closer together and made them even more determined.

Wide receiver Harrison Wallace III talked about that in a press conference Sunday afternoon. He said the coaching changes have had little impact “because everybody has bought in to go win a national championship.”
“It was crazy for everybody,” Wallace said. “But at the same time, the players and coaches did a great job of keeping everybody together. … I just feel like we did a good job of communicating with each other.”
The biggest noticeable change – other than a coach who  deflects attention to his players rather than attracting it to himself – is that the new coach is now on the field instead of the press box. Golding, when he was the defensive coordinator, coached from above. As a head coach, he is on the sideline. That turns out to be a plus, says standout defensive tackle Will Echoles, such a force in the Sugar Bowl. 
“I think having PG (Golding) on the field now is better,” Echoles said Sunday. “It’s different when they are sending stuff down through the headphones. It’s better when he can get us together on the field like he did in the second quarter against Georgia. He brought the whole defense together and told us what we needed to do better to get some stops.”

Whatever Golding said worked. There also seems to have been no problem at all with Charlie Weiss Jr. in total command of the Ole Miss offense and without Kiffin looking over his shoulder. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and his teammates have not missed a beat. If anything, they’ve been sharper in the two playoff games.
For his part, Golding says commentators make far too much of the coaching flux and how it affects the Rebels. He loves this team and seems to love its chances.
“I just think these guys show up every day and are excited to go to work and prepare and get better,” Golding said. “… and I think that’s pretty unique. And I think the other thing for them is they don’t flinch. There’s a grit and a toughness about this group … there’s no panic.”
The oddsmakers were wrong about Ole Miss before the season started. They were wrong about them before the Sugar Bowl. They absolutely could be wrong now. As Golding loves to say and says often, “Let’s spot the ball.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — A pair of Democrats from Lawrence with personal grievances about the Trump administration are challenging incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann for his 1st District seat.
Lauren Reinhold, a longtime federal employee at the Social Security Administration, was swept up in Elon Musk’s DOGE purge of federal employees. Colin McRoberts, a professor at the University of Kansas business school, was inspired to run for office after attending Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall’s contentious March 1 town hall in Oakley.
Both Reinhold and McRoberts believe they can overcome the long odds Democrats have faced in the district by taking aim at Mann’s willingness to support an unpopular Republican agenda.
“We were promised: ‘Things are going to be better for you.’ And I’m just one person, but they certainly were not better for me,” Reinhold said.
“I was lied to. I was told my prices would be lower,” she added. “I was told that things would be better for my kids. I was told they would fix health care. And it’s been a year, and none of that’s happened.”
McRoberts said his experience in business negotiations has showed him that representatives like Mann are unable to negotiate on behalf of their district because they are just “going to do what the party wants them to do.”
He said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act marked a tectonic shift by severing the ties between aid for farmers and food assistance for low-income people. Those programs traditionally have been bundled together as a compromise between urban and rural states.
“That’s really going to change the political balance of those subsidy payments going forward, which makes it a lot less stable,” McRoberts said. “And it’s the kind of short-term thinking that’s going to be really dangerous, because we don’t have negotiators in Congress.”
Thanks to state-level GOP gerrymandering in 2022, the liberal town of Lawrence in northeast Kansas is now included in the vast 1st District that covers much of the western two-thirds of the state, all the way to the Colorado border. Only one Democrat — Howard Miller, in 1952 — has won the seat in the 150 years since the district formed. Mann has won three terms, with about 70% of the vote each time.
 
Ready to fight back
Reinhold lived in Topeka until she was 6, then moved to St. Louis. She returned to Kansas in 1993 to attend law school at KU, and stayed to raise a family there.
“I want the world to know that I’m prepared to fight for Kansans, for everyday Americans,” Reinhold said. “I think we’ve been overlooked. We’re not getting what we need. The regular person is increasingly suffering economically. We’re all at risk of our health getting worse.”
She defined a “regular person” as “anyone who’s not fabulously wealthy,” or doesn’t have to worry about their current and future economic security.
Her life was upended after President Donald Trump took office and handed a billionaire tech mogul the power to fire government workers under the pretense of efficiency.
Reinhold said she received the email that was sent to federal employees in late January, urging them to quit their jobs in exchange for pay through September. At first, she resisted.
“And I thought, you know what, if they fire me, I could run for office,” she said. “I could run for Congress and try to fight this mess they’ve made of the federal government. Fight back and restore what the American people need.”
After weeks of turmoil, firings and reassignments, she agreed to take the buyout when a new offer was made in April. She is taking time off to focus solely on running for Congress.
“It’s not about me. It’s not about, oh, poor Lauren lost her job to DOGE,” Reinhold said. “That’s going to be part of the campaign, but I really care that the American people get the government they deserve, that we get the governmental services we need and deserve to make our lives better, and I feel so passionate about that.”

Embracing neighbors
McRoberts said he drove four and a half hours from Lawrence to Oakley because he wanted to hear what Marshall would say about Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and vaccines.
And, McRoberts said, it was pretty clear that Marshall didn’t want people to show up.
McRoberts ended up taking one of the videos that went viral from Marshall’s town hall. People booed Marshall when he dismissed their concerns about Trump administration policies, and the senator left abruptly.
“He didn’t have to care because he thinks he’s running in a safe election,” McRoberts said. “That affected me, the idea that he was so complacent that he’s just going to turn around and walk away, because it’s not fun to talk about the things he’s been doing wrong in Congress.”
McRoberts started thinking a run for Congress during the drive back to Lawrence. He figure he, or even his students at KU, could have handled questions better than Marshall. He wanted to challenge Marshall directly but realized a U.S. Senate campaign would require him to raise millions of dollars.
“I’m just not a wealthy man,” McRoberts said. “I cannot afford to leave my day job. I teach for a living because I have to pay the mortgage, and I love to teach.”
Marshall had complained that people from Lawrence were trying to disrupt his appearance in Oakley, even though both towns are in the same congressional district. The implicit message from Marshall, as McRoberts saw it, was that people from outside of western Kansas are not your friends.
Actually, McRoberts said, people across the district have a shared economic interest rooted in agriculture.
“I think that’s been going on for a long time, an intentional strategy to use the east against the west, and maybe to a lesser extent, the west against the east, to drive these wedges for the benefit of party politics,” McRoberts said. “And I will not and cannot play that game. We’re all neighbors. The 1st District is much more alike than it is different.”
 
A non-zero chance
Reinhold said her work experience gives her a deep understanding of how the federal government works, and that she is better suited than Mann to represent the district.
“I will listen to Kansans,” she said. “First of all, I will get out there and talk to Kansans and listen to them, and listen to what they need, and vote in Congress in accordance with that, and initiate bills, which he’s done very little of, to make our lives better.”
McRoberts said he believes Democrats have an opportunity to break through the Republican stronghold in the 1st District.
“Especially since we’ve seen the impact of tariffs, since we’ve seen the crisis of incompetence and corruption in the federal government, since we’ve seen Tracey Mann really fail to rise to the occasion,” he said.
“The odds are still very long, but it’s a long way from zero, and those odds are getting better every day,” he added.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC261055-1024x629.jpg,,,2026-01-05 11:13:18.692856

Buffalo, N.Y.
Died Oct. 17, 2025
Stamford, N.Y.

Anne Pratt Slatin passed away on Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, at The Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, N.Y., at the age of 80 from pneumonia.
She was born on Oct. 31, 1944, in Buﬀalo, New York, to Mary McNeil and Wilson Holly Pratt. Her early summers were spent at Camp Otsego in Cooperstown, where she began as a camper and later taught sailing — friendships from those years stayed with her for life.
In 1979, Anne married Dr. Harvey L. Slatin in their apartment in New York City, and later that year their daughter, Emily, was born. In 1986, the family moved to Stamford, N.Y., where Emily grew up and where Anne would spend the rest of her life.
Anne gave much of herself to Stamford. She served for many years as a village trustee and later became the first woman to be elected mayor, serving a two-year term. She was also a longtime member of the Stamford Village Library Board, committed to supporting the institutions that made the town stronger.
In her professional life, Anne worked as a self-employed genealogist, helping families trace their histories and reconnect with their roots.
In her later years, Anne volunteered with the Middletown Springs Historical Society in Middletown Springs, Vermont, near the retired dairy farm owned by her daughter, Emily, and Emily’s wife, Amelia. She loved both places and gave her time freely to the communities that mattered most to her.
She loved animals, especially cats, and delighted in the company of Penfold, her daughter’s dog, who always made her smile. That aﬀection also shaped her support for Heart of the Catskills, a cause close to her heart.
She is survived by her daughter, Emily Pratt Slatin, and Emily’s wife, Amelia Phoenix Desertsong; her sister, Mary Ellen Pratt-Phillips; and Loralei Jurztrenka, who first cared for Anne as a nurse and, in time, became a cherished part of the family’s life. She was predeceased by her husband, Harvey; her sister, Holly E. Keller; and her lifelong friends Frank and Carol Bell, and Ellen Wayman, of Stamford, and Richard “Dick” Woodhouse of Cooperstown.
Anne preferred simplicity over ceremony. At her request, there will be no calling hours or funeral.
The family extends their heartfelt gratitude to the doctors, nurses and staﬀ at The Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown for their extraordinary care and compassion during Anne’s final days.
Her final wishes were to be cremated and buried without ceremony at Lakewood Cemetery in Cooperstown, New York. Contributions in her memory may be made to the Stamford Village Library, the Stamford Fire Department, or Heart of the Catskills.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bruce Cole.","Born April 19, 1933
Medford, Massachusetts
Died Dec. 24, 2025
Marlboro, Vermont
Details of services
He has been laid to rest in King Cemetery in Marlboro. A celebration of life for Bruce will be held mid-April 2026. Letters of condolence can be sent to the family at P.O. Box 133, Marlboro, Vermont 05344.

Bruce Cole, 92, of Marlboro, passed away peacefully on Dec. 24, 2025, surrounded by his family. Born on April 19, 1933, in Medford, Massachusetts, Bruce was the son of Barbara Sawyer Cole and the Rev. Alfred Storer Cole of Wilmington, Vermont.
Bruce’s life was defined by hard work, compassion, a sense of humor, and an unwavering commitment to family and community. It was in Boston where he met his lifelong partner and greatest love, Barbara Draper. They were both young dreamers working and aspiring to become veterinarians at Angell Memorial Animal Hospital. Their shared passion for learning and service became the foundation of a love that lasted 70 beautiful years.
Bruce began his education at Tufts University, where his father taught, and later attended the Massachusetts College of Agriculture. He served his country with dedication in the Army Dental Corps in North Carolina during the Korean War. In 1959, he and Barbara graduated from Marlboro College, a place that remained a touchstone throughout his life and career.
In the early 1960s, they bought an old farmhouse in Wilmington, Vermont. With tireless energy and care, transformed the surrounding woods and fields into a working farmstead. A place of animals, shared work and laughter. It became their home for six decades, where they raised their five children and created a lifetime of family memories. For his grandchildren, it was a place of learning, adventure and love, where the roots of family were deeply planted.
Both Bruce and Barbara pursued careers in education with joy and purpose. After earning teaching certifications, Bruce went on to earn two master’s degrees and was later recognized with an Honorary Master’s in Education from Marlboro College. His passion for learning took him beyond the classroom — including a sabbatical in 1975 to study the English Primary System in England, and participation in an archaeological dig in Farfa, Italy, in 1981. These experiences enriched his teaching and inspired the many children whose lives he touched.
Bruce’s tenure at Marlboro Elementary School was truly remarkable. As a teaching principal, he upheld high standards with warmth, creativity and deep respect for every child.  He had a rare ability to see potential in others and lift people up – meeting people where they were, encouraging confidence and helping them believe in themselves. His approach, ahead of its time, nurtured curiosity, resilience, and confidence, creating a safe and supportive environment where children felt valued and capable. Decades of students, families and colleagues continue to hold him in the highest regard, carrying his lessons of encouragement.
Bruce found meaning in shared work and time spent together. He spent countless hours alongside his children and family—mowing lawns, painting houses and caring for the farm. After-school and summer days were filled with cutting and stacking firewood, sugaring, shoveling snow, tending to animals and skiing at Hogback Mountain. In these everyday moments, he taught by example, showing that love often looks like showing up, pitching in and doing things side by side.
For fifteen years, Bruce, Barbara, and their five children welcomed the community to Maple Ridge Farm Camp on the hillside in Wilmington. Here, campers would learn how to care for animals, develop an appreciation for nature and the outdoors, and be enthralled by wild stories Bruce told around the campfire during the weekly campouts. Camp excursions in the yellow school bus to oceans and mountains sparked friendships and fostered a lifelong love of animals and the outdoors. The camp reflected Bruce’s gentle guidance, patience, and belief in learning through experience.
Bruce was a husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, teacher, mentor, neighbor, and friend. He volunteered at the Deerfield Valley Health Center, the Diversion Board, Deerfield Valley Fair, Windham County Conservation District, Marlboro Cares and Marlboro School Association.  Bruce is survived by his beloved wife, Barbara, and his children, Bridget Cole, Dianna Driller (Ron) of Tahoe City, CA, Scott Cole (Jody) of Richmond, VT, Andrew Cole (Jennifer Langdon) of Kilauea, HI and Jennifer Nilsen (Karl) of Wilmington, VT.
He was a proud grandfather to 10 grandchildren: Courtney, Colin, Caitlin, Abigail, Tenaya, Garret, Nicholas, Gunnar, Eve & Mara. And 4 great-grandchildren. Bruce also leaves extended family, friends, and many former students who still call him Mr. Cole.
He will be deeply missed for his quick wit and sarcasm delivered in his Boston accent and the steady, comforting presence he brought into the lives of those around him. He lived with integrity and humility and made time for everyone he encountered, always ready with a story, a helping hand,  or quiet encouragement.
No words can truly capture who Bruce was or the depth of the impact he made; that is something felt in the hearts of all who knew him. Think of him every time you enjoy a cup of coffee, mow a lawn, split wood, paint a house, fire up a green machine, listen to NPR, pour real Vermont maple syrup over your pancakes or catch a glimpse of an old Dodge Dart.

Allen Reavis, R-Atchison, appears for a Dec. 17, 2025, recording of the Kansas Reflector podcast. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — As freshmen legislators last year, Rep. Allen Reavis and Rep. Lon Pishny began having conversations about about the unspoken impact state laws and regulations have on city and county governments.
Bills were being debated, Reavis said, “and it just felt like the effect it would have on local government wasn’t being fully measured.”
“If you’re a legislator who lives in a large city, you may not have the understanding of what happens in a small town with that same legislation,” he added.
Reavis, an Atchison Republican, and Pishny, a Garden City Republican, realized they needed to find a way to help educate and work with their peers. Their idea was to bring together lawmakers with experience serving in or working for local governments, and they formed the bipartisan Local Government Caucus to address their concerns.


They appeared on the Kansas Reflector podcast with Nathan Eberline, executive director of the League of Kansas Municipalities, to talk about the caucus.
“I’m concerned that we’re doing one-size-fits-all legislation in Topeka,” Pishny said. “We mandate it and pass it out to 105 counties when there’s such a variation in operations among those 105.”
Much of the tension flows from a combination of the Legislature mandating local government services, then trying to regulate local property taxes. For a while, the Legislature capped local property tax increases at the rate of inflation. Then, in 2021, the Legislature imposed a confusing “revenue neutral rate.”
That means cities and counties have to lower their property tax rate each year to offset gains in property values — and then send notices and hold public meetings before returning to the same rate as before.

Pishny said the revenue neutral rate was “troubling,” even if the premise was admirable.
“I pay taxes in multiple counties in Kansas, and I would prefer not to pay any more either,” he said. “However, I do want that fire truck to show up at my house, or that ambulance to show up at my house, and some of the services are extremely important.”
Pishny served on the Finney County Commission for 10 years before being elected to his Kanas House seat. Reavis said he spent 13 years in city government and two years with the county before being elected to the House.
They have identified about 40 legislators between the 125-member House and 40-member Senate who have local government experience. They said most are on board with the new caucus, and leadership supports the effort.
But, Pishny said, some remain skeptical.
“Leadership has even cautioned us they don’t want another lobbying group, and that’s not what we’re about,” Pishny said. “We are about education and information and helping people understand the role of local government and what the differences are across the state.”
Reavis said they don’t want to initiate legislation but would like to be responsive to bills and serve as a resource.
They identified several proposals already on their radar, including one that would eliminate a requirement that the Legislature approve local sales tax initiatives and just let local voters decide. They are also interested in discussion about franchise fees, which are charged to a utility to use public rights of way. There could be a challenge to the three-mile zoning jurisdiction that cities have in unincorporated areas. And they could see another wave of efforts to limit local property taxes.

Eberline recalled past efforts by the Legislature to eliminate certain costs, such as mortgage registration fees.
“I remember saying at the time, ‘Well, the more that you do this, the more you shift to the property taxes.’ Those services don’t go away,” Eberline said.
“And so here we are, 10 years later, and everybody’s frustrated by the property tax discussion,” he added.
Eberline said the communities that are thriving in Kansas tend to have something in common.
“It almost always tends to be the place where the city is working with the county is working with the state legislators, and they do have this idea of shared governance, a shared constituency, and the idea that we’re in this together,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC170001-1024x671.jpg,,,2026-01-05 09:57:21.704842

(Photo courtesy of the Office of the Governor)Gov. Tim Walz ended his campaign for a historic third-term on Monday amid mounting pressure from members of his own party and intense attacks from Republicans over widespread fraud in state-run social services programs.
Walz defended his record in a statement and said he was certain he could win a third term, but couldn’t give his entire attention to rooting out fraud while running a campaign.
“I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work,” Walz said in a statement.
Walz will speak to the press at 11 a.m. Monday.
Some Democratic-Farmer-Labor elected officials have quietly worried for months that Walz’s name at the top of the ticket would hand Republicans the governorship for the first time in 15 years and sink Democrats’ prospects down the ballot.
Walz faced a crowded field of Republicans challengers including House Speaker Lisa Demuth, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and former congressional candidate Kendall Qualls.
U.S. Sen. Amy Kloubuchar, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Secretary of State Steve Simon are possible candidates in a Democratic primary which would take place in August.



Read Gov. Tim Walz’s full statement:
Good morning, and Happy New Year.
Like many Minnesotans, I was glad to turn the page on 2025. It was an extraordinarily difficult year for our state. And it ended on a particularly sour note.
For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state’s generosity. And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.
I won’t mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St. Paul, and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place. They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family. They’ve already begun by taking our tax dollars that were meant to help families afford child care. And they have no intention of stopping there.
Make no mistake: We should be concerned about fraud in our state government. We cannot effectively deliver programs and services if we can’t earn the public’s trust. That’s why, over the past few years, we’ve made systemic changes to the way we do business.
We’ve gone to the legislature time and again to get more tools to combat fraud. We’ve fired people who weren’t doing their jobs. We’ve seen people go to jail for stealing from our state. We’ve cut off whole streams of funding, in partnership with the federal government, where we saw widespread criminal activity. We’ve put new locks on the doors of our remaining programs, and we’ve hired a new head of program integrity to make sure those locks can’t be broken.
All across the state, Minnesotans are hard at work on this problem. Advocates, administrators, investigators are on the front lines defending the integrity of our state’s programs, and I want to thank them for their efforts.
There’s more to do. A single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar too much to tolerate. And while there’s a role to play for everyone – from the legislature to prosecutors to insurance companies to local and county government – the buck stops with me. My administration is taking fast, decisive action to solve this crisis. And we will win the fight against the fraudsters.
But the political gamesmanship we’re seeing from Republicans is only making that fight harder to win.
We’ve got Republicans here in the legislature playing hide-and-seek with whistleblowers.
We’ve got conspiracy theorist right-wing YouTubers breaking into daycare centers and demanding access to our children.
We’ve got the President of the United States demonizing our Somali neighbors and wrongly confiscating childcare funding that Minnesotans rely on.
It is disgusting. And it is dangerous.
Republicans are playing politics with the future of our state. And it’s shameful. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: We welcome ideas from anyone, in any party, who wants to help us continue to stay ahead of the criminals.
And we welcome the involvement of the federal government. I’m grateful to the career professionals at the U.S. Attorney’s office and the FBI who are helping us win this fight.
But I cannot abide the actions of the political leadership in Washington – these opportunists who are willing to hurt our people to score a few cheap points. They and their allies have no intention of helping us solve the problem – and every intention of profiting off of it.
Which brings me to this: 2026 is an election year. And election years have a way of ramping up the politics at a time when we simply can’t afford more politics.
In September, I announced that I would run for a historic third term as Minnesota’s Governor. And I have every confidence that, if I gave it my all, I would succeed in that effort.
But as I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all. Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.
So I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.
I know this news may come as a surprise. But I’m passing on the race with zero sadness and zero regret. After all, I didn’t run for this job so I could have this job. I ran for this job so I could do this job. Minnesota faces an enormous challenge this year. And I refuse to spend even one minute of 2026 doing anything other than rising to meet the moment. Minnesota has to come first – always.
That’s what I believe servant leadership demands of me. And as an optimist, I will hold out some hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will consider what servant leadership demands of them in this moment. We can work together to combat the criminals, rebuild the public’s trust, and make our state stronger. But make no mistake: If Republicans continue down this path of abusing power, smearing entire communities, and running their own fraudulent game at the expense of Minnesotans – we will fight back every step of the way.
I’m confident that a DFLer will hold this seat come November. I’m confident that I will find ways to contribute to the state I love even after I’ve left office next January. But there will be time to worry about all that later.
Today, I’m proud of the work we’ve done to make Minnesota America’s best place to live and raise kids – from our new paid leave policy to our child tax credit to our free lunch program.
And I’m doubly proud of the incredible team we’ve put together to make that vision a reality. Thank you to every member of my staff, and every state employee, who’s part of this fight. We need you on the job to tackle the important work ahead.
Most of all, I want Minnesotans to know that I’m on the job, 24/7, focused on making sure we stay America’s best place to live and raise kids. No one will take that away from us. Not the fraudsters. And not the President. Not on my watch.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54916277197_74d814f6e6_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 09:57:21.704842

HOST: Laura Colarusso 
GUESTS: Jennifer Smith, Chris Lisinski, Jordan Wolman, Hallie Claflin







COMMONWEALTH BEACON is officially wrapping up 2025 and looking ahead to the stories that need to be told across Massachusetts in 2026. From major environmental scoops to local news in Gateway Cities to Beacon Hill happenings, our reporters covered a swath of issues last year, and many of those storylines will continue to unfold in the new year.  
On this week’s episode of The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon editor Laura Colarusso sits down with reporters Jennifer Smith, Chris Lisinski, Jordan Wolman, and Hallie Claflin to discuss the team’s major stories in 2025 and what they will be covering on each of their beats in 2026.  
Just weeks after joining the newsroom in September, Wolman uncovered that Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, used Gov. Maura Healey’s pending energy affordability bill as a legislative vehicle to put forth a measure to weaken the state’s 2030 climate commitments. The House didn’t move forward with the legislation following intense backlash, but it’s still on the table for next year.  
“Deep-blue state of Massachusetts walking back from its 2030 climate commitments is not a headline that, at least in November, House leadership was comfortable with,” Wolman said. “I think that we can look for a clearer compromise between what the governor had proposed and what was put forth in this trial balloon.”  
Lisinski, who also joined the team in September but has been covering the Statehouse for years, explained how President Trump’s second term dominated Beacon Hill in 2025. Looking ahead to 2026, he will continue covering the state’s budget pressures as Massachusetts faces sizeable tax revenue losses over a two-year span.  
“The budget writers in the Legislature and in the Healey administration have been growing more and more worried about how much the state is collecting in tax revenue. They have been lifting up every metaphorical couch cushion, trimming spending here and there,” Lisinski said. “That’s just going to continue to get worse with the existence of … the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”  
Claflin joined the team in July to cover the state’s 26 Gateway Cities. In September, she followed up with leaders, health care workers, and first responders in Leominster to examine how the city and region is dealing with the loss of its maternity unit two years later. In 2026, she will continue to monitor hospital and health care service closures in Gateway Cities. 
“Gateway Cities are particularly vulnerable when it comes to those kinds of closures. The payer mix is often challenging for hospitals that are already struggling financially – lots and lots of folks [are] on Medicaid and Medicare in those cities,” Claflin said. “I think there’s going to be more stories to tell there.”  
One of Smith’s deep dives in 2025 shed light on geographic disparities across the state when it comes to health care access.

California legislators return to Sacramento today to kick off the second year of the Legislature’s two-year session. In addition to dealing with a state budget deficit projected to reach nearly $18 billion this year and a 2026 primary election, lawmakers will introduce and weigh in on new bills. Expect many: In 2025, more than 900 bills were sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk.
One proposal in the pipeline is a bill that would enable Californians to file lawsuits against federal agents. Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco drafted the bill in response to ongoing immigration raids under President Donald Trump. Assemblymember Mark González, a Los Angeles Democrat, also introduced a measure that aims to restore the 988 suicide and crisis hotline for LGBTQ+ callers in L.A. County, following Trump’s elimination of the specialized service.
California Republicans in the Senate also laid out their priorities going into the year, which would require considerable bipartisan support given the Democrat’s super-majority in the Legislature. The GOP’s top issues include funding the implementation of the anti-crime measure Proposition 36, investigating Medi-Cal fraud and addressing the state’s high cost of living. 
Many new California laws went into effect on Thursday as well, including ones that allow residents to get grant money for new roofs, require tortilla products to contain folic acid and mandate consumers to pay an extra fee on products with a non-removable battery. Read our rundown on the new laws that could affect your life, and check out the most talked-about measures from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.
Meanwhile, two state laws facing legal challenges from critics have been blocked by federal judges. One measure, which passed last year, grants the state more authority to regulate working conditions for private-sector employees. And on Friday a federal appeals court ruled that the state’s 2023 law restricting concealed firearms is unconstitutional.

Another go for mandatory kindergarten?

Speaking of new bills, California lawmakers plan to reintroduce a proposal requiring parents or legal guardians to enroll their 5-year-olds in school. Though the Legislature has attempted to mandate kindergarten nearly a half dozen times in past years, some legislators are optimistic that a bill could advance this year, reports CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
Data shows that children who attend kindergarten have higher math and reading test scores, are more likely to graduate high school and are less likely to drop out of school. But while California requires all school districts to offer kindergarten, it doesn’t require families to enroll their children. 
State Sen. Susan Rubio, a West Covina Democrat, unsuccessfully proposed two bills to make kindergarten mandatory. One died in the appropriations committee in 2024; the other was spiked by Newsom in 2022, who cited budget restrictions. 
But this year could be different, Rubio says, because the Legislature experienced a significant turnover since it last voted on a kindergarten bill in 2024. Several legislators also said they’d consider sponsoring a kindergarten bill, and California’s public school chief Tony Thurmond pledged to support any bill that addresses it.

Newsom’s final year as CA governor

This year marks Newsom’s last year as California’s governor. In this final year, how the governor responds to the state’s budget, housing and affordability issues could have a major effect on his expected bid for the presidency, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
In the past seven years, Newsom expanded transitional kindergarten, created an office to control rising health care costs and enacted policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. His policy and politics battles against the Trump administration, particularly in 2025, has also thrown Newsom into the national spotlight. 
But the governor has fallen short of some of his promises too, which he could continue to tackle in 2026: California housing costs are some of the highest in the nation and homelessness has increased under his tenure. Amid federal and state budget cuts, some advocates also worry that Newsom will walk away from his goal to expand health care coverage, such as when he proposed to freeze new Medi-Cal enrollments for undocumented immigrants.

“There are no ceremonial offices right now,” Gray, a Democrat, said in an interview last week. “No one can afford to sit it out or stand on the sidelines.”

BURLINGTON — Molly Gray, the former Vermont lieutenant governor who also ran, unsuccessfully, for a seat in Congress, wants her old job back.
Gray announced her campaign for the state’s second-highest office Monday morning at a coffee shop in the South End of Burlington. Gray is running as a Democrat; if she wins the party’s primary in August, she’ll likely face current Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, a Republican first elected to the post in 2024, in the general election in November.
In Vermont, the lieutenant governor has few day-to-day responsibilities besides presiding over the state Senate when it’s in session. But those in the position can, and often do, use it to advocate for certain issues. Gray said she would be a stronger opponent of President Donald Trump’s administration, and the policies and proposals coming from the White House, than Rodgers has been in his first year in the post.
“There are no ceremonial offices right now,” Gray, who’s from Newbury though now lives in Burlington, said in an interview last week. “No one can afford to sit it out or stand on the sidelines at a time where the fundamental rights of Vermonters are under attack — regularly.”
(To be sure, Rodgers has said he does not support Trump and spoke against some of the administration’s actions at a major anti-Trump protest in Montpelier in April.)
Gray was elected lieutenant governor in 2020 after beating out a crowded field of Democratic primary opponents. She was in the job for less than a year before launching her campaign for what was then an open U.S. House seat. After a bruising campaign, she lost the primary to Becca Balint, who easily won the general election that fall.
After leaving office in 2023, Gray was tapped to serve as the first executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance. The Burlington-based nonprofit supports Afghans who are resettling in the state, offering a variety of programs such as a driver education initiative tailored to women who were not allowed to drive in their home country.
Gray said that role has given her firsthand experience with what she called the “extreme cruelty” of the Trump administration’s policies. She pointed, for example, to how the administration has paused visa and other programs for Afghan nationals, while those already in the country have also been stripped of temporary permission to stay.
“It’s ongoing chaos, right?” Gray said. “It’s been one blow after another.”
In addition to using the office’s bully pulpit to respond to news from Washington, D.C., Gray said she’s motivated to run for lieutenant governor again because of her own experiences — giving birth to her son, Jack, since she has left office, as well as caring for her mother, who lives in Newbury and has multiple sclerosis.
“I’ve experienced firsthand a health care system in crisis. Trying to access rural care in rural Vermont is extremely challenging right now,” she said. “We’re deeply concerned, as I think many, many families and many Vermonters are.”
Gray said that if she wins this year’s election, she is not interested in leaving the role for higher office, as she tried to do in 2022. That includes both running for governor and a seat in Congress, she said.
“If I’m lucky enough to earn the support of Vermonters — and have the chance to work for them again — I’ll stay in the job as long as there’s ability to problem solve and to get things done,” Gray said.
No other Democrats had formally announced a 2026 campaign for lieutenant governor as of Monday morning.

That extends to Beacon Hill, where legislators have been more or less on a holiday break since mid-November and now need to chart a course for the busiest stretch of the two-year lawmaking term.
Representatives and senators tend to bristle at the suggestion that they have not been productive, and sure, 2025 featured a not-insignificant amount of work to survey the landscape, gather input, and ponder appropriate next steps.
But a quick glance at the term’s new laws so far shows that legislative leaders are far from accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Once the holiday decorations are taken down and stuffed back into storage, they’ll have plenty of work to do.
Here’s a look at what to expect from Beacon Hill in 2026.
Budget, budget, budget
After a bevy of spending last year — in fact, most of the substantial legislation approved in 2025 featured some degree of appropriations — policymakers will return to the topic quickly.
Healey must file an annual state budget proposal for fiscal year 2027 by January 28, which will kick off months of debate about how Massachusetts absorbs the impacts of federal policy changes.
Her deputies project the megalaw President Donald Trump signed in July will decrease tax collections by nearly $950 million across this year and next combined. Lawmakers might be tempted to soften the blow by divorcing parts of the state’s tax code from the federal code, though that strategy could draw pushback from businesses, for whom compliance would become a heavier lift.
The state’s financial outlook is middling, with most revenues set for modest growth, so budget-writers have their hands full even before accounting for the federal changes.
There’s another big variable hanging over the next cycle, too: influential business groups are pushing a ballot question that would slash the state’s income tax rate from 5 percent to 4 percent. If approved, experts say that measure could cut available revenues by hundreds of millions of dollars in fiscal 2027 and by up to $4.8 billion annually once fully implemented.
Top Democrats are already antsy about the measure, and the frustration could prompt discussions about a compromise policy change to keep the question off the ballot.
Still in crisis: Health care and housing
Three of last term’s biggest laws took aim at the lack of available, affordable places for Bay Staters to live, boosted oversight of hospitals, and sought to control prescription drug costs.
And that won’t be anywhere close to the final word on housing and health care.
Insiders expect more debate this year about what else Massachusetts can do to boost housing production and rein in prices. It’s not clear what lawmakers and Healey have in mind, but they regularly cite the issue as one of the most pressing in the state, especially given its importance to the overused “affordability” and “competitiveness” slogans.
On health care, there’s growing interest — at least in the Senate and corner office — in reinvigorating the primary care sector, where an aging workforce and a lack of new physicians entering the field make it difficult for patients to secure timely appointments.
A task force lawmakers created to come up with solutions last month recommended essentially doubling the share of health care dollars that flow toward primary care, without increasing total spending.
That’s a potentially impactful move that could trigger a major political battle: Growing one slice while keeping the pie the same size means other industry segments, like specialists and pharmaceuticals, would earn less. Those who stand to lose are unlikely to acquiesce quietly.

Finding the right balance on energy affordability
Many of Healey’s top legislative priorities are still stuck somewhere in the pipeline as the new year unfolds, but one already had a short-lived stretch in the spotlight.
The House last fall appeared poised to use Healey’s energy affordability bill as a vehicle to defang the state’s 2030 statutory decarbonization requirements. Once that idea generated major blowback from environmental advocates, though, House leaders retreated.
House Ways and Means Committee chair Aaron Michlewitz said in November that stakeholders still need to “have a conversation at some point related to whether we can meet our goals for 2030,” but suggested that probably will not happen as part of any action on the governor’s legislation.
Left unclear in that assessment was what the final House rewrite will look like, not to mention what senators will do once they get a chance to stamp their own mark on the bill.
Healey’s underlying package wove together a suite of reforms, such as allowing the Department of Public Utilities to cap monthly utility bill increases, more tightly regulate third-party competitive electric suppliers, clear the way for new nuclear power, and more. The governor projected it could save ratepayers $10 billion over a decade.
While that proposal idles, Bay Staters are buckling down for another winter with significant rate hikes.
Election season is closer than you think
No matter how much the Legislature does, 2026 could still be a record-breaking year for policymaking… at the ballot box.
As many as 12 ballot questions are poised to go before voters, barring any proposals failing to clear the remaining eligibility hurdles or campaigns pulling the plug. That would blow past the record of nine measures that appeared on the ballots in 1994, 1976, and 1972.
Expect an awful lot of bellyaching on Beacon Hill about the measures, most of which reflect attempts to circumvent the Legislature on policies that do not have enough support among legislative leaders to move.
The Legislature will get a chance in the first part of the year to approve any of the initiative petitions or propose substitutions, though it seems unlikely they’ll feel inclined to stamp support on this field. Elected officials on occasion have brokered deals in which some campaigns agree to halt their efforts, and that could be on the table again.
Another safe bet: A lot of people will spend, and make, a lot of money on electioneering.
Ballot question campaigns are almost always expensive endeavors, with the most politically potent topics leading to slugfests. Stretch that dynamic across a historically large field, and it seems likely that campaign finance regulators will track tens of millions of dollars changing hands.
This year is also a major statewide election for individual officeholders. All of the state’s constitutional officers are up for election again, and most — including Healey, Attorney General Andrea Campbell, and Treasurer Deborah Goldberg — have already announced plans to seek another term. Three Republicans are also aggressively jockeying for the chance to challenge Healey in the fall.
In the Legislature, there will be much less competition. History shows most Massachusetts lawmakers can expect an easy ride to reelection. But the Legislature as a whole still tends to operate with a fair degree of election-year logic, and the work accomplished by late summer will quickly become fodder for the few incumbents who need to break a sweat on the campaign trail.

Under Newsom’s tenure, health care has been expanded, but his housing goals and homelessness pledges remain unfinished. Can he deliver before eyeing the White House?


It’s Gavin Newsom’s final year in office as California governor — and his last chance to use his role as governor to audition for the national stage. 
The governor, who will address the Legislature and present his budget proposal this week, has spent the past seven years pushing an ambitious agenda. Now in his final year, numerous interest groups will clamor for him to pass their preferred policies, nix the regulations they fear and protect the programs they favor. How he responds will follow him into his expected presidential primary run. 
Will he, with his recent focus on affordability, make a dent in Californians’ housing and health care costs? Will he make progress on reducing homelessness? Will he continue pushing green energy as voters demand cheaper gas? Will he weather another dismal budget deficit without punishing cuts that would alienate the progressives whose programs he has championed? 
“This really is a pivotal year for him,” Democratic political consultant Kelly Calkin said. “What do voters in the rest of the country want to see? They’re feeling the pinch of affordability. … He’s probably going to look through that lens on what helps shape his agenda for the next year.”
It’s also his final opportunity to make headway on some of the lofty goals Newsom made when he ran for governor in 2018 that he hasn’t always met.
He vowed to tackle homelessness, which has only gotten worse over his seven-year tenure, despite the more than $24 billion his administration has poured into it. He started off his term with an initial, headline-grabbing proposal to grant new parents six months of paid leave, but quickly pared it back to a two-week increase, for a total of eight weeks, and gradual boosts in how much the program pays.
In 2021 he said the state would add 200,000 new subsidized child care slots by this year, but the plan been delayed for two years and remains tens of thousand of slots short; he has since promised to resume the expansion this year.
He campaigned on establishing a single-payer public health care system, even calling out “politicians saying they support single-payer but that it’s too soon, too expensive or someone else’s problem.” Then he pivoted to “universal coverage,” with the state slowly expanding coverage for low-income Californians, including undocumented immigrants, but abruptly halted that amid a budget deficit last year. 
He spoke, like so many before him, of evening out the state’s boom-and-bust tax system that over-relies on stock market returns, but has largely quashed other proposals to raise revenue as the state stares down a deficit.
‘It never seems like enough’
Newsom’s penchant for big promises and first-in-the-nation ideas has been both a blessing and a curse for the ambitious politician. Advocates of those policies say the lofty goals have made a difference, even if the state ultimately falls short of achieving all of them. 
Newsom has left his mark on state government: He started new programs like the expansion of public school to all 4-year-olds, created an office to control rising health care costs, flexed the state’s regulatory powers to achieve its greenhouse gas-reduction goals — only to run into resistance with the Trump administration — and pushed state leaders into overseeing thorny issues like homelessness and the mental health care system that had long been left to local and county governments. 
“I don’t think there was a lot of stuff lacking,” said Anthony Rendon, the former Assembly speaker who led the chamber during Newsom’s first five years in office, of policy issues the governor has yet to address. After years of working with Newsom’s predecessor Jerry Brown, who was focused mostly on fiscal restraint and building up the state’s reserves, Rendon and former Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins recalled Newsom starting off his first term in 2019 pleasing the mostly Democratic Legislature with a long list of progressive ideas and a willingness to spend on them. 
“In retrospect, it never seems like enough,” Rendon said.

Diablo Unified School District in Concord on Aug. 11, 2025. Photos by Camille Cohen and Laure Andrillon for CalMatters
Case in point: housing. It’s perhaps the most visible measure by which Newsom will be judged after he leaves office and it comprises a bulk of the recent national Democratic platform focused on lowering the cost of living. About 40% of California households are “burdened” by their rent or mortgage, Census data shows, a policymaker benchmark meaning housing eats up more than a third of their income. 
Newsom ran on lowering those costs by boosting production and said it was “achievable” for the state to build an ambitious 3.5 million new homes by 2025. In 2024, the state added just under 120,000 new units, about a fifth of the annual rate needed to meet that goal. In media appearances the governor now downplays his original figure as a “stretch goal.”
Yet those who favor building more say he’s still accomplished more than any other governor on housing. They blame local resistance to housing density, high interest rates and the persistently high cost of building as reasons for the slow progress. 
“You can’t solve a systemic problem overnight or even in seven years, but what you can do is change the trajectory of the issue,” said Ray Pearl, executive director of the California Housing Consortium, a nonprofit that advocates for building affordable housing.
A pivot to modular housing this year?
Pearl pointed to actions Newsom has taken, like an early budget move to quintuple the state’s tax credit for low-income housing construction, backing laws that relax rules on where housing can be built and picking legal fights with cities that refuse to plan adequate housing units for their populations. 
“Leadership sets the tone,” he said. “It’s changed the focus and the conversation to where the state of California has finally gotten serious in planning for and producing affordable housing.”
Pearl said in Newsom’s final year in office he hopes the governor will support a proposed $10 billion bond lawmakers want to put on this year’s ballot to boost a state affordable housing fund.
Newsom acknowledges California has yet to see his promised building boom, and last month expressed interest in alternative forms of construction, such as modular housing, as another solution. On The Ezra Klein Show, he hinted at an upcoming legislative debate over how the state can promote modular housing, a cheaper way to build in which houses are assembled in factories then shipped to sites to be installed. An Assembly committee chaired by one of Newsom’s allies on housing, Democratic Oakland Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, is set to discuss the method this year. Its use in the Bay Area has already exposed familiar debates about the use of union labor in housing. 
“This holds a lot of promise. It holds a lot of political peril, in the context of the politics within labor. And that has to be accommodated and dealt with,” Newsom said. “By the way, if there’s a big preview for California in my last year, it’s in this space legislatively to take it to the next level.”
It’s the closest Newsom has come in recent weeks to stating a new policy goal or proposal. Izzy Gardon, Newsom’s spokesperson, would not provide any details on his housing or any other agenda, telling CalMatters only to “stay tuned.” 
Gardon refused interview requests to discuss the governor’s policy goals for his final year. Newsom is expected to deliver his State of the State address on Thursday.
Tough times for health care and social services
Already, advocates for the comprehensive safety-net services that Newsom has championed — another hallmark of his tenure — are urging him to maintain those programs as he stares down another tough budget deficit estimated at $18 billion. The agency overseeing those services accounts for nearly 40% of the state’s general fund spending and many of its programs are projected to lose significant federal funds through President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill.

During Newsom’s two terms, he added subsidized child care slots, boosted cash assistance for the poor, installed a state surgeon general who has focused on childhood trauma and the racial health gap and most significantly, incrementally expanded health care coverage to different groups of undocumented immigrants. 
The latter, a controversial and costly policy, has allowed the governor to pivot from his original promise of a universal, state-paid health care system that was the pie-in-the-sky dream of progressives and still say he was achieving “universal access.” After passage of the Affordable Care Act, more than 90% of Californians were insured by the time Newsom took office. His expansions, first for immigrant young adults and then for older ones, pushed it to nearly everyone in 2023. 
Policy allies generally don’t fault Newsom for shifting away from a single-payer system, which would have required billions more in state funds and complex agreements with an increasingly un-aligned federal administration. They are particularly satisfied that his administration has laid some of the groundwork for such a proposal by attempting to rein in the growth of health care costs through price limits imposed by the Office of Health Care Affordability. But now, they’re worried he’ll walk away from his expansive coverage goals altogether. 
Last year, facing higher than expected costs in the Medi-Cal program and needing to close a $12 billion deficit, Newsom undid coverage for the last group of undocumented residents to become eligible: working-age adults. A freeze on new enrollment of adults took effect Jan. 1. Later this year, undocumented immigrant adults will lose Medi-Cal dental coverage and next year most will face monthly premiums that are expected to force some off coverage, to the disappointment of health advocates who are urging Newsom to reverse the cuts. 
Amanda McAllister-Wallner, executive director of the advocacy group Health Access California, said she’s worried the administration will consider further cuts this year, after Newsom has come out heavily against other proposals to raise revenue for the health system, like a nurses’ union proposal for a wealth tax. She doesn’t like that the governor appeared willing to back down on coverage at the same time the state’s provision of social services for immigrants became an increasing political controversy nationally. 
“The hope was that the Health for All expansion would be considered the baseline, that that would be something we budget for long term because it’s just something that’s part of who we are as a state,” said McAllister-Wallner. “Health care has been an area where the governor has really made a name for himself in a way that I think he can and should be very proud of, and to see … a backing-off of those commitments would be the biggest disappointment for me.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/010623-Newsom-Inauguration-RL-CM-06.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 08:57:15.547655

California is one of 32 states that doesn’t require 5-year-olds to attend school.



The past few years, California has been all about the ABCs, 1-2-3s and the wheels on the bus, investing more than $5 billion in early childhood education. 
But kindergarten, a staple of elementary schools for more than a century, remains optional. Despite nearly a half dozen legislative attempts to require it, California is one of 32 states that doesn’t mandate that all 5-year-olds attend school.
That might change next year. Legislators plan to introduce a new bill to require kindergarten and they’re confident that it will meet a better fate than its predecessors, which either died in committee or were vetoed, largely due to the cost.
“Kids need to be around other kids, they need to be learning. It matters,” said Patricia Lozano, executive director of Early Edge California, which advocates for early childhood education. “I don’t see why California can’t make this happen.”
The data, advocates say, is clear. Children who attend kindergarten have higher test scores in math and reading in third grade and beyond and higher high school graduation rates. They’re also less likely to be suspended or drop out later in their school careers.
Why some parents opt out
While California requires all school districts to offer kindergarten, it doesn’t require families to enroll their children. Most do, but about 5% a year opt out. The reasons vary: some families believe their children aren’t ready for the rigors of school, and others are happy with their children’s current arrangement, whether it’s a preschool, day care or staying home with family.
Latino families are the least likely to send their children to kindergarten, data shows. Lozano said there’s a variety of reasons for this: they either don’t know about it due to a language barrier; they’re afraid to register their children in school due to immigration concerns; parents are working so hard they’ve missed notices from the school district; or some combination of all three. Regardless, schools need to improve their outreach to that community, she said.
Cecelia Kiss, a bilingual kindergarten teacher in the Sacramento City Unified School District, said she recently had a student whose mother was deported, and the child was unable to attend school because there was no one available to drive her. Even though the child loved school and the family placed a high value on education, it was logistically impossible to get the child to school. It took several weeks for the school and family to make transportation arrangements.
“For Latinos, education is so important. We want to give our kids the best we can,” said Kiss, who is also the parent of a kindergartner. “But sometimes we can’t do everything. We rely on kind teachers to care for our children, to help them learn, to help them be prepared for first grade.”
State Sen. Susan Rubio said that the fact that kindergarten isn’t mandatory discourages already disadvantaged families from enrolling their children. In her experience, Latino families have tremendous respect for the public school system and if the system tells them kindergarten is optional, and therefore not a priority, “they listen to that.”
That’s why she’s proposed two previous bills to make kindergarten mandatory. The state should be unequivocal in its message to families that early childhood education is essential for students’ success in school and life, she said. The state’s already rolled out transitional kindergarten to all 4-year-olds, expanded state-funded preschool and added more slots to its subsidized child care program. Bolstering kindergarten should be next, she said.
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond agrees. He said this month that making kindergarten mandatory is a legislative priority for 2026, and he pledged to support any bill that addresses it. Several legislators said they’d consider sponsoring one.
‘Not an urgent need’
Both of Rubio’s previous kindergarten bills died – one in the Senate Appropriations Committee and another when Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed it. In his veto note, he said he supports early education generally but the state hadn’t budgeted the cost, estimated to be $268 million annually. 
“While the author’s intent is laudable … it is important to remain disciplined when it comes to spending, particularly spending that is ongoing,” Newsom wrote.
Plenty of groups supported the bills, including the California Teachers Association — the state’s largest teachers union — and a slew of school districts. But it had a few opponents, namely the Homeschool Association of California. The group’s opposition was not based on the merits of kindergarten itself, but on the state’s ability to strip rights from parents.
“Most kids are already going to kindergarten. But some parents have good reasons for keeping their kids at home,” said Jamie Heston, a member of the group’s board. “Parents want the choice to decide what’s best for their individual child.”
The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association hasn’t taken a position on the issue, but generally opposes new initiatives that cost money — including mandatory kindergarten. That stance isn’t likely to change if a kindergarten bill resurfaces, the group’s vice president Susan Shelley said this week.
“From a budgetary point of view, there’s a lot of pressure this year to keep spending under control,” Shelley said. “This would not be a one-time cost. It would be ongoing. And there’s not an urgent need to expand kindergarten, compared to other more pressing needs facing the state right now.”
Bruce Fuller, an education professor at UC Berkeley who studies early childhood education, said the Legislature should focus on more pressing needs facing the under-6 crowd. Those include how the rollout of transitional kindergarten has led to the closure of many preschools, leaving many 3-year-olds without a place to go. Also, Head Start is struggling with funding and other obstacles imposed by the Trump administration, including attempts to bar families who are not citizens. And even though California has expanded access to state-funded preschool, not enough families know they’re eligible.
“Not that many families opt out of kindergarten, so it’s not a huge need,” Fuller said. “There are more immediate concerns.” 
Learning gaps among students
Still, Rubio is confident that a kindergarten bill has a good chance of passing this year, largely because the Legislature has seen a significant turnover since it last voted on a  kindergarten bill in 2024. Twenty-seven new senators and Assembly members were elected last fall.
For Rubio, whose parents immigrated from Mexico, the issue is personal. Although she did well in school, her twin brother did not. At an early age, he was wrongly placed in special education, fell behind and struggled throughout his time in school, eventually dropping out. Rubio believes he would have fared better if he had a high-quality early childhood education.
She’s also an elementary school teacher who’s seen the gap between students who’ve been to preschool, TK and kindergarten, versus those who had never enrolled in school at all until first grade. Children who’ve been to kindergarten know how to hold a pencil, write their names, count to 20, take turns and maybe even read or do basic math, she said. Those who haven’t lag far behind their peers and some never catch up, she said.
“I have very vivid memories of my students just breaking down crying at the end of the year because they couldn’t do a test. They didn’t know the answers, and that’s so heartbreaking to see,” said Rubio, who’s on leave from her job teaching at Monrovia Unified in Los Angeles County. “It’s hard on them, and it’s hard on the teachers because those children need a lot of extra help.”
Lozano said she thinks the bill will pass eventually. The initiative would cost money, but the state would save money in the long run if more students succeeded in school and graduated.
“It took us 20 years to get TK. It takes time to change minds, change policies,” Lozano said. “There are so many benefits to kindergarten, especially for the kids who need it the most. We believe the benefits outweigh the costs.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/032723-Buttonwillow-LV_CM_15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 08:57:15.547655

The California Courier uses the name of an established paper and doesn’t disclose apparent Republican ties. Critics call it “pink slime”




Earlier this year, as the political battle over Congressional redistricting brought California into the national spotlight, Facebook users were shown a curious series of ads.
The ads, from a straightforward-looking news site called the California Courier, often felt a lot like campaign commercials, linking to articles hammering Democrats in the state, including Gov. Gavin Newsom. Few punched in the other direction, toward Republicans. One said “California Democrats just rewrote their gerrymandering plan so voters will see their partisan map on the ballot this November.” Another called Proposition 50, which passed in November, “a scheme critics say is meant to undermine voter-approved protections and entrench one party rule in California.”
A reader who clicked through to the Courier’s website would find stories that largely align with a conservative view of the news, like a video of a child “riding a scooter through San Fran’s drug-ravaged streets,” or an anonymous piece that cites “confidential sources” cautioning against a “left-wing educator” running for a position with an Orange County school district. 
What a reader would not find is any disclosure of the Courier’s ownership or funding, including what appear to be ties to a network of conservative organizations in California that, according to one researcher, scaled up a series of right-leaning news sites in three other states just ahead of the 2024 election.
The Courier has money to spend. According to a review of the ad library maintained by Facebook’s owner, Meta, the outlet has spent more than $80,000 since 2021 promoting its stories on social issues and politics, potentially reaching tens of thousands of users on the platform each week. 
Critics say the California outlet is part of a growing, nationwide ecosystem of innocuous-looking, cheaply-produced news publications that publish and advertise biased articles in an attempt to surreptitiously influence elections. They worry the practice could mislead voters and corrode trust in nonpartisan news providers.  
“I think we are in an era where people are consuming so much content online without knowing the source of it,” said Max Read, who has studied the network apparently behind the Courier at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonprofit that works to counter political polarization. “And for well-funded organizations to contribute to that by disguising what they’re doing online just helps exacerbate that problem of people not trusting what they come across.”

At a glance, the Courier does not necessarily look right-leaning. A handful of stories seem like straight news echoing press releases, such as one announcing new affordable housing units. But even those that seem relatively neutral may have a right-leaning spin, like one describing speeding fines tied to income as a potential “woke penalty loophole.”
The outlet also shares a name with a 67-year-old California-based publication serving the Armenian diaspora. One of that Courier’s founders won acclaim from his peers for his tenure as dean of the University of Maryland’s journalism school.
When The Markup and CalMatters contacted the publisher of the Armenian Courier, he said he was unaware of the other site. He told a reporter he was opening it for the first time.
“I’m definitely not conservative,” said Harut Sassounian, who owns the Courier, where his regular editorials appear online and formerly in print. “The two publications have nothing in common. Neither politically nor ethnically nor anything like that.”
The Lincoln Media network
Although it lacks the pedigree of its Armenian twin, the right-leaning Courier has shown it is well-immersed in today’s social media. A video it made suggesting Newsom flip-flopped in his view of President Joe Biden’s mental acuity generated thousands of reactions. 
The publication also shares some of the murky citation practices of contemporary social media. Almost all of the stories on the site are unattributed, or simply attributed to “the California Courier.” 
A few, however, include author names. One of the named writers describes himself on social media as a “content creator” for the Lincoln Media Foundation, a conservative group, and links to Courier articles. Another shares a name with a Republican strategist based in Orange County, and a third lists a resume with conservative organizations in a short bio. 
The Lincoln Media Foundation is tied to the Lincoln Club, a group based in Orange County that bills itself as “the oldest and largest conservative major donor organization in the state of California.” The club funnels anonymously-donated money to conservative candidates and causes.
The Lincoln Media Foundation’s Facebook page recently said it was “proud to present” a new documentary purporting to reveal “the untold truth about the Pacific Palisades fire,” the natural disaster that tore through the state this year and increased political pressure on Newsom. 
One hour later, the Courier’s Facebook page promoted it as well, not mentioning the Lincoln Media Foundation but describing the documentary as “much anticipated.”

Neither the Lincoln Club, Lincoln Media, the California Courier, or the Courier writers responded to multiple requests for comment about the origins of the site, either through email, phone, or social media messages.
That silence, and the lack of information about ownership on the Courier’s website, comes despite the outlet’s chief goal, as outlined on its Facebook page.
“California Courier offers statewide and local news,” the page’s description reads. “Our mission is transparency.”
The Lincoln Club has previously been linked to “local” websites around the country, spreading stories with a distinctly conservative tint. 
Last year, Read’s Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which tracks disinformation and extremism online, found a handful of such sites that noted deep in their privacy policies that they were projects from Lincoln Media. Those outlets had names like The Angeleno and the Keystone Courier, and stretched from California to Pennsylvania, although a resulting report didn’t name the Courier. 
Many of the sites used Facebook and other social media tools to press a conservative agenda, the report found. Meta has rules against “coordinated inauthentic behavior” but it’s not clear whether Lincoln Media’s websites would cross that line. 
‘Pink slime’ news
Researchers have taken to calling sites like those operated by Lincoln Media “pink slime” news, a name coined after a meat-industry additive. These sites don’t produce outright false news, like others, but they do not meet basic journalistic standards. That often means low-quality content and failing to disclose associations with outside organizations. 
The sites generally aren’t designed to generate revenue, but to sway public opinion. The majority, according to researchers, lean toward a conservative agenda, and if the site’s stories gain traction on social media, they can travel widely. “If they place an ad well or if they just get the right pickup from the right influencer, these things don’t really have a limit on how far they can go,” Read said.
While it’s not clear how many sites the Lincoln Club might fund, it isn’t the only group that has used the strategy.
In 2020, the New York Times reported on Metric Media, a group that created nearly 1,300 sites around the country with names like Maine Business Daily and the Ann Arbor Times. At a glance, these could pass for simple local news operations. But the Times report found they took money from public relations firms and Republican operatives to produce stories beneficial to those groups, a massive journalistic red flag. 
Ethical or not, the strategy can be effective for lending credibility to a particular viewpoint. Kevin DeLuca, an assistant professor of political science at Yale University who has researched pink slime websites, conducted an experiment that showed subjects both real unbiased news sites and others produced by Metric Media. 
Some subjects in the study were given a tip sheet that asked them to examine the sites closely, looking at whether they included information like credible mission pages and other details. But even with the tip sheet, the study subjects said in interviews that they didn’t strongly prefer the truly local over the manufactured sites. 
DeLuca says these sites are now in place around the United States, and news consumers have little idea when they’re running into them. The problem may only get worse with the spread of generative AI, since that technology further reduces the cost of creating such sites.
Researchers who study these sites say it’s never been easier to produce them. Local news, for one, has faced a years-long financial crisis that’s wiped many once-robust operations off the map.

While it can’t be said whether any one publication uses AI-generated content, the wide availability of tools like ChatGPT, capable of producing at least a semblance of a passable news story, have also made it easier to build up such sites. 
“It’s going to make these pink slime sites even harder for people to know that what they’re reading is not from a human source and not really local investigative journalism.” DeLuca said.
Sassounian, for his part, doesn’t think there’s any risk the two California Couriers would ever be confused with each other. He took over the paper in the 1980s, and his columns, which he describes as “hard-hitting editorials that defend the rights of the Armenian people worldwide,” have been translated into languages around the world. 
“It’s not pleasant to have our name used by someone else,” Sassounian said. “I prefer that they don’t, but I don’t know what I can do about it.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/121125-CA-COURIER-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 08:57:15.547655

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As states across the nation broke into a redistricting arms race ahead of the 2026 elections, Utah got a new congressional map through a court-ordered redistricting process stemming from a yearslong lawsuit alleging gerrymandering and a violation of Utahns’ rights to reform their government through ballot initiative. 
By the end of 2025, a Utah judge had ordered a new congressional map that included one Democratic-leaning district. 
The ruling has left Republican lawmakers dismayed and defiant. They’ve accused the judge of violating the Utah Constitution and separation of powers principles, as they maintain the Legislature has the sole authority to draw political boundaries. They’ve pledged to continue to fight the ruling in court and have pushed back candidate filing deadlines to allow more time for a different map to be put in place. 
As Supreme Court pulls back on gerrymandering, state courts may decide fate of maps

Anti-gerrymandering groups and plaintiffs in the case, meanwhile, are standing firm, arguing that the courts have not only the power — but the responsibility — to step in when lawmakers have failed to pass a lawful map. 
Voters in 2018 narrowly approved a ballot measure known as Proposition 4, which created an independent redistricting commission that had to adhere to neutral map-drawing criteria. But lawmakers later repealed and replaced that law with a new one to turn the independent commission into an advisory body that lawmakers ultimately didn’t need to listen to. 
Though 2025 brought significant developments in Utah’s longstanding redistricting legal fight, it’s still far from being resolved. 
Here are the key issues to watch in 2026 — which will have crucial implications for Utah’s redistricting process, the fate of Utahns’ ballot initiative power, and the future of Utah’s political landscape.

Will Utah’s court-ordered congressional map hold? 
The lawsuit over Utah’s redistricting process is far from over. 
The Utah Legislature’s top Republican leaders have repeatedly said they plan to appeal 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s rulings to the Utah Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. 
Late last month, Gibson issued a ruling declining to finalize the larger, ongoing redistricting lawsuit but allowing final certification of her Aug. 25 ruling that tossed out the Legislature’s 2021 map. That means the Legislature can appeal that specific decision to the Utah Supreme Court, which it’s expected to do in early January.

In that ruling, Gibson acknowledged that “until there is a final decision on these legal issues from our Supreme Court, there will be a cloud (over) Utah’s congressional elections and an open question regarding the power of the Legislature and the power of the people.” 
“The Utah Supreme Court can decide now if the Legislature is the sole and exclusive authority over redistricting in Utah or if it shares that responsibility with the people,” Gibson wrote. “It can decide if the people of Utah, through the exercise of their right to alter or reform government through a citizen initiative, can also pass binding laws regarding how the Legislature performs its redistricting duty.”
Additionally, the judge said the Utah Supreme Court “should decide now” if her Aug. 25 ruling that blocked the Legislature’s 2021 congressional map should stand or not. 
“These legal questions should be put to rest as soon as possible,” she wrote. “There is no just reason to delay the Utah Supreme Court’s review of those legal rulings in the (Aug. 25 ruling).” 
In redistricting fight, Utah Republican lawmakers will appeal to Utah Supreme Court

Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. 
Lawmakers in a special session pushed back the 2026 congressional candidate filing period by about two months — until March 9-13 — in hopes of getting a different congressional map in place in time for the 2026 elections. But it remains unclear whether the Utah Supreme Court will weigh in on time, what its decision will be — or if lawmakers will attempt any other legislative maneuvers between now and then. 
For now, though, Utah’s court-ordered map that includes a Democratic-leaning district concentrated in northern Salt Lake County, remains.
Democrats’ crowded race for Congress 
With high hopes that Utah Democrats will have their best chance in years to send a candidate to the U.S. House, the Democratic primary for the state’s newly drawn 1st Congressional District is already shaping up to be a crowded one. 
State Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, was the first to announce, followed closely by former congressman Ben McAdams, the last Utah Democrat to hold a seat in Congress. Former state Sen. Derek Kitchen also jumped into the race, along with current Sen. Nate Blouin, Salt Lake City Council member Eva Lopez Chavez, and a newcomer from West Valley City, Luis Villarreal. Even more announcements could be in the works. 
Meanwhile, the new District 1 could force a shakeup in Utah’s current all-Republican delegation. 
Utah lawmakers condemn courts while anti-gerrymandering supporters urge ‘hear our voice’

Because congressional candidates don’t need to live in the district they represent, it’s not yet clear which district each incumbent will run for. But if Utah’s current court-ordered map holds, whichever Republican runs for the 1st Congressional District will likely face an uphill battle to keep his or her seat. 
Will Republicans’ effort to repeal Prop 4 succeed? 
While Utah’s redistricting court battle continues, the Utah Republican Party and a political issues committee called Utahns for Representative Government are pursuing a ballot initiative of their own to repeal the voter-approved independent redistricting law known as Proposition 4. 
To successfully place the repeal question on the 2026 ballot, the groups have until Feb. 14 to gather at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters and hit high enough thresholds in at least 26 out of the state’s 29 Senate districts. 
As of Dec. 31, 24,372 signatures had been submitted, according to the Lieutenant Governor’s Office.
Another redistricting twist: Utah GOP changes tactics to repeal independent map-drawing law

A dark money group that helped finance President Donald Trump presidential campaign in 2024 is bankrolling the Proposition 4 repeal effort. The nonprofit Securing American Greatness has contributed more than $4.3 million to Utahns for Representative Government, according to the group’s received contributions report. 
The anti-gerrymandering group Better Boundaries — which successfully sought Proposition 4 in 2018 — has been encouraging Utahns not to sign the repeal petition, while also accusing some paid signature gatherers of using “misleading and deceptive tactics to trick people into signing.” The group has also issued reminders that signers can go through a process to remove their signatures. 
If the groups successfully place the repeal question on the 2026 ballot, Utah voters will have the final say on whether Proposition 4 stays — or gets overturned. 
Lawmakers may try again to enshrine their power over ballot initiatives 
When Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders announced they would be holding a special session to push back congressional candidate filing deadlines, they also said they plan to consider asking voters to consider a constitutional amendment to “clarify” or restrict the power of voter-approved ballot initiatives. 
It wouldn’t be the first time Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature tried to do this — but the last attempt failed, voided by the courts. 
After a groundbreaking Utah Supreme Court ruling in 2024 made clear that the Legislature’s power over “government reform” ballot initiatives has limits, Utah lawmakers put a question known as Amendment D on the 2024 November ballot to sidestep that ruling and rewrite the Utah Constitution. 
Judge voids controversial constitutional amendment on Utah’s Nov. 5 ballot

Had it been approved by voters, Amendment D would have enshrined in the Utah Constitution the Legislature’s unfettered power to repeal or alter any type of ballot initiative, including Proposition 4. 
However, the Nov. 5 ballot language posing the question to voters — written by Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders — did not explain that in plain language, prompting critics to sue. They claimed Amendment D’s language was “false and misleading.”
Gibson agreed, while also determining state officials failed to meet constitutional publication requirements — so she voided the question. State attorneys appealed the decision to the Utah Supreme Court, which affirmed the district court’s decision.
But Utah lawmakers don’t seem likely to drop the issue. They may pursue a new version of Amendment D — but it’s not yet clear what its language will be. Lawmakers are likely to consider a resolution to put the question on the ballot during their 2026 general session scheduled to begin Jan. 20. 
Lawmakers eye changes to the courts 
As part of a brewing issue that’s related to redistricting but bigger — stemming from lawmakers’ overall recent frustrations with the court system — Utah legislators are likely to again turn their attention to Utah’s judiciary and consider making changes. 
Utah’s top GOP lawmakers have said that the Legislature is expected to weigh whether to expand Utah’s Supreme Court from five justices to seven. 
They told the Deseret News it’s meant to address growing caseloads and to speed up decisions, but Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told The Salt Lake Tribune in October that more justice could actually lead to more deliberation and delay timelines further. 
Saying it’s not court packing, governor supports expanding Utah’s appeals courts  

Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters during his Nov. 25 news conference broadcast by PBS Utah that he’s in favor of adding more justices to the Utah Supreme Court and more judges to the state’s Court of Appeals. 
The governor said he doesn’t see it as court packing, and that he doesn’t share the same consternation lawmakers have with the courts. Rather, he said he sees it as a way to “start moving justice quicker through the system.”
A majority of states have at least seven justices. That includes neighboring Colorado and Nevada. Idaho and Wyoming have five. 
If the Utah Legislature’s 2026 session is anything like last year’s, however, it’s possible tensions between lawmakers and the judiciary could boil over again. Last year, lawmakers considered a slate of bills that legal professionals and even Durrant, who as a member of the high court doesn’t generally comment on political issues, described as a “broad attack on the independence of the judiciary.” 
Many of those bills, however, fizzled or resulted in a compromise. It’s possible some could return for further debate. 
Additionally, some Republican lawmakers have voiced support for considering articles of impeachment against Gibson over her rulings in the redistricting case — but it remains to be seen whether that effort will gain any traction. 
Rep. Matt MacPherson, R-West Valley City, said he planned to file articles of impeachment against the judge. But when asked about that effort in November, MacPherson told Utah News Dispatch he wanted to wait and see how the Legislature’s appeal to the Utah Supreme Court goes before deciding whether to proceed.

Jeana Ross, R-Guntersville, speaks to the Alabama House of Representatives on May 8, 2024 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker has pre-filed a bill for the 2026 legislative session that would limit screen time for children.
HB 78, sponsored by Jeana Ross, R-Guntersville, would require licensed child-care facilities, public kindergarten classrooms and certain Pre-K classrooms to implement guidelines and training on screen time created by the Department of Early Childhood Education (ADECE) Research and Evaluation team.
Ross, who previously served as Alabama Secretary of Early Childhood Education, said after seeing what research said about the effects of screen time on children wanted to find a way to prevent it.

“I can remember early on, like in the early 2000s writing grants, because I wanted every child to have an iPad. I just thought, because it was the new technology, and they could put all their books on the iPad, and they wouldn’t have to carry those heavy books in a backpack,” she said in a recent interview. “I didn’t know better, but now we see what the outcomes are and why it wasn’t such a bad idea for the older students, but it absolutely was not a good idea for the younger students.”
An August report from Cedars-Sinai Medical Medical Center, a hospital in Los Angeles, said that children under three years old should have “little to no screen exposure” because it can delay social skill development.
“We’ve long recognized that the earliest years of life matter the most, and from birth to age five, their children’s brains are developing so fast, I mean, faster than any other time, and the experiences they have during those years shapes their learning for a lifetime,” Ross said.
Ross said one key piece of this bill is bringing awareness to parents about screen usage.
“This is not about shaming or making people feel like, oh my goodness, what have I done? This is just about informing, and that’s going to be a big piece of this legislation, that parents are going to be able to have information that they might not have known about, as far as how to best use screens and when not to use them,” she said.
Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey said after the Dec. 11 Alabama State Board of Education meeting that while screens have their place in society, students need to be spending instructional time with teachers.
“There’s a lot of research about the overuse of screens in some places. We already have limitations on our four-year-old Pre-K program in this state, so I’m excited about us having discussions about how we can extend some of those limits to five-year-olds,” he said.
Under the Alabama Administrative Code, children under the age of two are prohibited from screen usage and children over the age of two are limited to less than 30 minutes per day for children in half-day programs and less than an hour a day in full-day programs in licensed childcare facilities.
Not all child care facilities in Alabama are licensed. Out of 2,458 facilities roughly 78% (1,922) are licensed by the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). Licensed facilities are required to reapply for licensure every two years.
Ross’ bill expands these limitations to include weekly limitations of 90 minutes per day for children ages two through four and individual screen usage is prohibited. Local boards of education must adopt policies on appropriate screen time usage in kindergarten classrooms.
Guidelines implemented in the bill would be created by the Department of Early Childhood Education (ADECE) Research and Evaluation team in collaboration with DHR and the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE). All three agencies will implement the guidelines once created.
“If you provide the opportunity to people, for people to have input, not only are you creating something that’s got a lot of good across the board perspective, you’re including people in the process, and I think that’s very important,” Ross said.
The guidelines must include the importance of reading, play, physical activity and caregiver-child interaction; the risks of excessive screen time on children and strategies for creating “screen-free routines” at home.
The bill would require certain teachers and staff to undergo annual training developed by ADECE, DHR AND ALSDE that includes guidance on the appropriate use of screen time in early childhood settings, what constitutes high-quality programming and alternatives to screen time.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Tribes across the West have worked with states to protect the Colorado River and conserve enough water to raise elevations in the river’s two largest reservoirs, Lakes Powell and Mead, a move that has helped states during critical droughts.
Now tribes want to make it clear that any future agreements on how to manage the river’s water must include their input and an acknowledgment that they intend to develop their water rights.
“It’s high time that tribes begin to really begin to flex their sovereignty,” said Mike Natchees, a member of the Ute Indian Tribe Business Committee.
The Ute Indian Tribe holds significant senior water rights, including 500,000 acre-feet in the Green River basin in Utah, but faces challenges with unused water flowing downstream due to lack of infrastructure and funding. 
“It just continues to flow downstream. We are uncompensated for it. It is undeveloped. And again, that is unacceptable for the Ute Indian Tribe,” Natchees said.
That sentiment was shared among representatives for dozens of tribes who spoke at the Colorado River Water Users Association conference at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in December.
Western states that rely on the Colorado River have less than two months to agree on how to manage the troubled river. The seven Colorado River Basin states — Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming — have until Feb. 14 to reach a new water sharing agreement before current operating rules expire at the end of 2026 —or the federal government will step in with their own plan.
But the Ute Indian Tribe, whose reservation is located in Northeastern Utah, emphasized that any new agreement will have a significant impact on tribes across the Colorado River basin.
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use during dry years. Historically, Lower Basin states have used nearly all their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation under current Colorado River guidelines, compared to the 4.5 million acres-feet used by the Upper Basin states.
Natchees said the impact of water cuts to tribes in the Upper Basin have not been discussed enough during negotiations, adding that he hopes tribes will one day have a seat on the Upper Colorado River Commission, an interstate water administrative agency that represents Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico.
“The bottom line is that the Lower Basin is just simply over allocated. They’re overusing and they’re doing it with no regard to anyone in the Upper Basin, which feeds their system, and that needs to change,” Natchees said.
Tribes have continued to be a part of the solution when it comes to conservation on the river, said President of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, Jonathan E. Koteen.
In 2025, the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe signed an agreement to conserve 13,000 acre-feet of water to bolster elevations in Lake Mead, and contributed additional water savings through its ongoing seasonal fallowing agreement with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
Those water savings helped California reach its goal of conserving 1.6 million acre-feet in Lake Mead a year ahead of schedule.
“Tribal inclusion must be formal, meaningful and permanent. Tribes are not new participants. We are original stewards of the river, and our voices must be part of shaping the future family,” Koteen said.
Conservation efforts by tribes have also been innovative, said Koteen. The Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe secured funding to line the Reservation Main Canal, reducing seepage and improving efficiency for water deliveries to large portions of the Yuma Project Reservation Division.
Another example of an innovative solution was when the Jicarilla Apache Nation entered a landmark 10-year water-sharing agreement with New Mexico and The Nature Conservancy in 2023 to lease up to 20,000 acre-feet of its Colorado River water annually, supporting endangered fish habitat and water security for the state by strategically releasing water into the San Juan River.
“It’s increasing water security for the state of New Mexico, allowing the state to meet its obligations under whatever framework that we end up coming up with in post 2026, so it’s a great project,” said Jenny Dumas, the water attorney for the Jicarilla Apache Nation.
But Dumas emphasized that not every tribe can replicate such an agreement, and every tribe has their own unique needs that must be considered when settling on a new water sharing agreement.
Councilmember for Ute Mountain Ute Tribe Conrad Jacket said the tribe’s Bow and Arrow Farm is a major economic driver. While tribes in California, like the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, are able to reduce crops for payment, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe can not.
“This year, we did have to cut back,” Jacket said. “And that’s not good on our part. That is not good on all this whole region’s part.”
Instead, the tribe would benefit more from flexible tools that allow the tribe’s water to be set aside in good water years, while contributing to additional release in dry years.
Tribes said they were committed to helping states reach a seven-state consensus on how to share the river’s water, in order to stabilize the river and secure their rights.
During the conference, the Colorado River Indian Tribes, the Gila River Indian Community and the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, which manages the Central Arizona Project, signed a major proclamation to work together to protect the Colorado River.
The Colorado River Indian Tribes is Arizona’s largest and most senior Colorado River water rights holder.
“All of us who live in Arizona, native and non-native alike, are connected by water, for without water, there is no life.  And it is that common thread that binds us, which has us here today, pledging to work together for the greater good of all who live in Arizona,” said Colorado River Indian Tribes Chairwoman Amelia Flores.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC08889-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 08:11:41.157980

The lieutenant governor presides over the Alabama Senate but has little power over the chamber. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)The Alabama lieutenant governor, constitutionally speaking, is like a bag of old phone charging cords.
You may need it one day. But it’s more likely to sit and do nothing.
Which is not to say the person occupying the office is powerless. The lieutenant governor has some appointments. He or she presides over the Senate and casts votes in the event of a deadlock. And should the governor leave office — legally or mortally — the lieutenant governor takes the job.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But for most occupants, it’s four or eight years of doing little but calling senators to order and reporting the outcome of votes.
The lieutenant governor, in effect, is a timekeeper with benefits. You could become governor. But you most likely won’t. It’s the vestigial tail of Alabama government.
Yet promising to sit better than your opponents doesn’t fly in a political campaign. So candidates for the office have to pretend its limitations don’t exist, or campaign on their personalities.
I’ll give Wes Allen this much: His campaign website for lieutenant governor seemingly acknowledges that fact. It has no issues section or platform. It’s just Allen and his far-right ideas, particularly when it comes to voting.
It’s the same thing with Agriculture and Industries Commissioner Rick Pate, another candidate for the office. The only suggestion policy on his site is a link to a story in which Pate says Trump’s tariffs on agriculture, which are terrible for farmers, are actually good for them.
There are other candidates with plans for the job. Patrick Bishop wants to “vigorously advocate for the equality of all Americans” (could be a tough sell in the Alabama GOP these days). Dean Odle has a lengthy article on his website about an alliance between Islam and communism (which probably would have used “Catholicism” in the place of “Islam” not too long ago). Nicole Wadsworth has a detailed issues page, but hardly anything on it is in the purview of the office she seeks.
Phillip Ensler, so far the sole Democratic candidate, says he would try to facilitate healthy debate in the chamber, in hopes of advancing legislation on issues like education and health care. He can do everything on the former, but it’s hard to see what effect he could have on the latter in a GOP-dominated Senate.
This will be a pattern over the next few months. Among Republicans, you’re going to see a lot of arguments over who loves President Donald Trump more and can act as the oracle of his will. They’re going to want you to think that they can remake education and the economy while asking the clerk to call the roll in the Senate.
And we’re going to see a lot of money spent on this timekeeping job. In 2018, the candidates for the office spent over $5 million on the race. Combined, Allen and Pate raised $1.3 million for the lieutenant governor contest by the end of November.
The lieutenant governor’s race, in that respect, is an estuary where the fresh water of political ambition meets the brackish waves of constitutional reality.
But it also reflects a broader disconnect between campaigning and governing in this state. Which we’re going to see a lot of in these midterm elections.
Tommy Tuberville’s gubernatorial campaign website leads with his promise to fight “woke ideology.” In Alabama, this has meant making teachers afraid to discuss Black history with students and having publicly subsidized come-aparts over rainbow flags.  He also wants to bring back manufacturing jobs, secure the border that’s some 675 miles away from Alabama, and improve education, somehow.
The thing, though, is that Tuberville won’t have the power to do any of that should he be elected governor. He’ll have a bully pulpit — emphasis on bully — for his obsessions. But Tuberville will learn, as other governors have, that power in the state resides in the Legislature.
But he’s not the only candidate who doesn’t seem up to speed on the state of things in Alabama. Jay Mitchell and Katherine Robertson’s attorney general campaigns leave one with the impression that A) Alabama’s immigration rates are high (they are lower than the national average), B) that immigration is inherently a problem and C) that Immigration and Customs Enforcement somehow needs their help to terrorize children and families.
Over in the secretary of state’s race — a campaign for an office that does little more than file papers — Caroleene Dobson and Andrew Sorrell want you to think election fraud, effectively nonexistent in Alabama, is a much bigger issue than election accessibility.
It’s this strange game we play. Candidates pick issues that have little valence in the state. Voters more affected by rising health care costs than “woke” largely let them get away with it, so long as they keep the right-wing catchphrases coming. And for four years after electing them, we lament that the state government doesn’t do anything.
Most of those offices have more power than the lieutenant governor does. But like that old bag of charging cords, they seem to be a poor fit for our present needs.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Leg-7173-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 08:11:41.157980
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-05 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Is Congress facing another shutdown threat? Here’s what to know.,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/05/congress-federal-shutdown-january-2026/,"Funding for much of the federal government runs out Jan. 30. If Congress doesn't approve a deal by then, it could lead to a partial shutdown.","After a record-long government shutdown that ended in November, Congress faces another funding deadline just two months later.
Federal lawmakers are trying to avoid another closure that would lead to furloughs of thousands of federal workers and a pause in some government operations. But the consequences wouldn’t likely be as significant as the one in the fall because a few agencies already have full-year funding through the end of September.
Funding standoffs are becoming increasingly common, and the government has been operating for a while on short-term bills to keep things running at current levels. And that has left Congress more susceptible to shutdown threats.
With lawmakers returning from the holiday recess this week, they have a short window to strike a funding deal on an appropriations package for the rest of fiscal year 2026 or opt to pass another short-term bill to give them more time for negotiations.
If they are unable to approve any funding fix by the end of the month, the government could fall into a partial shutdown.
Here’s where things currently stand.
Why is government funding running out in January?
Congress set the next funding deadline for Jan. 30 as part of a bipartisan deal that reopened the government in mid-November.
Members passed three of the 12 full-year spending bills that fund specific government agencies for fiscal year 2026: military construction projects and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, and the Legislative Branch which keeps Congress operating. Those funds will last until Sept. 30, which is the end of the federal fiscal year.
Meanwhile, the rest of the government agencies are operating on flat funding that will expire at the end of January.
Congress will either need to pass the remaining nine spending bills that’ll keep the rest of the government funded through September or pass another short-term measure known as a continuing resolution.
Will they meet the deadline to avert a shutdown?
Congress will be tasked with finishing up a broader funding deal with less than a month until the deadline.
Negotiations were underway before the holiday break and will ramp back up again for the next three weeks that Congress is in session in January.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, will play a major role in those negotiations. She’s the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, which crafts and negotiates spending legislation.
Leaders are hopeful they can broker a deal with new topline numbers. But if an agreement on a funding package doesn’t come together, Congress will likely resort to a continuing resolution that’ll keep funding going for a shorter period of time. But passage of that type of legislation isn’t guaranteed either.
Even if funding were to lapse again, it wouldn’t be like last year’s 43-day shutdown.
Some programs that were suspended in the fall, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, wouldn’t be in jeopardy again. That’s because Congress already approved full-year funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees federal nutrition assistance.
Will health care play a role again? 
During the funding standoff in the fall, congressional Democrats made health care one of the central demands to earn their votes. Because of narrow majorities in Congress, Republicans needed Democratic votes at least in the Senate to pass any funding bills.
The debate revolved around the extension of enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans. With the expiration of those pandemic-era tax credits after Dec. 31, premiums are set to spike for many this year who get their coverage through the state’s marketplace, Access Health CT.
Democrats, including Connecticut’s congressional delegation, have said they’ll keep fighting for the renewal of those expired subsidies that had been in place since 2021.
But it is unclear if the party will once again tie the tax credits to funding the government at the end of January, though they could make new demands.
Separately from government funding, various groups of lawmakers are seeking a legislative solution to bring back the subsidies, though likely with some limits.
And the House is expected to take up Democrats’ three-year extension after the party and four Republicans forced the issue through a procedural tool called a discharge petition. Because lawmakers collected 218 signatures, it triggers a vote on the House floor.
Even if it passes the House this month, Senate GOP leadership is unlikely to take it up. A vote on the three-year subsidy extension failed to advance in the Senate last month.
Will CT secure the rest of its congressional earmarks?
Connecticut’s congressional delegation scored some of its funding requests for local projects for the first time in years.
That’s because earmarks — now known as congressionally directed spending in the Senate and community project funding in the House — usually only get approved in full-year spending bills.
Lawmakers are able to make requests with some limitations that typically get steered toward pet projects in their states. Connecticut’s delegation has sought funding for infrastructure and environmental investments, social services for families and children, affordable housing and upgrades for police departments and emergency units.
Connecticut’s share of approved earmarks were part of the three full-year spending bills that passed in November to end the shutdown. But dozens of other earmarks requests are in limbo.
If Congress can pass some or all of the remaining nine funding bills this month, Connecticut will secure funding for its other initiatives that amount to tens of millions of dollars. Lawmakers in the state sought at least $177 million in earmarks for FY 2026.
But if the government stays open through a short-term fix, funding for those local projects are unlikely to materialize. Lawmakers will be able to make new earmarks requests later in the year for fiscal year 2027.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25274456520062-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:57:42.254403

Industry groups and climate advocates anxiously await the $126 million initiative. But the state lawmakers who championed it say it’s taken far too long to come online. […],"Freightliner eCascadia electric trucks used in a Coca-Cola Bottling fleet are pictured in 2023. (Photo courtesy of Daimler Truck AG)Washington is close to opening a new incentive program for commercial fleet operators to transition trucks and other vehicles to models that run on electric or hydrogen power.
Industry groups and climate advocates anxiously await the $126 million initiative. But the state lawmakers who championed it say it’s taken far too long to come online.
The transportation sector is the biggest driver of Washington’s carbon emissions. Exhaust from big trucks and buses makes up a disproportionate share of those emissions, and diesel air pollution can be especially unhealthy.
To help combat this, the Washington Zero-Emission Incentive Program, or WAZIP, is expected to launch in the spring.
“We are very eager for WAZIP to launch as soon as possible,” said Leah Missik, the Washington legislative director for environmental advocacy group Climate Solutions. “We know from the experience in other states and even from the experience of people who’ve been able to get clean trucks here in Washington that this program will help drivers and businesses save money, and it will benefit communities.”
Washington has already made some progress.
In 2024, nearly one in five new medium- and heavy-duty vehicles sold in Washington ran on zero-emission technology, according to the state Department of Ecology. Though the adoption rate varies depending on the type. Heavier trucks are harder to come by than, for example, electric delivery vans. Think of Amazon’s ubiquitous Rivian vans.
Heavy trucks, on the other hand, remain prohibitively expensive for many companies, while lacking public charging infrastructure, industry groups say. And they can’t go nearly as far on a charge as their diesel-fueled counterparts, not to mention they’re much heavier.
The city of Seattle has tried its own incentive program offering up to $180,000 for Class 8 heavy-duty trucks to serve the Port of Seattle. But even with that sweetener, operators found the transition still unfeasible financially.
Instead, the city in October partnered with a company called Zeem Solutions to distribute $1.5 million to drayage operators. It follows more than $5 million that the Northwest Seaport Alliance gave the company over the summer for a commercial fleet charging depot in the city of SeaTac.
But while Washington state moves ahead, the federal government has looked to slow the transition. 
Washington has been following the lead of California in its push toward zero-emission vehicles. California has a unique ability to set emission rules that go further than federal guidelines, and other states can pick between the two. Washington has been following California’s stricter standards. 
But Congress this year repealed California’s opportunity to set those standards. States, including Washington, have sued the federal government over the move.
One of those rules pushes manufacturers to up their sales of zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks over time. The move by Congress and approved by President Donald Trump offers a “slight ease of pressure” on the trucking industry, said Sheri Call, president and CEO of the Washington Trucking Associations.
“But it also doesn’t mean that we don’t want to continue the conversation about what industry can do today,” Call continued, “because we do have members who are motivated to reduce their carbon footprint. They just need workable solutions to do so.”
The local trucking industry is also grappling with the Trump administration’s cancellation of federal money meant to fuel a hub of hydrogen development in the region, which aimed to help develop cleaner semitrucks, among other things. Call said this is “very promising technology for the industry, especially in the heavy truck space.”
How will it work?
The WAZIP program is funded by proceeds from the state’s carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act. 
It’ll offer $82 million in vouchers for on-road vehicles, $20 million for off-road equipment, like forklifts and farm equipment. It’ll also have $10 million reserved for small businesses.
For example, buyers of a zero-emission Class 4 medium-duty truck weighing between 14,001 pounds and 16,000 pounds could get $60,000 off at the point of sale, though the final voucher amounts aren’t yet finalized. The vouchers, which increase based on weight, cover electric and hydrogen fuel cell technology.
For reference, a Class 4 diesel truck costs around $60,000 while the electric version is roughly $160,000, according to John Barnes, of TEC Equipment. Diesel Class 8 trucks cost $160,000 compared to $600,000 for electrics.
Voucher applicants can also ask for more money to install charging infrastructure, a major barrier to transitioning to zero-emission vehicles for both businesses and individuals. 
The hope is that trucking companies can get assistance with upfront costs to transition toward electric, then reap the benefits of reduced fuel costs over time.
“I cannot understate the importance of it in terms of hitting our climate targets, but also helping people save money over the long run,” Missik said.
Some businesses will be eligible for even more savings. They include those with under $10 million in annual revenue and those certified as an emerging or rising business by the state’s Office of Women and Minority Owned Business Enterprises. Drayage operators, veteran-owned businesses, nonprofits and public agencies also qualify. 
In the Class 4 example, these purchasers could get an extra $10,000 off.
Businesses can also buy converted or used vehicles with vouchers of reduced value.
The initiative is modeled on similar efforts in California, where a truck incentive program has given out roughly 15,000 vouchers totaling over $1.6 billion in savings in the past 15 years.
Call and Missik both expect WAZIP to be very popular.
What’s taking so long?
But those leading the charge for WAZIP’s creation think it should already be up and running. 
State House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, said it should’ve started up at least six months ago. His counterpart in the Senate agrees.
“The governor’s office and the Department of Transportation know that I’m not satisfied by how long it’s taken to get this done,” Fey said. “It’s beyond the point now that my patience is about done with this.”
In response, the state Department of Transportation noted “this is a complex program that WSDOT needs to ensure is developed and administered properly, because significant state resources are involved.”
“This work includes custom software to meet Washington’s unique needs,” spokesperson Barbara LaBoe said in an email. “WSDOT is working diligently to deliver the program as quickly as possible, while maintaining the high standards for compliance and usability that are required.”

(Photo by Donna Gordon Blankinship)When Cadence was deciding which 8th grade classes to take at Maywood Middle School, a couple of things influenced the 14-year-old’s choices. 
“I don’t like ELA,” she said, referring to English Language Arts, the term schools use these days for reading and writing. 
So Cadence chose to spend part of her day in Issaquah School District’s experimental microschool, which combines science and English with a focus on the environment, and an emphasis on hands-on learning.
On a recent Friday afternoon, Cadence and her classmates were conducting an experiment to better understand radiation, using skittles and math — and both reading and writing. Earlier in the period, she participated in a class review session employing both writing and conversation. And her class also spoke briefly about the book they had been reading about the groundbreaking chemist and physicist Marie Curie.
In other words, her teacher, Valerie Buck, weaves reading and writing into every day and every project, with or without Cadence and her classmates realizing. It’s a creative approach to meeting students where they are academically.
Customizing education to the needs of individual students is not new. Research has shown for decades that every child requires a slightly different path to academic success. But most schools find it easier to talk about than to actually do in large classes during short class periods.
Issaquah’s microschool program is just one notable example where a Washington school is working hard to overcome those obstacles. Creativity in educational programs appears — in my limited view — to be growing again in these post-pandemic years. Microschools are one option.
Some consider microschools, which are more popular on the East Coast, a leftover from the pandemic. Some families who felt online learning wasn’t working formed their own learning “pods,” where students could both quarantine and learn.
The Maywood program doesn’t exactly fit the microschool model, because it’s not an all-day, standalone program. But it has many of the elements: It is small (50 total students in two classes) and different and has a focus on personalized learning.
Students opted into the program, which the school views, in part, as a way to get them ready for the project-based learning approach at a district high school. Building community is another major goal in Buck’s classroom and another emphasis at many microschools.
The Issaquah project is not offered as an all-day standalone program, although that is a goal, because school officials could not cobble together enough money to launch a larger pilot.
They are lucky to have enough space — tucked away from regular classes — to give them the feeling of being special and unique. And this corner of Maywood has a couple more empty classrooms just begging to be filled with an expanded program, which Buck said would allow them more time for hands-on learning.
Buck chose to focus on the Salish Sea and sustainability and has integrated community service projects to add real-life experience. For example, students did a water use study about shorter showers and visited the Gates Foundation to learn about water and toilets.
“I think it’s important because kids really need purpose with what they’re learning,” Buck said.

Penelope, 13, agreed. “It seemed more interesting than normal classes,” she said between counting “radioactive” skittles in Buck’s class. “You get to do nice hands-on things, which is fun.”
Julia Bamba, the microschool principal who oversees special projects and innovation for the district, said Issaquah started experimenting with alternative school models because they wanted to give students more control over their learning.
The district takes a slow and steady approach to innovation, starting with prototypes that are thoroughly tested before scaling. It’s not good enough for the innovations to meet student desire for variety (or more science and less language arts); they also must meet the district’s high academic standards, Bamba said.
She pointed to a few other public school programs that both inspired Issaquah and keep them thinking about how they can innovate.
Big Picture Learning is a network of schools across the nation and in Washington that emphasizes student-directed learning. And Tacoma Public Schools has become a center for creativity through a maritime education partnership with the Port of Tacoma, and by providing numerous ways students can earn college credit while still in high school. 
‘Customer’ focus and creativity in Spokane
One of my favorite examples of school innovation is Spokane Public Schools. A recent conversation with Kristin Whiteaker, who is director of charter schools, satellite schools and program support for the district, revealed there’s more going on in Spokane than I was aware of.
You may remember that when Washington state started experimenting with charter schools, Spokane was the only district that decided to embed that choice inside their public school walls. But they’ve done a lot more. They not only provided intentional remote learning years before the pandemic, they have strengthened and grown their online school since then. Spokane Virtual Learning welcomes students from across the state and has higher graduation rates (88% in four years) than a lot of regular public schools.
Spokane offers many other choices from the school innovation checklist: Dual-language immersion in Spanish and English, project-based learning, a parent-teacher cooperative model, special resources for homeschool families, a biomedical institute, a standalone highly capable program, and a Montessori school. Spokane also has district-wide school choice so students and families can choose which program is best for them.
Why so many choices? That’s what the community wanted, Whiteaker said.
While many districts across Washington lost enrollment during and after the pandemic, Spokane didn’t. Whiteaker credits their “customer” focus and ongoing academic success.
“We’re constantly surveying families to ask questions about what their interests are and what their perspectives are before we make decisions,” she said.
Whiteaker emphasized that Spokane isn’t just interested in creativity, but academic success.
“We lead with data and research and have a focus on best practices,” she said, adding, “And the heart. Care that comes from the heart is part of our culture.”
They don’t have a microschool, but I’m guessing that’s because Spokane parents haven’t heard of them yet.
An evolving trend
Microschools most closely resemble one-room schoolhouses, although they usually have more than one room. But the idea is the same: small school, multi-aged classes, hands-on, differentiated learning. The concept blossomed during and after the pandemic, but existed well before. 
Their size makes the economics more difficult than the academics, and state regulations can also be a stumbling block. A few states have passed laws giving microschools the right to exist, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. Other states, including Oregon, Illinois and Massachusetts, require hybrid authorization similar to private schools.
Many microschools in other states (and potentially in Washington) operate under homeschool laws or as private schools. A 2025 report from the National Microschooling Center estimates that between 750,000 and 2.1 million students attend microschools in the U.S. They are in every state as well as Washington, D.C., and nearly half were founded by parents.
Sixty-one percent of microschools nationally get their funding from tuition, while 38% get at least some of their money from state school choice dollars, such as vouchers. Ten percent get regular public school or charter school funding.
A Washington proposal to establish a pilot project to authorize certified teachers to operate microschools failed to pass during the 2022 legislative session. But districts and private schools are allowed to experiment with the model under existing laws.
Tailored approach
Another Washington microschool, the Kineo School in Kirkland, is private, tuition-funded and designed to serve a neurodivergent student population. It has a multi-age classroom and operates as a one-room schoolhouse for children in kindergarten through third grade. 
Flexibility and personalization are two main values at Kineo, explained school Director Elizabeth Kent. Everyone learns at their own pace and in small groups based on ability, not age.
Kineo and other microschools are not for everyone, Kent said. Children who thrive in larger social groups do better at larger schools. But the benefits outweigh the disadvantages for some children, such as individualized learning, which is much harder to do in a regular classroom of 30 kids with one teacher.
“I don’t know how teachers can work with large groups of students and tailor things,” Kent said.
But Kineo’s low student-teacher ratio — 10 students with two teachers, plus specialists like occupational and speech therapists — comes with a hefty price tag of about $26,000 a year. Kent said that’s about middle of the road for private schools in the area. 
The school was bigger before a large group of students graduated. Kent said they hope to grow again, but won’t go above 40 or 50 students in a few class groups.
Kent said size is an important element of a microschool, but other things, like community and personalized learning, are what make the schools special.
“Meeting individual student needs is huge. I do think you can do that with a traditional program,” she said. “What doesn’t work is if a family expectation doesn’t align with what the school is offering. It’s just not enough to desire a small school.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microschools2-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:11:40.842920

Photo by Tony Webster.Minnesota already gets more than half of its electricity from wind, solar, nuclear and other resources that don’t emit planet-warming carbon dioxide or air pollutants that harm human health. Power plants here emit 50% less greenhouse gas than 20 years ago, according to Clean Energy Economy Minnesota.
Under state law, Minnesota’s power sector needs to go 100% clean by 2040, and there’s a sense among state policymakers, utility leaders and energy system experts that the easy part may soon be over.
Energy system modelers say efforts to reduce power emissions become costlier and more logistically challenging as the grid reorients around weather-dependent renewables. Adding more of what’s known as “clean firm” resources like nuclear, geothermal, hydropower, gas plants with carbon capture, and long-duration batteries — plus more high-voltage power lines — can address what Deloitte researchers call “the last 20%” problem.
The challenge for Minnesota is that these resources all have their own tradeoffs. Policymakers, utilities, labor and host communities appear far from consensus around the best path forward — particularly when it comes to nuclear power plants, which Minnesota law prohibits building more of.
Not fast enough?

The “carbon intensity” of the Minnesota power grid ticked down another 4% in 2024 as utilities and energy developers added more renewable power, Clean Energy Economy Minnesota said in April.
The poster child for those efforts is Xcel Energy’s multiyear plan for the Sherco power plant, which by early next decade is set to host enough carbon-free power to replace most of its retiring coal units’ output. State regulators have approved a host of other clean energy projects over the past two years, including 910 megawatts’ worth — nearly the output of a full-size nuclear power plant — in a two-month span this summer.
For now, utility leaders, regulators and policymakers say Minnesota remains on track to meet its statutory obligation for 100% carbon-free power by 2040, but with a major caveat: electric vehicles, data centers and new industrial loads are pushing electricity demand upward. If built, Minnesota’s dozen or so large data center proposals would consume more power than every home in the state, according to the Star Tribune.
“Solar and wind aren’t going to do everything on their own. Yes, we are building out renewables, but not at the rate our demand for electricity is increasing,” said Rep. Spencer Igo, a third-term Republican who represents part of the Iron Range, at an October forum hosted by the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance.
The long-range plans filed by Minnesota’s two biggest for-profit utilities show firm resources like gas plants accounting for a significant share of new additions to the grid over the next decade-plus. Minnesota Power, now majority-owned by the private equity firm BlackRock, wants to add 750 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity to replace a coal power plant set to retire by 2035. Xcel Energy would deploy nearly 3,000 megawatts of batteries and “firm dispatchable” power to its system in the 2030s after adding 420 megawatts of gas at a new southwestern Minnesota power plant later this decade.
Xcel and Minnesota Power say their new gas plants would run only as needed to make up for temporary energy shortfalls caused by high power demand or periods of low wind. And Xcel is designing its Lyon County gas plant to run on a mix of at least 30% hydrogen, which does not emit greenhouse gases when burned and can be produced with carbon-free electricity (or possibly mined from natural reserves).
But in its most recent long-range plan, Xcel admits that squeezing all the greenhouse gas emissions out of its Upper Midwest grid — which covers parts of the Dakotas, Wisconsin and upper Michigan — will require “ingenuity, new technologies, and transmission.”
Leading contenders
None of those new technologies is perfect.
Geothermal power, which taps naturally occurring heat deep underground, has managed to unite environmentalists on the left with MAGA types on the right. That includes former fracking executive and now Energy Secretary Chris Wright. But even the “enhanced” geothermal systems being commercialized across the western United States today are no match for Minnesota’s stable geology, which makes getting the power out of the ground that much more difficult
Another technology that involves drilling thousands of feet into bedrock is carbon capture and sequestration. In theory, any carbon-emitting power plant could retrofit its exhaust system to absorb, liquefy and inject most of its greenhouse gas emissions deep underground.

Like geothermal power, however, long-term carbon storage requires specific subsurface conditions absent in Minnesota and much of the Midwest. Most power plants in the region would thus need to tie into yet-to-be-built pipelines like the long-planned Summit network, which would pipe carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Minnesota and four neighboring states to a storage site in western North Dakota.
Summit’s future is uncertain due to a recent regulatory setback in South Dakota and opposition from property owners regionwide. Even if it moves ahead, it will cost billions and take years to bring online. Perhaps more appealing is the potential for captured carbon to be used as an input for locally made “e-fuels” that could one day replace petroleum-based fuels for airplanes, ships and other heavy vehicles — if the economics ever make sense.
Theo Keith, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, said Minnesota’s biggest investor-owned electric utility is taking a wait-and-see approach. Xcel doesn’t currently have plans for carbon capture and doesn’t think it’s needed to reach the 2040 goal, but it “could play a role in the future of clean energy as the technology improves and the cost comes down,” he said.
Then there’s long-duration energy storage, a grab-bag of surprisingly low-tech solutions that deliver power for at least 10 hours.
Some, like the iron-air batteries Great River Energy plans to power up next year, can discharge at full capacity for several days on end. While the lithium-ion batteries dominating the grid are now cheap enough to enable 24/7 solar power in sunnier parts of the world, they may never be economical for riding out the multi-day stretches of low sun and wind Minnesota sees every winter.
Long-duration energy storage could help. But it faces its own technical and economic challenges, particularly around energy losses during charging and discharging, said Kevin Pranis, marketing manager for Laborers International in Minnesota and North Dakota. Pranis’ union hosted the October nuclear forum.
“If you only get half your energy back, it costs twice as much to run,” he said. “I could see iron-air batteries totally transforming the world and eclipsing everything else — or not.” (Coal, gas and nuclear power plants also lose a lot of energy when converting heat to electricity.)
Efficiency is one thing nearly everyone involved in Minnesota energy policy agrees on, even if they emphasize different aspects.
The controversial bill that extended key tax breaks for data centers this year also requires large-scale computing facilities to pay up to $5 million annually into a home weatherization fund for lower-income Minnesotans. Sen. Nick Frentz, a Mankato Democrat who supported the bill, said that provision would reduce customers’ electric bills and relieve stress on the grid itself.
“I’m surprised how little attention that feature is getting,” he said. “The less energy these houses use, the less pressure on our grid…it’s a big win.”

Meanwhile, DFL Reps. Larry Kraft and Kari Rehrauer want Xcel Energy and other Minnesota utilities to develop “virtual power plants” to offset 10% of their electric demand within three years.
Virtual power plants use home batteries, thermostats and other small-scale energy resources to alleviate grid constraints on the relatively rare occasions — typically on the hottest summer days — when power demand pushes the otherwise overbuilt grid to its limit. They’re far cheaper than conventional power plants, can be deployed in months rather than years, and help get more out of the existing grid without expensive new infrastructure, said George Damian, director of government affairs for Clean Energy Economy Minnesota.
“We have a system that we’ve already paid for…(so) how can we operate it better,” Damian said.
The nuclear option
Some say Minnesota’s grid would operate better if it had more nuclear power — the one resource it’s not allowed to add courtesy of a 30-year-old legislative moratorium.
At the October forum, speakers hailed the economic and environmental benefits of nuclear power. Nuclear plants employ twice as many people as similarly-sized coal plants. They pay better than most other energy employers. They’re cleaner, even considering the issue of waste storage. They’re usually the biggest taxpayers in their communities: Xcel’s Prairie Island nuclear plant accounts for 54% of Red Wing’s city tax base and 40% of its school district’s tax base, according to an analysis by Center for Energy and the Environment. And despite high construction costs, they may actually reduce the long-run cost of reaching 100% clean power.
“Eighty to 85% of the electricity we are going to need will come from tools we already have,” like wind, solar, batteries and high-voltage transmission, said Michael Noble, former executive director of St. Paul-based Fresh Energy. But “if we rely on (them) to do 100% of the job, we’re going to pay way too much for electricity…we need firm power that you can turn on when you need it,” he added.
Noble said he was motivated to speak publicly for the first time about his support for nuclear power because after decades of dithering, the industry “has its act together enough to build new nuclear.”
Dozens of startups have designs for “small modular” nuclear plants they say are safer and cheaper to build than the full-size reactors operating today. So do a handful of better-known companies, like GE and Rolls-Royce. And after 30 years during which the United States added virtually no nuclear capacity, two full-size reactors powered up earlier this decade in Georgia.
The Trump administration is all-in on nuclear. Wright, the secretary of the Department of Energy, sat on the board of well-connected nuclear startup Oklo before taking his current job. In the year since, he has reduced his department’s support for renewables while putting billions toward nuclear, geothermal and fossil fuels.
President Trump himself could reap billions from the proposed merger of his social media company and another startup aiming to commercialize nuclear fusion, a nascent technology that futurists hope ushers in an era of cheap, near-limitless energy without the long-lived radioactive waste.
Minnesota nuclear proponents want the state to lift its moratorium — the country’s strongest — and join the party. Other Midwestern states — including Democratic leaning states — have done the same: Wisconsin in 2016, Illinois just this year. If Minnesota doesn’t act soon, the long-awaited nuclear construction boom could pass it by, said Aaron Rosenthal, research director for North Star Policy Action.
“As other states have taken action on this…Minnesota is increasingly the outlier,” Rosenthal said at the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance forum. Rosenthal was the sole credited author on a pro-nuclear policy paper distributed at the event.
A Republican-led effort to repeal the nuclear construction ban came up short in the 2025 legislative session, but lawmakers are likely to try again in 2026 as development-hungry Greater Minnesota communities turn up the pressure. A coalition of 18 rural counties joined the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance in October, followed by future Xcel gas plant host Lyon County in November.
Arguments against new nuclear plants emphasize high construction costs and long build times. The two new Georgia reactors came in seven years late and $17 billion over budget, double the initial estimate. North America’s first small modular reactor, in Ontario, looks more expensive than expected, too. Proponents say costs will come down as more plants get built, citing the “learning curves” that have made wind, solar and now batteries competitive with fossil fuels; skeptics aren’t so sure.
But that debate is almost a sideshow in Minnesota. Here, any successful effort to lift the moratorium runs through the Prairie Island Indian Community, which remains opposed. In the 1970s, an Xcel predecessor company kept the tribe in the dark as it built the Prairie Island nuclear plant on its doorstep. Since the 1990s, amid a federal stalemate on long-term nuclear waste storage, radioactive spent fuel has accumulated at the site over what Rosenthal’s paper called “explicit tribal objections.” At the forum, Igo called the tribe’s treatment “horribly wrong.”
It’s an existential issue for a community whose federal recognition is tied to that particular piece of land, said Blake Johnson, the tribe’s government relations specialist.
“If something were to happen that made us evacuate and not able to return, we don’t exist as a tribe…there is still no solution to the waste that sits 700 yards from our people,” he said at the forum. The tribe’s consultations with legislators last session failed to yield a breakthrough, he added.
Igo said he would keep trying.
“We are going to move forward together or we’re not going to move forward,” he said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24077210421_cc6f35e9aa_o-1024x646.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:11:40.842920

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)With 2026 already underway, there are a few faces we are watching in state government. Will Indiana’s Senate Republican leader face pushback from his own caucus?  Will Democrats break through in a statewide race?
Here are five Hoosier politicos who could have an interesting year:
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray: The leader of the Senate has taken national heat for his role in the defeat of the redistricting bill. When the president of the United States is taking your name in vain, it’s not a great day. So, the question is what happens next? He isn’t up for re-election until 2028, so the primary threats are mitigated in his case. But does he still control his fractured caucus? Theoretically anyone could challenge him for his leadership post but if the redistricting vote is an indicator, Bray has the necessary support to remain. A bigger concern is his relationship with Gov. Mike Braun and House Speaker Todd Huston — both big supporters of the map redraw.

Braun has been especially upset that the Senate, at least initially, ignored his special session call. Bray reversed course and the public vote was a bit embarrassing for Braun given that Republicans have a supermajority in both legislative chambers. If Braun wants his legislative agenda to move, he will have to temper that anger. Meanwhile, Bray and Huston work closely on virtually every topic going through the General Assembly and must maintain that relationship to get past intraparty squabbles.
Speaking of Braun, he is our next person to watch. And he needs some solid wins.
In 2025, he did secure some property tax relief for Hoosiers — up to $300 for many  — but the final product was far afield from his original proposal. And we all know how redistricting went.

So, what can we expect from Braun in 2026? It’s a little unclear. His office hasn’t unveiled a specific legislative agenda even as the session resumes. And it’s ending in late February, meaning there isn’t much time to get substantive proposals done.
Braun told the Indiana Capital Chronicle he wants to focus on health care costs but didn’t give any examples of how that would occur. Lawmakers have been working on health care for several years and have a bit of fatigue on the topic.
The governor will likely face an interstate tolling debate in 2026 as the state looks for more revenue to maintain and upgrade highways. One area he is poised for big wins is on the utility front. But only if the new regulators he has named to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission come through — blocking rate hikes and generally tapping the brakes on utility profits.
For the first time in a decade, Hoosiers will see the Bayh name back on a statewide ballot. But it’s not Evan Bayh — Indiana’s former governor and U.S. senator. Instead, it’s his son Beau Bayh, a lawyer and Marine Corps captain running for secretary of state.

The 30-year-old Democrat has been on the campaign trail for months, meeting with potential voters in diners and gyms around the state. And he’s been raising money — lots of it. Since he formally launched his campaign in October, he has already raised over $1 million in large donations.
He must get past Blythe Potter at the Democratic state convention in June — a small businesswoman with her own military service record — if he wants to take on Republican Diego Morales in November. If Beau Bayh doesn’t beat Morales, who has had numerous missteps in office, Indiana Democrats will be demoralized.
Beau Bayh does have one Achilles heel — while born in Indiana he has lived most of his life on the East Coast. That was due to his father serving in the U.S. Senate and then he attended college and law school at Harvard. Republicans will use that to label him an outsider.
The race I’m most interested in this year is that of Fort Wayne Republican Sen. Liz Brown. It’s a fascinating look at how GOP politics have split in Indiana — with longtime Republicans now considered not conservative enough if they buck the party line even a little.
Brown has been one of the most strident anti-abortion voices in the state and a reliable Republican since she came to the Indiana Senate in 2015. But she got crossways with a few GOP stalwarts — including U.S. Sen. Jim Banks and Attorney General Todd Rokita. That’s because she refused to hear an immigration crackdown bill last year that she thought needed too much work.
Before that she voted against a bill to eliminate firearm licensing requirement and another banning transgender Hoosiers from high school sports.
Banks and Rokita recruited a primary challenger — well-known Allen County politico Darren Vogt.
Brown was among the most vocal in support of the recent move to redistrict Indiana’s congressional districts, and resigned a Senate leadership post in frustration. Bray later took away her Judiciary Committee chairmanship.
The last B to watch for is Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith. That’s because he is always making news, but not necessarily for the best of reasons.
Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith speaks at a pro-redistricting rally at the Indiana Statehouse on Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
In 2025, he had his share of controversy. From buying a luxury SUV to firing an employee who later alleged some members of the staff watched an AI-generated-porn video in the office. His employees regularly closed the Statehouse office in the summer, too. And his close friend and pastor is facing a sex scandal at his church.
Plus, Beckwith said the 3/5 compromise was a good thing and received a reprimand from Senate leadership. He often butts heads with Braun — most recently saying the Trump administration threatened federal funding for Indiana before deleting the his tweet.
It’s unclear what to expect from Beckwith in 2026 because he doesn’t follow any government or political norms. Which is just the way he likes it.

A mix of corporate donors, small-dollar contributors and others with big pockets – that latter of which appear to be pulling for Democratic U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham and Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake.
As the new year begins, the 2026 primary season is in full swing, and the top three U.S. Senate candidates on the Democratic side of the aisle each have millions of dollars to play with as they march toward August 4, the date on which voters will choose party nominees for the November general election.
The same can be said of Republican Mike Rogers, who is also sitting on a mound of cash given to him by wealthy donors throughout 2025, giving him a steep advantage as a candidate who is already maneuvering like he’s in the general election race.
Year-end 2025 campaign finance reports aren’t due until the end of January, which will detail spending between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 while also wrapping up the contribution and spending totals for the previous year. 
Reports that are available show that each of the three major players on the Democratic side of the race are in a tight race money wise, with Stevens having the advantage, but mostly due to campaign committee transfers she infused into her Senate bid from her congressional committee.
What’s more interesting, however, is where that money is coming from and who’s giving it.
Stevens flush with larger donor cash, some from large corporations
Stevens raised $4.72 million between April and October 2025, with $3.11 million coming from direct individual, organization and PAC contributions. The transfer from her congressional committee totaled $1.53 million.
Federal Election Commission reports show that Stevens also received $6,000 from the Blue Michigan PAC, which is supporting her campaign. Bridge Michigan reported that the group has also spent significant money on text message support for Stevens.
She spent $2.6 million up until Oct. 1, and ended the quarter with $2.6 million cash on hand, putting her in a strong spot as the candidates move into the heart of primary season.

Part of that had to do with her larger dollar donations from wealthy individuals. FEC data shows that the largest share of Stevens’ fundraising haul came from donations of $2,000 or more ($1.79 million) and donations of $1,000 to $1,999 ($751,316).
Public FEC reports also show that Stevens has amassed tens of thousands of dollars from multiple large corporations, including:

Amazon and Blue Origin PAC, owned by Amazon chief Jeff Bezos (a combined $39,000);
Google’s NetPAC ($11,500);
FedEx PAC ($23,000);
Delta Airlines PAC ($35,000);
the Boeing Company PAC ($13,500);
Norfolk Southern Corporation’s Good Government Fund ($1,000);
Walmart’s PAC For Good Government ($24,000);
DoorDash’s DashPAC ($5,900);
The McDonald’s Corporation PAC ($3,000);
Charter/Spectrum’s PAC ($18,000); and
Nucor Corporation PAC ($15,000)

Each of the companies have a history of reportedly questionable labor practices and union-busting activity.
Stevens has positioned herself as a strong supporter of unions throughout her career in Congress, introducing labor-focused legislation in the House, and has racked up various endorsements from unions like the  Teamsters Local 243, UNITE Here Local 24, Pipefitters, Steamfitters, Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Service Local Union 636, and IronWorkers Local 25.
Rogers raised less than his rivals in the bulk of 2025, but with billionaire support
Not to be outdone, Rogers raised $3.41 million, but only $1.87 million of that came from direct contributions. Bridge Michigan also reported that some of his fundraising haul came from the “Team Rogers” joint fundraising committee.

Rogers’ total fundraising haul was also aided by a nearly $1.5 million transfer from other committees, including Team Rogers.
Rogers spent $966,938 in the first two quarters of 2025, and owes nearly $6,000 in debt owed to his campaign.
That leaves Rogers with $2.7 million cash on hand.
Rogers is also sitting on $5 million donated to the Great Lakes Conservative Fund super-PAC supporting his bid from Tim Dunn, a Texas oil billionaire with deep ties to the Christian Nationalist movement and a rising presence in the national GOP scene.

The Gander also reported that Team Rogers accepted a $12,000 contribution from John W. Childs, a billionaire megadonor who was charged in 2019 with soliciting prostitution in a Florida massage parlor sting.
Rogers’ only rival for the GOP nomination is former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Bernadette Smith, who entered the race in late November, too late for mandatory fundraising reports.   
McMorrow and El-Sayed trailing, but not far behind
McMorrow, who announced her candidacy in March 2025, raised $3.85 million through October, amassing a greater share of dollars than Stevens did in total direct contributions at $3.82 million. McMorrow also had zero transfers from previous campaign committees.
She did, however, spend $2.4 million. That leaves McMorrow with $1.45 million cash on hand, but with zero debt owed to her campaign.
Unlike Stevens, McMorrow’s largest share of contributions came from people giving $200 or less ($2.08 million), but McMorrow’s second largest share of donations came from the $2,000 or more category ($899,772).

El-Sayed has been trailing his Democratic primary rivals in fundraising, but not by much.
He raised $3.57 million up until October with $3.56 million coming from direct contributions, still more than Stevens but not as much as McMorrow. El-Sayed spent $1.72 million up until October, the least of the three candidates.
Like Stevens, El-Sayed’s largest donation category came from those giving $2,000 or more ($1.6 million), but his second largest portion of his overall contributions came from the $200 and under club ($961,749).

Becky Currie will try again in the coming legislative session to push through Mississippi prison health care reforms. 
A similar effort by the Republican chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee fizzled and died in in last year’s session.   
In an interview outlining her plans, Currie said she will introduce legislation based on findings gleaned from numerous tours of Mississippi’s prisons as well as instances of alleged denial of medical care documented by Mississippi Today. 
The findings have come to light as the state continues to direct hundreds of millions a year to a private medical contractor, VitalCore Health Strategies. 
“We’ve got to give patients – I call them patients because when you’re sick, you’re a patient no matter where you are – we’ve got to give them the care that the taxpayers have already paid for,” Currie said. 

Mississippi Today’s “Behind Bars, Beyond Care” series has documented alleged routine denial of health care in Mississippi prisons: potentially thousands of people living with hepatitis C going without treatment, an untreated broken arm that resulted in amputation and delayed cancer screenings one woman said led to a terminal diagnosis. One ex-corrections official said people are experiencing widespread medical neglect in Mississippi’s prisons, and revealed internal communications between department officials lamenting the quality of care provided by VitalCore.
During the 2025 legislative session, Currie took to the floor of the Mississippi House and presented a wide-ranging list of examples that she said showed inadequate medical care in state prisons. In some cases the lack of care resulted in unnecessary suffering and death, she said.
Many of the issues have been allowed to persist because the state Department of Corrections is policing its own provision of health care at prisons, Currie said. 
Currie last year drafted a bill that introduced numerous reforms, including giving authority to the Mississippi Department of Health to review prison health care and make policy changes. 
Other central tenets of the bill included ensuring that inmates have access to 24/7 medical care, dispensing medication in a way that ensures inmates who need it actually receive it, requiring prisons to provide communal electronic kiosks for prisoners to request medical appointments and waiving fees for a wide range of medical services. 
Long considered one of the most conservative members of the Mississippi House, Currie secured support from the entire House, winning over everyone from tough-on-crime Republicans to criminal justice reform-minded Democrats. The bill passed 118-0 in the House. It was amended and whittled down before passing the Senate, but ultimately died in late negotiations between the chambers.
Currie believes the bill contained too many provisions, drawing opposition from the office of Gov. Tate Reeves and some of his Senate allies. Currie said Reeves’s office wanted to hire a private firm to conduct a review of prison health care instead of the Department of Health, a debate that loomed over the bill as House and Senate negotiators failed to agree on a final version in the closing days of the 2025 session.
To avoid a similar impasse this year, Currie will introduce many of the same measures, but in separate bills.
“I had it kind of like the Big, Beautiful Bill,” Currie said. “I had the big health care bill for MDOC, which was a failure on my part, because they were able just to say, ‘Oh no, we don’t want all of that this year.’ I’ll come at it a little differently (this year) and do it piece by piece.” 
One key policy fix Currie plans to reintroduce this year is revamping the process by which inmates request medical attention at many prisons. Prisoners often still need to rely on guards to bring them to an infirmary. This arrangement gives guards, who are not medical professionals, the power to determine whether a prisoner receives immediate care.
“We’re still at the part where an inmate has to tell a guard that I need to see a doctor, and he tells them to sit down and shut up, and they never get to see a doctor,” Currie said.
In October, Mississippi Today reported on the case of Christopher Boose, a 38-year-old Mississippi man who fell off his bunk at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility and broke his arm. He was allegedly denied treatment by guards for a week and developed sepsis. Boose, who was serving a one-year sentence for a Drug Court infraction, had his arm amputated. He has filed a federal lawsuit seeking $5 million in damages. 
To prevent similar episodes from happening in the future, Currie plans to push for new requirements to document prisoner requests for medical attention.
“The problem is we keep zero records, and there’s no accountability,” Currie said. “Like the article you did. It’s like oh, well, he lost his arm, I’m so sorry he didn’t get seen. We had to cut his arm off.’ I mean, it’s just, that kind of thing happens so often.”
Another prison health care issue Currie plans to tackle again is the spread of hepatitis C. Documents and private conversations reported by Mississippi Today show the problem appears to be widespread in state prisons.

A major scientific advance in the early 2010s – direct-acting antiviral drugs – transformed treatment regimens for hepatitis C, offering high cure rates, shorter treatment durations and fewer side effects. But the medication can cost the Mississippi system almost $30,000 for a six-week course. Many state prison systems have negotiated lower prices for the medication and are able to treat more patients.
Currie plans to keep pushing for the Department of Corrections and VitalCore to purchase hepatitis C medication through health care organizations enrolled in the federal 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical companies to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices. The program can offer discounts on drugs in the range of 20% to 50%. 
The Department of Health provided MDOC information about how to access 340B pricing, but as of October, the agency had not yet taken steps to obtain the reduced prices, a Health Department spokesperson told Mississippi Today. 
In an interview, Senate Corrections Chairman Juan Barnett, a Democrat from Heidelberg, said that he “vaguely remembered” Currie’s bill and supported some of its key provisions, but wanted to center efforts in his committee around reducing Mississippi’s prison population to free up more money for health care services. 
Barnett said he wasn’t completely satisfied with the performance of VitalCore, the private medical contractor that has raked in hundreds of millions of dollars to provide health care in prisons. 
“My thinking of trying to handle most of that cost is to reduce the prison population by passing legislation that will allow people with certain crimes to be able to be released,” Barnett said. “When you get the population down, then you have more money at your disposal to handle medical issues.”
Mississippi has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world — 661 people per 100,000. About 19,500 people are currently incarcerated in state prisons. 
Currie was initially surprised when House Speaker Jason White made her chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee. But amid a growing chorus of complaints about the provision of health care in Mississippi’s prisons, White told Currie, a former nurse, that she would have free rein to clean up the system. 
“Becky, go get em,” Currie recalls White telling her. 
So she crisscrossed the state, traveling to prisons and speaking with inmates about the issues they faced when trying to receive medical care. She encountered people with jaundice from untreated hepatitis C and women with cancerous lumps growing out of their breasts. 
Despite evidence that prisoners in a state with such a high incarceration rate aren’t receiving proper medical attention, Currie said, she has waged a lonely push for reform.
“It’s just me,” Currie said. “And it’s not that the proof’s not there.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/17162611/MT-Prison-Health-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:11:40.842920

Missouri GOP senator slams party leaders for forcing vote on bills without allowing debate

But before that, Democrats intend to make state Senate Republicans pay for invoking the rule to shut off debate — known as the previous question — for the first time since 2020.
With fewer than one-third of the seats in each chamber, the filibuster in the state Senate is practically the only means for the minority party to stall or kill legislation. That is why Democrats are determined to extract a price for using the previous question, but they aren’t saying how that will play out in the annual legislative session that starts Wednesday.
“As far as what that session looks like, everyone will have to wait and see,” Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat, told The Independent last month.  
The only affirmative duty of the General Assembly each year is to pass a state budget. But with a dwindling surplus, revenues in decline, and Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe pushing for elimination of the state income tax, the prospects for easy agreement look murky.
The list of other items awaiting action include issues that generate bipartisan support, such as addressing the growing wait list of people being held in jails who need court-ordered mental health treatments; legislation intended to improve maternal health; and personal agendas of departing lawmakers, including term-limited Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin’s bill to shut down solar power development and desire to regulate pharmacy benefit managers.
There are 10 seats in the state Senate certain to change hands, and all have attracted candidates currently in the Missouri House. Legislators looking to move up — including Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Republican running for the state Senate — will want to take election year achievements home to voters.
“You never know about the Senate, but the House is going to do business as usual, and we’ll just see how things play out in the Senate,” Patterson said in an interview with The Independent.

 Senate dysfunction

When Senate Republican leaders used the previous question rule at the end of last year’s session, it was the first time the motion to shut off debate was invoked during a regular session since 2017.
After the votes passing bills to undo voter-approved paid leave for workers and putting repeal of the 2024 abortion rights amendment on this year’s ballot, Democrats vowed there would be a price to pay in 2026.
“What we’re doing today is a failure of the Senate,” state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia said on the final day of the 2025 session. “And when there’s a failure in the Senate, there needs to be a response, and that response can’t last forever, but that response has to happen, and it has to be painful, and has to make us all understand that when the Senate doesn’t function as a body, we all lose.”
The offense, in Democratic eyes, was repeated during the September special session on redistricting, and aggravated by a rules change that sidestepped every opportunity Democrats could use to stall proceedings.
Democrats have to maintain their stall long enough to show that their views must be respected and that the state Senate is designed to be a less partisan body than the House, said state Sen. Tracy McCreery, a Democrat from Olivette.
“One of the challenges with working with some of the newer senators is that they brought the House mentality with them, and they don’t have respect for the institution of the Senate,” McCreery said. “In the Senate we have thoughtful, deliberative conversations, and we don’t just ram things through and not allow for debate.”
O’Laughlin, asked by text about the opening-day atmosphere she expects as she begins her last session as Senate leader, replied only with a head-exploding emoji.
Gov. Mike Kehoe speaks during the 2025 State of the State Address in the Missouri House chamber (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
 Budget and taxes

The gap between estimated state general revenue and appropriations in this year’s budget is $2.6 billion. Part of the difference, for state cash flow needs, is artificial because it is new spending on multi-year construction projects or money set aside for unfilled jobs in state government.
The rest must come from the state’s accumulated surplus, which has been diminishing and could be depleted within two fiscal years.
Kehoe has warned his budget proposal on Jan. 13 will be written to bring spending into balance with current revenue. That task will be complicated by the need to replace up to $1.2 billion in spending from non-general revenue funds with general tax revenue. 
“There are only painful budget bills that have money to cut from,” said state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Democrat from Springfield. “And typically in our state, when we have to face budget cuts, we see that in K-12 education, higher education and (appropriation bills) that include things like social services and the social safety net.”
Kehoe’s also expected on Jan. 13 to outline his plan for weaning state government off the income tax. With the tax representing 65% of last year’s $13.4 billion in revenue, the question will be where to find replacement money.
Republican members will be anxious to hear the details.
“We’ll have to see what that proposal will be and what revenue replacements or what revenue sources will be created from those changes,” said state Rep. Jeff Vernetti, a Republican from Camdenton.
Local taxes will also be a major question. State Rep. Tim Taylor, a Bunceton Republican, led a House committee that spent the summer studying property taxes. There are a number of Republicans who want to replace the property tax system with sales taxes.
That could work in some areas but wouldn’t generate enough revenue for rural areas, Taylor said in a recent interview. And for areas that could generate the revenue, the tax rate could be prohibitive.
The state imposes a 4.225% sales tax but local option taxes mean the rate paid at retail in most locations is much higher. And the sales tax is one place to go for replacement revenue for the income tax.
That is unlikely to be popular with voters, Taylor said.
“The thought of increasing sales tax again is really going to put that to pushing 10 cents on $1 or something, and that’s pretty substantial,” Taylor said.
Local governments will be watching both debates closely, said Steve Hobbs, executive director of the Missouri Association of Counties.
“First and foremost this needs to be fair to the citizens of Missouri,” he said.
Property tax is an immensely complex issue to tackle, Hobbs said. One reason, he noted, is that state school aid is tied to local tax effort.
The Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force, appointed by Kehoe, is halfway through its study of school funding. Changes to how local taxes are imposed would change the formula calculations.
And support for education depends on reliable revenue from state taxes, which are about to be overhauled, Hobbs noted.
“You have two legs of your education funding stool you are talking about putting under construction,” Hobbs said. “That is a big lift.”

 O’Laughlin’s agenda

In early December, O’Laughlin wrote on social media about a frustrating experience she had attempting to obtain a prescription while in Jefferson City. Most of the time, she wrote, she gets her medications from a local pharmacy in Clarence, but was frustrated by mixups and miscommunications she blamed on pharmacy benefit managers.
“What is the result of this wondrous cost saving set up? Absolutely nothing good for the customers,” O’Laughlin wrote.
Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, are the mechanisms used by insurance companies to control prescription costs for their plans. Techniques include preferential contracts for particular pharmacy companies, with higher reimbursements or dispensing fees for high-volume chain stores and online providers.
“The rural areas are hardest hit because their pharmacist is also their healthcare advocate, often knowing the patients and literally their entire medical history,” O’Laughlin wrote in response to a question from The Independent.
O’Laughlin endorsed legislation filed by state Sen. Travis Fitzwater, a Republican from Holts Summit, to end preferential clauses in PBM contracts.
Similar legislation last year drew a coalition of opponents that, along with insurance companies, included the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Missouri AFL-CIO. 
The opposition will be daunting, said Abe Funk, owner of John’s Pharmacy in southeast Missouri. Funk’s business operates in six locations, including two in communities with fewer than 1,000 people.
Funk is a member of the Missouri Pharmacy Business Council, which lobbies for independent pharmacies. He’s been calling legislators in his area and will personally visit the Capitol to push for the bill.
To overcome opposition, this year’s bill will focus on revealing the details of how PBMs pay claims. That’s helped change some minds, he said.
“They like the idea of transparency,” Funk said. “They like the idea of actually being able to see what their claims are, their payments. And so we anticipate a different climate this session than we have in the past.”
O’Laughlin’s long-standing opposition to renewable energy development is being ramped up by a 5,000-acre solar power project in Henry County in western Missouri. The project was developed over several years but only revealed publicly at the start of 2024. 
In December 2024, after two incumbent commissioners were defeated for reelection, the Henry County Commission approved an incentive package for the solar project that included $650 million in public-sponsored financing.
A lawsuit invoking a rarely used law requiring the courts to investigate public contracts is heading to trial in October. O’Laughlin has filed a bill for a moratorium on new solar project construction, including stopping work on projects underway but not finished, through Dec. 31, 2027.
The solar projects use valuable farmland, seek tax abatements and other preferential treatment and add little to local economies, O’Laughlin wrote in an email to The Independent.
“I honestly see this as tearing a giant hole in the fabric of our communities socially, fiscally, environmentally,” O’Laughlin wrote to The Independent. “What is there to like about them?”
 Election year prospects

No Democrat has won a statewide election since 2018, and results from 2024 show how daunting it will be for Kirkwood Democrat Quentin Wilson, a state department director from 1998 to 2001, to deny incumbent Republican State Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick a second term.
The auditor’s office is the only statewide race on the ballot. Last year, despite spending $20 million, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Lucas Kunce received just 41.8% of the vote, only two percentage points more than gubernatorial candidate Crystal Quade, who spent about $2 million.
But the difficult statewide race for Democrats doesn’t mean this year’s voting won’t give the party an opportunity to impose significant losses on Republicans. The same voters that gave GOP candidates landslide wins for statewide office handed them defeats on abortion rights, following up on prior liberal ballot measure wins on Medicaid expansion and marijuana legalization.
Republicans have put a measure reinstating the state’s near total abortion ban on the ballot, along with a proposal to change the way majorities are calculated for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative. And the redistricting plan intended to give the GOP an additional seat in the U.S. House faces a possible referendum vote. 
Controversial ballot measures can bring hundreds of thousands of Missourians out for an otherwise unexciting election. That occurred In 2018 and 2020, when a right to work referendum and Medicaid expansion, respectively, were on August primary ballots. In those years, nearly 300,000 more people voted in the Democratic primary than the average of other elections since 2000. 
Millions have already been spent on ballot measures for this year and the total for all will likely exceed $100 million by the time voters go to the polls.
But even a big surge of Democratic voters would only dent, not break, the GOP majority, said Terry Smith, political science professor at Columbia College.
Only 21 of 163 Missouri House seats were decided by 10 percentage points or less in 2024, and early financial reports indicate that only two of the 17 state Senate seats on the ballot appear to be truly competitive in November.
The best result for Democrats, Smith said, would be to break the two-thirds supermajority Republicans enjoy in each chamber. 
After the 2024 election, Republicans held 111 seats in the House and 24 of 34 seats in the Senate.
“Do Republicans  have anything to worry about? I don’t think so,” Smith said in an interview last week with The Independent.
In deeply Republican districts, even if the ballot measures draw a larger Democratic vote, it won’t be enough to change the outcome, Smith said.
“If you go from a district that is 75-25 to 60-40,” he said, “you pick up 15 points and you still lose by a landslide.”

(Nataba/iStock Images)We face a new year with the likelihood that the same divisive and hate-filled words and actions will intrude and dominate much of the public square. Some political leaders observing and adopting behavior from the lesser-civilized among us will prove useful.
Little else seems to be working.
We have all heard the saying, “They fight like cats and dogs.” But, all cats and dogs do not fight each other. Many, if not most, get along just fine.
Actually, our cat takes naps on our dog’s face. However, that has not always been the case. One of our previous dogs found great pleasure in chasing and terrorizing one of our cats. So clearly, it all depends.
It depends on what?
One could speculate that maybe our current dog and cat get along because they grew up together and shared their kitty and puppy days. That is partly the case. But, the dog has also been accepting older adopted cats that were complete strangers with different temperaments. There is no fighting, no chasing. They all get along.
Lesson one: Cats and dogs couldn’t naturally look or behave more differently, and yet whether they grew up together or met as strangers, they still respect each other, live peaceably under the same roof, and often do things together.
There are lessons that members of the Missouri General Assembly can take from that as they convene their 2026 legislative session this week. Members of Congress can do the same.
Respect and getting along are not just common among cats and dogs, but also among other lowly creatures in the animal kingdom.
We have a neighbor who loves animals, especially horses. On any given day when we pass by her farmhouse, it is not uncommon to see horses (large and miniature), donkeys, mules, sheep, goats, even peacocks, turkeys, and chickens of various breeds — all grazing and scratching alongside each other. 
We have yet to witness a fight or scuffle among any of them during nearly two decades we have been neighbors. While we know they might occur, it is not a common occurrence.
One could easily dismiss this example by saying, oh your neighbor operates a petting zoo, or she carefully picks docile animals. She does not. 
There is another likely explanation. She loves animals. She shows it in her actions, her tone, her body language and how she cares for and communicates with them. The animals see and feel her love, and they behave toward her and each other accordingly. 
Lesson two: These animals are different in every way imaginable — unlike us humans who are 99.99% the same — yet they co-exist, they get along. There are many reasons why they do. We can imagine.
Lesson three: First and foremost, our neighbor — the leader in this case — creates the space, sets the tone with the way she treats and communicates with that very diverse animal population.
Do you suppose there are any hints, lessons our political leaders can glean and put into practice?
Examples abound.
Several miles down the road while riding in the countryside, I looked over at a pasture with cows, Shetland ponies, elks, alpacas, and zebras. I thought to myself, what is it that we humans do not get? Those animals don’t speak the same language, certainly do not look alike, and yet they all seem to get along for their common good.
This harmony, respect, and acceptance just described among farm animals likely exists among many animals in the forests and jungles, even in the sea. 
Of course, there are those that do not get along, that prey on each other, and that live in fear of each other. But there are lessons we can learn from them, too. 
It is all about discernment and choice. 
Many choices are available to us. Exposure. Learning. Understanding. Compromise. Acceptance. How we choose to appreciate, work together, and live with each other.
So why do we, supposedly the most civilized animals on the planet, find ourselves promoting, practicing, even wallowing in perpetual discord and divisiveness the aim of which is to do more harm than good. Or, if any good at all, only for the few.
If many of our political leaders do not have, do not like, or haven’t been around animals or taken the time to observe any, maybe this new year is a great time to start or become reacquainted.
Our state and nation cannot perform the greatest good for the greatest number of its citizens by continuing the disrespect and disregard for the rules and laws that promote decency and civility, and most importantly, how we regard each other as fellow human beings traveling this earth entitled to the same rights and privileges.
How have we, who have so much in common, lost our way when many in the animal kingdom have not?
Yes, we do not hold all the same beliefs about everything or have the same life experiences. We all do not have the same visions and goals, or how to accomplish them.
We can disagree, have robust discussions on any issue or problem. But, we need not take advantage and try to destroy each other during the process.
Many aspects of our state and national political environment are on a slippery slope, and goodwilled visionary leaders who are willing to work for our common good are hard to find. It’s time for many of them to look to members of the animal kingdom for guidance.
Even animals accept and appreciate coexistence and the mutual benefits a vibrant living environment can bring.
Why can’t many of our political leaders?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AnimalandPoliticalLeaders2-Nataba-1024x675.jpg,,,2026-01-05 06:57:30.123852

State and federal officials are gearing up to stop the advance of a parasitic fly that is less than 70 miles from the United States border with Mexico.


Since Nov. 25, at least 10 new cases of incidents involving the New World screwworm fly have been confirmed within 400 miles of the border. The flies have been inching their way to the U.S. since they broke the biological barrier created by Panama’s narrow geography in 2022.

“There is a threat of it maybe getting into the southern United States, and then it would most likely end up in Missouri, too, at least maybe some isolated cases,” State Veterinarian Steve Strubberg said. “It’s conceivable that it could happen in the coming year or two.”


Deb Hudman, Missouri Department of Conservation health section chief, added that “transportation of infected animals is most likely how it would enter.”


Experts are hoping for a long winter and cold spring to help keep the flies from crossing the border.


“The cold weather is good,” Hudman said. “Anything as low as 48 degrees Fahrenheit stops the larvae and pupae development, and anything below 59 degrees significantly drops the activity of adult flies.”


Local and federal agencies are working to take advantage of the weather and keep New World screwworm flies out of the U.S. Last month the U.S. Department of Agriculture launched a website hoping to centralize information about the flesh-eating fly.


“The USDA remains focused on implementing our sweeping five-pronged plan to combat New World screwworm. As part of these critical efforts, USDA is working on both sides of the border to ensure a comprehensive response,” said Lyndsay Cole, a USDA spokesperson, in an email.



That five-pronged plan includes a total of $29.5 million in investments to renovate an existing fruit fly production facility in Metapa, Mexico, and to build a sterile insect dispersal facility at Moore Air Base in south Texas. The Mexico facility is expected to open as early as next summer. Planning is also underway to build a new production facility at Moore Air Base, according to the USDA website.


“Unfortunately there won’t be enough of those sterile flies available to us for a few years. It takes a long time to ramp up those production facilities, so we are hoping it stays in Mexico,” Strubberg said.
According to the plan, sterile screwworm flies are among the primary tools the government can use to fight the New World screwworm, but only one plant exists in Panama; it produces 100 million flies a week. A separate plant in Mexico that produced 500 million flies a week was shut down in 2012 for economic reasons.
The goal of producing sterile flies is to have them mate with female flies, which usually mate only once in their lifespan. Using this method, over time the population is reduced back down to zero. The sterile insect technique is what allowed the U.S. to eradicate the flies in the 1960s.


The U.S. government has worked closely with Panama since the now-broken biological barrier was formed.
 A costly wipeout



Screwworm was eradicated in the U.S. in 1966 at the cost of around $750 million. This time around, the USDA’s Economic Research Service says it could cost the Texas economy alone $1.8 billion over the next year if the fly gets into the United States.


Losses of $730 million are predicted to fall onto cattle producers. Nine of the last 10 confirmed cases of screwworm within 400 miles of the U.S. have come from bovines, according to data collected by the USDA.


“If it would come in, we would have such a great expense of eliminating it,” Strubberg said. “There are just so many different areas of added expense for individual producers.”


The impacts it would have on consumers are harder to predict, Strubberg said. But potential spikes from a dip in supply and increased expenses from dealing with screwworm could add to shelf costs.


To help the government contact producers in a potential infested zone, Strubberg urges people to register their premises through the Missouri Department of Agriculture if they have animals. The premises registration form can be found here.
 Cows and wildlife: easy targets




The flies can infest all living warm-blooded animals. This includes humans, pets, livestock and wild animals. Some signs to look out for in infected animals include an open wound or navel that looks infected, decreased activity and animals isolating themselves.


“The larvae are basically maggots,” Strubberg said. “They are much more aggressive than the normal maggots of the common flies we have around Missouri right now, and so they will cause a lot more damage.”


If an animal gets infected, there are a few treatment options. If treated, animals can make full recoveries, but untreated it is “very devastating,” Strubberg said.


“If you catch it early enough and treat it, you would do some surgical procedures to remove the larvae and hopefully treat them so they don’t mature,” Strubberg said. “There are systemic treatments of infested animals also; some of the larvae are so deep that you can’t remove them all surgically.”


The FDA conditionally approved a new topical solution for the prevention and treatment of New World screwworm in cattle over 2 months old, Exzolt Cattle-CA1. The drug is in the same family as Bravecto, an oral drug used for flea and tick prevention in dogs and cats.


“Exzolt Cattle-CA1 is eligible for conditional approval because it is intended to prevent and treat serious or life-threatening diseases in cattle, it addresses unmet animal health needs, and demonstrating effectiveness of the drug requires complex or particularly difficult studies,” the Food and Drug Administration said in a news release.


“Pets are also an easy way for screwworm to be transported,” Strubberg said. “We are working with every entity we can to try and get pet owners and all animal owners aware.”


He says to monitor pets to make sure they don’t have any open wounds and are feeling well. Strubberg added it’s important to be especially vigilant if you recently traveled to a place with an active screwworm population like Central and South America.


“If anyone is purchasing pets from outside the state, you definitely want the veterinarian to take a good look at it,” Hudman said.


Missouri’s wild animal populations would be at risk as well.


“Deer would be something to keep an eye on because they have lots of wounds from running, vehicle strikes and fences,” Hudman said. “It could certainly be present in raccoons, opossums, coyotes and rabbits. Really any warm-blooded species with an open wound.”


Wild populations would be next to impossible to contain and treat because they aren’t behind a fence or in a barn, Hudman said.


“You would have to trap all of them, and then you would have to treat them, then the first treatment might not take,” she said. “I just don’t see how that would be very viable.”


The only wild populations that might be possible to protect are ones with small, localized populations. Hudman pointed to Missouri’s elk population as an example.


The Missouri Department of Conservation is working closely with the Missouri Department of Agriculture and the USDA to develop a plan to combat the potential arrival of screwworm. A plan is currently not finalized.


“We’re setting up and making sure there are microscopes all around the state with people who can identify the larvae so we can have a local or regional way to approach it,” Hudman said.
 Screwworm fly impostor



Another challenge Missouri faces in identifying potential screwworm infestations is a different species of blowfly that looks like the screwworm fly. That species of blowfly feeds off dead tissue instead of living tissue.


“It’s going to be very tricky for the general public to tell the difference between the two, and the one that feeds off of dead tissue is very prevalent,” Hudman said.


While the New World screwworm fly hasn’t been detected in the U.S., Hudman advises caution toward the potential presence of the fly in the coming years.

A bipartisan bill in the state Legislature aims to address those problems. | Photo by Caspar Benson/Getty ImagesOn Dec. 3, a committee of Wisconsin lawmakers heard from Gabriel Lugo about his time in prison before his conviction was overturned. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Lugo testified through a statement read by attorney Rex Anderegg in a hearing of the Assembly Committee on State Affairs. He said he experienced constant lockdowns that severely restricted his movement and some correctional officers treating him as less than human. 
Lugo, 36, was convicted of first-degree reckless homicide in 2009 and spent the majority of his incarceration in Waupun Correctional Institution, the state’s oldest prison, which has received scrutiny for prison deaths and living conditions. After Lugo’s conviction was overturned, he was released from jail in June 2023.
According to Christopher Lau of the Wisconsin Innocence Project, the project has helped exonerate more than 30 people. Clients leave prison with medical ailments and emotional trauma, without familial support, employment, savings, and often, with nowhere to call home, his testimony stated. Many struggle to re-enter society. 
Exonerees often have to wait months to get on the agenda for the claims board’s meetings, Lau stated. If they qualify, the law doesn’t provide enough to ensure stable housing, he said, “to say nothing of the costs of social services like counseling, vocational assistance and access to health insurance.” 
The Wisconsin Claims Board can award up to $25,000 in compensation, at a rate not greater than $5,000 per year for the imprisonment, and has also awarded attorney fees. It can recommend that the state Legislature issue additional compensation. 
In February 2016, the Assembly unanimously approved a bill that aimed to increase state support for wrongly convicted people, including enabling the claims board to issue higher payouts. It did not become law. 
AB 583, a bill currently in the Legislature, also aims to provide more aid more quickly to wrongly convicted people. Under the bill, a wrongly convicted person would receive compensation at a yearly rate of $50,000, prorated daily, for the imprisonment; the total would not exceed $1 million. The claims board would adjust the rate yearly to account for the cost of living, and it would be able to award compensation in an annuity payable over time. 
The bill addresses when people who received compensation for wrongful imprisonment in the past can petition for more under the new law, potentially allowing some to receive more compensation. 
The bill lays out when wrongly convicted people could have health care coverage under plans offered by the Group Insurance Board to state employees. 
Under the bill, if a person is released from imprisonment on the basis of a claim of innocence, they could petition for a court order directing the Department of Corrections to create a transition-to-release plan. They could also petition for a financial assistance award of up to 133% of the federal poverty level for up to 14 months, or while compensation proceedings are pending, whichever is shorter. 
State legislators who introduced the bill included Republican and Democratic lawmakers. Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine), chair of the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety, submitted testimony in support of the bill. 
The bill bars some people from filing a petition with the claims board for compensation for wrongful imprisonment, such as a person who is convicted of a violent crime after being released. 
Records-sealing language
Also under the bill, a person released from imprisonment on the basis of a claim of innocence could petition the court for the sealing of all records related to the case. For Lugo, it took about two years to get a response from job applications because his case was still visible online, his statement said. 
A similar provision in the bill that the Assembly passed in 2016 drew pushback from the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, which argued that it would “dramatically compromise the ability of media and the public to examine what went wrong in cases in which things are known to have gone terribly wrong.”
On Dec. 22, the Wisconsin Examiner reached out to the office of Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek), one of the lawmakers who introduced the bill, about the provision and the council’s concern in 2016. 
“Thank you for bringing this information to our attention as we were not aware of this when we introduced the bill this session,” Rodriguez said in an emailed comment. “The organization has not reached out to us with any concerns at this time.”
Lawsuits
Wrongly convicted people may also attempt to obtain a monetary award through lawsuits. The bill addresses the possibility of a person receiving a settlement, judgement or award for damages in a federal or state action related to their wrongful imprisonment. 
Under one of these parts of the bill, if the person obtains a settlement before the claims board awards them compensation, the claims board would subtract the amount from the board’s compensation. 
Changing the process
Under current law, the claims board is responsible for finding whether the evidence of the person’s innocence is “clear and convincing.” 
The claims board members come from the Department of Justice, the Department of Administration, the Office of the Governor, the Wisconsin Senate and the Wisconsin Assembly. The Senate and Assembly members are Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) and Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Markesan).
Under the bill, when the claims board receives a petition for compensation for an innocent convict, it would be referred to the Division of Hearings and Appeals in the Department of Administration. The division would find whether the evidence is clear and convincing that the petitioner was innocent of the crime they were imprisoned for. 
If the evidence is clear and convincing for innocence, the division would transmit its findings to the claims board, which would decide what amount of compensation would be equitable. 
Individual bills
In a decision dated Jan. 30 of this year, the claims board awarded $25,000 to Gabriel Lugo, plus approximately $77,000 in attorney fees, and recommended that the Legislature award him an additional $750,000.
According to Rodriguez, the Legislature has only passed individual appropriation bills awarding additional compensation three times. 
Rodriguez’s testimony stated that it’s estimated that around 72 people have been exonerated in Wisconsin since 1990, and that seven received recommendations for compensation above the cap. She stated in a press release that “the Legislature should not have to play judge and jury again” when there is already a process at the claims board. 
“Without these reforms, exonerees would continue to need individual appropriation bills to receive an adequate amount of compensation,”  Rodriguez stated in a press release. “These bills have rarely been acted upon, and even more rarely are signed into law.”
The board has also recommended that the Legislature issue additional compensation for Robert and David Bintz, who were released from prison in the fall of last year.

(Photo by Hal Brown/New Jersey Monitor)In the nearly four years since Matt Platkin became New Jersey’s 62nd attorney general, his critics have multiplied.
Republicans tried to impeach him. Democrats accused him of weaponizing his office to attack their allies. State police unions sued him. Someone even sent voters mailers attacking him, a move usually reserved for political candidates in bare-knuckle election contests. (Platkin ran for public office just once — when he became the first sixth grader at his middle school elected to student government.)
Platkin regards it all as a measure of his success.
“I haven’t shied away from tough decisions and tough cases,” he said. “If you do this job for four years and you haven’t pissed anybody off, then you really haven’t done the job the right way.”
With just weeks left before Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill takes office and installs a new attorney general, Platkin shared his proudest moments, biggest frustrations, future plans, and more in a wide-ranging interview with the New Jersey Monitor.
 On corruption and criticism
Gov. Phil Murphy named Platkin, a Democrat and his former chief counsel, attorney general in February 2022.
As head of the state Department of Law and Public Safety, Platkin leads an office of about 8,000 people and oversees police, criminal and civil investigations and prosecutions statewide, and more.
His corruption crackdowns typically grab the most attention, both because he’s targeted some of the state’s most powerful people, such as South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, and because those cases don’t always hold up in court. State judges tossed Platkin’s criminal indictments of Norcross and more than a dozen correctional officers involved in a brutality scandal at the women’s prison, among others.
Those fumbles have fueled calls for an outside review of Platkin’s public corruption unit and prompted state legislators from both parties to try to take the state police from his control and subject his staff to wiretaps.
Platkin called the criticism “baseless personal attacks” rooted in his mission to hold people accountable, regardless of political party or position, from drug traffickers up to President Donald Trump.
“These are people with positions of power who have bully pulpits. I don’t hear them saying it’s political prosecutions when we take down 30-plus-defendant mafia rings or drug cartels or gangs engaged in gun violence. But when you prosecute a politician, people who don’t like it want to accuse you of having a political agenda,” Platkin said. “That’s not new, by the way, but I do think the severity of the attacks has increased, and they’re completely unfounded.”
A Norcross spokesman declined to comment for this story. When a state Superior Court judge dismissed the charges against Norcross last year, Norcross attorney Michael Critchley said Platkin “trashed” the reputation of the Attorney General’s Office with the “sham” indictment. Platkin’s office is appealing.

 A national ‘embarrassment’
One of Platkin’s more public clashes with his critics came earlier this month, when a Senate panel unanimously passed a bill that would have weakened the state comptroller’s office, which also investigates public corruption.
That hearing was helmed by Sen. James Beach (D-Camden), a close Norcross ally and architect of the plan to remove state police from the Attorney General’s Office. Beach clashed with Platkin, U.S. Sen. Andy Kim, and acting Comptroller Kevin Walsh when they testified against the bill, telling Platkin, “You, sir, have drug down the department!”
Platkin called the hearing an “embarrassment” and followed it up with an unusual written rebuke to Beach, accusing him of violating the free speech rights of the bill’s critics by limiting the time they could testify about the measure while allowing some of the bill’s supporters to speak at length about it.
Platkin told the New Jersey Monitor that the government cannot discriminate against people because it doesn’t like their speech.
“Once you open the door up to give people a platform to speak, you have to give everyone a fair shot to speak,” he said. “He stacked the deck. He was dismissive, he was arrogant, he was aggressive, he was insulting — to a United States senator, just as he was to ordinary residents of our state. And what message does that send to people of New Jersey and across the country, who have the lowest level of faith in their government institutions that they’ve had since the Civil War?”
Beach declined to comment through a spokesman. Sen. Nicholas Scutari, who sponsored the bill, later withdrew it and said he won’t meddle again with the comptroller’s powers.
 Taking on his boss
Platkin also tangled with Murphy after first lady Tammy Murphy launched a bid for the U.S. Senate seat when its former occupant, Bob Menendez, was indicted and later convicted in a global bribery scheme and resigned in disgrace.
Kim was the first to announce he wanted the seat. As the state’s party leaders lined up to endorse Tammy Murphy, Kim sued to challenge the county line, which gave party leaders’ preferred candidates better placement on the ballot. During the court fight, Platkin offered his unsolicited opinion that the county line must go. Tammy Murphy later dropped out of the race.
Did this cause problems with Gov. Murphy?
“I think he’s been a tremendous governor, and I’ve been proud to serve him directly and him and his administration for almost the entirety of his time in office. He’s always been professional with me, and I’ve genuinely enjoyed the partnership,” Platkin said. “Obviously, that was a personally difficult decision, but one that you could look at now …  was the right legal outcome.”
Murphy told the New Jersey Monitor he has no hard feelings.
“It’s history. Matt’s done a hell of a job, in particular, I have to say, fighting the Trump administration, where he’s led with great force and stature,” Murphy said.
Platkin has joined or led at least 43 federal lawsuits against the Trump administration.

 Proudest accomplishments?
Platkin cited a number of actions as his proudest moments as attorney general, including his fights against Trump’s policies, his work against gun violence, and lawsuits against tech giants like Meta, TikTok, and Discord, whose platforms he alleges have fueled social media addiction among youth.
A gun violence reduction advocate since high school, he said his role as attorney general gave him the power to make change on the issue — and his two young children gave him the drive.
“I grew up in the Columbine generation. I thought we would have solved this problem,” Platkin said. “My daughter had her first school shooting drill before she could walk. Weeks ago, I got an email that they played Elmo in the closet to keep 2-year-olds from being too loud during a school shooting drill. That’s not normal. And that’s not Second Amendment rights.”
Platkin has defended New Jersey’s strict gun laws against challenges by the gun lobby, expanded tracking of gun carry applications, taken steps to better investigate gun crimes, targeted gun retailers, supported community-based violence intervention work, and more. He said all this has helped cut gun violence in New Jersey to record lows since statewide tracking began in 2009.
“We know that it’s not 9.5 million people engaging in gun violence. It’s like 1,000 people. So when you think about it that way, it’s actually quite a solvable problem, or at least a problem that you can reduce. And we’ve tried to focus on those people that we know are habitually involved in violence,” he said.
 What’s next
Platkin wouldn’t say much about where he’ll go after Jen Davenport, Sherrill’s choice for attorney general, succeeds him. But it won’t be politics, he said.
“I can tell you for sure I’m not running for office,” he said. “I find it kind of funny that people can’t imagine that somebody might do something because they think it’s right, not because it furthers a political narrative.”
He vowed to remain active in many of the battles he waged as attorney general.
“I didn’t start caring about these things when I took office in 2022, and I’m not going to stop caring about them in 2026,” he said. “In some way, shape, or form, I’m going to stay involved in these fights.”
Assemblyman Antwan McClellan (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Assemblyman Antwan McClellan (R-Cape May), who last year pushed for Platkin’s impeachment, called his legacy “a failure.”
McClellan pointed to prosecutorial missteps that resulted in the collapse of high-profile cases; Platkin’s numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration; his office’s lengthy, unresolved investigations that leave state troopers and other targets in limbo; and his decision to supersede the Paterson Police Department over the objections of its chief and the city’s mayor. The latter sparked a court fight that went up to the state Supreme Court, which deemed the state takeover lawful.
“It’s all chasing headlines, as opposed to grinding down and really doing the work that needed to be done and what’s expected from the attorney general of the state,” McClellan said.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Fifty-nine children died of caregiver abuse or neglect in 2024, according to an annual report from the Indiana Department of Child Services released Monday, just before the end of 2025.
Of those, 18 were due to abuse and 41 were due to neglect.
The total has stayed in a similar range in recent years — from a low of 50 in 2020 and a high of 61 in 2022. Last year’s number was 56.
DCS reviewed 276 child fatalities in 2024. The share of deaths attributed to caregiver maltreatment has hovered around 20% for at least the last several years.
The agency reviews all child deaths that involve allegations of abuse or neglect, and — for children under age three — all fatalities that are sudden or unexplained. Forty-two, or 71%, of the victims were under age 3.
Fifteen kids in the report were previously victims in a prior case of abuse or neglect substantiated by DCS.

Death by weapon, which includes body parts like closed fists, was the leading cause of death, listed in 20% of cases. Asphyxia, poisonings, drownings and unsafe sleep conditions were other top factors. DCS pulls causes of death from state death certificates.
Two cases involved toddlers shooting themselves with unsecured, loaded firearms — one in his mother’s purse and one by his father’s mattress. That is down from 10 similar cases recorded in 2023.
Parental alcohol and other drug use was prevalent, however.
Several young children died directly of acute cocaine, fentanyl or methamphetamine toxicity. But parents were repeatedly described as incapacitated by drug use in numerous cases with other primary causes of death, like a house fire, starvation or unsafe sleep conditions.
Some kids died after catching the common cold. Often, their parents didn’t seek medical attention despite noticing their children stopped eating, went pale, struggled to breathe and so on.
Other victims had chronic health conditions.
A 1-year-old boy, who’d previously been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and heart failure, died after going months without an overnight ventilation machine or medications prescribed to prevent fluid build-up in his lungs.
One 12-year-old girl with Type 1 diabetes died of diabetic ketoacidosis. Her blood sugar topped 600 on the day of her death. Investigators found a broken continuous glucose monitor and unused insulin pumps in the home, according to the report. The child’s medical records revealed the parents had a history of failing to manage her autoimmune disease even though they’d been through training more than 10 separate times.
Of the 78 alleged perpetrators deemed responsible for the fatalities, 63 — or 81% — were the children’s biological parents. Multiple perpetrators can be involved in one death.
The report cited a variety of caregiver stressors, like insufficient income, unemployment, substance abuse and a history of abuse — either as a victim themselves or as a perpetrator.
In 43 cases, or 73% of them, the children died at their own homes.

(Photo by Zoranm/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — A Tulsa lawmaker is pushing for a new law that would require public schools to begin conducting routine hearing tests for children in kindergarten through third grade in an effort to boost literacy rates.
But the plan has faced pushback from some state and national groups, who argue that while the hearing screenings would be beneficial, it’s critical that the state’s required guidelines adhere to best practice and be funded adequately so as not to harm local schools and businesses.
State Rep. Meloyde Blancett, D-Tulsa, said she filed House Bill 2188 last session after talking with pediatric audiologists in her district. She believes that undiagnosed hearing loss is likely preventing some students from succeeding academically.
“If you can’t learn to read by the third grade, then you can’t read to learn,” Blancett said. “It becomes a significant barrier to success in school.”
She’s pressing for Oklahoma to join the 70% of states that already require some type of hearing screenings for school-aged children.
While over 98% of infants are screened for hearing issues at birth, the testing cannot flag certain types of pediatric hearing loss, including late-onset or progressive, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, which represents over 200,000 audiologists, speech-language pathologists and scientists. 
Nationally, about 15% of children suffer from hearing loss when they enter school, according to the group. But failure to detect it impacts speech and language development and harms children’s academic, emotional and social outcomes, according to the organization.
Kim Richardson, a licensed hearing instrument specialist with more than 20 years of experience at Lucid Hearing in Edmond, said cost is a barrier that keeps many families from receiving early screenings and intervention.
Screenings cost from $250 to $350 if someone has to pay out of pocket, she said.
“Most insurance doesn’t cover hearing screenings, which is why people put them off,” Richardson said.
David Huff, Doctor of Hearing Care by Hugh, an Edmond-based business, said that hearing screenings are only effective if schools are properly trained in how to administer them.
“Screenings should happen, but schools must be equipped,” he said. “Without consistency across districts, the results become unreliable.”
How to properly conduct the screenings was a concern for five high-profile groups, including Hearts for Hearing, the Academy of Audiology, and the Oklahoma Speech-Language-Hearing Association. The groups opposed Blancett’s legislation during the 2025 legislative session.
While the three did not respond to requests for comment, Blancett provided a letter the groups sent lawmakers in February. They wrote that while they “unequivocally support the expansion of hearing screenings” using evidence-based screening models, they worried about the “significant, unintended negative consequences” of House Bill 2188.
Among those were a requirement to use a tablet-based program that the audiologists said is not consistent with “evidence-based methods recognized for childhood hearing screenings by nationally recognized clinic practice guidelines.” 
The groups also expressed concern about the financial burden to Oklahoma’s education system and immediate workforce supply challenges that would be required to accommodate increased testing and referrals. 
They also urged lawmakers to first study legislation passed in other states that already require such testing.
Blancett said it is unlikely that she’ll continue to pursue House Bill 2188 during the 2026 legislative session, which starts in February. But she said she’ll continue to press for student hearing screenings and will continue to work with stakeholders to develop best-practice legislation.
“There’s a critical need that’s not being met,” Blancett said. “My hope is that at some point, this gets across the line so we can give kids and teachers the resources they need.”

(Photo by Westend61/Getty Images)LINCOLN — With state government facing a $471 million budget shortfall, one state agency again seeks to use state lottery funds, through the Nebraska Environmental Trust, to help finance its operations.
The proposal was described by trust supporters as a new and probably unconstitutional “raid” of trust funds — state lottery proceeds that are granted out to environmental projects.
A state official, meanwhile, described the transfer as necessary to continue soil and water conservation projects and said it complies with a recently amended state law that expanded the allowable uses of the money.
The Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment (NDWEE), in a mid-budget funding request, seeks an $8 million transfer from the Trust, of which $6 million would be used for a soil and water conservation program and $2 million for salaries and administrative costs.
Board members of the Nebraska Environmental Trust made their annual grant awards in 2024. The grants were awarded early, in January instead of June, to allow organizations to begin work sooner in the year, officials said. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
Amanda Woita, a department spokeswoman, said the transfer to the Water Resources Cash Fund complies with the goal of the Trust funds — to conserve, enhance and restore the state’s environment, and that the Trust currently holds more than $70 million, so it can “easily” afford an $8 million withdrawal. The Trust typically distributes about $20 million in lottery-funded grants each year.
“Using these funds to protect the vital groundwater and surface water resources is a clear constitutional and common-sense use of the funds allocated to the Environmental Trust,” Woita said in an email response to questions.
But Kristal Stoner, the head of Audubon Great Plains, and Sandy Scofield, a former state senator who heads the Friends of the Environmental Trust, questioned the legality of the proposed transfer.
Stoner said using one-time Trust funds to help solve a state budget problem would “erode” the Trust and its purpose, which is to provide competitive grants to local and regional organizations seeking to enhance the state’s environment.
“I am deeply concerned,” she said in an email. “Continued diversions of funds will mean the end of the Trust.”
“Nebraska should continue to fund our legal responsibilities and basics of our government with general funds,” Stoner said, and not lottery proceeds.
Tight budget times
The proposal comes when the state is wrestling with closing a gap in the state budget and as supporters of the Trust worry about raids on the grant funds.


Explaining the Nebraska Environmental Trust
The Nebraska Environmental Trust was established when Nebraskans approved a state lottery in 1992. It receives 44.5% of the lottery proceeds — about $20 million a year in recent years.
Its stated mission is “to conserve, enhance and restore the natural environments of Nebraska.”
Grants are provided on a competitive basis, after a review and scoring by a committee of Trust Board members and then voted on by the entire 14-member board. The governor appoints nine board members. Five others are state agency heads, four of which are appointed to those posts by the governor.
Recent grant recipients include the Statewide Arboretum, various cities and towns from Omaha to Mullen, the Crane Trust, Ducks Unlimited, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, as well as the Audubon Society.


A year ago, the Legislature allocated $15 million in Trust funds, over two years, to soil and water conservation programs overseen by the Department of Natural Resources, an agency that recently was merged into the NDWEE.
State lawmakers, though, rejected a proposal by Gov. Jim Pillen to expand the use of Trust funds to include “outdoor recreation” and “healthy infrastructure.”
The separate Water Resources Cash Fund primarily finances projects by local Natural Resources Districts to enhance stream flows and groundwater recharge in areas of concern about water resources.
When it was created, the water program was financed using state tax dollars. But since 2011, Trust funds have been transferred in some years to supplement the state water cash fund’s annual grants, which totaled $3.7 million in the most recent year, according to an October report to the Legislature.
The NDWEE, in its budget request, said the $8 million in Trust funds would allow continuation of water resources programs in areas where water has been fully or overappropriated.
In recent years, the Trust, in a departure from past practices, has built up an excess of funds by not awarding all the proceeds it gets from the Nebraska Lottery. In 2023, for instance, it granted out only $11 million of the $20 million available. In 2024, $15 million was granted out of $26 million available.
This year, grant awards of about $18 million out of the $25 million available have been recommended by a Trust subcommittee, according to Holly Adams, the Trust’s executive director. The full Nebraska Environmental Trust Board meets Jan. 8 to consider approving those awards.
According to the Legislative Fiscal Office, the Trust holds about $73 million in assets, about $27 million of which will remain unobligated, once the proposed new grants are considered. Some of the Trust’s grants are multi-year, so funds for them are already assigned to grant out in future years.
Scofield, who was chief of staff under then-Gov. Ben Nelson when the Environmental Trust was created, said lottery funds were never intended to finance the administrative expenses of state agencies. She said the current budget “mess” has been caused by the state failing to provide enough tax revenue to finance state operations.
Some have blamed cuts in state income taxes passed by the Legislature in 2023 as too deep. The cuts are projected to reduce state tax revenue by $470 million in the current fiscal year and $702 million in 2026-27. Pillen, meanwhile, has said he anticipated needing to cut state spending and says state government should be reduced. He has called for $500 million in agency cuts this year.
Legal questions continue
Supporters of the Trust, who maintain that the latest proposed transfer is illegal, point to a state statute that says that grants from the Trust “shall not provide direct assistance to regulatory programs.”

But Woita, of the NDWEE, said that is a misreading of state law, and that recent amendments for the use of the Water Resources Cash Fund clearly allow its use to cover the costs of salaries and water conservation projects.
In May, a former state official, Jon Oberg, threatened to file a lawsuit to block the proposed transfer of Trust funds to the water resources fund proposed in the 2025 legislative session.
Oberg and another former state official, W. Don Nelson, who served as chief of staff under then-Gov. Bob Kerrey, have previously successfully blocked a Trust funding decision that they maintained was unconstitutional. Their 2020 lawsuit resulted in the removal of a $1.8 million grant to install ethanol blender pumps at gas stations.
But Oberg told the Examiner on Thursday that he had no comment about the most recent proposal. The proposed $8 million transfer will be considered by the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee during the 2026 legislative session, which begins Wednesday.

A fifth candidate, Enrique Casiano of Janesville, happens to check all four of those boxes. A 47-year-old registered nurse, Casiano said his decision to join the Democratic field of hopefuls for the 1st District seat arose during a four-month strike at the Mercyhealth East Clinic in Janesville, where he is a leader in United Auto Workers Local 95.
The walkout of UAW-represented nurses, physical therapists, medical assistants and maintenance employees at the clinic started July 2, centered on health care costs, wages and security for employees.
“When September came around we were still on strike,” Casiano recalled. “I was thinking to myself, What in the world is going on? Why would a company do this to their employees? Why would this even be allowed?”
He and fellow union members blamed federal labor laws. Casiano said they have “no teeth” and don’t hold employers accountable.
“That has to be changed at a national level,” Casiano said. “That’s what motivated me to get out there and run for Congress.”
The strike ended Nov. 3, when the clinic management and the union ratified a new contract. The agreement led to raises that were higher than nonunion employees received elsewhere in the Mercyhealth system, Casiano said, although still less than what the union had originally sought. Health care costs for employees will be “basically three times” what they were previously, he added.
“This was a big concession,” Casiano said. “Something I told the membership, this should be a wake-up call for everybody to vote for someone who’s going to do something about the health care crisis in our nation.”
Casiano argues that health care is a human right and government should do more to prevent health care costs from leaving people in debt or sending them into bankruptcy.
“If you have the money, you’ll get care,” he said. “If you don’t have the money, I’ve seen how many people end up being homeless or go into great debt because of their health.”
He supports Medicare for All, but also favors giving states greater freedom to regulate the health care systems. He opposes consolidation among health care groups and favors breaking up large hospital and health care systems, as well as keeping for-profit businesses, including private equity and venture capital firms, out of health care.
“The current system rewards profiting from people’s health care crisis,” Casiano said. “It is not a system of prevention and rewarding the best health care outcomes and practices.”
Casiano said that updating the 1930s-era National Labor Relations Act with laws that would strengthen the rights of workers to union representation is a top priority of his. If elected he would also seek to enact stronger federal laws against wage theft and against misclassifying workers as independent contractors with fewer protections. He said that he also wants “real tax relief to the working class” instead of the wealthy.
Casiano is one of five Democrats vying for the chance to challenge U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, the Republican incumbent in the 1st District now in his fourth term.
“I’m part of the working class. I’m not a lawyer. I’m not a politician,” Casiano said — although he readily acknowledged that every other Democrat competing for the nomination could make the same claim.
“Pretty much everybody running this time around, we’re all just working class people who want to see a change in the 1st District,” he said.
The rest of the Democratic field includes ironworker Randy Bryce, emergency room nurse Mitchell Berman, Racine community activist Gage Stills and university administrator Miguel Aranda.
As he shapes his campaign, Casiano is leaning into his background as a health care professional, a union activist and also a member of the Hispanic community.
He said the Trump administration’s round-ups of immigrants — which has caught up U.S. citizens in addition to people without legal immigration status — has a personal dimension.
“It’s sad that I, when I go to Milwaukee, can be stopped [by police] just because of the way I look and the way I talk,” he said. “At the national level, we’re attacking specific [ethnic groups of] people, which we’ve never done before.”
The 1st Congressional District has been solidly Republican since the mid-1990s. Steil succeeded Paul Ryan in the office when Ryan stepped aside  in 2018 after a 20-year tenure. A corporate lawyer and former Ryan aide, Steil won with margins of 9 to 10 points in 2022 and 2024.
The Cook Political Report has rated the district as likely Republican in 2026, and gives the GOP a 2-point advantage based on past presidential elections.
Casiano contends political apathy accounts for Steil’s success. “In the last election, many of my coworkers, they just did not go out to vote,” he said. “It’s not winnable, somebody told me [because] it’s all about the money.”
He contends that 2026 can be different.
“What’s changed now is the Trump administration and how messed up everything is going,” Casiano said. “Only people that have blinders on will say everything is OK, because it’s not.”
Casiano said he knows he’s a long-shot candidate, but he believes Steil is vulnerable and that people can be motivated to vote if candidates reach out to them.
“I know he has let down a lot of his constituents,” Casiano said. “We know he’s not out there for the farmers, or some of the small businesses” in the district, he added. “That’s the big message we’ve got to bring forward.”
He believes enough people have stayed away from the polls in the past to make a difference in the outcome for 2026.
“We have to go and start talking to Black and brown people in our community and get them out to vote,” Casiano said. “This is what I’m going to be fighting for.”

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden reminded lawmakers during his December budget address that state law “dictates” a minimum increase in education funding each year.
But in the next breath, he recommended flat funding for South Dakota schools.
During a press conference two days later, South Dakota Searchlight asked Rhoden to explain the contradiction.
“The same people that made the laws can suspend them, if you will,” he said. “And there’s times that it’s been necessary to do so.”
Lawmakers created the mandatory increase law in 1995, with an effective date in 1997. It required annual increases of 3% or inflation, whichever is less — an amount described as the “index factor.”
Legislators and governors followed or exceeded that requirement for 13 years. Since 2010, however, they’ve provided less than the index factor four times. Rhoden’s proposed budget would be the fifth.
How lawmakers get around the index factor
To get around mandatory funding increases, lawmakers amend the state education funding law. Instead of applying the mandatory increase to the prior year’s baseline funding, they reset the baseline. 
The mandatory increase remains in the law, but only as a requirement for the next year. When the next year arrives, if legislators want to go below or above the minimum increase, they reset the baseline again as needed.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said the index factor now serves more as a “guideline or a goal.”
“One Legislature can’t bind a future Legislature by statute,” Venhuizen said.


Dave Knudson was chief of staff to Gov. Bill Janklow when Janklow signed the mandatory minimum increase into law three decades ago. Knudson, who later served as a lawmaker, said the Legislature’s recent treatment of the law signifies a declining commitment to schools.
“It seems like education isn’t as high of a priority in these last few years as it was the prior 25 or so,” Knudson said.
1990s law changes made schools ‘very dependent on the state’
Janklow convinced lawmakers in 1995 to take more responsibility for school funding in an effort to reduce local property taxes. 
Knudson said the index factor was established because Janklow’s administration “knew state funding would have to be adjusted on an annual basis.” Three percent was close to the annual rate of inflation around that time, he said.
‘Not increasing is a cut’: Governor’s flat funding plan for education, health care worries advocates

Former lawmaker Lee Schoenbeck served in the Legislature then. He said there was an expectation that the index factor would provide what school districts “needed to have to operate.”
The changes implemented in the 1990s made schools “very dependent on the state,” Schoenbeck said, and put the onus on lawmakers to follow through with required funding increases.
“It ought to be a big deal to decide you won’t do that,” Schoenbeck said. 
During the roughly 30-year history of the index factor law, lawmakers have increased education funding by exactly the index factor 10 times and gone above it 15 times. They provided increases smaller than the index factor four times, including one year of widespread budget cuts when education funding was reduced.
Rhoden said during his budget address that education funding has stayed above the index factor over the long term. Since his predecessor Kristi Noem became governor in 2019, state education funding has grown by 27.9%, Rhoden said, while the index factor over that time has been 21.7%
Impact of sales tax reduction
Sandra Waltman, the South Dakota Education Association’s director of government relations and communications, said school districts set their budgets with the index factor as a guideline. Some enter into multi-year contracts with teachers based on the expectation.

Yet school leaders recognize it can be difficult to meet the index factor “in extreme times,” Waltman said.
“To ignore it consistently and have schools fall behind inflation is where we’d become concerned,” she said.
Schoenbeck said the state could live up to the index factor this year by immediately returning the state’s sales tax to 4.5%. The Legislature and then-Gov. Noem temporarily reduced the rate to 4.2% in 2023, costing the state more than $100 million in annual revenue. The tax is scheduled to go back up to 4.5%, but not until 2027.
“Put that back to where we had it and you’d have your problem solved,” Schoenbeck said. “Now these people in the Legislature will have to decide if they have the courage to pay their bills.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)I have an easy New Year’s resolution for Oklahoma lawmakers: Vow to reject any legislation in 2026 that creates do-nothing advisory boards. 
Pretty much every annual legislative session, senators and representatives pat themselves on the back for creating another government panel that seems to have no enforcement or regulatory power, much less do anything to make our state a better place.
Take the higher education Free Speech Committee, for example.
It’s been in the headlines recently because Oklahomans want to know what this body is doing about the fact that our state’s three largest universities have each been hammered with allegations of First Amendment violations, ranging from political and religious speech discrimination to press censorship.
Lawmakers created the board in 2022 to ensure that First Amendment rights are protected on Oklahoma college campuses, but gave it the power to only review policies and complaints and then make recommendations to universities on improvements to policies and free speech training. Chad Caldwell, who authored the legislation, has said the committee is needed because free speech matters continue to grow in importance, affect everyone universally and need to be protected.
But rather than being bastions of free speech, this nine-member board gives the sense that they have no sense of urgency to protect the First Amendment rights of university students and employees.
Instead of serving as a watchdog, this group has largely relegated themselves to the sidelines, opting instead to be cheerleaders, allowing universities to police themselves.
Meanwhile, our universities have faced serious free speech accusations.
A dispute at Oklahoma State University gained national attention after a staff member reportedly criticized a student for wearing a hat emblazoned with “No. 47” – symbolizing President Donald Trump’s second administration – while ironically giving a speech about free speech on campus at a nonpartisan event.
Leadership at the University of Central Oklahoma is facing accusations that they’re attempting to censor the press by stopping the print edition of their student newspaper, The Vista. The paper continues to publish digitally. 
And the University of Oklahoma is facing a dispute over whether a student, who received a failing grade after she cited the Bible in an essay about gender conformity in a psychology class, can claim religious discrimination. It has led the university to put two educators, including a teaching assistant who gave a student a zero for her work, on leave. The university, by the way, is now also facing accusations from a national group that they infringed on the rights of the teaching assistant. Just before Christmas, the university said that person who graded the essay was stripped of instructional duties.
As the Freedom From Religion Foundation put it, OU is a public university, which cannot privilege a certain religious viewpoint.
This state committee, meanwhile, has been largely silent throughout it all.
That raises concerning questions about whether board members actually know what they’re doing, and if they even could recognize a First Amendment violation.
During its most recent meeting, the Free Speech Committee only mentioned the OU dispute, which continues to play out, just before adjoining. The board chair asked the board if anyone wanted to address it as part of the board’s new business. Caldwell, who serves on the committee he helped create, commended the university for using the free speech processes in place.
Committee member Andy Lester also praised OU after the meeting, but lamented at one point that “it’s hard to balance these things.”
Indeed. But that, dear sir, is the onerous task this committee should be undertaking.
He also recommended that people pursue free speech complaints at the campus-level rather than with his committee because their “process takes some time.”
That’s not encouraging for people who deserve to have their First Amendment rights protected and enforced by what should be a neutral body or for our universities that deserve vindication if they did not commit a violation.
If this board is not equipped to quickly sort through complaints, why do it at all?
Caldwell said he supports it continuing to be an advisory committee. He argues they don’t need enforcement powers to force changes, and said that the committee was designed to be collaborative rather than adversarial with the universities it works with.
Board members have been busy combing through institutions’ free speech policies and making seemingly minor revision recommendations.
I question if this committee has the expertise — and willpower — needed to recommend changes that will strengthen free speech protections.
As an advisory board, they definitely don’t have the power to require needed change.
Which makes it a prime example of the ridiculousness of advisory boards and commissions.
So I hope as lawmakers begin drafting their 2026 legislation, they ask themselves if another advisory board will legitimately make lives better for their constituents.
If the answer is no, then let’s resolve in 2026 to take a hard pass on creating new ones and to seriously consider the continued need for those that already exist.

Local stakeholders say the project simply requires too many unacceptable impacts for the unique, and lucrative, outdoor recreation hotspot.
The post Backer of controversial Seminoe hydroelectric project proposes new tack appeared first on WyoFile .","The developer of a proposed pumped-water-storage hydroelectric project at Seminoe Reservoir has submitted a revised plan and asked federal officials to consider it as they evaluate the proposal and draft regulations. 
Utah-based rPlus Hydro says the alternative plan addresses a host of local concerns, including threats to critical bighorn sheep habitat and a destination trout fishery. Project opponents, and at least one state agency, say they haven’t had adequate time to evaluate the new proposal and remain unconvinced that it accomplishes that aim. 
The developer also filed a request in December with the state to certify water quality assertions made in its applications for federal licenses. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality will review and prescribe conditions related to “dredge-and-fill” activities associated with the project, according to the agency.
If built, the pumped-water storage system would generate electricity by pumping Seminoe Reservoir water uphill during daytime “off-peak demand” hours when wind and solar power are plentiful and wholesale electricity is cheapest, and then releasing that water back downhill through hydroelectric turbines during higher-demand hours in the evening.
Wildlife impacts, waivers and an alternate plan
The project is ultimately subject to federal approval and regulation, though which agencies should handle which aspects is still a matter of debate. Several state agencies and local government entities, meanwhile, also have roles to play as evaluators, commenters and advocates.

On the federal side, rPlus Hydro wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider its newly proposed “Alternative D” in the draft environmental impact statement for the project. The company, responding to an outpouring of concern and analysis from locals, says its newly crafted option would result in less heavy-truck traffic and a smaller construction footprint, reducing likely impacts to wildlife in the area, including a prized bighorn sheep herd.
“From a recreation standpoint,” rPlus wrote in a Dec. 15 letter to FERC, the company’s revised proposal “relocates the primary construction activities for the main access tunnel — including the batch plant and spoil pile — farther from the state park. As a result, recreational resources and visitor experiences are expected to be less affected than under [FERC’s currently preferred plan].”
Wildlife and outdoor recreation advocates have railed against the company’s request for a long list of waivers to timing stipulations designed to protect wildlife and habitat in the area. Likewise, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has objected to some habitat impacts that FERC appears willing to accept, including variance requests to override “timing stipulations for the crucial winter and [birthing] ranges,” Game and Fish wrote in a December letter to FERC. 
“Bighorn sheep have very specific habitat requirements which the minimization and mitigation measures proposed in the [draft plan] will not be able to adequately compensate,” the letter states. “Bighorn sheep habitat is irreplaceable.” 
rPlus Hydro’s new option is a welcomed effort, as well as an acknowledgement of threats to wildlife and recreation, Trout Unlimited’s Patrick Harrington said. But it doesn’t go far enough. The project would still disturb big game and other wildlife and chip away at vital habitat. The new alternative also doesn’t address potential impacts to the Seminoe and North Platte River fisheries.

“It’s a [public relations] strategy, not meaningful mitigation,” said Harrington, who serves as Wyoming governmental relations director for Trout Unlimited’s Rockies Region.
A major flaw in the proposed new alternative, Harrington added, is that it appears to shift much of the federal government’s mitigation planning for the project from FERC to the Bureau of Reclamation, which doesn’t have comprehensive authorities to address the myriad environmental and recreation impacts.
“This just creates an administrative loophole that makes permitting simpler,” Harrington said.
Existing wildlife timing restrictions, which are enshrined in the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Rawlins Resource Management Plan, increase the cost of construction, rPlus Hydro told WyoFile. The company is asking for waivers that are “narrowly tailored to allow construction to proceed efficiently.”
“Under the BLM Resource Management Plan,” rPlus continued in a written response to WyoFile inquiries, “seasonal activity restrictions would limit construction to roughly four months per year. This constraint would significantly extend an already complex, multi-year construction effort and require repeated mobilization and demobilization of crews and equipment, adding costs and inefficiencies that would make the project uneconomical to build.”

The public comment period for FERC’s draft environmental analysis ended Friday, before the agency formally responded to the company’s new proposed alternative. Trout Unlimited and several other entities, according to Harrington, are asking FERC for additional time to review and comment on the revamped proposal. rPlus Hydro “does not oppose” additional time for public review and comments, the company said. 
Without the benefit of formally reviewing rPlus Hydro’s proposed alternative, Wyoming Game and Fish reiterated to FERC its frustration with the federal agency’s draft plan. 
“We have articulated our concerns to the project proponent and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission through numerous exchanges,” Game and Fish Director Angi Bruce wrote. “And yet our most significant concerns, direct and in-direct impacts to the Ferris-Seminoe bighorn sheep herd and the fisheries of Seminoe Reservoir, Kortes Reservoir and the Miracle Mile segment of the North Platte River continue to be inadequately addressed or disregarded in the [draft environmental impact statement].”
Seminoe project
rPlus Hydro, and its subsidiary Black Canyon Hydro, propose building a 13,400-acre-foot reservoir in the Bennett Mountains overlooking Seminoe Reservoir near the dam — one of several reservoirs on the North Platte River.
Water from Seminoe would be pumped approximately 1,000 feet uphill to the new storage facility during the day when the market price for electricity is typically cheapest, then the water would be released through hydroelectric generators in the evening when daily power demand peaks, according to the companies. The facility could generate more than 900 megawatts of electricity when operating — slightly more than the generation capacity of the Dave Johnston coal-fired power plant, and enough to power roughly 675,000 homes.

The project also requires a new bridge and about 30 miles of new power transmission line connecting to PacifiCorp’s Aeolus Substation near Medicine Bow. The estimated cost ranges from $3 billion to $5 billion, and it could take up to five years to construct, according to federal documents.
“The project will bring substantial economic benefits to the local community and will serve as an important element of Wyoming’s modernized and reliable energy infrastructure,” according to the company’s website.
State’s review, and water quality
As stakeholders await word from FERC about its next steps, Wyoming DEQ has posted technical and modeling reports regarding rPlus Hydro’s request to the state. DEQ will host a public meeting from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Jan. 21, at Casper College.
Among other water quality considerations, the agency noted “discharges of water used for power generation may influence water quality in Seminoe Reservoir, the downstream Kortes Reservoir, and the segment of the North Platte River below Kortes Dam known as the ‘Miracle Mile,’ primarily with respect to temperature.
“This segment of the North Platte River,” DEQ continued, “is designated as an Outstanding Resource Water where the existing quality is maintained and protected.”

Trout Unlimited, as well as Friends of the North Platte and other groups, worry that a potential increase in turbidity and temperature may damage the fisheries, noting that trout, in particular, are sensitive to warmer temperatures. That’s a concern for local governments that rely on fishing tourism revenue.
“Any negative impacts upon the North Platte fishery, specifically the Miracle Mile, could have a devastating impact on our tourism industry,” Casper Mayor Ray Pacheco wrote in a draft letter to FERC.
The Casper City Council, joining Natrona and Carbon county officials, objects to FERC’s currently proposed path forward for the project. 
“This project will have a substantial impact on the health, safety, welfare, custom, culture and socioeconomic viability not just of Carbon County, but Natrona County and the City of Casper,” Pacheco wrote. “It is imperative that any potential impact this project has on hunting and fishing must be considered and properly mitigated.”
rPlus Hydro reiterated to WyoFile that it “takes seriously” and “recognizes the tremendous importance of fish and other wildlife to Wyoming and to the communities surrounding the proposed Seminoe Pumped Storage Project.”
The company noted that its own study concluded “that normal project operations, under typical conditions, would not harm Miracle Mile water quality or its fishery. rPlus has agreed to operational restrictions to ensure temperature thresholds are not exceeded and that the Miracle Mile remains fully protected.”
Conservation groups, including Trout Unlimited, are not convinced. All things considered, Trout Unlimited’s Harrington told WyoFile, the project appears to require so many environmental exceptions and acknowledged fish and wildlife impacts that it is simply a bad fit for the location.

Food insecurity is soaring in the state due to inflation and other factors, food relief experts say.
The post Wyoming spent $2.4M on hunger relief during shutdown emergency appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming spent $2.4 million to supplement hunger relief efforts in the state when the government shutdown left an estimated 26,000 state residents without federal SNAP assistance this fall. 
The money, which Gov. Mark Gordon released after declaring a public welfare emergency, was distributed to 81 mobile pantries, food pantries and the Food Bank of Wyoming. Distribution amounts ranged from $1,814 to the LaBarge Food Bank to $216,280 to Needs Inc. in Cheyenne.  
With the increased purchasing power, Wyoming’s network of food relief partners were able to distribute approximately 140,000 more meals statewide compared to the same period last year, according to a Department of Family Services report.
That number underscores what food relief personnel describe as a level of food insecurity they’ve never experienced before. 
It’s hard to say something like “all-time high” because there are holes in historic data, Food Bank of Wyoming Executive Director Danica Sveda said. But that’s what it feels like. “We are experiencing food insecurity on a much higher scale than I think anyone anticipated,” she said. 
The need for nutritious food had already increased to notable levels by summertime. The trend ramped up during the holidays, Sveda said. 
Gov. Gordon touted the SNAP-related hunger relief efforts in a recent press release.
“This effort reflects Wyoming at its best,” Gordon said. “State agencies, nonprofits, churches, and volunteers worked together to take care of our neighbors.”
He added a caveat, however.

“I’m proud of that work but I want to reiterate that this need has not ended with the restart of SNAP,” Gordon said. 
Hunger insecurity and SNAP
An estimated 90,000 people in Wyoming lack reliable access to nutritious, affordable food, according to the 2025 Map the Meal Gap from Feeding America. Additionally, 26,260 children live in food-insecure homes, the report shows, a 39% increase since 2019. 
As to what’s fueling growing needs, Sveda said, “it’s largely due to inflation. Grocery store prices are incredible right now, even for people who don’t face food insecurity.”
For families whose wages haven’t risen, she said, “the cost of food is really making families make hard choices.” Most other costs of living like utilities, rent and gas are inflexible, she said, so it’s the food budget that often takes the hit.

The federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget. 
Around 29,000 people in 13,000 households receive SNAP benefits in Wyoming, according to the USDA. The average monthly benefit is around $386 per household. Children and seniors received the majority of the roughly $62 million in 2024 benefits. 
The Wyoming Department of Family Services distributes SNAP benefits on a monthly basis via reloadable EBT cards, which function like a debit card, for buying eligible food items.
As October’s government shutdown stretched toward November, the USDA announced plans to stop SNAP payments due to lack of funding. On the eve of the Nov. 1 SNAP lapse, Gordon declared a public welfare emergency, releasing state funds to prop up food assistance. 
Wyoming was unable to transfer state funds to SNAP recipients’ EBT debit cards. Instead, the executive order enabled the governor’s office to send discretionary emergency funds to charitable organizations and churches to provide food through food banks and pantries. 
A recent Department of Family Services report outlined how funds were disbursed and used during the period between Nov. 1 and Nov. 19, when Gordon’s order was rescinded.
“The funding allowed pantries to purchase a greater quantity and variety of items, especially high-demand proteins and fresh produce,” the report said.
Hunger relief programs served 74,000 individuals in November, a big jump from 53,000 in October, the report shows — “highlighting the increase in usage in November, which occurred during the federal government shutdown.” 
Rising needs
In the report, the Food Bank of Wyoming compared the November food spending of its partners to the same period last year. 
“Due to this increased purchasing power, partners were able to distribute approximately 140,000 more meals statewide compared to the same period last year,” the report said. “This dramatic increase underscores how essential this funding has been in stabilizing food access during a period of heightened need.”

The report also includes other data that indicate mounting food insecurity in the state. From September through November, calls to Wyoming’s 211 helpline related to food needs nearly doubled, the report states. 
Sveda, who spoke to WyoFile days after the Christmas holiday season ended, said that even with the buffer of emergency funds, pantries ran out of food, didn’t have enough volunteers to operate more than a few hours per week and experienced increasing numbers of people showing up for food assistance. 
SNAP benefits have resumed. Still, Food Bank of Wyoming and others are bracing for high demand to continue in 2026, she said. 
“We want to make sure that no one has to go to bed hungry, and that no one is malnourished because they couldn’t afford produce,” Sveda said. “And so looking ahead, we’re going to continue to work really hard to cultivate relationships with producers, farmers, ranchers and donors to make sure that we can keep doing this valuable work and make sure that we’re getting enough food out into the community.”

When everyone has health insurance, providers aren’t burdened with bad debt, charity care and overcrowded emergency departments, writes Barbara Sowada.
The post ‘Medicare for All’ can fix a broken system appeared first on WyoFile .","The current U.S. healthcare system is broken. 
The problem is bigger than affordability. Our system is a for-profit mishmash of disparate insurers and payment plans cobbled together in reaction to economic and political issues. The result is an increasingly unaffordable, ineffective, confusing mess, which frustrates patients, doctors and hospitals alike.

Opinion

The solution is “Medicare for All.” 
It would bring high quality, affordable care to everyone. You wouldn’t lose your health insurance if you lose your job, move, get divorced, age out, or make too much money. A catastrophic illness or injury wouldn’t plunge you into medical debt. It lets you choose your doctors and hospitals, improves your access to healthcare services regardless of where you live, reduces health disparities, and improves the health of individuals and our communities. 
Studies show that having health insurance is strongly correlated with more disease prevention, better chronic disease management, less infant and maternal mortality, and greater longevity.
Medicare for All builds on and expands traditional Medicare, which is well liked, to provide comprehensive benefits — medical, prescription drugs, mental health, dental, vision, hearing and long-term care to every person in the U.S. With everyone covered in the same plan, care is affordable. There are no insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs, copays, deductibles, coinsurance, surprise bills, nor network restrictions.
The benefits to doctors and hospitals are significant. With Medicare for All, a single-payer system, billing is standardized and streamlined, saving an estimated $40 billion annually. Providers are paid the same for the same service, instead of payment varying by geography and insurer. When everyone has health insurance, providers aren’t burdened with bad debt, charity care and overcrowded emergency departments.
Opponents claim Medicare for All is too expensive and would raise taxes. The fact is we cannot afford not to implement Medicare for All. America has the most expensive healthcare system in the world, an estimated $5.3 trillion was spent in 2024. 
Broken down, the average cost to insure a family of four was about $29,000 — $3,564 out of pocket, $6,296 in premiums and $19,276 in employer contributions, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker, which monitors the U.S. health system’s performance. 
In other words, those premiums are a kind of tax. Right now, we are all paying for each other’s health insurance. For instance, employer contributions are indirectly subsidized by us, paid for through higher prices when we buy the company’s goods or services, and are directly subsidized by the worker, through reduced compensation to offset what employers spend on employees’ health insurance.
The U.S. spends almost twice as much as comparable countries who have healthcare for all — $13,432 per person versus an average $7,393, using 2023 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data. Yet, our health outcomes are poorer by all major metrics. Here’s the kicker — 60% of U.S. healthcare costs come from tax dollars. Sixty percent of $13,432 equals $8,059 — still more than our counterparts pay for better healthcare. We pay much more because the U.S. is not a unified system but a conglomeration of competing, for-profit parts. Costs cannot be controlled in a for-profit system, only shifted. 
Motivated by quarterly growth, the U.S. healthcare system functions much like the children’s game of musical chairs. Insurers, big Pharma, hospitals and doctors compete with each other, expecting their profits to grow quarterly. Comparable countries keep their costs low because they are not motivated by quarterly growth, investor dividends and stock buybacks. 
Their healthcare systems are funded through some form of income-based progressive taxes, or a combination of progressive taxes and limited household contributions. Everyone is automatically covered and costs are controlled through a systemwide budget, known as a global budget, which unites all parts of the system and spreads the money equitably so hospitals don’t go broke, nor eliminate services. All communities, including rural communities, have access to necessary care.
You don’t have to be a fan of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders to see that his proposed Medicare for All legislation is a good step in the right direction — a move toward a single-payer system that provides comprehensive coverage to all Americans, regardless of income or health status. To control costs, Medicare for All must be explicitly a non-profit system, integrated by a global budget. It also must be adequately funded. Medicare for All, however, will not be welcomed by those who are profiting from the current system. They have the money to lobby Congress, and disinform the public, to maintain the status quo. If we want affordable healthcare, then Medicare for All is worth fighting for.
Piecemeal reform, whether at the state or national level, can only bring us more of the same: rising costs and diminishing returns.

(Getty Images)Idaho will receive nearly $930 million over the next five years to improve rural health care access and affordability. 
The massive federal tax and spending package approved in July included $50 billion for “Rural Healthcare Transformation” grants nationwide. 
Idaho on Dec. 30 was awarded nearly $186 million in annual grants to be distributed over five years to implement the plan outlined in its grant application, which focuses on five initiatives: “improve rural access to care through technology; ensure accessible quality care through innovative models; sustain rural workforce with training, recruitment, and retention; implement population-specific, evidence-based projects to make rural America healthy again; and invest in rural health infrastructure and partnerships.”  
“For many Idaho families – especially in rural areas – affordable, accessible health care is a real concern,” Gov. Brad Little said in a press release. “This investment, made possible by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, recognizes those challenges and puts resources where they’re needed most. It helps strengthen local health care and ensures Idahoans can get the affordable care they need, no matter where they live.” 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare submitted the state’s application with consultation from a task force convened by Little. 
The state will use the funds to provide subgrants to support the goals and projects outlined in its application. 
“A budget request will now go before the Legislature for federal funds approval,” the press release said, “and additional details about implementation will be shared as they become available.” 
 Idaho plans to use technology to improve rural access to care

The state’s application includes plans to conduct assessments on rural health care facilities to identify gaps, develop shared infrastructure among clients and to invest in equipment, software and training to expand telehealth options. 
The state plans to help procure mobile apps and online portals to help Idahoan patients for “self-monitoring, appointment scheduling, medication adherence, and coaching.” Investments in cybersecurity improvements, AI clinical tools, emergency system upgrades, and health management and analytics systems are also included in the plan.  
The goals to achieve by 2030 include increasing the number of facilities utilizing telehealth by 50%, increasing the percentage of physicians located in each of Idaho’s rural counties that are connected to the new Health Alert Network (HAN) to at least 80%, and increasing the number of appointments completed using telehealth or remote delivery modality by 50%.
 Idaho’s plan to use ‘innovative models’ includes diagnostic kiosks, workforce programs 

Idaho’s grant application outlines plans to deploy kiosks and pods in rural communities in places such as libraries, grocery stores and pharmacies where people may attend a telehealth appointment or receive mail-order prescriptions in lockers.
To address workforce shortages in rural areas, the plan proposes to further utilize health care professionals who aren’t doctors, such as emergency medical services, or EMS, responders. The plan said it may use funds to create designated locations where these professionals could hold in-person contact hours or offer apprenticeships. Funds would also be used to develop a Community Health Emergency Medical Services plan and allow trained EMS professionals to perform check-ups and wellness assessments in homes.
Funds may be targeted at recruitment, retention and training of EMS professionals. 
Goals include increasing the percentage of Idaho’s rural counties that have at least one county-level full-time equivalent paid EMS position from 28% in October 2025 to at least 97% by December 2030 and to decrease the percentage of emergency responses to repeat users (those who received services more than more than once in a year) from 32% in 2013-2016 to less than 10% by December 2030. 
 Funds may target incentives on medical education, training and retention in rural areas

Most of Idaho is rural, and the entire state is experiencing a significant shortage in doctors, especially in certain areas such as obstetrics and gynecology. The state does not have a public medical school in its borders, but it has some state-sponsored seats at the University of Washington and University of Utah medical schools. 
Both graduate and undergraduate medical students can do required training rotations in Idaho, and increasing opportunities for these clinic rotations in Idaho has been a focus of a recent task force looking to boost medical education in the state. 
The application includes financial incentives for doctors who commit to working in rural areas for at least five years, including signing bonuses and retention bonuses. There would also be money put toward health care education scholarships to students who would commit to serving in rural areas upon graduation, and support for physicians who train undergraduate or graduate medical students. 
Using the federal grant to support medical training in rural areas was an idea floated by the Idaho Medical Education Working Group, the Idaho Capital Sun reported in September. 
 Projects to deploy address chronic disease, mental health, maternal health 

Within Idaho’s initiative to “make rural America healthy again,” are projects to implement national standards and screening to try and prevent chronic health conditions, improve mental health and substance abuse treatment and address shortages in maternal and child health services. 
Projects include the National Diabetes Prevention program to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, and diabetes self-management education and support programs, as well as enhanced screening and education about Alzheimer’s and related dementias, and cancer, heart disease and other chronic conditions. 
Funds could be used for initial start-up costs for a pediatric psychiatry access line, so that pediatricians may be able to consult with child psychiatrists, according to the application. Other efforts could include providing space for mental health treatment in schools, expanding mobile crisis response teams and mobile medication assisted treatment for substance abuse, and to complete a needs assessment of maternal and neonatal care. 
Goals include decreasing the number of deaths from suicide, drug overdose, and alcoholism by 25% from 1,216 in 2023 to 912 or fewer by December 2030 and increasing the number of rural hospitals completing one or more new perinatal collaborative initiatives from zero to eight by December 2030. 
 Infrastructure investments may include equipment, vehicle and mobile screening units 

The planned investments in rural health care infrastructure include supporting renovations of facilities that would facilitate prevention programs, behavioral health treatment, dental and maternal health services. 
The funds could also be used to modernize facilities with the purchase of equipment such as MRIs, CT scanners, equipment for compounding pharmaceuticals and other items that would allow rural residents access to higher-level care without having to travel to a larger community. 
The application includes a plan to purchase mobile mammography units to offer breast cancer screenings in areas where they are not offered, and to help clinics and facilities retrofit vehicles to use for patient transportation. 
The application included a commitment to strengthen its partnership with the five federally recognized Native American tribes in Idaho, as well as to set aside 3.5% of its total grant to support tribal health care facilities and projects intended to improve services for Native American residents.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Candidates in a crowded Republican field vying for their party’s nomination to fill a vacant Arkansas state Senate seat already agree on many issues, from lowering taxes to supporting abortion restrictions — but they are especially united in their opposition to the 3,000-bed Franklin County prison project.
The GOP candidates facing off in a five-way primary Tuesday include a former member of the state House of Representatives, a gas utility community affairs coordinator and three businesspeople.
They’re hoping to serve the remaining term of a Republican lawmaker who was a vocal opponent of a project that has roiled this rural community 45 minutes from Fort Smith so much that one critic has placed placards and fake skeletons across from the prison site in protest of it.
Whoever wins the GOP nomination will go on to face Adam Watson, an independent, in the special general election held on March 3. If none of the candidates win an outright majority, the top two advance to a runoff Feb. 3.
The seat became vacant in September, after the death of Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch, who was among the lawmakers who voted against the prison’s construction when it was repeatedly rejected during last year’s legislative session.
Stubblefield’s seat has been the focus of a lawsuit over Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ decision to schedule the election for his successor in June. The move prompted complaints that the timing would have left voters without representation in this year’s legislative session, when the prison project is likely to come up. Sanders eventually moved up the election after being ordered to do so by a judge.
The candidates are:

Former state Rep. Mark Berry
Wade Dunn, a businessman
Brad Simon, a businessman
Stacie Smith, community affairs coordinator for Arkansas Oklahoma Gas
Ted Tritt, a businessman

 Prison 
The five candidates said in interviews and during a candidate forum in Booneville last month that they believed spending on the prison was irresponsible, citing issues obtaining water at the 815-acre site, lack of an available workforce and lack of input.
Berry, who represented House District 26 when the prison was announced in October 2024, said the prison issue has been “poorly handled” by state officials, expressing frustration with how he was informed about it. Generally, Berry was in support of building a new prison — just not in Franklin County, and possibly not as large either — and for increasing state spending on public safety.
“One thousand to 1,500 beds would be adequate, with the ability to expand that prison as we actually need it,” Berry said. He added that expanding Calico Rock was another potential option.
Dunn, who has been endorsed by Stubblefield’s family, criticized the surprise announcement of the prison site as “sneaky” and “underhanded,” before adding that he would never be in favor of it.
He also proposed an alternate location, saying Mountainburg, just off Interstate 49’s Exit 29, could draw on Fort Smith and the northwest Arkansas region for employees.
Simon said the state would be better off using that money to address the number of inmates who return to prison after being released, a root cause for the state’s prison bed shortage.
“We invest about $5 million a year on our reentry program,” Simon said. “We could spend $100 million on reentry programs, and it wouldn’t even be a drop in the bucket to what that prison’s going to cost.”
Tritt disputed there was an overcrowding problem. He said there needed to be a greater focus on providing additional support for people locked up for nonviolent crimes and those with mental health issues.
Smith said in an emailed statement that she could not support spending “$1 billion on a 3,000-bed prison when our state has so many other needs.”
Taxes and priorities
The Republican hopefuls sounded similar on other issues. The four who spoke at the forum cited lowering income or property taxes as a priority if elected, while also saying such cuts had to be fiscally responsible.
Dunn said, if elected, he would push to eliminate property taxes for veterans and those over the age of 65.
“They’ve contributed a tax base to the tax base for 40 years, paid for their homes, paid for their property, but they still have to rent it from the government,” Dunn said.
Simon said cutting regulations and taxes were his top priorities, along with reducing spending, arguing those moves would expand the economy.
Berry supported eliminating income taxes, especially the corporate income tax.
Tritt also agreed with continuing to cut Arkansans’ taxes. But he also said listening to constituents would be most important, because “people don’t feel like their voices have been heard” in Little Rock.
Tritt said he was also concerned with a recent Arkansas Supreme Court ruling that legislators can alter or repeal constitutional amendments passed by voters with a two-thirds majority in each chamber.
“We’re gonna have to have some fighters there [in the Legislature] that’s going to stand up for the Constitution,” Tritt said.
Smith said her top priority other than the prison was strengthening workforce development via “vocational training, apprenticeships, and partnerships with local businesses.”

We’ll be watching everything from health care reforms and support for the state’s foster children to economic development plans and policies that could shape the state’s energy economy for years to come.
The legislative session is a chaotic period for both news and the public. It’s when laws are made and priorities for the state’s government throughout the next year are set.
We at West Virginia Watch wanted to take some time here before session begins on Jan. 14 to prepare our readers for what they will see from us throughout the 60 days, explain how processes work and ensure they know what tools and resources exist to help them navigate the often confusing proceedings that are about to take place.
Please read on to help keep yourself informed about what we’re tracking over the legislative process and feel free to reach out to any of our reporters if you have questions about the legislative process, our work or anything else.

A quick rundown on how session works
Lawmakers are expected to gavel in for the first day of the 60-day session on Wednesday, Jan. 14. That evening, Gov. Patrick Morrisey will deliver his second State of the State address, where he will lay out the legislative priorities he wants to see lawmakers address throughout the rest of session.
Once session starts, any lawmaker in either the state House of Delegates or Senate can introduce bills they would like to see their colleagues consider. After being introduced in the lawmaker’s chamber, the bill will be referred to the committee process.
In the Senate, the process is simple: each bill is referred to at least one committee, where lawmakers will discuss it, invite testimony on it and introduce potential amendments to change it. If a bill is passed out of committee, it will return to the entire Senate for consideration.
In the House, new rules introduced last year restructured the committee process. There, bills are referred to more specific subcommittees that operate under the larger committee. For example, under the House Education Committee are subcommittees for educational choice, higher education and public education. Members from the larger House Education committee serve in smaller groups on the subcommittees.
Each subcommittee in the House will consider a bill for at least two days. The first day it is introduced in the subcommittee will serve as a “public hearing,” where members of the public and stakeholders either request to speak on bills or are invited by lawmakers to do so. Individuals should reach out to committee chairs for each subcommittee to request to speak. 
The second day is when lawmakers will markup and discuss the legislation at hand, offering amendments as they see fit. At the end of that process, they will recommend whether or not the bill should be passed by the larger standing committee. The overarching committee will hold its own public comment period and discussion and markup of the bill before voting whether or not to advance it to the full House for passage.
After going through the committee process, legislation introduced in both chambers will be reintroduced — usually on second reading — in front of the entire body they originated in. Lawmakers at this point can offer amendments to bills that must be approved by a majority of the whole chamber. After a third reading and if a bill is approved by a majority of lawmakers, it will advance; the House will send their passed bills to the Senate and vice versa for passage.
Generally, this process continues until both chambers agree on and pass the same version of the bill to send on to the governor for approval. Once received, he can either sign the bill, veto it or allow it to become law without signature.
There are, of course, exceptions to all of these processes — either the House or the Senate can vote to suspend rules and change proceedings with enough votes, for example.
Overall, it’s most worth watching a bill once it is assigned to a committee. That shows that the bill is gaining traction and at least has enough support from a committee chair to be discussed and featured on an agenda.
Keep in mind, there are thousands of bills introduced each year. Only some of those advance through the committee process and even fewer become law. For example, out of 2,460 bills introduced last session only 249 — just over 10% — are actually considered completed legislation, meaning they became law or were vetoed by the governor.
WHAT WE’LL BE FOLLOWING
School funding formula woes, paying for the voucher program 
Many lawmakers represent counties losing public schools due largely to West Virginia’s shrinking population. Seventeen school closures have been approved so far this year, according to an analysis from the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. Sixteen public schools closed in 2024.
Schools get less money from the state when there are fewer students in classrooms, spurring financial concerns as they try to serve those who remain. 
State lawmakers have floated the idea of changing the state school aid funding formula, which hasn’t been updated in years, to better serve counties that are dealing with declining student enrollment. Adjusting the complicated school funding formula could be challenging in the 60-day session window.

School superintendents last month told lawmakers that they’d like to see a funding increase in the formula for professional and service personnel salaries so they can retain necessary teachers and staff despite declining population. 
The funding formula also doesn’t account for special education services, which are costly to the school system. Special education students now make up around 25% of the state’s student population, according to the state school board. 
Lawmakers will also have to figure out how to pay for the Hope Scholarship, the state’s broad school voucher program, that is expected to cost around $230 million. Some Republicans have already raised concerns that the program cost is ballooning out of control, and House Democrats are expected to introduce bills that would put guard rails on how the money can be spent, like banning use of Hope funds in out-of-state schools. 
Morrisey, lawmakers want changes for troubled foster care system
Republicans in the House and Senate have already said they’ll introduce at least 16 pieces of legislation focused on fixing the state’s troubled foster care system. Several of the measures focus on beefing up accountability for Child Protective Services, including a measure that would require CPS workers to wear body cameras.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has touted improvements to child welfare under his watch, but lawmakers are still concerned about how the state is handling foster care cases for around 6,000 kids. 
Many of the measures would require funding.
Morrisey plans to work with the Legislature on one of the proposed bills that would create a fund to bring hundreds of out-of-state foster children back to West Virginia. The money would be used to open in-state beds in state-owned facilities. There are more than 300 foster children from West Virginia in facilities across the country.

Senate President Randy Smith wants to see data center bill challenges addressed, others may not
One of the largest pieces of legislation passed in the 2025 regular session was House Bill 2014, dubbed the Power Generation and Consumption Act. The law aims to recruit the establishment of data centers in West Virginia. It also allows for the creation of microgrids — relatively small power sources that are not connected to existing electric utilities. 
The law created a specialized tax structure for certain data centers and microgrids, meaning all but 30% of property tax revenues generated by the facilities is diverted outside of the community they operate in. It also stops localities from enforcing any zoning requirements or other policies against the developments, meaning local governments have no control in how they operate.
Several companies are currently attempting to construct microgrids and data centers throughout West Virginia. Residents in some of these communities have been outspoken against the developments, citing concerns over environmental and health impacts and lamenting the lack of local control their governments have over the facilities and the costs that could be associated with them.
It’s possible this session could see revisions to the data center and microgrid bill, in part due to these residents’ concerns.
Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, told his constituents in Tucker County in November that he had a “hard time” voting for HB 2014. As Senate president, he continued, he could have killed the bill but doing so would have been “hard” on his “political career” since it was a priority from Morrisey.
He said that “local control is a big issue” within the bill, and something that members of the state Senate “want to address.” 
At a news conference last month, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw was less direct about addressing concerns that have stemmed from the bill and the developments proposed following its passage. He said that, since it had been less than a year since the law went into effect, it was difficult to know the real impacts HB 2014 could have. 
“I’m sure that it’s among the things we’ll talk about when we convene next month,” he told reporters.
Meanwhile, Morrisey told reporters last month that he doesn’t believe concerns shared by locals who would be most affected by proposed data centers — and who have stood up consistently at rallies, public hearings, in lawsuits and more decrying them — are fair. He called them a “couple people” who were “engaging in scare tactics” and urged the public to instead celebrate how potential future proceeds from data center developments could help cut taxes.

School vaccination policy still unclear legislatively
Every year, lawmakers introduce bills to loosen the state’s strict school vaccination requirements. While states generally require school students to be vaccinated against several infectious diseases like whooping cough, polio and measles, West Virginia is one of only five states that do not allow families to opt out of that requirement for religious or philosophical objections. 
State law currently allows exemptions for only medical reasons. An executive order from Gov. Patrick Morrisey is at odds with the state’s school vaccine law, but he says the order is permissible under another law, the Equal Protection for Religion Act. A case at the heart of the debate is set to be reviewed by the West Virginia Supreme Court.
Last year, the Senate approved a bill that would have codified Morrisey’s executive order, but the House of Delegates ultimately rejected it. 
While some lawmakers have said they’d support or introduce bills that would put religious exemptions into state code or even get rid of the vaccine requirements altogether, the chair of the House of Delegates health committee told West Virginia Watch changing the school vaccine law is “not a priority” as the debate makes its way through the courts. Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, chair of the Senate Health Committee, said this session’s legislation should come from the House after delegates rejected last year’s bill. 
PEIA remains unstable
West Virginia state employees continue to face rising health care costs. The Public Employees Insurance Agency recently approved a 3% rate increase effective July 1 for state employees, local government workers and retirees who are on their health care plans. For state employees, a monthly spousal surcharge will increase by an average of $200 per month.
Last year, PEIA raised rates by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. Retirees also saw a 12% increase in premiums. 
The 2025 legislative session saw few PEIA-related bills. Morrisey last summer said he planned to call a special session to address the issues, but the session never materialized.

State employee pay raises as part of economic development
Morrisey has said his budget proposal will include raises for all state workers, but he’s not said how much. Morrisey told reporters he wants to work with state lawmakers on the proposal. 
“In my budget for fiscal year 2027, we will have a pay raise for state employees. Period,” Morrisey told reporters at a news conference Dec. 11. “That’s going to include teachers, that’s going to include school service personnel, that’s going to include our hard working state police and so many of the people — the correction officers — who are working hard every day to make West Virginia a better place to live, to work and to play.”
Republican leaders in the House of Delegates have proposed legislation that would increase pay for state teachers and school service personnel. 
State treasurer Larry Pack said he’s backing legislation that would have all teachers in the state making at least $50,000. Teachers who already make that amount should get a $2,000 raise, he said. 
House Republicans want to see more economic development overall 
At a news conference last month, Republicans in the state House of Delegates said they want to see economic development and job creation dominate their legislative agenda.
Specifics for the plan so far are relatively vague and they will likely remain that way until legislation is introduced showing details. The approach, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw said in December, will focus on three pillars: job training, workforce development and retention; investment in “job-creating businesses” and, lastly, practicing “responsible economic growth.”
Hanshaw said the state will see more resources put toward the aviation industry, both in manufacturing and operations. 
The House will also see the “Recharge West Virginia Act” introduced, which Hanshaw said will “support” local businesses in the state that increase their staffing.
Other legislation will be the TEAM-WV Act, an acronym meaning Technology, Energy, Aviation and Manufacturing. The act, Hanshaw said, is modeled under the same guiding principles of the nearby JobsOhio. In West Virginia, the potential bill would propose creating a “competitive, statewide” nonprofit to help form a more “cohesive” approach for developing sites for industry and growing partnerships between sectors.
Another attempt at Certificate of Need repeal 
For years, advocates and special interest groups have been lobbying the Legislature to repeal the state’s Certificate of Need process. Even after years of having a Republican supermajority control both chambers of the Legislature under Republican governors, they’ve been met with little luck.
Last year, that trend continued as legislation proposing to repeal the process again failed, this time laying bare a political power struggle largely between Morrisey and members of the House.
CON has been on West Virginia’s books since 1977. It’s a regulatory process, overseen by the West Virginia Health Care Authority, that requires entities looking to create or expand health care services to receive a legal document proving those new services fit an unmet need in the area.
Through the Health Care Authority, those interested in obtaining a CON receive technical assistance before applying to see what needs they are meeting. Services are approved through a needs methodology and different services — such as hospice care, ambulatory centers, clinics, private practices and specialty services — have different methodologies.
Morrisey announced during his first State of the State address last year that he wanted to see the entirety of this process repealed. He called it “big government activism at its worst” and said that repealing it would allow the state’s health care industry to “move toward the free market.”
But those who work in health care have been critical of removing CON laws as more than 75% of patients in West Virginia are government payers, meaning their health insurance comes from the Public Employees Insurance Agency, Medicare or Medicaid.

If CON is repealed, these critics say, there would be no guarantee facilities that come into the state would cater to these patients, as those programs reimburse less for services than private insurers.
Legislation to remove CON laws have been introduced annually for at least a decade. Most never gained traction. 
Last year, the legislation — HB 2007 — served as one of the first tests for Morrisey’s influence in the Legislature, and specifically among members of the House. Several lawmakers who held concerns about repealing the certificate of need process told members of the media, in interviews and elsewhere, that they did not appreciate the strategies employed by the governor and his staff while they attempted to whip votes in support of the legislation.
House Health voted down HB 2007 early last session, meaning it never went to the full House for consideration. While Del. Chris Anders, R-Berkeley, attempted to discharge the bill from the Health Committee and to the House floor for another vote later in session, he yet again failed as all but 16 members voted overwhelmingly to kill the legislation one last time.
It’s likely CON repeal in some form will again be up for consideration in the Legislature as it has been for the last decade. Specifics on the proposed policy, however, will only be clear once a bill is introduced.



There are several resources that can help the public stay on top of what happens at the Legislature every day and most can be found online at https://www.wvlegislature.gov/ Here are some quick tools you can use this legislative session:

Bill tracking: Using either the bill number, sponsor or keywords, you are able to search for bills that have been introduced during session and see where they are in the legislative process. This is a good way to see what bills have been introduced on certain topics or what issues certain lawmakers are tackling.
The Legislative Calendar outlines important days and deadlines to keep note of throughout the legislative session, including the last day to introduce new bills, when rulemaking should happen and more.
Bulletin Board: Checking this in the morning allows the public to access expected calendars for both the House and the Senate. Links to scheduled committee meetings are available for each chamber as well as the chamber calendars, which detail what bills are expected to come up throughout that day and where they are in the process.
WV Legislature Blog: Staff for the Legislature work each day to write brief blog reports showing what happened under the dome, from subcommittees to the chambers. This is a great way to stay up-to-date on some of the more policy-focused decisions made during session that may not always be covered by news outlets.
Activity Calendar: Over the 60 days, different organizations and groups will set up throughout the Capitol’s upper and lower rotunda hosting advocacy days. They are there to educate the public, meet with lawmakers and lobby for and against legislation to support their causes. The activity calendar lists what advocacy days are scheduled for 2026.
Contacting your legislator: Both the House and the Senate have complete lists of currently serving lawmakers on the Legislature’s website. These profiles include contact information for the lawmakers, their districts, what committees they serve on and bills they’ve sponsored so far in the session.

(Photo by Lora Wobbema/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s farmers are looking for higher profits but things may get worse before they get better, ag industry experts say. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture in December announced its Farmer Bridge Assistance, a payment program to help farmers survive what was a disastrous 2025 for many producers. 
North Dakota has set up its own loan programs to help farmers through economic hardship and to recover from storms that wiped out storage bins, making producers more dependent on short-term markets. 
Bank of North Dakota President Don Morgan said there is “prolonged stress” on the ag industry, and 2026 will likely not provide much relief when it comes to profits. 
He said the loans backed by the state-owned bank are not just meant to get farmers into 2026 but also into 2027. 
Morgan said the bank will help farmers with “as much as a working capital break as we can.” The bank is taking applications until June 30, 2026. 
The Bank of North Dakota allocated $37 million in loans to help rebuild grain storage and provide temporary storage. Another $300 million loan program aims to help farmers who lost money in 2024 and 2025. The bank also made available another $100 million in loans to help farmers pay for storing grain that has not been sold from the 2025 harvest. 
Bank of North Dakota commits $400 million ‘lifeline’ to ag producers

As of mid-December, the bank had funded more than 100 loans under those programs, with about 30 applications pending.
Looking at the big picture, Bryon Parman, agriculture finance specialist with North Dakota State University Extension, said the frequency of bailout programs for farmers raises concerns about deeper problems. 
“These ad hoc programs have started to become the rule more so than the exception,” Parman said. His comments came after the Trump administration announced the bridge payment program. 
“The fact that you need them over and over and over again, there’s some issues,” Parman said. 
Much of the blame for poor crop prices, especially in soybeans, has been blamed on the Trump administration’s trade war with China, a key market for North Dakota soybeans. 
But Parman said he saw signs of weakness in the ag economy even when farm revenue was high in 2022.  He said in that year, the rate of return on major assets and equity was relatively low to some previous boom years.
Parman said farmers are paying $10,000 and sometimes $20,000 an acre for land. 
But the land “doesn’t make all that much money, which, as an economist, doesn’t make any sense,” he said. 
Morgan said land values are being supported by large ag operations that are able to borrow more money, from out-of-state interests and the perception of scarcity. 
“They aren’t making any more of it,” Morgan said of farmland. 
Owning land that’s of high value does help a farmer’s balance sheet, Parman said, but high land values also make it hard for younger farmers to expand and be profitable doing it. 
Unlike drought years or other natural disasters, Parman said crop yields have been pretty good. 
“Prices have been an issue, but mainly they’ve been an issue because our costs are so high,” Parman. 
Federal ag payments address ‘crisis situation’ but trade still key, North Dakota groups say

Fertilizer prices are staying high in part because of competition for fertilizer from other parts of the world that are trying to improve their ag production, such as South America and India, Parman said. 
In addition, China, a major supplier of fertilizer, has been exporting less, he said.  
Mark Watne, who last year ended a 12-year run as president of the North Dakota Farmers Union, said he recently visited farms in Brazil and was impressed by their ability to increase production. 
Brazil’s advances in agriculture and soybean production have allowed it to fulfill much of China’s demand. That means China has become less reliant on soybeans from the United States. 
“Without even chopping down more rainforest, they can expand,” Watne said of Brazil  “So I think it’s worrisome. I think we may become more of a residual supplier (to China) than we really want to be.” 
One area of relief is declines in the prices of fuel and lubricants as well as lower interest rates, but are not enough to offset the increases in other categories. 
“Most major crops will see a cost increase of between 1.5% and 2% from 2025-2026,” Parman wrote in a November article published by NDSU  “While this would not be considered a large increase, given current crop prices, any increase at all will be difficult to absorb financially for many producers.”

(Photo: Benjamin Pounds for Tennessee Lookout)Seventeen years have passed since a massive rupture at a Tennessee Valley Authority plant spilled more than 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash into Harriman, Tenn., but the event is still raw in Jessica Waller’s mind.
Waller’s father, Ernest Hickman, a union contractor for Jacobs Engineering Group, worked on cleanup of the spill.
Hickman died of emphysema, which Waller attributes to his contact with the ash over a six-year cleanup period — specifically beryllium, a naturally occurring metal used in the nuclear, automotive and aerospace industries, and arsenic, which is used in metal, technology and some medical uses. 
Both are present in coal fly ash and are highly toxic.
She believes her mother, Patsy Hickman, also got ill from exposure after washing her husband’s clothes and other activities putting her in contact with the ash, causing her death of respiratory failure.

“It’s sad to know there’s a lot of people even here in Tennessee in the area who have no idea about the coal ash spill,” Waller said. “Or they do but they didn’t know the extent of the devastation that it caused, especially health-wise of making so many people sick.” 
Lunches on the coal ash
A dike at the Kingston Fossil Plant broke on the morning of Dec. 22, 2008, releasing 5.4 million cubic yards, or 1.1 billion gallons, of wet ash stored in the pond behind it. 
The ash, a byproduct of burning coal, spilled as sludge into the Swan Pond Embayment and Emory River and covered 300 acres, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Ernest Hickman was one of the first workers cleaning up the site, just one or two days after the spill. Hickman, Waller said, first worked in the spilled ash sludge keeping pumps running to suck it up. Later he shoveled it around to different locations including rail cars. His last month there was in April 2014 when the spill material “finally got from the mush to dust,” Waller said.
Coal ash contains 26 toxins including ones that cause cancer, are heavy metals or are radioactive. The workers’ training materials mentioned risks from arsenic and silica but not other risks from other materials like lead, cobalt, uranium, radium, lithium or molybdenum.
Waller said Jacobs didn’t allow respirators or masks and gave false information.
“(Workers) were told that you could eat a pound of it a day and it not even hurt you,” she said. 
TVA footed the bill for workers to have luncheons at tables underneath tents “right on the coal ash.” Wind, Waller said, blew the dust around, getting it in their food and drink.
“That’s because they trusted them,” she said of why the workers ate at these lunches. “And that trust was broken.”
“He would come home with his nose full of white stuff,” Waller said of her father during the ash cleanup. “He’d be coughing up black stuff.”
Jacobs Engineering settles Kingston coal ash case

Both of her parents, Waller said, started developing respiratory illnesses in the years after the cleanup, followed by her mother’s cardiovascular issues. She said her mother fell ill in 2014 and her father in 2016 and that their symptoms such as mini strokes “mimicked each other.”
“They got to where they couldn’t walk,” she said. “They couldn’t talk.” 
She got her father a sippy cup so that he could still enjoy Pepsi.
Ernest Hickman began “falling all the time.” Waller quit her job and delayed going back to school to be a licensed practical nurse to focus on caring for her parents instead. 
Ernest Hickman died on Dec. 4, 2016, and Patsy Hickman on Sept. 19, 2018. They were in their 50s; other Jacobs workers who died were younger.
“Question everything.”
“This was all covered in the ash,” she said in December, pointing to soccer fields near a historic marker in Swan Pond Sports Complex at the former spill site. 
Close to the 17th  anniversary, Waller placed her parents’ portraits next to another nearby monument, a cross meant to represent those including her parents, killed by toxins.
She is still worried about contaminants still in nearby bodies of water, and her grief flares near the holidays.
“I do have a hard time with Thanksgiving and Christmas,” Waller said. She still decorates a tree on Nov. 1 like her mother, whose favorite holiday was Christmas, did.
She remembers her father making drawings using his computer’s “basic paint program,” including one that included an image of the Earth describing Jacobs and another company, Bechtel, as doing “environmental cleanup around the globe.”

Waller didn’t conclude the ash was a cause for her parents’ illness until after her mother’s death. Then she went on a “binge” of research on ash toxins. She connected with Janie Clark, whose husband had worked on the spill cleanup and died. 
Waller met more spill workers and their families through a Facebook group. She compared her parents’ experience to that of others and then checked with doctors who’d treated other workers.
She said she got compensation from a lawsuit filed against Jacobs, settled in 2018 — Jacobs appealed the decision until 2023 — although she said the plaintiffs were “let down” by how long it took. Since then she’s told her story as a way to handle her grief he’s told her story for two years which she said helped her handle her grief for her parents and anger at TVA and Jacobs.
Waller said she hoped people could learn to be more skeptical of people in power and big corporations.
“Question everything,” she said, adding she likes to get second opinions in her nursing work.
Coal ash, she said, despite current talk of reviving the coal industry,  is “definitely not safe” and that moving it around will “contaminate everywhere.” 
She and Clark talk at least once per week.
“Nobody understands the type of grief that we are dealing with,” she said of herself and Clark. “We were the ones that witnessed the suffering.”

(Photo by Chad Riley/Getty Images)Idaho’s endowment forests are often the subject of passionate public conversation, and that is a good thing. These lands support Idaho’s public schools and other institutions and are managed – by Idahoans – with care and scientific rigor. 
Who benefits from the state’s school endowment fund? Idaho students or the forest products industry?

A recent op-ed about Priest Lake includes several misconceptions about how the Idaho Department of Lands (IDL) and the State Board of Land Commissioners (Land Board) manage these trust lands. As stewards of Idaho’s endowment lands, we want to set the record straight. 
The endowment assets are managed as a unified trust with the Endowment Fund Investment Board managing the financial assets and Idaho Department of Lands managing and protecting the land assets. Both entities are under the supervision of the Land Board. 
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands is clear-cutting “senescent forests” and converting them into tree farms.

FACT: The term senescent forest refers to stands in a state of biological decline. IDL does not manage endowment forests to reach senescence. As a trust land manager, IDL maintains forests in productive, healthy, actively growing conditions to ensure long-term revenue and ecological resilience. Regeneration harvests, including clearcuts in appropriate locations, are recognized, science-based silvicultural tools that help restore young, vigorous stands while protecting soils, water quality, and wildlife habitat for the long-term.
IDL is not converting forests into “tree farms.” Our forests are managed for long-term sustainability, ecological function, and consistent revenue for beneficiaries. 
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands has adopted a blanket 40–45 year timber rotation, similar to timber management on the West Coast.

FACT: This is an oversimplification. While IDL does use the Forest Projection System (FPS, developed by the Forest Biometric Research Institute) as one of several tools for forest growth modeling, rotation ages are set based on site productivity and inventory data from field measurements and LiDAR analysis, not an arbitrary timeframe.
In Idaho’s diverse landscape, high-productivity sites may reach commercial maturity in around 35 years. Others may require 85 years or more.
Most endowment forest stands fall somewhere between.
Rotation age is determined by site-specific biological growth, sustainability modeling, and long-term revenue considerations — not by a single statewide target.  
 MYTH: Timber harvests on endowment land are not sustainable or cannot support long-term revenue.

FACT: Sustainability is built into the trust mandate. Idaho’s endowment forests are managed under a sustained yield framework, ensuring that harvest levels remain stable over time, forest health is maintained, and timber revenues continue for future generations of beneficiaries.
Many Priest Lake stands are harvested after reaching maturity following timber harvests or stand replacing wildfires from decades ago.
 MYTH: Revenue from endowment lands is only intended for public schools, and contributions are “token.”

FACT: Public schools are the largest beneficiary, but not the only one. By law and by trust structure, endowment lands support:

Public schools
Agricultural College
Charitable Institutions
Normal School
Penitentiary
School of Science
State Hospital South
University of Idaho
Capitol Permanent Fund

Endowment lands and funds form a unified trust corpus, established by the United States at statehood. The state of Idaho — through the Land Board as trustee — has a fiduciary responsibility to manage these assets for all named beneficiaries.
Revenue from timber currently represents over 90% of annual income from land management, but Idaho’s endowment also includes 1.5 million acres of other revenue-producing lands and a highly diversified investment portfolio managed by the Endowment Fund Investment Board (EFIB).
The fund’s performance is among the strongest and most transparent public land trusts in the country.
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands is “putting all its eggs in one basket” by relying on timber and acquiring additional timberlands.

FACT: This characterization misrepresents Idaho’s trust structure and investment strategy.
The land portfolio is increasingly diversified through commercial leasing, land exchanges, strategic acquisitions and limited dispositions.
EFIB manages a diverse, high-performing financial fund that mirrors private-sector best practices
Timberland acquisitions are guided by long-term expected returns, not short-term conditions.
Idaho’s combined land and financial assets form one of the nation’s most disciplined, well-managed trust systems.
Land dispositions over the last decade have produced approximately $330 million dollars. Of this, about $100 million has been reinvested in 54,000 acres of productive timberland, $144 million reinvested in financial assets, and $85 million available in the Land Bank which can be used to purchase more profitable lands or transferred to the financial asset. 
 MYTH: Engineered wood products will replace traditional timber markets, making Idaho’s forests less valuable.

FACT: Engineered wood products still require high-quality fiber, something Idaho’s managed forests are well-suited to produce. Traditional lumber and engineered wood rely on different grades and types of timber, and IDL forests contribute to both markets. These evolving markets strengthen, not diminish, the economic value of managed forests.
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands logging is the primary driver of soil erosion and phosphorus levels in Priest Lake tributaries.

FACT: This conclusion is not supported by comprehensive landscape evidence.
The area around Priest Lake has seen substantial residential development, which also influences nutrient loads and water quality.
Historic U.S. Forest Service management up through the 1970s–’80s involved intensive harvests visible in Google Earth time-lapse imagery — activity that predates current conditions.
IDL applies stringent best management practices, stream buffers, and slope protections based on Idaho’s unique soils and terrain, meeting or exceeding Forest Practices Act requirements.
Any evaluation of phosphorus or sediment trends requires watershed-scale analysis that accounts for all land uses, not just selective interpretation of a single tributary.
In conclusion, Idaho’s endowment lands exist to provide permanent, long-term support for Idaho’s public institutions. IDL’s management is built on science, sustainability, transparency, and constitutional fiduciary duty. The challenges facing these forests — wildfire risk, changing markets, population growth, and ecological stress — require thoughtful, strategic stewardship. 
That is exactly what IDL is committed to delivering.

(Photo courtesy of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library)Federal policies on health care and trade are likely to continue to color North Dakota’s biggest government stories in 2026. Congress and the Trump administration are spending money in an attempt to help the rural health care system and farm economy to offset cuts to Medicaid and declining ag commodity prices.
It’s also an election year, featuring ballot measures and a U.S. House race in North Dakota. And the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library plans its grand opening in conjunction with the nation’s milestone 250th anniversary.  
Special session
Gov. Kelly Armstrong has set Jan. 21 as the date for a special legislative session to allocate federal rural health funding that was part of what Republicans called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in 2025.
North Dakota was awarded $199 million after applying for its share of the federal funding. One North Dakota policy change prompted by the competition for federal funding was prohibiting the use of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy candy and junk food. The new restrictions are expected to be implemented by September 2026. 
North Dakota receives $199 million in federal grant for rural health care

North Dakota’s application for funds from the Rural Health Transformation Program focused on four areas: workforce; preventive care and healthy eating; bringing high-quality health care closer to home; and improving health care technology.
Once lawmakers gather at the Capitol, they could propose bills addressing other issues. But legislative leaders have said they plan to limit the scope of the session, and rules require that a two-thirds majority in each chamber must agree that the topic should be considered.
Election
North Dakota’s only U.S. House seat and a potential statewide vote on making school meals free for students are likely to be the top races in 2026, but there are many more. More than half of the Legislature’s seats are up for election, and there are local races for seats on school boards, judgeships and other positions. 
U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, a Republican in her first term, plans to run for reelection and has already received President Donald Trump’s endorsement. Republican Alex Balazs, who came in fourth out of five candidates in the 2024 primary but received the state party endorsement, has announced plans to challenge Fedorchak.

Other statewide offices  — all held by Republicans — on the 2026 ballot are secretary of state, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, tax commissioner and two seats on the Public Service Commission. 
The statewide nonpartisan offices up for election are the Superintendent of Public Instruction and two seats on the state Supreme Court.
In the Legislature, odd-numbered districts are on the ballot and two even-numbered districts, 26 and 42, have elections for House seats. The primary is June 9.
North Dakotans may be voting on state funding for school breakfasts and lunches, something the 2025 Legislature voted down. Organizers still need to turn in signatures to get the issue on the general election ballot. 
Voters will consider during the primary election a ballot measure to require all proposed amendments to the state constitution to comprise a single subject. 
The Legislature also approved putting two measures on the 2026 general election ballot. Measure 1 proposes to make changes to term limits voters approved in 2022. The measure would allow lawmakers to serve up to 16 years in one chamber and clarifies that a partial term does not count toward the limit. Measure 2 would require that 60% of voters approve a measure instead of a simple majority. 
Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library
The grand opening of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library is set for July 4 in Medora, coinciding with the 250th birthday of the United States.
All living presidents are invited to the grand opening, said Matt Briney, spokesperson for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation. However, they may not attend on the opening weekend and instead arrange a time to see the library before the year ends. 
President Trump has not confirmed whether he will attend the library opening, Briney said. July 1 is highlighted on a national calendar of 250th events to celebrate the library’s grand opening.
Members of Theodore Roosevelt’s family are planning to camp in the area during the opening weekend, and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who is also a library foundation board member, plans on attending the library opening, according to Briney. Among public officials expected to attend is Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who championed the library project as North Dakota governor.
The state has high hopes for attracting more tourists to the town of fewer than 200 people with the museum dedicated to Roosevelt, who ranched in the Badlands before becoming revered as one of America’s greatest presidents.  
Energy 
As the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, North Dakota relies on oil and gas taxes for more than half of its revenue. Production has held relatively steady, though the price of oil is struggling to stay above the level forecast by the state. 
North Dakota oil production resilient even as prices have declined

Industry observers will be watching to see if a couple of carbon dioxide gas sequestration projects — Minnkota Power’s Project Tundra and the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline — will move forward. 
Sequestration is permanent underground storage of the greenhouse gas. Minnkota would sequester CO2 from a coal-fired power plant while Summit would gather CO2 from ethanol plants in five states, including one in North Dakota. While in the works for years, construction has not started on either project. Summit, which has faced regulatory challenges, has indicated the possibility of changing the pipeline route, but also has said a North Dakota storage area “remains an important long-term asset for the project.” 
Meanwhile, hearings on a controversial high-voltage transmission line are coming up in January. There is high interest in a pipeline to bring natural gas from western North Dakota to the east, though construction won’t start until 2028. There could also be headwinds for wind and solar energy as the Trump administration cuts incentives for green energy projects. 
Potential efforts to extract critical minerals from coal, lawmakers’ study of nuclear energy’s feasibility in the state and the ongoing discussion surrounding data centers are also likely to be major energy topics in 2026.
Agriculture 
The farm economy took a beating in 2025, and 2026 isn’t looking so good, either. A major factor will be export markets. China has been a key importer of North Dakota soybeans in years past but did little buying in 2025. 
Depressed prices for soybeans and other crops coaxed the Trump administration into aid payments for farmers, which should arrive in February. Former North Dakota Farmers Union leader Mark Watne questioned whether those payments would be enough to keep farmers afloat.
Construction will continue in 2026 on two giant milking operations for Minnesota-based Riverview in the Red River Valley. There is a lawsuit pending against the state for its permitting of the Herberg Dairy near Hillsboro and other legal challenges to the Abercrombie Dairy north of Wahpeton. 
Beef production was the bright spot for North Dakota agriculture in 2025, and despite some ups and downs, could be again in 2026 as consumer demand remains strong despite higher prices.

I’ve lost track of the number of lawsuits filed to force the federal government to do what it is legally required to do. Political violence is at an all-time high. And the animosity across the aisle continues to grow, even though lawmakers of different backgrounds, communities and ideologies have more in common than they think. Division and otherization have become the norm.
Unfortunately, the word unprecedented has been used so often that it feels less like something new or never done before and more like Tuesday.
I think it’s finally time to retire “unprecedented.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Now, don’t get me wrong—I’m not harkening back to the “good ol’ days.” As someone who has spent their entire career in and around Lansing politics, I know that the secrecy, political jabs, lack of transparent information and lack of communication are nothing new. I know that the policy process is slow, and long legislative session days occurred even under single-party control. And not everything that happened this year was bad. We saw historic investments in school funding targeted to Michigan students who need it the most and support for 100,000 babies born over the next three years, helping them start off strong. We saw compromise, as members across the aisle and across the chambers worked together to improve policy and mitigate harm. 
But the good was vastly overshadowed by the onslaught of “unprecedented acts”.
So as we turn to 2026, we have a few resolutions that we think policymakers in Lansing should adopt.
First and foremost, mitigate the harm. Hundreds of thousands of Michiganders stand to lose health care coverage and food assistance due to the cuts included in the harmful federal megabill passed earlier this year. Even more will fall through the cracks due to complex federal rules and regulations and confusing paperwork. To be clear, these cuts do not mean savings for the states—they mean job losses, provider closures and higher food and health care costs for all 10 million Michiganders of every age, of all incomes and in every part of the state. The state must do what it can administratively and through budget decisions to reduce the negative impacts to the extent possible.
Get a balanced and equitable budget done on time. Families all over the state are struggling with the high cost of housing, groceries, utilities and child care. Michiganders deserve to see a doctor, put food on their tables, safely send their children to schools and reach toward economic security. School districts and local governments need to plan what services they’ll be able to continue providing. Our state budget is a moral document, and it needs to prioritize meaningful investments in Michigan’s people at a time when they need it most.
Pass evidence-based, data-backed, people-centered policies. As an organization rooted in data, we follow the numbers to determine whether our policy decisions are moving the needle on outcomes for Michiganders. We are also an organization that is informed by the community, and we know that ensuring the voices of those who will be most affected by policy change and budget decisions is a vital part of the policy-making process that is often missing. Consistent policies combined with sustained investments in what we know works are necessary in order to improve outcomes for Michigan’s kids, families and workers.
The Michigan League for Public Policy has been around since 1912. In that time, we’ve weathered economic ups and downs and shifted with political swings, but we’ve remained steadfast in our dedication to the issues Michiganders value most. Instead of policy decisions that divide us, we should be centering our family, friends, colleagues and neighbors in these conversations. And that would be truly “unprecedented.”

(Photo: NC Newsline)For nearly a quarter century, when debates over voting laws, gerrymandering, or money in politics enveloped North Carolina, Bob Phillips has been in the thick of them. That era ends this month, when Phillips retires from day-to-day advocacy work. 
As the leader of Common Cause North Carolina since 2001, Phillips has helped to shape anti-corruption laws and organize support for voting rights. He has worked with other groups like the League of Women Voters, Democracy NC, and the North Carolina NAACP to remove obstacles to voting, increase government transparency, and try to overturn election districts they argued were unfair.  
Phillips has been a constant presence in the Legislative Building, in courtrooms, and at rallies. And during his tenure, Common Cause NC has gone from a small, nearly invisible operation to an organization with statewide reach. 
Last January,  an online town hall Common Cause sponsored about Judge Jefferson Griffin’s efforts to throw out more than 60,000 votes in his race for a seat on the state Supreme Court drew more than 600 participants from around the state. Thousands of people gathered in the cold to attend its rallies to protest trashing votes in that close race. 
Phillips, with his typical modesty, doesn’t take credit for the group’s rising profile. He credits the organizers Common Cause has across the state and in the office with deepening the grassroots and making concrete what can be heady topics. 
“We still have a presence at the legislature in lobbying the decision-makers, but we’ve also invested a lot in organizers,” he said. “That’s probably the secret sauce in connecting people.”
Common Cause President and CEO Virginia Kase Solomón said Phillips has built a talented team in North Carolina and an atmosphere where they can do their best work. 
“Whether you’re a volunteer or a staff person, he figures out what your superpower is, then he lets you go and run with it. He’ll put you forward,” Solomón said. 
Mitchell Brown worked with Common Cause NC when he was a student at A&T State University in Greensboro in an effort to increase student turnout for the 2010 elections. He credits that work with his interest in voting rights. Brown went on to attend law school at NYU and is now senior voting rights counsel at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. 
“Bob is a very important reason why I’m a voting rights attorney today,” he said. 
When Phillips came to Common Cause after years as a reporter and then as spokesman for former Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker, he already had deeper knowledge than most about how the legislature works. He says partisan politics were not as toxic as today. 
Politics in North Carolina has undergone a tremendous shift in the last 25 years. Republicans have taken firm control of the legislature and have enacted laws such as voter ID, which the organization opposed. 
“It has changed dramatically,” Phillips said.  “I jokingly say sometimes the worst day I had in the first 10 years on the job would maybe be the best day today.”

And it’s hard to win a gerrymandering lawsuit these days. State and federal courts say it’s not their job to referee partisan redistricting. 
In fact, Common Cause North Carolina is etched in legal redistricting history. It was a case that went to the U.S .Supreme Court, Rucho v. Common Cause, that resulted in the court saying it would not consider complaints over partisan redistricting. The “Rucho” in the case is former state Sen. Bob Rucho, who now sits on the North Carolina Board of Elections. 
Still, Phillips looks back on some significant wins. 
He counts same-day registration, which allows people to register and vote on the same day during the early voting period, as a victory the organization helped secure. North Carolina passed same-day registration in 2007, the first southern state to do so. 
Though Common Cause NC is nonpartisan, Republicans deride it as built to aid Democrats. It’s true that Common Cause has sued Republican leaders many times in recent years over redistricting plans. Leading Republicans, including House Speaker Destin Hall, ridicule the strategy as ‘sue until blue.”
However, Phillips said its positions are centered on principles, not partisan politics. 
For example, Common Cause NC helped push campaign finance and lobbying laws through the legislature in the mid-2000s despite initial opposition from Democratic House leadership, Phillips recalled. Democratic House Speaker Jim Black was under investigation for accepting illegal campaign contributions, and the measures were inspired by reports of his activities. Black was later indicted and sentenced to prison. 
Though its push to have an independent group draw election district lines is now seen as a Democratic issue, it’s something Republicans wanted when Democrats were in control, Phillips recalls. 
Back in 2007, Republicans, then in the minority, sponsored bills to create an independent redistricting commission. Among the sponsors were current Senate Leader Phil Berger, a Rockingham County Republican, and former state Reps. Tim Moore and Thom Tillis, who went on to serve as House Speakers. 
Democrats in the legislature buried those bills. 
Independent redistricting is all but dead in North Carolina today, and after a series of friendly rulings by conservative courts, Republicans are exercising their considerable freedom to draw districts for partisan advantage. 
It wasn’t that long ago that the declaration from a former House Republican redistricting leader that a congressional plan had 10 Republican seats and 3 Democratic seats only because they couldn’t figure out how to draw an 11-2 map drew gasps and made headlines. 
Now, partisan advantage is a clearly declared goal. 
“They were just blatantly open about it,” Phillips said. 
Phillips says Republicans are disguising racial gerrymandering, which is still illegal, as partisan gerrymandering, which the Rucho decision allows.
Common Cause NC lost a federal lawsuit over legislative and congressional districts this year. It and other plaintiffs claimed new lines are racial gerrymanders, while Republicans asserted they used no racial data to create the new districts. 
“Unfortunately, we’re at a time where many of the courts buy that,” Phillips said. 
After Phillips returns from a long vacation, Solomón has asked him to come back to an advisory role for the national organization.  
“”He’s someone whose advice and wisdom and strategic thought-leadership and knowledge base I was dreading the idea of losing,” she said. 
Phillips said he has tried, and he hopes Common Cause will continue, to help promote civility in elections. 
“Everybody wants to see our elections being more civil affairs than they are,” he said. “Can we suddenly, with a coalition, make that happen? Probably not. But we can get more people thinking about what’s needed in holding the folks that are running for office accountable.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BobPhillips_redis-featured.jpg,,,2026-01-05 06:12:12.123764

According to the report – which is entitled “Who Owns America,” nearly 9% of residential parcels in 500 U.S. counties are owned by a corporation and the concentrations exceed 20% in some cities. What’s more, the trend is expanding rapidly, and it’s further complicating the already deeply challenging housing market for first-time buyers. And in December to learn more about the report and the housing market challenges it helps to highlight, we caught up with the national housing reporter for the news outlet, Stateline, Robbie Sequeira.

Because the Capitol is closed and vacated for a $300 million multi-year renovation, the House and Senate will meet in a temporary building that was constructed next to the Capitol Annex. 
Other state offices, including the governor’s and Supreme Court’s, have been moved elsewhere in Frankfort. 
Public will be on the outside as Kentucky legislature convenes in temporary quarters

The temporary legislative chambers have no in-person accommodations for the public. Some open government advocates have raised concerns about the lack of public galleries, saying it could distance Kentuckians from the proceedings. However, Republican legislative leaders said building galleries would have been too costly an addition for a temporary structure. 
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear voiced criticism of the lack of galleries in mid-December when asked about plans for an alternative rotunda space. In the Capitol, citizens and officials often gathered in the rotunda for rallies and other events. 
The governor said the Capitol Education Center, a visitors center, had been “altered to try to create the largest meeting space possible” as an alternative to the rotunda. The center sits atop the parking structure next to the Capitol Annex. 
“So, this meeting space will be close by, we believe will be safe, and is the best alternative that we have, Beshear said. 
As for the lack of galleries in the House and Senate chambers, Beshear said, “You could have put in bleachers. You could have put in just extra seating areas, simply by moving a wall back in some area, but that wasn’t included in their design.”
Also different this year, Beshear will deliver his State of the Commonwealth Address Wednesday at the Thomas D. Clark Center for Kentucky History in Frankfort. The speech before a joint session of the House and Senate has traditionally been delivered in the House chamber of the Capitol.
Who can enter temporary chambers?
Answering questions via email, Legislative Research Commission (LRC) spokesperson Mike Wynn said that legislators, legislative staff and credentialed reporters will have access to the temporary chambers. Lobbyists will not.
Wynn added that a few Annex committee rooms — rooms 149, 154, 169 and 171 — will be open to the public as viewing rooms while lawmakers are in session in the next building. The rooms will have live video feeds of the proceedings in the House and Senate. 
“Anyone wishing to access the temporary chambers must enter through the Annex and use the walkway that connects the Annex to the temporary chambers,” Wynn said. “The main entrance of the temporary chambers is located next to the Rose Garden.”

People with an LRC-issued badge can enter the Annex via the front doors or the tunnel that connects the annex to the parking garage, Wynn said. People with disabilities may use an ADA entrance at the rear, southeast corner of the Annex. On busy days, LRC may activate the front doors near the Floral Clock on the west end of the building. 
The temporary structure is connected to the Annex by a walkway. Security officers will be at each end of the walkway, inside the doors, Wynn said. Lawmakers have offices in the Annex.
Wynn told the Lantern that those wanting to reserve an Annex committee room for an event, like an advocacy group, should follow buildings on the LRC’s website. The Finance and Administration Cabinet will still oversee requests for events on the Capitol’s campus, he added.
Also missing from the 2026 session will be some student pages. The General Assembly will not host its day page program, Wynn said. Students from across the state participate in the program, visiting the Capitol and their lawmakers for a day while learning about the legislative process. 
“The General Assembly will continue to offer a constitutional page program, and the House will offer opportunities for students to participate in the legislative process through House Standing Committees,” Wynn said. 
Full-time pages are high school students, typically juniors and seniors, who serve throughout the entire legislative session. 
New addresses for constitutional officers
As for Kentucky’s other branches of government, the judicial and executive branches have also moved out of the Capitol during the renovation and to temporary offices in Frankfort. 
The Kentucky Supreme Court is at 669 Chamberlin Avenue. Additionally, the Supreme Court Clerk’s Office and the State Law Library are on Chamberlin Avenue. 
Beshear and his staff are in the Old Governor’s Mansion and State Office Building on High Street in downtown Frankfort. Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman’s office is at Berry Hill Mansion.
Republicans Attorney General Russell Coleman and Secretary of State Michael Adams are neighbors. The AG’s office is at 1024 Capital Center Drive, while the secretary’s office is at 1025 Capital Center Drive.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Boosting Rhode Island’s share of funding to K-12 public schools could relieve some pressure on municipal property taxes, according to a commission calling for an overhaul of the state allocation to local school districts.
The group convened by the Rhode Island Foundation found the state only covers about 38% of K-12 education spending, an amount Foundation CEO and President David Cicilline called “really low” when compared to other states.      
“If we don’t get this right and ensure that every student in Rhode Island has access to a high-quality public education to prepare them for a pathway into either higher education or a career, the future of our state is really in jeopardy,” said Cicilline, a former U.S. representative and Providence mayor at a December press briefing ahead of the report’s release.  
The foundation’s Blue Ribbon Commission released recommendations in a report Monday, proposing that the state redo what constitutes “full funding” for municipal school districts, by incorporating costs such as transportation and teacher pensions into the state’s funding model. In addition, towns and cities would also have a clearer idea of their own fiscal obligations to their schools. 
“I think most states are moving towards a system where the state assumes greater responsibility,” Cicilline said, partially because poorer communities often have a harder time generating the revenue needed to effectively fund their schools.     
The commission suggested that a 58% state share would result in an increase of about $600 million a year in education spending.
Under the proposed changes, the total “foundation cost” of K-12 education, as the commission labels it, would be about $2.9 billion. State spending would rise from roughly $1.57 billion to $2.16 billion and the municipal share would fall from about $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion.

The 63-page report is the product of the Blue Ribbon Commission, which was established in December 2024 and co-chaired by Cicilline and Nora E. Gordon, a Georgetown University professor of public policy. The commission’s members included superintendents, union leaders, advocates, charter and public school officials, plus a youth working group of Rhode Island students. Brown University’s Annenberg Institute served as research partner and facilitator and prepared the final report. 
The commission’s four big recommendations are meant to work in tandem and would need to be pursued as a complete set of reforms, rather than a piecemeal approach.

Edit the funding formula so that the state covers a much wider range of K-12 costs, rather than focusing too much on instructional costs.
Tweak the formula’s weights to determine how different students’ needs are served, such as students with disabilities, multilingual learners, and students with economic disadvantages.  
Require municipalities to have a minimum local contribution to their schools, based on the town or city’s property wealth, rather than the current suggested share.
More requirements for transparency in local school finances. The report notes: “Dollars come to districts regardless of how the district has spent past dollars, what student outcomes it is achieving with those dollars, or how transparent they are about the use of funds.” 

“What is occurring right now is that we have some students in the state of Rhode Island with a full bucket who are fully funded, and we have some students who are not,” said Brenda Santos, Annenberg Institute director of Rhode Island research partnerships and networks.
The commission also sketched an alternative wherein the state would maintain its approximate 38% share of local education funding, while still retooling the formula itself. In this scheme, municipalities would pay about $300 million more if all districts were to be fully funded.
Cicilline said lawmakers could write the new formula into law without immediately increasing the state’s overall K-12 spending. The state could phase in a higher share over several years, he suggested, as the budget allows. 
An aging formula for state aid 
The state’s current funding formula was first crafted by lawmakers in 2010 and instituted the following school year. As a recent legislative summary phrases it, “The core principle behind the formula is that state funding should follow the student; therefore, the distribution of state funds changes annually based on shifts in enrollment.”
In the commission’s view, however, not enough money follows students. The present formula’s “core instructional amount” provides municipal funding largely for teacher salaries and direct classroom costs. So that “core” amount, Santos and Cicilline told reporters at the December briefing, often ends up inadequate. 
Santos offered the example of in-district transportation costs as something that shocked the youth working group, who were flabbergasted that the state does not subsidize busing for public school students. 
“You cannot educate a child that’s not in the building, “ Santos said.
The commission also took mathematical umbrage with how the current formula combines child poverty rates and property assessment values in its calculations. It noted Rhode Island is the only state to crunch the numbers in this specific way, can lead to uneven funding in places where high property values coexist alongside high child poverty. 
The commission suggests relying solely on the property tax base to reflect a more accurate minimum contribution. The report’s third recommendation — to mandate a local minimum share of education funding — is meant to curb towns and cities whose local contributions have stagnated even as state aid and property values have increased. 










You cannot educate a child that’s not in the building.


– d Brenda Santos, Annenberg Institute director of Rhode Island research partnerships and networks


Santos said the revised calculation is a way to ensure “every single city in town is paying the same rate under this proposed system.” 
“So no one is a winner, no one is a loser,” Santos said. “There are no advantages for any district or any city or town like there are under the current system.”
She gave the example of Portsmouth, which currently gets about $3 million in state formula aid that would disappear under the new model. But the new model would also provide about $5 million for costs Portsmouth is paying locally, so the town would be about $2 million better off overall.
Pensions past and future
Pursuing either the 58% or 38% funding scenario would funnel state money in the following ways:

In-district transportation, school safety, career and technical education (CTE) costs, building maintenance, and early childhood screening are not included in the current funding formula and are kept afloat by municipal expenditures. The Commission recommends the state contribute to these costs.
The state already splits with municipalities the payments for out-of-district transportation, certain special education expenses, and the pensions of teachers who are already retired. The commission recommends that the state absorb these costs in full.

Right now, both current and retired teacher pensions sit outside the formula and are split 40/60 between state and local funds. The commission thinks that the future pensions of current teachers should be absorbed into the core funding amount like any salary cost, while the state should shoulder alone the pension liability for already retired teachers, “a cost completely unassociated with current students who are in school,” Santos said.   
The pension ask would eventually subside on the retiree side. In recent and upcoming fiscal years, the state has paid over $400 million for retired teachers’ pensions, but Santos said that state actuaries calculate that by 2036, the liability will fall sharply because of how the current benefit plan is structured.

State officials and legislative leaders were briefed on the commission’s report ahead of its release, and its recommendations are likely to become a topic of discussion at the State House when the legislative session begins anew in January.     
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said over a recent email that state representatives “look forward to carefully reviewing the report during our upcoming legislative session.” 
“A strong educational system is essential in making sure our students are well prepared for the rapidly-changing 21st century economy and is a critical component of our state’s future prosperity,” Shekarchi said.    
Senate President Valarie Lawson, also who serves as the president of the teachers’ union the National Education Association Rhode Island, is still reviewing the final document, according to spokesperson Greg Paré.
Paré said the commission “raises important issues” the Senate will soon explore this legislative session, and he added that the entire Senate is scheduled to receive a presentation on the report from the Foundation on Jan. 15. 
Gov. Dan McKee said in a an email that his administration “will carefully review their recommendations as we work with education leaders, the General Assembly, and communities to ensure our funding system is fair, transparent, and aligned with student success.”

(University of Kentucky photo)If you smoke and want to quit, call the national quit line at 1-800-784-8669 to speak with a confidential coach. 
In what could be a “game changer” someday for Kentuckians with small cell lung cancer, the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center has treated the first patient in the country with a novel drug currently in the early stages of human trials. 
Markey is the first site to open a U.S. trial for ZG006 (Alveltamig), which has three “arms” (trispecific) to grab cancer cells and connect them to T cells, a type of white blood cells that are key in fighting pathogens and disease. 
It has the potential to give years of life back to small cell cancer patients, for whom other therapies have been ineffective in many ways — only about 40% of patients responded to tarlatamab, an immunotherapy with two “arms” (bispecific), for example. 
Dr. ​​Zhonglin Hao, a professor of medicine and the co-leader of Markey Cancer Center’s thoracic oncology program, said small cell lung cancer usually occurs in patients with a history of smoking, with the exception of a “very small proportion.” 
This population typically undergoes treatments that are on the market right now, but their cancer often comes back.  
“When they recur, that’s when we need more options,” Hao said. He described the three-arm therapeutic approach like this: “When they are dragged together, the lymphocytes can kill the cancer cell.” This can extend and save lives, he said. 
His trial will enroll three dozen patients over the next few years. To qualify, patients need to have extensive stage or limited stage small cell lung cancer and need to have experienced a recurrence of their cancer after receiving first line chemotherapy, Hao said. Patients in the trial receive the therapy via infusion in a hospital setting every two weeks.  
Hao’s team treated the first patient in the trial in late October. That patient “has tolerated it well without any appreciable side effects,” he said. 
If this trial proves “promising,” Hao said, he will launch a second tier trial and be able to “take a larger number of patients, in terms of hundreds of patients.”  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in Kentucky, despite its robust screening system. Kentucky has the second-highest rate of smoking in the nation — behind only West Virginia. 
In 2022, 17% of adult Kentuckians smoked, significantly higher than the national rate of 11%. The rate of new lung cancer cases, too, is higher than the national average — 84.1 per 100,000 people in Kentucky compared with nearly 52.8 per 100,000 nationally, according to the American Lung Association’s State of Lung Cancer. 
“Everybody will be tickled if we can make the bispecific, trispecific work for more people,” Hao said. “Our goal … is to cure them … despite having … that kind of disease.” 
​​Meanwhile, Hao said, patients should seek treatment as early as possible. 
“A lot of times geography is a hurdle, a barrier for referral,” he acknowledged. “But I want all our community and college to think and to suggest (to) patients: Come to UK early and in order to have that potentially curable therapy.” 
This new treatment may also be effective in treating brain metastases, which is when cancer cells migrate to the brain. This is common in small cell lung cancer, according to UK. The first U.S. patient treated with ZG006 at Markey had brain metastases, Hao said. 
“This disease has a very high chance of coming to the brain,” Hao said. “Once they come to the brain … it’s oftentimes too late to handle it, so we’ve got to think about just starting immunotherapy as soon as we (can).” 



Who should get screened for lung cancer? 
According to the American Lung Association, people should get screening for lung cancer if they are 50-80 years old, currently smoke or did smoke in the last 15 years and smoked a pack a day for 20 years or two packs a day for 10 years. People who fit that criteria are “high risk” for developing lung cancer, according to the association. 
People can also email the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services’ lung cancer screening program at LungCancer@ky.gov with questions about screening. 
Kentuckians who believe they qualify for the UK trial can contact the Markey Cancer Center.

After this year’s governor’s race, the former Pennsylvania attorney general, Montgomery County commissioner and state representative is widely expected to set his sights on the party’s nomination for president in 2028.
Voters next year will judge Shapiro on his record of running the commonwealth. While Republicans say there’s plenty to criticize, such as three late budgets and lingering questions about a sexual harassment scandal involving a top aide, Democratic and Republican political experts say his appeal to a broad swath of voters is undeniable.
“Josh Shapiro is easily the most popular governor we have had in a long time. This is a guy that Democrats love, Independents love,” said Lehigh Valley-based GOP consultant Sam Chen, noting a group of prominent Republicans including former U.S. Reps. Charlie Dent and Jim Greenwood endorsed Shapiro in 2022. “Republicans, behind closed doors, acknowledge that.”
After nearly three years in the governor’s office, Shapiro’s approval record hit an all-time high in October, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll. His consideration as a running mate for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 elevated his profile nationally. 
And the governor’s race is expected to strongly influence down-ballot races, meaning the Democrats’ one-seat majority in the state House, the Republican three-seat majority in the Pennsylvania Senate and perhaps as least four U.S. House seats are believed to be in play this year. 
“Politically, Josh’s victory is very key to what’s going to happen from a policy standpoint in the commonwealth and in the nation,” Philadelphia-based public affairs executive Larry Ceisler said.
Shapiro’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Shapiro’s likely opponent in November is Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a retired U.S. Army officer and business executive serving her second term as the commonwealth’s financial manager. 
An ally of President Donald Trump, Garrity has positioned herself as a champion of the people during her five years in office. She touts the Treasury’s success in returning hundreds of millions of dollars worth of unclaimed property held by the state to its rightful owners and expanding access to educational savings programs.
Garrity’s campaign plans to make the case that while Shapiro has broad approval, it’s based on a carefully crafted public image. Voters will change their minds when they see beneath the surface, Republican strategists said.
“It’s a mile wide and an inch deep,” Garrity campaign spokesman Matt Benyon told the Capital-Star. “There’s very little intensity to it. It provides us an opportunity to tell the other side of the story.”
On Dec. 23, the campaign released a video styled as a movie trailer for a dark techno-crime thriller with references to a 2011 Philadelphia stabbing case that Shapiro took over when he was state attorney general. The tagline: “It’s amazing what you can learn … when you hide in the shadows.”
Before the case was transferred to the attorney general’s office in 2018, Philadelphia officials had initially determined that Ellen Greenberg’s death was a homicide before changing it to suicide, despite the presence of more than 20 stab wounds on the 27-year-old teacher’s body.
When the medical examiner said in October he no longer believed Greenberg died by suicide, Shapiro said he stood behind the conclusion the AG’s office reached that the evidence points to suicide. He also expressed regret that his office could not provide better closure for her family.

Garrity’s campaign will also make an argument that Shapiro’s narrative of success is belied by Pennsylvania’s national rankings of its economy, education system and transportation infrastructure.
“Pennsylvania is lagging behind,” Benyon said. “What Josh Shapiro does with seemingly every breath he takes is blame President Trump.”
Republican Party of Pennsylvania spokesman James Markley said the GOP will attack Shapiro over what it says is a lack of transparency surrounding the resignation of Secretary of Legislative Affairs Mike Vereb amid a sexual harassment scandal that resulted in a $295,000 settlement with Vereb’s accuser. 
The administration said during litigation over a Right to Know Law request for emails around the time the accusation was lodged that the accuser’s email account was deleted in accordance with records retention policies.
The GOP, Markley said, also plans to highlight what the party claims is a lack of transparency around security upgrades to Shapiro’s own Montgomery County home after the April firebombing of the official Governor’s Residence in April. Shapiro and his family were asleep there after celebrating Passover the night before when a Harrisburg man, at odds with the governor’s position on the war in Gaza, threw two Molotov cocktails into the state reception hall. 
Cody Balmer pleaded guilty in October to attempted murder with a sentencing enhancement for terrorism and will serve 25 to 50 years in state prison. The administration has said the improvements stem from reviews by Pennsylvania State Police and independent security experts “to pinpoint security failures, review protocols, identify gaps and make concrete recommendations for improvement to the Governor’s security.”
“If he doesn’t have anything to hide, then why is he fighting so hard to block all of this information from being released to the public?” Markley said.
Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy and administration at Penn State Harrisburg said those issues offer an opportunity to question Shapiro’s judgment and character, but they may not register with voters in the way Republicans want. Mallinson noted they didn’t affect Shapiro’s popularity in real time.
“Most people aren’t as polarized. They just want the government to work and things to go their way,” he said.
Chen said those issues might also present pitfalls for Garrity, noting that Shapiro gets sympathy as the victim of an anti-semetic attack and voters may feel it’s reasonable to update security after such a breach. Likewise, Vereb was a Republican when he served in the state House before becoming one of Shapiro’s close aides in the attorney general’s office.

“You’re walking on very thin ice if you’re going to use that as an attack,” Chen said. 
Shapiro’s image is that of a governor who has proven his ability to competently run a government, who has pushed for investments in education, agriculture and transportation. And while he hasn’t achieved all of those policy goals, Mallinson said Shapiro has put himself at the center of compromises and willingness to entertain proposals from those further to the left and right of him.
Mallinson said the three late budgets on Shapiro’s watch might be an angle where he is vulnerable to criticism. Although a monthslong delay of his first budget was due in part to the collapse of a school voucher deal with Senate Republicans, in each case the divided legislature has shared responsibility, Mallinson said.
Democratic strategist Neil Oxman said Shapiro has figured out how to work with the Republican Senate 
“He understands better than anyone, probably since [Ed] Rendell was governor, that when the Democrats and Republicans each control houses there has to be some give and take,” Oxman said.
Shapiro has also leveraged losses into political capital by demonstrating that he is fighting for constituent groups. 
“Whether or not he can get mass transit [funding] for Philadelphia and Allegheny County, just the fact that he’s fighting for it shows voters he’s fighting for them,” Oxman said.
And although Shapiro has many policy issues to figure out, such as surging energy demand and prices in the face of the AI race, Ceisler said Shapiro’s demonstrated ability to work across the aisle provides a foundation to continue negotiating.
“For all the acrimony and delay, he’s done a good job,” Ceisler said.
And while the budget delays in 2023 and 2025 that extended into the fall each year caused real disruption and expense for school districts, county governments and nonprofit organizations, the vast majority of Pennsylvanians weren’t directly affected. 
Last year, the weight of the late state budget was compounded by the record 43-day federal government shutdown, which resulted in hardship for many federal workers. That may have had a detrimental effect on faith in government generally, Mallinson said
“My bigger concern is that it affects their view of government and the ability to get things done,” he said. “If you’re a voter who is not just turned off from voting by that … at the end of the day, you still have two options and you have to pick one.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shapiro-snap-updates--1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 05:56:54.544346

In Ashland, a street lamp lights the way between two bridges over the Ohio River. (Getty Images)In its most recent rate case, Kentucky Power clarified that population and industrial losses, coupled with the need to increase revenue for investors, relative to its fixed costs, are significant reasons for its proposed 15% industrial rate hike, 14.9% residential rate hike and 13% commercial rate hike. 
Annual statistical reports kept by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) reflect a sad tale. Over 12,000 residential customers have been lost in the past 14 years in Kentucky Power’s 22-county service area in Eastern Kentucky. In 2010, Kentucky Power sold 3.3 billion kilowatt-hours of industrial power.  By 2024, that number dropped to 2 billion kilowatt-hours  a 38% loss. No doubt, our region is in trouble. 
Most people living in Eastern Kentucky do not need numbers on a chart to tell us that industries once depended on to feed our families have declined or, worse yet, completely evaporated. Coal, steel and power, the bedrocks of our communities and local economies, have gone by the wayside. 
Kentucky Power itself was a major player in declining power and coal jobs when it chose to decommission its Big Sandy 2 generating plant in Louisa and invest millions of Eastern Kentucky ratepayer dollars in the coal-burning Mitchell plant located just outside of Moundsville, W. Va., a plant that does not  employ Kentucky citizens, pay Kentucky taxes or burn coal mined in Eastern Kentucky.  
So here we are, looking for new industries to attract to our area and hoping the industries and businesses we do still have stay. None of this is for the faint of heart. To their credit, economic development teams across the region are aiming to create sustainable growth, foster innovation and improve the quality of life in their communities. Adding another 15% to the industrial electrical rate, which is already one of the highest in the state, is not helpful. 
More is needed, much more than just decently priced industrial electrical rates to attract and maintain industries and businesses providing good-paying jobs. Infrastructure is key as well. 
As they say in the real estate market, our area of Northeast Kentucky has good bones. We have two major waterways, the Big Sandy and the Ohio River; rail services and three major highways that pass through our area: Interstate 64, US 60 and US 23. We are minutes away from the AA Highway, a throughway to Northern Kentucky and the industrial Midwest.  We have regional airports nearby. Yet, we have failed to keep up. 
Our electrical grid needs work. Extreme weather events due to climate change — hurricanes (the effects of which are felt here in Kentucky), ice storms, floods and tornadoes — are only growing in frequency and intensity. According to Climate Central, 83% of power failures can be attributed to weather changes. We must upgrade or suffer the dire consequences of inaction.

The aging grid in Eastern Kentucky requires a proactive approach to meet the needs of a region seeking a renaissance. Merely trimming trees and clearing brush do not guarantee a resilient power supply. Ratepayers deserve a reliable power supply that only comes from utilizing current technology.
Unfortunately, there has been a major issue at the Mitchell plant requiring significant capital and attention to address. One of Mitchell’s two concrete cooling towers is failing structurally at the over-50-year-old coal-burning plant and needs to be reinforced or replaced. 
According to Kentucky PSC records, the options to address the failing tower would be $376 million for a new mechanical draft or $356 million  to shorten the tower. Either way means money out of the ratepayers’ pocket for an expense that is not a long-term solution as the Mitchell plant, which Kentucky Power owns half of, is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2040. The money needed to shore up the tower will be in addition to the current proposed rate hike. Kentucky Power has said it is seeking a federal grant to help with this expense; time will tell.
The complicated history Kentucky Power has with its ratepayers continues to lean toward customer rate unsustainability. A correction must take place. 
We need companies providing good-paying jobs to locate in the service area to combat population loss, and those companies need fair electrical rates and adequate infrastructure. Ratepayers need Kentucky Power, a monopoly, to manage its operations more effectively. The truth is, families in Eastern Kentucky, who already pay the state’s highest average energy bills, can no longer bear the burden of questionable decisions by Kentucky Power, compounded by a hard-hit regional economy. 
PSC meetings on this matter were recently well attended in both Pikeville and Hazard as citizens and elected leaders alike spoke out in unity about the harm further rate hikes will cause.   
One more community meeting is on the schedule. The Kentucky PSC will be in Ashland at 5 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 8, at the Ashland Transportation Center to hear from ratepayers.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As 850,000 Virginians (and millions nationwide) went without food stamps this fall during the federal government shutdown, the giant reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer set off a timer for states to reduce their error rates in computing the disbursement of funds to recipients. States that don’t comply risk losing their funding.
That means Virginia must drop its error rate from where it hovers now around 11% down to 6% by 2027. Otherwise, the state could be on the hook for $270 million annually. 
Enter “SNAP Forward,” an initiative spearheaded by Gov. Glenn Youngkin through an executive directive this past August with the express purpose of reducing the state’s SNAP error rates. It’s work that incoming Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s administration will inherit. 
Youngkin has publicly referenced the initiative and his administration’s efforts to slash SNAP error rates repeatedly in recent months, most recently in his final budget presentation to lawmakers last month, but has shared few details. The Mercury gleaned a clearer picture of the progress so far through a series of Freedom of Information Act requests and by reviewing  Youngkin’s  proposed state budget. 
 Compliance with federal law changes

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, helps low-income earners afford to buy groceries. States have always handled disbursing the federal funds to qualifying residents. Sometimes, errors in either overpaying or underpaying households arise, stemming from paperwork mistakes by government staff or outdated information from beneficiaries. 
When Congress passed its reconciliation bill in July, the measure stipulated that states with higher error rates may have to, for the first time, pay a portion of SNAP benefits to recipients. 
Beyond spurring error rate reductions, the law adjusted age and work eligibility requirements.
Since Oct. 1, Virginia beneficiaries can no longer attest to their expenses and income themselves. Now, state employees reviewing SNAP cases must  take further steps to verify applicants’ expenses. Household composition will be required to be verified as well by March 2026.
 Strategic meetings

A series of meeting presentation slides revealed by the November and December records request shows conversation materials used during a monthly series of “SNAP Forward” virtual meetings with local Department of Social Services workers around the state. The meetings began in September. 
The conversations entailed training refreshers for workers on managing SNAP, new policies to verify household information and notes on other states, like Wisconsin, which has maintained a low error rate. Virginia’s Department of Social Services has plans to conduct interviews with states that have track records of dropping their error rates to gather insights.

 Contracted help

The Mercury reviewed a $1.7 million contract for services by a company called KPMG included in the state’s FOIA response. The organization offers tax, audit and advisory services to companies and governments that hire it. 
With a six-month contract for services, KPMG has been tasked with deploying to “agreed-upon” local DSS offices to “support (Virginia) with targeted strategies to help improve SNAP payment accuracy.” The company was also hired to provide recommendations and prepare training documents.
The Mercury reached out to KPMG to inquire further but did not receive a response by the time of this publication. 
 A quality assurance team 

As local social service departments around the state handle SNAP case loads, the administrative ease or strain looks different in different localities. One of the records the state released to the Mercury was a document outlining feedback from the Virginia League of Social Services Executives. The group expressed concerns about whether smaller local social services offices in the state could handle the additional administrative burden that the new process would require. 
Lawmakers and advocates have also warned that these workers are expected to have heavier loads for Medicaid eligibility changes triggered by the reconciliation bill. 
Youngkin’s outgoing state budget proposal earmarks about $2.4 million to fund a quality assurance team for the Office of Health and Human Services — a potential solution for the expected administrative challenges. The 14 new positions Virginia could  hire would be responsible for helping to find and correct SNAP payment errors. 
Whether the team comes to be or not depends on upcoming budget negotiations in the 2026 legislative session, where Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger will have her own ideas about how the state should allocate its resources. After Virginia’s legislature agrees on the next state budget, Spanberger will be responsible for signing it or making adjustments.

Last year, one notable document was missing.
The annual report from the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission would normally have been published at the end of November. The JIRC’s 2024 report was a rich text: for the first time, it contained the names and misdeeds of Virginia judges who were disciplined by the seven-member commission for violating the commonwealth’s judicial cannons. The change was the result of a 2023 law sponsored by Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick, which passed with bipartisan support and backing from outgoing Attorney General Jason Miyares.
Virginia House approves bill to boost transparency when judges get punished

That brief window of transparency shut last year, when lawmakers unanimously passed a bill specifying they would be the first ones to see JIRC’s annual report — and decide if it’s ever made public. 
The change means the public won’t know the names and misconduct of errant judges in their community in 2025 unless lawmakers decide to release it. In 2024, that list included a Richmond judge who’d made unwanted advances on female attorneys and a Roanoke judge who’d had a relationship and provided legal aid to the mother of a man on trial for murder in the same courthouse. 
In a committee meeting last year, the 2025 bill’s sponsor, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, said judges deserved more privacy.
“The whole idea was — especially in unfounded cases — a lot of information that’s available under the FOIA law right now is information that might not be accurate and may be defamatory toward a judicial officer,” Deeds said in a February committee meeting, referring to the Freedom of Information Act.
But Deeds’ statement doesn’t align with what’s in the reports. Under the rules of the 2023 law, the outcomes of “unfounded cases” are not published in the JIRC’s annual report — only a much smaller number of cases where judges were disciplined for violating the cannons.

In an interview last week, Deeds said he was unaware the report only contained the names of disciplined judges.
“When there’s a founded complaint, when there’s disciplinary action — that ought to be public information,” Deeds said.
Deeds said the bill was “not my idea” and that he “really had not had any interest in this before.” At the committee meeting, he said former Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth Melvin, who retired last month, had convinced him to carry the bill. The judge served as vice chair of JIRC and previously represented Portsmouth as a Democrat in the House of Delegates for 24 years. Melvin could not be reached for comment for this story.
Deeds said he was unsure how the General Assembly would publish the report, if it decided to do so, and said he was open to reconsidering the bill after a social media thread by Richmond reporter Sarah Vogelsong last month brought the issue to public attention. (Vogelsong previously served as  editor-in-chief of the Mercury).
“I didn’t realize people were hotly anticipating the release of these things,” Deeds said.
All 50 states have systems for screening and investigating ethical complaints against judges. Those complaints are always private, and the overwhelming majority in Virginia involve litigants unhappy with verdicts, JIRC’s counsel, Raymond Morrogh, told lawmakers in a 2021 Senate committee presentation. Those complaints aren’t eligible for JIRC’s review. If a panel determines a complaint does have merit, they can elect to gather more information, like a response from a judge, or simply express their disapproval without taking formal action.
If an investigation substantiates a complaint, judges may face a range of outcomes, including agreeing to disciplinary actions, like supervision or substance abuse treatment. In more serious cases, the JIRC may elect to hold a formal hearing. 
The hearings can resemble trials, where a state official presents evidence of misconduct, including witnesses and depositions, and a judge, often represented by a lawyer, presents their defense and cross-examines witnesses. The commission has the power to suspend a judge and recommend that the Virginia Supreme Court censure, remove, or force a judge into retirement.
In the majority of states — but not Virginia — fact-finding hearings involving judges are public, according to the National Center for State Courts. 
Indiana University law processor Charles Geyh, a national expert in judicial ethics, said in an interview that judges were often “reluctant to air their dirty laundry in public,” wary of undermining public trust in the courts. But Geyh argued Virginia’s level of secrecy into judicial misconduct risked undermining that goal.
“We’re past the point where the public is going to sit tight and have the judiciary say, ‘Trust me, we’re doing it — we’re just not telling anybody about it,’” Geyh said. “We’re past the point where that’s enough.”
Fairfax attorney Andi Geloo, a vocal critic of what she calls “wayward judges,” said the secrecy around judicial discipline created a separate standard from others accused of misconduct, from police officers to criminal defendants.
“The public has a right to know how judges are performing and whether they’re upholding the law,” Geloo said. “And this change sends a message that judges are above the law.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)When state Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, talks about Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act, she often does so from experience — both as a former journalist and as a lawmaker who says she has repeatedly seen the law used to discourage public access rather than promote it. 
Since her first year in office in 2018, Roem has made FOIA reform a legislative priority, reintroducing the same core proposal multiple times. Earlier this year, that effort nearly paid off, with her bill advancing further than ever before before ultimately dying late in the House.
Now, Roem is trying again.
She has reintroduced Senate Bill 56 for the 2026 General Assembly session, which is set to begin next week, reviving an effort to tighten limits on how much state and local governments can charge for public records and to clarify how agencies seek court relief when responding to large or complex requests. 
The proposal, which earned bipartisan support during the 2025 session, at the time passed the Senate, cleared a House committee and reached the House floor before being sent back to committee on a procedural vote after committees had stopped meeting, effectively killing the bill.
“It’s the same bill, different year,” Roem said in an interview with the Virginia Mercury. 
“I have worked since 2018 on this legislation, and I have introduced it five or so times over the years. The entire point of it is to reduce FOIA fees, so that the fees that are being charged are actually being used simply to cover the actual costs associated with pursuing FOIA requests in the first place, instead of being used as a deterrent for the public to not pursue FOIA requests.”
 Limiting FOIA fees

Under SB 56, public bodies would be prohibited from charging more than the median hourly rate of pay of their employees — or the actual hourly rate of the employee performing the work, whichever is lower — when calculating labor costs for producing public records. 
Supporters say the change would prevent agencies from assigning high-paid staff to routine FOIA requests in ways that inflate costs and discourage access.
Currently, Virginia law gives agencies broad discretion to determine who processes a request, a practice critics argue has allowed FOIA fees to climb into the hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
The bill creates a narrow exception to the fee cap. If a public body can demonstrate that no employee is available to process the request at or below the median hourly rate, it may petition a court for permission to exceed the limit. 
Roem said that provision is intended to accommodate situations involving specialized or technical records while still placing the burden on the agency to justify higher charges.
“Even I, as a state legislator, got hit with a FOIA fee earlier this year, a three-digit FOIA fee,” Roem said. “This happens to my constituents routinely.”
She pointed to a case in her district involving a mother who was charged more than $8,000 to view a 92-second video of her autistic daughter being dragged off a school bus. While the fee was later reduced, the woman still paid hundreds of dollars and needed $1,500 in financial assistance to cover the remaining cost.
“This happens again, and again, and again, and again, where FOIA fees are used as a deterrent to the public getting public information that they have already paid for,” Roem said. “Public documents are public, your tax dollars have already paid for these documents in the first place. Therefore, you should have the lowest barrier possible to accessing them.”
 Changes beyond cost

In addition to fee limits, SB 56 would update the required “notice of rights and responsibilities” 
that public bodies must post on their websites. The notice would be revised to explain how fees are calculated under the new limits and to describe the option for agencies to seek court approval to exceed the cap.
The bill also clarifies how agencies may seek additional time to respond to FOIA requests. Current law allows public bodies to petition a court for more time in limited circumstances, but the process has been criticized as unclear and inconsistent across jurisdictions.
Under Roem’s proposal, agencies could file such petitions in either general district court or circuit court, and courts would be directed to give those petitions priority on their dockets. Importantly for requesters, the bill would toll — or pause — the statutory response deadline while a petition is pending.
The legislation also makes technical changes to reorganize the FOIA statute, moving provisions related to charges for producing records into a separate section for clarity.
Taken together, the bill aims to standardize FOIA fees statewide, reduce the use of cost as a barrier to public access and provide clearer procedures for courts, agencies and requesters when disputes arise.
 FOIA as a public tool

Roem has repeatedly emphasized that FOIA reform is not about making life easier for journalists.

“The public needs to care about this, because it is the most important tool that they have to hold their government accountable in between elections,” she said. “It is the single most important tool that they have. That’s a misconception that it’s just reporters and some state actors who use it.”
She noted that support for the bill has come from across the political spectrum, including social conservative groups that often oppose her on other issues.
“FOIA is not just for the people we agree with,” Roem said. “It’s for people who disagree with us, and it is for people who are perfectly neutral and just collecting data. FOIA is for everyone.”
Despite broad rhetorical support for transparency, Roem said FOIA reform rarely becomes a voting issue for the public, making it easier for lawmakers to treat compliance as a burden rather than a core responsibility.
“The Virginia Freedom of Information Act is consistently treated as a burden by government officials rather than a necessary obligation of government to its citizens,” she said. “It needs to be seen as a vital, important government service, as opposed to an administrative burden.”
Alan Gernhardt, executive director of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act Advisory Council, said the council’s staff has studied earlier versions of Roem’s proposal.
“As staff, we do not take any position on pending legislation,” Gernhardt said. He explained that a council subcommittee studied Roem’s SB 324 in 2024 and produced an executive summary and report, but did not reach consensus on a recommendation. A subsequent council meeting lacked a quorum, preventing a formal vote.
Gernhardt said Roem’s 2025 bill was based on that earlier work but was not referred back to the council after it failed to pass.
 How Virginia compares

Virginia’s FOIA system has long drawn criticism for its complexity and inconsistency. With the commonwealth’s 133 localities, Roem said, there are effectively 133 different approaches to public records access. Her bill draws in part from practices used in York County, which she described as a more reasonable, nonpartisan model.
Virginia’s approach also stands in contrast to FOIA systems in several other states that place tighter limits on fees or waive them entirely in many circumstances. 
According to a 2023 national review by the transparency nonprofit MuckRock, some states restrict charges to the actual cost of duplication, while others prohibit agencies from charging for staff time altogether unless a request is deemed unusually burdensome.
States such as Colorado and Indiana, for example, cap or standardize labor fees, reducing agencies’ discretion to assign higher-paid employees to routine requests. 
Other states have moved even further toward low- or no-cost public records access. In Nevada, agencies generally may charge only for the cost of copies, unless a request is classified as “extraordinary,” and even then the law requires fee policies to be clearly posted. 
At the federal level, the U.S. Freedom of Information Act allows for fee waivers when disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations — a standard transparency advocates say states should more broadly adopt. 
An overview of federal FOIA fee waivers is available online, while comparisons of state public-records laws are compiled by the National Freedom of Information Coalition.
“Some states don’t have FOIA fees at all,” Roem said. “Some states have much more reasonable systems than we do. It can be free, and others have reduced rates. Virginia’s system sucks.”
 Prospects in 2026

Roem is hopeful that SB 56 will pass during the 2026 session, citing the bill’s near-miss earlier this year and a House with dozens of new members. She said she is reintroducing the legislation “literally verbatim” from the version that earned bipartisan support, but plans to make the case again to lawmakers unfamiliar with its history.
Still, uncertainty remains over whether the measure would become law even if it clears the General Assembly.
It is unclear whether incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer, would sign the bill. A spokesman for Spanberger did not respond to a request for comment.
For Roem, the stakes extend beyond this year’s vote.
“I have repeatedly compared the Freedom of Information Act in Virginia to a giant slice of Swiss cheese,” she said, “which every single year gets more and more holes poked in it, and less and less cheese around it.”
She added: “Here we are voting to add more exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act without having fewer exemptions to offset it. This is about strengthening the most important accountability tool the public has.”

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)When the State Corporation Commission approved Dominion Energy Virginia’s proposal to build a new, 944 MW gas peaker plant on November, 25 it looked like the end of a long, drawn-out battle over the future of fossil fuels in Virginia.
SCC approves Chesterfield gas plant and Dominion rate hike, creates new rate class for data centers

The approval seemed to signal that for now, at least, the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) would not stand in the way of new gas-burning turbines in spite of their high greenhouse gas emissions. According to the SCC’s order, the surge in power demand from data centers had triggered a reliability exception to the VCEA’s ban on new fossil fuel construction.  
Then suddenly, on December 16, the SCC granted the Southern Environmental Law Center’s (SELC) motion to reconsider the decision the commission had rendered just weeks before,  suspending approval of Dominion’s plan. What the heck?
The SCC did not limit what it intends to reconsider, suggesting it will look anew at each of the four issues SELC raised. Since those issues cover pretty much everything about the gas plant’s approval, it’s impossible to guess what is going on. 
Certainly, there are many reasons to criticize the initial approval of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center (CERC), beyond its climate impacts. The majority-Black community where the plant would be located suffered for decades from exposure to toxic air pollution spewing from the huge coal plant on the site. Closure of the coal plant had brought a welcome respite. Residents fear they will once again serve as a sacrifice zone for decades to come, in spite of environmental justice protections written into the VCEA.
In addition, Dominion had gamed the planning process so thoroughly that this alone might have caused the SCC to reject the proposal. Dominion had gone ahead and put in an order for the gas turbine even before soliciting proposals from third parties to address reliability concerns, as the law requires. On top of that, the company told the SCC that an independent third party had reviewed the options, which was false. 
 Dominion, it turned out, never had any intention of awarding the project to anyone but itself or of considering alternatives that didn’t involve fossil gas. How could the SCC reward such malfeasance?
The VCEA prioritizes the security and reliability of the power supply even over its carbon-cutting and cost-saving goals, but there are conditions attached to approving new power plants, intended to make new fossil fuel generation something of a last resort. SELC and other environmental groups had made a strong case both that Dominion failed to meet those conditions, and that there were non-fossil fuel alternatives that could provide reliability at less cost.
But if Dominion’s gaming of the process should have sparked outrage at the SCC, it also succeeded in putting the regulators in a difficult position. The mere suggestion of a future with rolling blackouts if a power company doesn’t get its way would cow any public utility commission, let alone one in a state facing an unprecedented surge in demand.  
That explains the SCC’s order approving a certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) for the gas plant Dominion swears is its only viable option. What, then, explains the about face on December 16, less than 24 hours after receiving the motion to reconsider?  
 Four possible errors

In its motion, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), representing Appalachian Voices, the NAACP and Mothers Out Front, argued that the SCC erred on four points around environmental justice, the cost of the gas plant compared to alternatives, the burden of proof on reliability and the legal mechanism for cost recovery. 
If the SCC were to agree with any of the first three arguments, the result would require new analysis, and might even send Dominion back to the drawing board. Agreement on the fourth point, however, would only change how Dominion charges ratepayers for the cost of the project. It would require the company to put the cost into base rates instead of a new rider, making CERC potentially less profitable for the company.  
This last point looks like something of a legal slam-dunk. A provision in the VCEA allows rate recovery through a rider only when a utility has met its energy efficiency targets – something all parties agree Dominion has not done. 
SELC also alleged that the commission failed to ensure the development of CERC “does not have a disproportionate adverse impact on historically economically disadvantaged communities,” another statutory requirement. The SCC’s original order addressed the point but appears to have misread this section of the law. That fact alone would justify a reconsideration of the November 25 order, though it would not alter the core of the decision to approve a CPCN for the gas plant.   
SELC’s other three points put CERC in greater jeopardy, if the SCC agrees. 
The commission’s environmental justice analysis consisted mainly of a judgment that a gas plant would be less harmful to the surrounding Black and Hispanic community than the coal plant that was formerly on the site. This may or may not be true, but that’s not the standard. On the contrary, a minority community that has suffered decades of pollution shouldn’t be first in line for the next polluting project to come along. That “disproportionate” impact is precisely what the VCEA and the Environmental Justice Act prohibit.
If the SCC were to side with the local community on this point, it wouldn’t stop Dominion from building a gas plant, but it would require the company to find a new location.  
The two final arguments attack the decision that a large gas peaker plant is the right remedy for a looming energy crisis. SELC contends that Dominion didn’t prove the cost of the gas plant is reasonable, citing the company’s deeply flawed process for considering alternatives and its failure to include fuel cost data. SELC also complains the SCC didn’t require Dominion to prove that its claimed threat to reliability could only be satisfied with a fossil fuel plant, but had merely taken the company’s word for it. 
These are accurate complaints about Dominion’s flawed process and strained analysis, and compelling reasons to reject Dominion’s plan — but they were just as compelling on November 25, when the SCC issued its order granting the CPCN.  
Indeed, the SCC had to both close its eyes and grasp at straws to reach the conclusions it did. For example, a footnote in the SCC’s order cites a Dominion witness’ testimony for the proposition that a Sierra Club witness had agreed a gas plant would be needed eventually. The commissioners did not take the time to find and review the Sierra Club’s testimony, which would have shown the Dominion witness had mischaracterized the evidence. Indeed, the Sierra Club’s modeling showed an alternative portfolio of clean resources would provide more energy than CERC at less cost. 
But apparently, gaming the process, ignoring the law and mischaracterizing the evidence are all things Dominion is willing to do to get an expensive fossil fuel plant approved in the face of the rigorous conditions set by the VCEA. 
On December 29, the SCC set a date of January 23 for Dominion to reply to the issues raised by SELC in its motion for reconsideration; presumably the commission will then set a date for a new hearing on those issues. The timeline could push a final decision on CERC out beyond the end of this year’s legislative session, making the interplay of politics and policy all the more interesting.

Kelly Ayotte signs legislation related to immigration enforcement in May. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Beginning Jan. 1, people in New Hampshire may face new penalties if they post “No Trespassing” signs on land not their own. Owners of nuisance dogs that repeatedly bite will face higher fines. And the Division of Motor Vehicles must create a “blue envelope” program to allow drivers with autism spectrum disorder to obtain envelopes with information on how to best communicate with them if an officer pulls them over.  
The Legislature passed more than 300 bills in 2025, and Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed all but a few. While most of that legislation took effect shortly after Ayotte’s signature this summer, a number took effect on New Year’s Day.
Here are the newly effective state laws in 2026. 
A ban on gender-affirming care for minors
In 2024, the Legislature banned “genital gender reassignment surgery” for those under 18. In 2025, the body banned virtually all other forms of gender-affirming care. 
House Bill 377, which took effect Jan. 1, bars medical professionals from carrying out any procedure on a minor “attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her gender or sex,” including with surgeries, hormone therapy, and puberty blockers. Minors who began their procedures prior to Jan. 1 may continue them, but the practice must end moving forward, and providers who ignore the law must face “administrative disciplinary action,” though not criminal charges. 
Transgender rights advocates have decried the law as harmful to transgender youth who have used the treatment to align themselves to their gender identity; supporters argued the procedures can have permanent effects and should be studied more.  
An end to sanctuary cities
Starting in 2026, local law enforcement agencies will be required to follow immigration detainers issued by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Those detainers require local police to hold a person that has been arrested for up to 48 hours in order for ICE agents to arrive and potentially take custody if the person has violated immigration laws. 
The bill, House Bill 511, also prohibits cities and towns from passing “sanctuary city” policies in which police departments are instructed to not inform ICE about potential immigration violations of people in custody and to disregard the retainers.
A slew of fee increases
A number of fee increases have gone into effect this month, part of a push by lawmakers last year to find revenue without raising taxes. Among the increases are the fee for a new driver’s license, from $10 to $20; a rise in vanity plates from $40 to $60, and a jump in the price for a new motor vehicle registration from $25 to $35.
There are also fee hikes for specific industries. Pesticide dealers will now pay a $160 fee for each new pesticide they register; tractor registration fees are now $11, up from $6; and cement mixers are increased to $12, up from $1.80.
A prohibition on ambulance ‘balance billing’ 
Starting in 2026, people who ride an ambulance will no longer be personally charged if the ambulance ride costs more than their health insurer is willing to pay. Senate Bill 245 bans the practice of “balance billing,” also known as surprise billing. The bill also sets mandatory rates for how much ambulance companies can charge insurers.
“This bill is going to make sure that when you have that ambulance come to your house for your mother or your father or your loved one, that there’s not a surprise bill that comes afterwards, that really makes you feel, ‘Wow. How can I pay for this?’” Ayotte said at a bill signing in August. 
A crackdown on AI use and chatbots against minors
This year, it will be a violation of child endangerment laws for the owner of a chatbot or other online service to use artificial intelligence to “to facilitate, encourage, offer, solicit” sexually explicit conduct, use of illegal drugs or alcohol, acts of self-harm, or acts of violence from a child.  
The new law, passed via House Bill 143, is in part directed toward chatbots that use AI technology to allow children to role-play conversations with different personas, whether through a video game, movie, TV show, or other interaction. The owner or operator must know that they are intending to facilitate or engage that behavior; those who do may face a civil lawsuit brought by the state Attorney General’s Office and may pay a fine of at least $1,000 per violation.
The laws also target the use of artificial intelligence to create “intimate visual representation” of children, equivalent to child sexual abuse imagery. Starting Jan. 1, doing so will be a Class B felony and a registrable offense, under Senate Bill 300. 
Landlords cannot require electronic payment for rent
Beginning in the new year, tenants have the right to refuse to pay rent via electronic means. Previously, landlords could require payment through apps such as Venmo or Zelle; now, under House Bill 309, the landlord “shall allow at least one other non-electronic form of payment” to pay for a lease, a lease renewal, or an extension. 
Mandatory accessible voting machines at town meetings
As of January, a pilot program to expand accessible voting is now permanent. In 2024, lawmakers required cities and towns to provide accessible voting machines at local elections, like town meetings and municipal elections. Now, under House Bill 67, the state will continue that mandate in a long-term arrangement. The machines, which are already used in federal elections, allow people with disabilities to easily vote using a keyboard or touchscreen and print out a ballot with their choices selected. 
Last year, municipalities tested out a system in which they borrowed the machines from the Secretary of State’s Office; moving forward, cities and towns will continue borrowing the machines but will pay for the cost of programming the machines for local elections. 
Voter information sharing between poll workers and state
Election workers in cities and towns will also be empowered to request personal information from state records to confirm people’s eligibility to vote in that polling district. Under House Bill 464, the Department of Safety and Secretary of State’s Office may share records that could show proof of a would-be-voter’s citizenship, such as birth certificates, as well as age and domicile. 
The new powers come as the state prepares for the federal midterm elections in November, and more than a year after the passage of House Bill 1569 in 2024, which required new registrants in the state to provide hard copies of proof of citizenship in order to vote. 
Meanwhile, Senate Bill 221, which also took effect Jan. 1, requires town supervisors of the checklist to verify voter rolls every year, rather than every 10 years under the previous law. 
A new parental right to their minor child’s library records
Parents will also have new record-seeking powers. As of the new year, House Bill 273 allows parents to request from public libraries their minor children’s borrowing records. That includes printed materials, DVDs, CDs, and other audio-visual materials; the information must be requested by a parent or legal guardian.  
Dumping yard waste in public bodies of water now illegal
Starting Jan. 1, it will be illegal to dump yard waste into any state body of water, on the ice of such water, or on the banks of the water. Anyone who “purposely or knowingly” violates this law will face a felony violation. The bill, House Bill 416, added yard waste to a list of existing materials not allowed to be dumped into waters, including bottles, glass, crockery, cans, scrap metal, junk, paper, garbage, tires, old automobiles or car parts, and trees. 
Meanwhile, House Bill 179, which took effect Thursday, imposes stiffer financial penalties on people who discharge hazardous or toxic wastes and have failed to pay the expenses associated with the cleanup. After 90 days of nonpayment of those expenses, the new law imposes a $1,000 additional fine per day until the expenses are paid. 
A new ‘C-PACER’ system for energy-efficient development
Developers and property owners will have access this year to a revamped financial mechanism to pay for energy efficient apartment buildings. Known as C-PACER, the new system will replace an older system that observers said was poorly designed and burdensome for towns. Now, the program will be run by the New Hampshire Business Finance Authority. 
Supporters say the voluntary program could make it easier for developers to find savings through energy efficiency and then use those savings to make the housing projects more attainable.  
Department of Education subpoena powers for teachers
As lawyers continue to spar over a state law barring certain concepts around race and gender from being taught in public schools, the Department of Education now has the ability to issue subpoenas to teachers. House Bill 520, which took effect Thursday, allows hearing officers at the department to issue subpoenas to teachers and school staff. 
Those subpoenas can be carried out for investigations into code of conduct violations by teachers, and can include books, papers, documents, and other items. 
The U.S. District Court of New Hampshire struck down the state’s “banned concepts” law in 2024; lawyers for the state have appealed that ruling to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. But supporters of HB 520 say it will help the department investigate other forms of misconduct, such as harassment and sexual assault. 
A quicker return of confiscated firearms
New Hampshire residents who relinquish their firearms to police due to a court order could now have an easier time getting those weapons back when the order expires. 
House Bill 506 requires that courts ensure a “prompt” return of the firearm to the individual once the protective order expires. The bill states that courts may choose to carry out background checks to see if the person is barred from under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System or under records held by state police. But those background checks are not required. And under the new law, individuals have a right to request a hearing to challenge a court’s decision to withhold the firearm, in which the Department of Safety must show up in court and provide “clear and convincing” evidence that the person is barred from having the firearm. 
Should the department not show to the hearing, the court must return the firearm to the individual by default, the bill states.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AyotteSigningMay222025-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-05 05:11:57.607709

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A health care administrator who narrowly lost a bid for the Arkansas House last year is running once again, this time against an Air Force veteran in Tuesday’s special election.
The two are vying for the Democratic nomination in the hopes of flipping a Republican-held district that includes portions of North Little Rock and Sherwood as well as the Camp Joseph T. Robinson military base. Rep. Carlton Wing, R-North Little Rock, was serving his fifth term when he resigned in September to head Arkansas TV, the state’s recently rebranded public television outlet.

Wing’s resignation triggered a special election, and the special primary for House District 70 pits Alex Holladay against Cordelia Smith-Johnson.
The election has Holladay knocking on the same doors he visited a little over a year ago before Wing defeated him by 316 votes.
“It’s like a battle scar, like, ‘Yeah, I did this before, and it worked, they remember me,’” Holladay said.

Smith-Johnson has not run for office before but said residents comment on her accessibility and willingness to take on challenges.
“[They say], ‘You’re not scared to say this, you’re not scared to challenge a person on this,’” Smith-Johnson said. “I’ve been in the Air Force. I’ve never been scared of a fight.”
The primary winner will face Republican Bo Renshaw in the special general election on March 3. Regardless of who wins Tuesday, Smith-Johnson and Holladay will have a rematch in the regular primary, also on March 3.
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders initially scheduled the special election to align with the regularly scheduled one in November. The state Democratic Party sued. Sanders relented after a judge ruled in the party’s favor.

 Health care

Smith-Johnson left the Air Force in 2019 and is now a prevention coordinator for the Army National Guard. Holladay recruits health care professionals for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
Both candidates said health care affordability is a major policy concern.
Smith-Johnson said many fellow veterans have expressed frustration about “the long wait time to see a specialist” because Arkansas doesn’t have enough highly specialized physicians. Her campaign website states veterans should have adequate housing and job opportunities as well as needed physical and mental health care.
“No one who served this country should have to fight for basic services,” the website states.
Holladay said he’s concerned about the impact of Medicaid cuts on District 70’s elderly population, in addition to the fact that “it’s just way too confusing getting care.”
“My dad is currently on long-term hospice,” he said. “Navigating that process is a nightmare, and I’m a professional.”
The federal government’s upcoming changes to Medicaid include work requirements and higher out-of-pocket costs for enrollees. KFF projects that Medicaid expansion states like Arkansas, could see a 14% drop in enrollment.

 Education

Both candidates said they got into politics via the education system. Holladay considered running for school board in North Little Rock in 2023. The seat in his zone wasn’t up for election until 2026, so he ran for the Legislature in 2024 instead, he said. 
What inspired Holladay to run was frustration with the LEARNS Act, the 2023 law that created a school voucher program that allows state funding to be used for certain private school and homeschooling expenses.
The state needs to implement “stricter guidelines” over how school voucher money is spent, he said. The state also should ensure an “equilateral education” for Arkansas children regardless of where they live or what type of school they attend, he said.
Smith-Johnson said school vouchers take away funds public schools could use for services to students with disabilities. Her daughter is homeschooled, but when she was in a traditional school setting, she was falling behind because she “didn’t have the resources” she needed from her individualized education plan, Smith-Johnson said.
“I stepped in to be the voice, and I got the parents to come stick with me on behalf of their kids, and we got things done, and I realized then that there’s power in a voice,” Smith-Johnson said.

 Affordability and the prison proposal

Both candidates favor expanding access to pre-K. Smith-Johnson’s campaign website says she supports state-funded child care, and Holladay’s website expresses support for the child tax credit.
Smith-Johnson said a key tenet of affordability is ensuring low-income people’s access to food assistance such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. She said she opposes new federal work requirements for SNAP recipients because they’re “not feasible,” including for veterans.
“I grew up on SNAP benefits,” she said. “My mom worked, and we still survived on SNAP.” [2026 Primary Election Voter Guide: The candidates, the ballot measures, and the tools you need to cast your vote.]
Holladay said some voters have told him they’re upset that Sanders wants to build a multimillion-dollar, 3,000-bed prison while people are “struggling to go to the grocery store.”
“I’ve been surprised by the number of voters that bring it up,” Holladay said. “I don’t even ask. They just bring it up because one of our [campaign] taglines is, ‘What matters to you?’”
Voters in Senate District 26 will also head to the polls Tuesday to choose a Republican candidate for their own special election. District 26 includes part of Franklin County, where the state bought 815 acres of land for the planned prison. The project met backlash from local residents, including the late Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield, whose death in September triggered the election.
Smith-Johnson said she too has heard District 70 voters bring up the prison unprompted. She used to work as a probation officer, and she said a more effective response to crime in Arkansas would be restructuring the probation system.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)In a recent commentary in Rhode Island Current, Robert Hackey (who has trained many of Rhode Island’s best health policy students over many years) and co-author Chloe Johnson forcefully argues that Rhode Island can’t wait nine years to address the national primary care workforce shortage in a way that protects Rhode Islanders now.  
We agree.
Building a new medical school at URI isn’t adequate. 
But we disagree about the value of such a medical school, which we think is a critical element of a long-term solution to our primary care woes.
A new medical school won’t cure R.I.’s primary care shortage. Here’s a better idea.

Primary care is critical to Rhode Island’s health services delivery system because the supply of primary care physicians has been shown, over and over again, to be associated with better public health outcomes and lower costs.
We think everybody in Rhode Island should have a regular source of primary care.
Rhode Island needs 133 to 266 more clinicians than we have now, according to a 2024 presentation to the Rhode Island Senate Study Commission on the new Medical School by the advocacy group Primary Care for All Americans.
That means committing the state to developing this workforce, but an arms race to steal them from neighboring states is not a viable long-term strategy.  A new medical school, if it admits Rhode Islanders preferentially and obligates them to practice in Rhode Island for a number of years, is critical to this “grow your own” strategy.










Building a new medical school at URI isn’t adequate. But we disagree about the value of such a medical school, which we think is a critical element of a long-term solution to our primary care woes.


Rhode Island’s primary care workforce strategy should also include developing primary care nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants. Nurse practitioners now constitute about 50% of the primary care workforce. But though a number of good studies show that nurse practitioners can provide the same quality of care for specific procedures as physicians, high quality primary care is a team sport with physicians using their training to help lead the team and handle complex cases.
That new medical school can also help seed the development of new primary care residencies, which, as Hackey and Johnson correctly indicate, are critical to addressing our workforce needs.  (We should also be developing nurse practitioner residencies to make sure all our primary care clinicians are well trained.)  
A new medical school is also an economic engine for the state, as testimony to the special legislative commission’s report explains. And that new medical school gives Rhode Islanders their best shot at attending medical school near home — most of the Rhode Island high school students who go to medical school now have to leave the state to do so. There is good evidence that students who go to both medical school and residency in their home state are much more likely to stay and practice here — and we need lots more Rhode Islanders to go to medical school, do a primary care residency, and then stay to practice here, in their own communities. 
We need to act today on the more immediate fixes Hackey and Johnson note: improving primary care physician take-home pay; reducing the primary care administrative burden; improving electronic medical records so they are user friendly and helping clinicians manage their workload, instead of adding to it. 
In the medium term, creating robust loan repayment programs is essential, so clinicians in training today will take primary care jobs in Rhode Island. We need to continue to fund scholarships with obligations to practice primary care in Rhode Island, so we train more primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and PAs who commit themselves to practicing primary care here; and build many more new community-based residency programs for primary care physicians, nurse practitioners and PAs. Our strong community health center system is the logical base for this work. 
There is no quick and easy fix to this national problem that took 30 or more years to develop. Massachusetts now has a new statewide Task Force on Primary Care Access, Delivery, and Payment. Delaware is reportedly planning to use $100 million of its Rural Health Transformation Grant funds to build a new medical school and help address the challenges we also face. Rhode Island’s U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is leading discussions in Washington to implement essential reforms in Medicare to rebalance its payments from specialty care to primary care,  
The cost of a new medical school represents a tiny fraction of Rhode Island’s $4 billion yearly health care spend, much of which is unnecessary or wasted. A new medical school alone won’t fix primary care fix the mess — but it is an important step forward, one that will give hope to Rhode Islanders, a place to study near home for our students, and the pathway for everybody in our state to have a relationship with a skilled, compassionate clinician as they seek long, healthy and fulfilling lives in our state.

The House Study Committee on Cancer Care Access released its final report following a series of public meetings across the state held last year. The committee, chaired by Rep. Lee Hawkins, a Gainesville Republican, was tasked with identifying barriers to care as cancer cases in the U.S. are expected to rise.
“The rural oncologist is really a dying breed. We don’t have very many oncologists who are setting up shop in rural areas, and part of that is related to the fact that oncology in general is having difficulties with workforce sustainability,” said Dr. Kristin Higgins, chief clinical officer at City of Hope Cancer Center Atlanta and a member of the study committee, in an interview.

Georgia faces a significant disparity in access to care between its metro hubs and rural communities. According to the committee’s findings, although one-fifth of Georgians live in rural counties, only as much as 8% of the state’s oncologists practice there.
To address a shortage of rural doctors specializing in cancer care, the committee recommended expanding the state’s Physician Loan Repayment Program to include specialists practicing in rural areas and increasing the amount of loan forgiveness available. Currently, Georgia offers $150,000 over four years to physicians practicing in rural counties. The report also suggests encouraging rural rotations for medical students.
The committee found that Georgia’s rural counties – or counties with less than 50,000 residents – often face higher poverty rates and hospital closures, making travel to urban treatment centers difficult for patients.
“When you are in smaller communities around the state — I always think about Dublin, Georgia, which is right in the smack dab center of our state —  you have to go to Macon or to Savannah or to Augusta or to Atlanta. There are so many that don’t have that access that I have been so fortunate to have,” said Lynn Durham, CEO of Georgia Center for Oncology Research and Education and a three-time cancer survivor who advocated for the study committee’s creation.
According to the Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan 2024-2029, which calls for increased attention to addressing disparities among cancer deaths, minority and rural populations are disproportionately affected by cancer mortality. Men are also more likely to die from cancer than women.
“I think Georgians deserve access to cancer care close to home. I hear all the time that people want to be with their support systems when they’re going through one of the toughest journeys of their life,” Durham said. “They want to be home and get the best possible treatment they can right here.”
To improve early detection, the legislative panel’s report recommends supporting the use of mobile cancer screening units in rural and underserved areas, such as the Brunswick-based Southeast Georgia Health System Wellness on Wheels. The mobile health clinic provides free or low-cost breast cancer screenings and travels to surrounding counties, such as Glynn, Brantley, Camden, Long and McIntosh counties.

“In 2025 alone, the WOW mobile mammography unit performed approximately 100 site visits with over 400 patient encounters,” said Chad Roberson, director of imaging services at Southeast Georgia Health System.
But running a mobile clinic presents its own challenges. Roberson said that the mobile unit operates “both a clinic and a heavy-duty truck, requiring additional repairs and regular maintenance to perform effectively.” He said that with such a specialized vehicle, issues can arise during periods of high use, increasing costs and causing downtime. He also said the mobile units require health care workers willing to travel long distances and work irregular hours.
The committee also proposed increasing the percentage of tobacco settlement funds appropriated for cancer prevention and screening. Georgia has received about $4 billion from the master settlement agreement with the tobacco industry over the last 27 years, with about $600 million dedicated to cancer-related activities.
Advocates argue that funding for access to cancer care is crucial as federal funding cuts to Medicaid from H.R.1 passed over the summer, which along with expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, is set to reduce health care funding by more than $50 billion by 2034, according to a November 2025 report from the Georgia Health Initiative,
Fabienne Antoine-Nasser, government relations director with American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, urged the state to increase funding for cancer-related programs, particularly the tobacco use prevention program, a state program that was discontinued in May due to federal cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Antoine-Nasser suggested raising taxes on tobacco, which could generate $350 million in annual revenue if increased by $1.50 per pack, would help address federal funding gaps.
“I believe that taking a really staunch look at (raising tobacco taxes) … would have such a great impact and really help Georgians who are pre-diagnosed and want to be able to get access to prevention measures, or post as well who want to get access to care,” Antoine-Nasser said.
The committee report also called for supporting the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University in its pursuit of National Cancer Institute designation. Currently, the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University is the state’s only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and establishing a second in another region of the state could provide patients with greater access to a wider range of treatments through clinical trials.
While the committee did not recommend full Medicaid expansion, a long-standing goal for some health advocates like Antoine-Nasser, it did recommend simplifying Medicaid access, enrollment and renewal for pediatric patients and addressing reimbursement rates for oncology-related codes. American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network sent Hawkins a letter in July outlining how federal budget cuts under the Trump administration could affect access to care, saying that policies could cut Medicaid funding for Georgia by an estimated $8 billion over the next decade, with $2.2 billion of those cuts specifically falling on rural areas.
“Protecting and strengthening Medicaid access and access to care is going to be so imperative,” Antoine-Nasser said, pointing to estimated losses of health care coverage due to expiring ACA enhanced tax credits. If these tax credits expire, which the House is set to vote on a three-year extension in January, the GHI report projects that 340,000 Georgians will become uninsured.
Hawkins said in an interview that because of funding uncertainty at the federal level, he is not sure if he can move forward with any recommendation, at least not until the impact of federal funding cuts becomes clearer.
“As of right now, until that shakes out, I do not have any proposed legislation,” Hawkins said. “Just about all the recommendations would need to be funded, and with the One Big, Beautiful Bill, our health care funding is up in the air right now.”
The chairman also seemed concerned about the impact from the expiring Affordable Care Act  subsidies, saying that without a federal fix, insurance costs could skyrocket for Georgians.
“The numbers that I read, it looks very depressing for individuals being able to afford their insurance. I mean, some of the policies are doubling in cost,” Hawkins said.
Lawmakers can consider the recommendations in the upcoming legislative session, which starts Jan. 12, and Higgins was optimistic they would find bipartisan support.
“(Access to cancer care) is not going to be controversial. It’s not going to be a controversial area of funding,” Higgins said. “Everybody is affected by cancer.”

Freestanding birth centers can address maternal health inequities, but many are facing mounting financial and regulatory pressures. (Photo courtesy of Sarah Simmons)Dr. Heather Skanes opened Alabama’s first freestanding birth center in 2022 in her hometown of Birmingham. Skanes, an OB-GYN, wanted to improve access to maternal health care in a state that’s long had one of the nation’s highest rates of maternal and infant mortality.
Those rates are especially high among Black women and infants. Skanes’ Oasis Family Birthing Center opened in a majority-Black neighborhood, offering midwifery services as well as medical care.
But about six months after the center’s first delivery — a girl who was Alabama’s first baby born in a freestanding birth center — the state health department ordered Skanes to shut it down. A department representative informed her that by holding deliveries at the birth center, she was operating an “unlicensed hospital,” she said.
Hospital labor and delivery units are shuttering across the nation — including more than two dozen in 2025 alone. Freestanding birth centers like Skanes’ could help fill the gaps, but they too are struggling to stay open.
They face some of the same financial pressures that bedevil hospitals’ labor and delivery units, including payments from insurers that don’t cover the full cost of providing maternity care.
Birth center owners also must contend with arcane state rules and antipathy from politically powerful hospitals that view them as competition, especially in rural areas with few births.
Nationwide, the number of freestanding birth centers doubled between 2012 and 2022, but more recently the pressures have taken a toll: About two dozen centers have closed since 2023, bringing the total number down to about 395, according to the most recent data from the American Association of Birth Centers.
Hospitals block much-needed birth centers in the South

In November, Pennsylvania Lifecycle Wellness and Birth Center announced it would shut down birth center services, citing pressure from regulatory challenges and sharp surges in malpractice premiums. It had served Philadelphia for 47 years. And New Mexico’s longest-operating freestanding birth center stopped delivering babies in December.
“When a new business opens, within the first three to five years you expect a certain number will close,” said Kate Bauer, executive director of the American Association of Birth Centers. “But we’ve had several long-standing birth centers close [in 2025] and that hits particularly hard.”
In California, which has some of the strictest birth center licensing rules in the country, concern over the closure of at least 19 birth centers between 2020 and 2024 prompted the state legislature to pass a law in October to streamline birth center licensure.
An appealing alternative
Freestanding birth centers are not attached to hospitals and aim to provide a more homelike, less traditional medical setting. They employ midwives and focus on low-risk pregnancies and births. Some also have an OB-GYN or family medicine doctor on staff, and they often have partnerships with nearby hospitals and doctors if more specialized care is required.
Some Black and Indigenous midwives and doulas say birth centers can be helpful alternatives to their community members, many of whom have had experiences in more medicalized settings that left them feeling marginalized, dismissed or unsafe.
Midwife Jamarah Amani, executive director of Southern Birth Justice Network, runs a mobile midwifery clinic serving majority-Black and Latino neighborhoods in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The nonprofit, which aims to make midwife and doula care more accessible, recently bought a building for a freestanding birth center it aims to open in 2027.
“[Midwifery] presents like a luxury concierge-type of service, and our goal is to really change that and to bring it back to the community in a very grassroots way,” Amani said. She added that expanding access to prenatal care could help address inequities in maternal health, as maternal death rates among Black women are three times higher than those among white women.
Freestanding birth centers also can be a solution for communities without a hospital nearby.
The closest hospital to the Colville Indian Reservation, located in northern Washington state, is half an hour away, said Faith Zacherle-Tonasket, founder of the nonprofit xa?xa? Indigenous Birth Justice.
So far, the group has trained nearly a dozen tribal doulas and midwives to serve the area. In the next few years, it plans to open a freestanding birth center. Zacherle-Tonasket said Indigenous-run birth centers are crucial alternatives for tribal women, who also have some of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation and often face prejudice in clinical settings.
“They don’t feel safe. So a lot of them just don’t get prenatal care,” said Zacherle-Tonasket. “Bringing traditional midwives that are from our own communities, that were born and raised in our communities, that know the families — we know that those babies will be birthed with love.”
Regulatory hurdles
When the Georgia legislature relaxed state health care regulations in 2024, it felt like a long-awaited win for Katie Chubb. A registered nurse and mother of three who’s worked in health and nonprofits, Chubb has spent years trying to open a birth center in Augusta.
The state denied her application to open the center in 2021. Georgia, like many states, requires health care providers to get state approval, called a certificate of need, before they can build a new facility or expand services. Rival providers, like other hospitals, can challenge an application, effectively vetoing their local competition.
That happened in Chubb’s case: Two local hospitals filed letters of opposition against her and refused to say they’d accept emergency transfers from her birth center, another requirement for opening.
Georgia currently has three freestanding birth centers, a fraction of the more than two dozen that operate in neighboring Florida.
“We’re seeing women giving birth in hospital hallways or at home unassisted, because there’s no in-between option like a birth center,” Chubb said. In October, Georgia lost another labor and delivery unit at a rural hospital two hours north of Augusta.
“Women are just left to figure things out.”

In Kentucky, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a bill in March that aimed to clear the way for freestanding birth centers by exempting them from the certificate of need process.
But Republican lawmakers attached a last-minute anti-abortion amendment to the bill, prompting Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear to veto it. The legislature eventually overrode his veto. Midwifery advocates hope the new law will help make it easier to open a birth center in the state.
Georgia legislators similarly revised Georgia’s certificate of need rules in 2024, exempting freestanding birth centers. Chubb, who championed the new law, hoped it would clear the path for herself and others.
But they hit another roadblock. The state still requires birth centers to secure a written agreement with a local hospital to accept transfers of clients in emergencies. Chubb and at least one other prospective birth center owner have been unable to get their local hospitals to sign such transfer agreements.
“We’re still fighting,” Chubb said. “Behind closed doors we’re still working very hard on getting legislation and regulations changed to make opening birth centers more equitable.”
Some hospitals view birth centers as a threat to the viability of their labor and delivery units, siphoning off patients and revenue from a service that’s already unprofitable for most hospitals.
Daniel Grigg, CEO of Wallowa Memorial Hospital, a 25-bed critical access hospital in northeast Oregon, said there aren’t enough births in the area for both hospitals and birth centers.
“When you’ve got a small-volume community like we have, every birth helps the providers keep their skills up and their competency,” he said. “When you’ve got a midwife taking, say, 10 patients out of that pool,” it can have an impact on physicians and hospitals.
Alabama lawsuit
After the Alabama Department of Public Health shut down Skanes’ birth center in 2023, she joined with two other women who had also been attempting to open birth centers in Alabama: Dr. Yashica Robinson, an OB-GYN in North Alabama, and Stephanie Mitchell, a licensed midwife in Alabama’s rural and economically disadvantaged Black Belt region. Together they sued the Alabama Department of Public Health over what they called a de facto ban on birth centers.
The state insisted its tighter regulations would ensure that birth center facilities are safe. The birth center owners said the state’s rules were overly burdensome and clinically unnecessary for the low-risk, nonsurgical births that are attended by midwives. And, they said, the rules prevented more families from accessing care where it’s desperately needed. The state has lost at least three hospital labor and delivery units since 2020.
“Entire swaths of the state are maternity care deserts without access to essential health care,” said Whitney White, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the birth center owners and their co-plaintiff, the Alabama affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives.
“Hospital labor and delivery units are closing, and pregnant folks are reporting they’re really struggling to access the care they need, struggling to get appointments, struggling to find a provider,” White said.
US hospitals see stark decline of obstetric services, study shows

Last May, an Alabama trial court permanently blocked the state from regulating freestanding birth centers as hospitals. Birth center staff are still overseen by state boards of midwifery and nursing.
All three Alabama centers are now open. But their licensed midwives are delivering babies under a cloud of uncertainty about the future.
The state appealed the ruling in November. The case is ongoing.
Struggles and solutions
Bauer, of the American Association of Birth Centers, said many centers face the same financial barriers. Uncomplicated births at freestanding birth centers cost less than they do at hospitals, but research has shown that insurers, including Medicaid, reimburse centers at lower rates. Some state Medicaid programs don’t cover some of the nonclinical services, such as lactation consultants and doulas, that birth centers may provide. And malpractice premiums are rising.
“We’re volunteering our time, essentially, to keep the birth center open as a service to the community,” said Sarah Simmons, co-owner of Maple Street Birth Center in rural Okanogan County, Washington. The center can’t afford to hire a front-desk staffer or another midwife, Simmons said. She added that on average, the center makes less than a third of what the local hospital makes for providing the same obstetric service.
But there may be solutions to some of these financial problems. For example, the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a national health care policy center, has recommended that health insurance plans, both Medicaid and commercial, pay hospitals and birth centers monthly or quarterly “standby capacity payments” per woman of childbearing age covered by that health plan in the facility’s service area. It also recommends that plans pay a separate delivery fee for each birth.
In 2024, Democratic U.S. senators proposed a bill to allow for a similar payment model.
Standby payments could help freestanding birth centers, especially those that fill gaps in maternity care deserts — but not unless centers receive payments that are comparable to those that hospitals get, said Simmons, whose center serves four sparsely populated counties along with the Colville tribal communities.
“This would be most beneficial to freestanding birth centers if pay parity laws were enforced, so rural freestanding birth centers were paid the same rates for the same services as rural hospitals, ” she said.
State grants also can help, but birth centers say a one-time infusion won’t be enough. In 2024, Washington opened grant applications for distressed hospital labor and delivery units and freestanding birth centers.
Ashley Jones, of True North Birth Center and president of the Washington chapter of the American Association of Birth Centers, said the grant has helped keep their doors open.
Meanwhile, Chubb, the Georgia nurse, recently had to take another job to support her family while her birth center remains in legal limbo.
“I’m just waiting until the government figures out what they’re doing.”

(Getty Images)As Americans struggle to afford groceries and utilities, a new study finds that three Ohio cities are among the most expensive for another essential — medical care. 
Cleveland, Toledo and Cincinnati are in the top 11 in terms of how big a bite medical expenses take out of their incomes, according to a WalletHub analysis of the 100 largest American cities.
For decades, inflating health care costs have far outpaced inflation in the economy as a whole. Between 2000 and 2024, the cost of medical care rose 121%, compared to 86% for the overall economy, according to the Peterson-KFF Health Tracker. 
Meanwhile, grocery prices have jumped more than 29% since 2020 with “no end in sight,” NPR reported in September. And many Ohio electricity consumers have seen increases as high as 44% just this year, according to Consumer Energy Solutions.
Ohioans’ pay hasn’t kept up. Adjusted for inflation, median annual income has actually dropped from about $71,000 in 2019 to $67,873 four years later, according to the Ohio Housing Finance Agency.

All of that is leaving families in a bind, the WalletHub report said.
“As health care gets increasingly more expensive, more and more people find themselves struggling to afford essential services and medicines,” it quoted analyst Chip Lupo as saying. “While some cities have lower prices than others, the average income in many places still may not be enough to keep up with the costs, especially when consumers have also faced inflated prices across all other facets of their budgets over the past few years.”
So it’s not great news that some Ohio cities are among the nation’s most expensive when it comes to health care. 
WalletHub analyzed data collected in November by the Census Bureau and the Council for Community and Economic Research. 
It compared the cost of doctor, dentist and optometrist visits as well the prices of ibuprofen and insulin glargine in each of the 100 largest cities. It then expressed those costs as a percentage of the cities’ median annual incomes.
Cleveland had the dubious distinction of coming in second, with medical costs making up 11.35% of median monthly household income. 
“This is largely due to the fact that Cleveland has the lowest median household income in the country, at $39,187 per year,” the report said, adding that medicine prices were relatively high in the city, while the cost of provider visits was relatively low.
Toledo came in fourth on the list, with medical costs making up 11.03% of median monthly income, and Cincinnati was 11th, at 8.98%. Columbus was 64th at 6.09%, putting it in the lower-cost half of big cities.

The fate of child care in Ohio is also impacted by federal decisions, including funding for Head Start programs and a Child Care and Development Block Grant.
Advocates say the recent government shutdown already caused issues in a field that’s struggling to keep up with demand and costs.
“The disruption to Ohio’s federally funded Head Start programs in 2025 – proposed budget cuts and the destabilizing government shutdown – was unprecedented,” said Julie Stone, executive director of the Ohio Head Start Association, Inc.
With Congress’ Jan. 30 deadline to yet again pass a federal spending bill, the potential for future struggles is mounting.
“Ohio’s children, families, providers, and communities are counting on strong federal investments and stable, year-round funding,” the child advocacy group Groundwork Ohio wrote in a fundraising email to supporters this month.
Groundwork’s president and CEO, Lynanne Gutierrez, said they are holding on to hope that agreement can be made on the federal level. Plus, with a strong infrastructure at the state level, she said there’s lots of data that can inform the work of the next governor, whoever that may end up being.
While the major-party candidates have not been officially decided yet, Gutierrez said her group has had conversations with the campaigns of both Dr. Amy Acton and Vivek Ramaswamy, gubernatorial candidates on the Democratic and Republican sides respectively.
“We see opportunities with both candidates, because this really is a bipartisan issue,” Gutierrez told the Capital Journal. “We’re committed to being a partner to whoever the next governor is.”
State funding will be a big part of the 2026 strategy for child care advocates, as they face a $600 million budget shortfall that will hit in 2028 as one-time federal funding goes away, according to Gutierrez.
“We believe that, just sort of back of the envelope math, that gap will mean there’s 30,000 kids per year who would lose access to care,” Gutierrez said.
Head Start leaders share the concern around the funding shortfall, and Stone said the strength of Head Start’s services “will be crucial to maximizing family access to care.”
As for state funding, the most recent state operating budget left eligibility for the Publicly Funded Child Care program at 145% of the federal poverty level, despite calls for the level to be raised to 160% or even 200%.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXA cost-sharing model called the Child Care Cred Program that splits child care costs among the state, employers and employees who apply for the program received a $10 million appropriation. The budget provision started out as GOP-led legislation in both the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate, but policy analysts say other states who have tried the program have seen “lackluster” results.
The Child Care Choice Voucher Program also received $50 million over the next two years in the state budget. The money will come from federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds.
While grant programs to support recruitment and mentorship in the child care sector were included in the budget, the amounts the state contributed to them went from as much as $3.2 million in House budget drafts, down to $2.85 million in the final budget.
There’s going to be a harder lift as the new year begins, partly because the incremental funding changes advocates have attempted to persuade the Ohio legislature to take have fallen by the wayside, leaving the large gap, a number of that could prove too eye-popping for policymakers to take on.
“I’m sure we’re not the only (sector) with a funding gap, and there’s not going to be new federal money that’s going to be able to cover this gap,” Gutierrez said.
Accessibility and affordability continue to be issues for child care providers and families alike. According to a 2025 child care survey of central Ohio conducted by the Ohio-based non-profit Action for Children, 16% of providers in that area are unsure whether they will remain open in the next three months, a 5% increase from 2024 data.
“Providers have even deeper concerns about long-term stability, with over half (58%) of all providers unsure if they will be open in the next 12 months, without additional public support,” the report stated.
The research found that nearly half of the providers who participated in the report say their monthly revenue doesn’t cover expenses. The providers are also seeing less-than-capacity enrollment, with about 70% enrollment from facility to facility.
“Under-enrollment can cause financial challenges for child care providers who often operate on thin margins even when fully enrolled,” the report stated. “Lack of full enrollment can put the program at risk of closure, and so, decrease stability for the families it serves, and exacerbate shortages of affordable, quality care.”
The cost of child care has been debated by the legislature for years, with various bills attempted, from cost-sharing models to family tax credits. But with state funding dips and federal money being cut or fading away, struggles may continue for families who need the care.
The Action for Children study found child care to be “out of reach” for many households in central Ohio, and for those who can afford it, it’s “often their largest single monthly expense.”
In Franklin County, for example, the lowest median cost of child care makes up 14.6% of the average income in the county, where the median household income is $1,367 per week.
Gutierrez said driving down cost will of course be a big part of Groundwork’s work within the legislature next year.
“Affordability is the number one for families … (we’re) looking at both child care and potential child tax credit policies to help hard-working families,” she said.

That includes Ohio secretary of state, attorney general, auditor, treasurer. Two Ohio Supreme Court justice seats will also be up for election this year.

Former Ohio Department of Health director Dr. Amy Acton is running as a Democratic candidate for governor. Former Congressman Tim Ryan announced he will not run for governor, essentially clearing a path for Acton to be the Democratic nominee.   
Acton has received nominations from the Ohio Federation of Teachers, Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, the Ohio Association of Public School Employees, AFSCME Ohio Council 8, former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, and the United Auto Workers.
There are two Republican candidates running for governor — entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and political newcomer Casey Putsch. The Ohio Republican Party officially endorsed Ramaswamy in May 2025.
Ramaswamy has secured trade union endorsements including the Ohio Teamsters Union and the Central Regional Council of Carpenters. President Donald Trump and the Center for Christian Virtue’s president have also endorsed Ramaswamy, who ran for president in 2024. 
Putsch lives in northwest Ohio and is a founder of the nonprofit Genius Garage car charity.  
Political newcomer Heather Hill is also running for governor as an independent after leaving the Republican party. 
Former Democratic state Rep. Elliot Forhan and John Kulewicz, a retired attorney and Upper Arlington City Council member, are running in the Democratic primary for Ohio attorney general. Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is also running for attorney general. 
Democratic Ohio House state Rep. Allison Russo and Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, are running in the Democratic primary for secretary of state.
Current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and retired Air Force intel officer Marcell Strbich are running in the Republican primary for secretary of state. 
Current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for state auditor in 2026. 
A Republican primary for the nomination for Ohio treasurer includes former state Sen. Niraj Antani, current state Sen. Kristina Roegner, former state Rep. Jay Edwards, and Lake County Treasurer Michael Zuren.
No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer. 
Two Ohio Supreme Court races will be on the 2026 ballot.
Democratic Ohio Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Brunner is being challenged by four Republicans competing in a primary — former Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Colleen O’Donnell, Fifth District Court of Appeals Judge Andrew King, Second District Court of Appeals Judge Ron Lewis, and State Appellate Judge Jill Flagg Lanzinger. 
Brunner is the only Democratic judge on the 6-1 Ohio Supreme Court. 
Republican Ohio Supreme Court Justice Dan Hawkins is up for reelection next year against Democratic candidate First District Court of Appeals Judge Marilyn Zayas, who previously ran unsuccessfully for Ohio Supreme Court in 2022 when she lost to Justice Pat DeWine by a 13% margin. 
The filing deadline to run for Ohio office is Feb. 4, Ohio’s primary election is May 5, and the general election is Nov. 3. 
The last time a Democratic candidate won any of Ohio statewide executive offices was back in 2006 when Ted Strickland was elected governor, Marc Dann was elected attorney general, Richard Cordray was elected treasurer, and Jennifer Bruner was elected secretary of state. 
Also in 2026, former Ohio Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown will challenge appointed Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, who replaced JD Vance in the chamber. Husted is seeking his first election to the position.

A small group of Venezuelans, their loved ones and advocates gathered Sunday at the Gen. Simón Bolívar Memorial near the National Mall to celebrate the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.
President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that U.S. military forces captured Maduro and Flores in an overnight raid on their home. Both were brought to the U.S., where they face narco-terrorism charges.
The U.S.’ overnight military operation knocked out electricity in parts of Venezuela’s capital of Caracas and included strikes on military installations. That was followed by Trump’s remarks Saturday that the U.S. would “run” Venezuela in the interim.
Many in the U.S., however, remain divided over Trump’s invasion and capture of another country’s leader, especially considering the lack of congressional approval to carry out the operation. Critics worry it will drag the U.S. into another costly war, saying the president is only doing this to gain access to Venezuelan oil.
But, Maduro’s capture is also being welcomed by many Venezuelans as he is widely seen by opponents — within his country and by foreign governments — as having illegitimately won Venezuela’s 2024 election.
The memorial statue where Sunday’s festivities took place honors Simón Bolívar, popularly known as “The Liberator” for his work securing the independence of multiple Latin American countries, including Venezuela, from Spanish rule in the 1800s.
‘The usurper president’
In attendance was Gabriela Montero, an award-winning Venezuelan pianist and human rights advocate who performed at the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony for Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado.

“This is not a matter of the U.S. coming in and taking our riches and taking our resources. This is about removing from office a group, and in this case, right now, the usurper president, and allowing, in this next phase, a space for a transition which will finally lead the road to our freedom,” Montero said.
When asked if he had any reservations about U.S. military action in Venezuela, Montero’s husband Sam McElroy responded, “none, whatsoever.”
“I can fully understand why people, for example, are concerned about the extrajudicial nature of the bombing of the boats, and how this was done without an act of Congress, or without consulting Congress. But, you also have to deal with the problem as you see it and as you find it,” McElroy said.
“It was an extraction of two criminals, not an extraction of a president, because he’s not the president of Venezuela,” he said. “He was the illegitimate usurper, a criminal who was extracted. So we must get that right.”
Both Montero and McElroy consider Edmundo González to be the legitimate winner of the 2024 presidential election.
“Venezuelans, we have, for the last 20-plus years, voted. We’ve marched. We’ve tried to find our way to democracy through democratic means,” Montero said.
“We’ve done everything that was required of us as a peaceful people without the arms that the military and the government, unfortunately, own, and we’ve done everything that we could to be able to free ourselves and to become a democratic state again, and it’s been impossible.”
Carlos Figueroa attended Sunday’s celebration with his family.
He expressed gratitude to the Trump administration, saying he never thought he’d see Maduro brought to justice for creating “unbearable conditions” in Venezuela. He said that after decades, many Venezuelans who initially fled the country will feel safe coming home.
“The rule of law is not yet restored in the country. When that happens, then, of course, millions of Venezuelans will return back. And, definitely, that’s my expectation too,” Figueroa said.
‘Hands off Venezuela’
Just blocks away at the White House, another small group gathered, but with different intentions: To protest both U.S. military action in Venezuela and the capturing of Maduro and Flores.

Robbie McLuckie was part of that group. He held a sign reading, “Hands off Venezuela.”
“I’m just really concerned about the military action on Venezuela. I think it should have gone through Congress, and the Trump administration took unilateral action and impacted the sovereign rights of another country,” McLuckie said.
“Obviously, Maduro is a complicated, bad guy. He wasn’t a good leader. He mistreated his people. But, that doesn’t mean we need to be invading other people’s countries without congressional approval, kidnapping their leader, and bringing them back. I think that’s really scary.”
Also part of that group was a demonstrator named Jose, who shared similar concerns.
“We know very well that, you know, the natural resources are one of the primary interests to do all these kinds of attacks,” Jose said.
“You know, I’m from Bolivia, and Bolivia, we have one of the biggest resources of lithium, and we know that this is going to happen to us,” he said. “If that happened to Venezuela, we are next.”
But Venezuelans, like Montero and Figueroa, remain steadfast in their support for the Trump administration’s operation.
“A lot of people think they understand Venezuela. They’ve just arrived in the conversation. We’ve been in this fight for 27 years,” Montero said.
“Ask a Venezuelan, ask us what our story is, ask us how much we suffered and we’ve lost. Ask us, you know, to inform you, to educate you,” she said. “Don’t presume to know, because this is a complex situation.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)As 2026 begins, so does the second year of Maine’s two-year legislative session.
The official start of the second regular session of the 132nd Legislature is Jan. 7, but throughout the fall the 35 members of the Maine Senate and 151 members of the House of Representatives have been revising proposals and introducing emergency measures with the guidance of analysts and other staff. 
Most legislation is proposed before the start of the two-year cycle, ahead of what is referred to as the “long session,” which typically lasts from January through June. 
This year’s “short session” — scheduled to end on April 15, though it’s possible it’ll run longer — will be focused on legislation carried over from 2025, with some new proposals, including a supplemental budget.  
Legislation 
During the first year of the 132nd Legislature in 2025, legislators passed a biennial budget and a budget addition, as well as hundreds of new laws, which added protections from ticket scams, prohibited the doxing of children, and shielded health care providers by allowing them to remove their names from the label of abortion drugs, among other things.  
But lawmakers and the governor pushed off the fate of hundreds of other bills to the second regular session. 
Gov. Janet Mills postponed her decision on 61 bills that have already passed both chambers of the Legislature, such as proposals to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following the state’s largest toxic foam spill in Brunswick.
Mills can either veto these bills within the first three days of the next session or allow them to become law without her signature after that. 
She’s already announced her intention to allow at least two to become law: one that will restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement and another that will require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns.
The 61 bills being held are in addition to nearly 400 that the Legislature opted to carry over into next year. That legislation includes all of the measures that were left on what are referred to as the appropriations and study tables. The bills that end up on these tables have largely passed the full Legislature but still needed to vie for remaining funding, or in the case of studies, legislative staff in order to help conduct them. 
The House and Senate will also consider some new proposals the Legislative Council, a group composed of the ten legislative leaders, approved in the fall. 
For example, the council accepted a bill from Senate Assistant Majority Leader Jill Duson (D-Cumberland) that seeks to protect due process in immigration detentions. 
Each bill is assigned to one of the 17 joint legislative committees, which hold public hearings and work sessions and then cast votes that serve as recommendations for how the full Legislature should vote. But, the full Legislature doesn’t always agree with the committee. 
The chamber in which a bill’s sponsor resides determines whether the House or Senate takes a bill up first. Legislation has to make it through both the chambers (​​which means passing at least four steps on the floor in each: first reading, second reading, engrossment and enactment) in order to get to the governor, who can either sign the bill, allow it to become law without her signature or veto it. 
If Mills does the latter, lawmakers can override a veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber, though the Legislature has so far never done this during her tenure. 
But, there are also other — less visible — ways bills can die. Notably, the appropriations table, where bills are placed to vie for remaining funding if not funded in the budget. (During the 131st Legislature, less than 10% of bills placed on the appropriations table ultimately became law.)
Any bills the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee decides to fund off the table still need approval again by the full Legislature and ultimately the governor. 
Budget 
Each legislative session, lawmakers are tasked with passing a biennial budget in the first year and a supplemental budget in the second year to adjust for changes in revenue or priorities. 
There remains a fair amount of economic uncertainty as the governor and lawmakers begin to debate adjustments. 
The state is expected to take in nearly $250 million more over the next two years than previously estimated. But as Maine State Economist Amanda Rector said during a Dec. 15 briefing to the appropriations committee, “It is important to bear in mind that there is a high degree of risk associated with the forecast as a result of the extremely uncertain economic environment we continue to face,” noting federal changes such as tariffs and a lack of jobs and inflation data, among overall economic unpredictability.  
The governor proposes her budget plan first, which she submits to lawmakers, specifically the appropriations committee. The appropriations committee then holds public hearings on each part of the plan before it puts forth a budget bill to be considered by the full Legislature.  
Unlike the federal government, which can take on debt, the governor is required to propose a balanced budget. The Legislature then bears the responsibility of enacting a budget — in conjunction with all other spending bills — in which spending doesn’t exceed available resources in those specific fiscal years.
Like other bills, the budget bill can either pass as an emergency measure, which requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers and would allow it to take effect immediately upon approval by the governor, or as a non-emergency measure, which only requires a majority vote in both chambers and would result in the bill taking effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns. 
Last session, the Democratic majority passed both the initial biennial budget that largely continued funding at the same levels and the budget addition that later added policy changes without Republican support.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which the White House said will be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center.  (Photo courtesy of Kennedy Center)Nebraskans will remember 2025 as a year when grocery, coffee shop or online retail receipts got them in touch with “affordability” … or lack thereof. As we begin a new year, all of us should consider other meanings for the word. 
To wit: CBS’s “60 Minutes” ranks among television’s most iconic programs. Its long, well-respected run began five years after the assasination of John F. Kennedy. Both benchmarks are back in headlines … reminding us of what we can’t afford.
As widely reported, the new, inexperienced editor-in-chief at CBS News killed a “60 Minutes” segment last month that exposed serious problems in the administration’s immigration enforcement practices. 
The piece’s cutting came on the heels of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts board — handpicked by the president — added his name to the building, which is a memorial to JFK. 
I rarely write about other media, lest readers confuse criticism with a cheap shot or praise with professional bias. I’ll take that chance here because the “60 Minutes” dustup is more than simply looking at one piece of journalism. 
It’s about whether journalists can continue practicing their profession as they have since 1791, when we ratified the Bill of Rights. If you’re keeping score at home, the Fourth Estate has been at it about 235 years. 
You know the particulars: No government interference with citizens’ rights and freedom to be informed … as we do also with speech, assembly, prayer and petitioning. 
The government did not directly spike the “60 Minutes” story, which was about the country deporting immigrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The reporter has publicly denounced the decision as political rather than journalistic. 
Her boss argued that the story should be held until the reporter obtained comments from the administration, something the reporter had sought several times but got no response. 
The reporter wrote, rightly, that if officials can undo a story by not commenting when given the chance, they effectively have a “kill switch” for any piece with which they might disagree.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Journalism holds accountable those in power, who spend taxpayer money, make and enforce laws by which we live, govern according to the Constitution and are responsible for safeguarding the rights of those who gave them such power. 
When “news” capitulates in the face of government displeasure or criticism — before or after the fact — freedom is restricted and information filtered or erased. In a democracy, that’s simply unaffordable, a price too steep to pay.
The postscript to the “60 Minutes” hullabaloo was a modern “miracle.” CBS had already sent the segment to a Canadian streaming service, where it was promptly bootlegged and shone all over the internet. It’s a solid piece of journalism, well-reported and neither sensational nor unseemly. What we’ve come to expect from “60 Minutes.” The hope is that we can continue to do so.
Slapping another name on the Kennedy Center fails any number of tests, not the least of which is that only Congress, because federal law created the place, can effect such a change. The president and the center’s board know that, legal principles apparently be damned.
Other failures are at work here. One is history. In 1955 President Eisenhower appointed a commission to consider a new public center for the performing arts in the nation’s capital. That culminated in the National Cultural Center Act passed in 1958. As president, JFK led the effort to raise funds to build the center. 
After his assasination, federal legislation renamed what was then the National Cultural Center to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a “living memorial” to the former president. 
Attaching another name, even a twice-elected president who had nothing to do with the center’s inception and spirit, chafes against this history and simple good taste. Just last week, when the Kennedys were mourning the loss of JFK’s granddaughter, the president belittled their support of the center.
Not that long ago we witnessed much political hand-wringing about government overreach, nefarious plots and ploys we were told unnecessarily injected the feds’ reach where it didn’t belong. The worry? The government was meddling in our personal lives, changing the rules and costing us our freedoms.
Overreach can happen in other ways, too. When, for example, the government casts a large shadow over the reporting of the news. Or it decides that the rules and regulations of the institutions and infrastructures on which our politics and our way of life operate can be ignored or flouted.
A democratic republic like ours, in its 250th year, can afford neither.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)It’s a new year here in the Free State of Florida and you’re freer than ever!
Free to tote guns; free to kill bears; free to drain and pave; free to call ICE if you spy some brown-complected fellows in the Home Depot parking lot.
Most of all, you’re free to make New Year’s Resolutions.
Not the usual crap about getting more exercise, practicing mindfulness, adding legumes to your diet or volunteering.
Nonsense.
We’re Americans: selfish, lazy, and overweight.
Now, I don’t know what resolutions your elected officials and other powerful Florida folk have made, but here are a few guesses and predictions for the Year of Our Lord 2026.
Assuming there’s not a world-wide conflagration, an almighty flood, or a plague of frogs, in which case all bets are off.
1. In preparation for a 2028 presidential run, Gov. Ronald Dion DeSantis will resolve to learn to smile properly.
And be nice.
Or nice-adjacent.
As you recall, voters didn’t exactly warm to him in 2024. He was, as one columnist put it, “an all-around odd duck and not in a good way.”
The solution? Charm School!
Avenues of Excellence in Coral Gables offers private lessons in everything from social discourse to how one does and does not eat one’s chocolate pudding.
2. Sen. Stan McClain and Rep. Dean Black resolve that in 2026 they will protect Florida’s Confederate monuments, slapping fines on Damn Yankees who dare try and remove them.
It didn’t pass last year but, by God and General Lee, the bill will be heard in the Legislature this year.
Why not go bigger? Get more Confederate names back on schools and roads.
Ditch the “Barack Obama” and “Harriet Tubman” street signs and return to calling the Old Dixie Highway the Old Dixie Highway.
The Pentagon has brought the names of Confederate generals Bragg and Benning back to the military bases where they belong. (There was a federal law against that, so Pete Hegseth found some people with the same last names that he could borrow.)
Now, how about righting the wrong done to Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest? Jacksonville wokesters forced N.B. Forrest High School to change its name to “Westside.”
Political correctness run amok.
Forrest was a valiant soldier, a human resources entrepreneur (some called it “slave trading”) and, as Grand Wizard of the Invisible Empire, a pioneering anti-DEI campaigner.
3. How ’bout them ’Noles!
I do not mean this in a good way.
FSU’s once-vaunted football team did not cover itself in glory this season.
Nor did the University of Florida’s: The Gators went 4-8; the Seminoles 5-7.
A couple of directional colleges went to bowls: FIU appeared in the Servpro First Responder Bowl (lost) and USF in the StaffDNA Cure Bowl (also lost).
On the plus side, the ever-annoying University of Miami beat the even-more-annoying Ohio State in the first playoff.
But Texas had eight teams in post-season play.
Texas. Eight.
Florida athletic programs are struggling. They have to build indoor practice facilities. They have to hire a coach and pay him millions, then millions more when they fire him.
It’s tough.
Therefore, every Floridian must resolve to give generously to the Name, Image, and Likeness Collective of their choice to help buy the best players in the nation.
While you’re at it, you can support some of their proud sponsors, including Cambio Tequila and Social House Vodka.
4. Why don’t we all pitch in and help ban more books this year?
Local cranks and Moms for Liberty can’t do all the work.
Many of Toni Morrison’s books are off the shelves, as well as “Slaughterhouse Five,” Kurt Vonnegut’s mind-bending anti-war novel, which one Mom for Liberty called “shocking and perverse.”
She elaborated: “I don’t think [my daughter] needs to fill her head with pictures and ideas of Shetland ponies having sex with girls.”
Still, too many works of literature remain unbanned.
John Keats’ 1820 poem “The Eve of St. Agnes,” for example, which promotes unmarried sex and the eating of strange, possibly hallucinogenic, foodstuffs: “spiced dainties” and “lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon.”
Or “Moby Dick” (that title!) which depicts two men sleeping in the same bed and calling each other “husband and wife.”
Or William Faulkner’s “Go Down, Moses,” a Critical Race Theory novel which implies that slavery was really quite bad.
Get to work, people. Make 2026 the year our children read nothing but the clean-ish bits of the Bible.
5. Members of Florida’s well-upholstered “developer community” make the same resolution every New Year’s: erect strip malls, big box stores, golf courses, and ticky-tack exurban “communities” on what’s left of Florida’s unspoiled lands.
I wouldn’t be surprised if they inscribed their vow in the blood of road-kill critters on sheep skin.
Even though tiresome “knee-jerk obstructionists” (as one legislator calls people who care about clean water, habitat destruction, and sprawl) fight back.
Sometimes the tree-huggers even win.
As the Phoenix’s Craig Pittman reported, the Sarasota Audubon Club stopped the nation’s largest homebuilder from parking 170 houses next to a bird sanctuary.
In Orange County, enraged residents said a big hell no to a Texas outfit planning to build an 1,800-house monstrosity on land zoned rural.
But this year, developers are getting a little help from their friends in the Florida Legislature.
The peoples’ representatives plan to push through a brace of bills that would hamstring the public’s ability to object to developments, allow city or county administrators – not elected commissioners, answerable to the voters – to approve projects, and override local government.
No opportunity for corruption there, no sir.
6, The Florida Democratic Party (Yes! It still exists!) also makes the same resolution every New Year’s: Win an election.
Any election.
And dang, if they didn’t snag one in 2025!
A non-Republican female human beat a Donald-Trump-and-Ron-DeSantis-endorsed Republican male person to become mayor of Miami.
Republicans were typically gracious in defeat.
The Miami-Dade County Party Chairman said, Democrats were “making a mountain out of a molehill.
“It’s not a rebuke of the president or the party. Democratic city elects Democratic mayor.”
Even though this Democratic city hasn’t elected a Democratic mayor in 28 years.
If nothing else, it may perk up our Donkey friends.
A little.
David Jolly, a former U.S representative and former Republican, is running for governor as a Democrat.
But Rep. Byron Donalds, Donald Trump’s preferred candidate, leads in the polls.
As befits a MAGA man, Donalds is given to saying things divorced from both history and intelligence.
Perhaps you are unaware that, while Jim Crow wasn’t great, at least “the Black family was together” and politically “conservative.”
Never mind the lynchings.
7. Speaking of the gubernatorial race, the Republican Party of Florida might consider worrying about the upstart candidacy of one James Fishback, a 31-year-old Elon Musk fanboy now being sued by his former hedge fund employer.
Fishback’s building name recognition in a peculiar way, getting thrown out of an economic conference for confronting Federal Reserve board member Lisa Cook (the one Trump keeps trying to fire), demanding foreign students pay $1 million a year in tuition at Florida universities, and calling Byron Donalds a “slave” and “DEI Donalds.”
Combustible Florida U.S. Rep. Rep. Randy Fine, who was once ordered by a judge to attend anger management classes, and who said Palestinians in Gaza should “starve away,” calls Fishback “a total weirdo.”
Obviously, he’s an exemplary MAGA candidate.
8. The governor and the grim band of anti-intellectuals who rule higher education in Florida have yet to declare this resolution out loud, but it’s pretty clear they want 2026 to be the year they turn all our universities into New College.
Once a highly regarded liberal arts school where non-traditional students – outside-the-box thinkers, gay kids, trans kids, arty kids – were as welcome as more mainstream students, where learning was creative, not prescriptive, New College is now sad and second-rate.
Determined to quash academic freedom across the state system, DeSantis has installed ideologically aligned presidents at UWF, USF, FIU, FAU, and FAMU.
The interim (soon to be permanent) president of the University of Florida, a climate change skeptic, has ordered UF to be “institutionally neutral.”
What he means is “conservative.”
UF has shut down its Department of Environmental Horticulture (“environmental” is a bad word), abolished its Center for Inclusion and Multicultural Engagement, and shuttered its Office of Sustainability.
Many humanities and social sciences programs are endangered, too.
But the spanking new Hamilton School for Classical and Civic Education, run by the very conservative former state Supreme Court chief justice Charles Canady and endowed by, among others, by the right-wing Council on University Reform and billionaire DeSantis donor Ken Griffin gets all the money it wants.
Institutional neutrality roars into the future, charged with teaching the superiority of Western Civilization.
All I can say is Happy New Year, y’all.
And good luck.
We’ll need it.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0934-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 00:11:42.031318

We do little to prevent this, so there is only one plausible conclusion: We are okay with it.","Last month Abdulah Kanchero, of New Haven, and Francisco J. Diaz-Aquino and Johanna  Beatriz Navas-Gonzalez, of Stamford, died in the cold, unsheltered.
On the night Kanchero passed, the Unhoused Activist Community Team (UACT), including 18 people who had been turned away from full warming centers, occupied New Haven City Hall. After sending police to throw everyone out into the frigid night, the administration relented and opened an additional overflow warming center in a meeting room in the Hall of Records.
Following the deaths in Stamford, Gov. Ned Lamont released state funding for homelessness services to partially make up for federal cuts in that area.
Whenever the death of an unhoused person makes the news, there is wringing of hands and perhaps token action. Here’s the thing: Winter comes every year; and we know that it will kill about 700 unhoused people in this country. We do so little to prevent these deaths, there is only one plausible conclusion: We are okay with it.
Our economy needs homelessness, to support the commodification of real estate, which makes a few people rich while leaving housing unaffordable for the rest of us, and to keep worker bees buzzing busily. This year the Harris Poll found that 40% of U.S. Americans were dissatisfied with their jobs but would not quit because of fears about an uncertain economy.
“Why work?” you may ask.
“So that you don’t die on a park bench,” is a compelling answer.
Though we need homelessness, most people dislike coming face-to-face with it. My friend Rico, who has frequently lived unsheltered, once told me, “If you’re visible, you’re criminal.” The day before any parade or festival, hit the streets at dawn, and you will see police rounding up unhoused people. Sometimes they take a social worker along for cosmetic purposes, but these workers do not have enough safe accommodations to offer everyone being displaced or arrested for the crime of being poor.
New Haven Police ticketed and arrested U-ACT members and unhoused people on the Green the day the Christmas tree was erected. God bless us, everyone.

Government’s power to criminalize homelessness was bolstered by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Grants Pass decision and an executive order issued by President Donald J. Trump, which I’ve written about in depth elsewhere. When the president acted on that executive order with a militarized response to homelessness in the nation’s capital, unhoused people endured arrest and involuntary psychiatric commitment. Some took refuge deep in the woods, disconnected from any services through which they might have obtained housing.
The point has never been to end homelessness, only to punish people who experience it.
I am part of a crew of volunteers who raised the funds for and continues to support Rosette Neighborhood Village, tiny homes in New Haven for formerly unhoused people. After a tent encampment was demolished by the city, we envisioned a place where that community of neighbors could stay together. We also knew that people need a door to close, for privacy and safety. Modular units were a tenable solution. We put them up in a day for about $20,000 each. That is how you respond to an emergency.
When I visited my friends at Rosette Monday, I explained to one man how to get rid of the condensation in his unit. We’ve had a problem with drips ever since the city ordered United Illuminating to turn off our power and hence the built-in heating. Space heaters don’t warm the units evenly. Condensation results. Ostensibly, the city cut power because we do not meet state building code, which requires an individual kitchen and bathroom in a dwelling unit. (Residents share kitchen and bathroom facilities in the Amistad Catholic Worker House only steps away.)
When we appealed to the state, the city sent its own lawyer and building inspector to argue against our petition. Twice, sympathetic state representatives have introduced enabling legislation for tiny home communities administered by faith groups for unhoused people. But the bills never make it to the floor.
My colleagues came up with a rapid and affordable way to provide dignified transitional housing, without spending a dime of public money. If homelessness is a problem in search of a solution, why wouldn’t our local, state and even national governments be beating a path to our door to learn how to replicate the program?
Simple – because homelessness is not a problem. It’s a strategy to maintain an unjust economic system – and a highly effective strategy at that.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-05 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The job market is broken — and I’m graduating into it,Madisyn Kuhnly,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/05/the-job-market-is-broken-and-im-graduating-into-it/,"I love Connecticut and I want to build a career here, but this state does not do enough to make room for new graduates like me.","I’m a graduating senior majoring in communication at a Connecticut university, and instead of looking forward to the moment I cross the stage, I feel a knot in my stomach every time someone asks, “So, what are your plans after college?” 
The honest answer? I don’t know. And that terrifies me.  
All year, I’ve been doing everything I was told would set me up for success. I’ve been polishing my résumé, networking, taking internships, building a portfolio, and looking at job boards months before graduation. I’ve talked to professors, alumni, and friends. And still, every time I even think about graduation, I spiral. 



I’ve also talked to students who graduated last year, the ones who were sitting exactly where I am now. They tell me the job search is “humiliating,” “exhausting” and, most commonly, “brutal.” One friend applied to over 120 positions before getting a single interview. Another, a strong student I’ve always assumed would thrive, is still unemployed. Several others have jobs that have nothing to do with communications at all: barista, receptionist, retail. 
Sometimes, after hearing about how oversaturated this job market is, I wish I had picked a different major. But now I am in too deep. I have invested four years and thousands of dollars in this path. I cannot just turn back. So instead, I sit with the anxiety of wondering whether all this effort will pay off. 
My fear is not just emotional. It is backed by data, especially for communication and journalism majors. 
Connecticut officials like to point out that there are thousands of job openings. According to the state Department of Labor, there are 80,000 job openings statewide. But when you narrow that to media and communication roles, the picture changes. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that media and communication jobs nationwide are projected to grow more slowly than average. 

Madisyn Kuhnly

According to PR Daily, “The marketing and media/communications sectors have been among the hardest hit since the pandemic. When comparing current job openings to February 2020, they’ve endured drops of 24% and 26%, respectively.” 
Part of the problem is that many “entry-level” communications roles are not entry-level. The National Association of Colleges and Employers found that “even before AI, many entry-level jobs were facing extinction, with 35% of employers posting jobs on LinkedIn requiring three years of experience for them.” 
For communications jobs such as PR assistant, social media coordinator or event coordinator, employers often expect polished portfolios, formal client experience and multiple internships. Many students cannot afford unpaid internships. Many work full-time to pay tuition. Many commute long distances and cannot take low-paying opportunities in New York or Boston. 
We graduate qualified but not experienced enough for jobs meant for recent graduates. 
Even when we apply, we wait. And wait. And wait. 
A 2024 hiring report showed the average hiring timeline was 44 days. Communications roles, which often require writing tests, multiple interviews and portfolio reviews, can take even longer. Job seekers on forums like Reddit complain that they’re still looking for jobs many months after graduation. 
In a state like Connecticut, that timeline is dangerous. According to the United Way of Connecticut, 40% of households in 2023 were ALICE households, people who work but still cannot afford basic needs. Many new graduates fall into that category immediately — not because they are unqualified, but because the system is not built to support them. 
So yes, I am scared. I am scared I will walk across that stage, degree in hand, only to end up lost in the same maze last year’s seniors are still navigating. 
Connecticut can change this story. 
First, employers must stop calling jobs “entry-level” when they require years of experience. If companies want local talent, they must be willing to train us. 
Second, Connecticut’s colleges need real pipelines between communications programs and in-state employers, including marketing agencies, nonprofits, hospitals, universities, state agencies and local media outlets. Communications students should not be left to network or sink. 
Third, the state needs to offer paid internship opportunities, especially in communication, where unpaid internships still dominate.  
Finally, employers must shorten hiring timelines. Even a simple “no” is better than months of silence. 
I love Connecticut. I want to stay here. I want to work here. I want to build a career here. I want to build a family here. But I cannot do any of that if the state and its employers do not make space for graduates like me. 
Graduation should feel like a beginning, not an end. 
I have spent four years earning my communications degree. I just want a fair chance to use it.

It would be very easy for Maryland to get swept up in the fervor of a partisan gerrymandering arms race. But is that the right thing to do?
Bill Ferguson, President of the Maryland State Senate, has offered a wise, principled and practical argument against the idea. The General Assembly should heed his advice when it convenes for the 2026 session.
No one wants to see the election of a Democratic majority in Congress more than I do. But I’m writing today on a matter of principle that transcends party.

Instead of getting down in the mud and wrestling with our political adversaries, let’s defeat them at the polls with better ideas for serving the people and solving the nation’s problems.
Attempting to redraw Maryland’s eight Congressional districts to disenfranchise one-fourth of the State’s voters and deny them a voice in the Congress—in what would likely be a vain attempt to capture the one remaining seat held by a Republican—is not only a fool’s errand. It’s wrong.
This isn’t the Maryland way—or shouldn’t be. In these perilous times for the future of our democratic republic, it’s more important than ever to set an example, remain true to our principles of representative government, and not be lured into a tawdry pursuit of base partisanship that has already compromised the integrity and reputation of the Congress in the eyes of the American people, and poisoned the civility of our politics.
Fifty-two percent of Maryland voters are registered Democrats and control seven of the State’s eight seats in the House of Representatives. Moving Democratic voters from adjacent districts into the 1st Congressional District with the goal of defeating the lone Republican in the Delegation could put our incumbent Democrats at risk.
Experts with long experience running Maryland elections told the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission that it may already be too late to change the Congressional district map if the State hopes to ensure an orderly primary and general election process in 2026.
We can’t control what the leaders of other states do. But we can control what we do. Let our adversaries do their worst, and reveal themselves to the American people in doing so. Let them carry that mud-spattered banner, while we take up the challenge of defeating them with the power of our ideas and our commitment to deliver results that improve the lives of our people.
If America’s political system is broken, let’s dedicate ourselves to fixing it, not deal another blow to its credibility. In Maryland, let’s decide to be leaders—not merely followers in an unworthy cause.
We won’t preserve our democratic ideals and principles by imitating the tactics of political adversaries in other states who are determined to extinguish the voices of their opponents.
The speculative notion that the boundaries of Maryland’s eight House districts can be redrawn to guarantee that they will all be represented by Democrats in the next Congress is a bad bet and a bad idea.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 05:56:54.544346

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The Nebraska Medicine board announced Sunday that it had launched an “informational website” aimed at shaping public opinion against letting one of the nonprofit’s owners sell its 50% leadership stake to the other, the University of Nebraska.
The ramping up of the now-public dispute over the group’s future governance comes as the NU Board of Regents prepares for a hearing and possible vote Friday about whether to pay Clarkson Regional Health $500 million for full control.
The regents also will consider a related $300 million transaction for several Clarkson properties in and around the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s midtown Omaha campus, bringing the total price of the buyout to $800 million.
Board argues risks
Nebraska Medicine’s board, steered by people who have led some of the state’s major businesses, appears focused on peeling regents’ support from the proposal. The new website making the group’s argument is www.protectnebraskahealthcare.org.
The site argues, among other things, that compensation for specialists, doctors, nurses and staff could be compromised by state involvement. It seeks more time to find a new private partner for NU to take Clarkson’s place.
Lance Fritz, the former Union Pacific CEO who chairs the Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors, warned in a statement Sunday that ceding control over Nebraska Medicine to the government might put patients and health care providers at risk.
“It’s important that Nebraskans have access to clear and accurate information on this issue,” Fritz said. “We hope this website helps people understand what is being considered and why it is a serious concern.”
NU leaders argue opportunity
NU leaders have argued that patients will see no difference in the quality of care provided or the costs of that care. They argue NU is simply adapting to an ownership structure that reflects most modern academic medical centers.
University leaders, including NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold, have said they do not yet know how much of the $800 million would come from private donors versus public funds. Gold also acknowledged the difficult timing.
The broader NU system also faces the likelihood of additional budget cutting with the State of Nebraska confronting a projected budget shortfall and Gov. Jim Pillen’s push to cut at least $500 million in state spending.
Pillen, a former NU regent whose family runs a hog operation based in Columbus, supports the NU purchase and potential shift in ownership structure. He has said it will protect a vital asset for Nebraskans and their needs.
If the purchase happens, NU would be the sole owner of Nebraska Medicine, which offers hospitals and medical care primarily in eastern Nebraska. Nebraska Medicine’s board has described the push as akin to government healthcare.
Leadership structure questions emerge
Today, NU and Clarkson split leadership on the Nebraska Medicine board. NU says the independent board would still lead UNMC’s medical partner, but it was not immediately clear who would appoint the directors after Clarkson departs.
Following the sale, Clarkson, which helped the university build the core hospital building at 42nd and Dewey Streets, has pledged a $200 million gift to help replace it. Gold said none of the project’s public funding would pull from the budgets of other NU campuses. The campuses together finalized cuts last fall totaling $43 million. 
Clarkson offers NU its half of Nebraska Medicine, properties for $800 million

Clarkson has said it plans to use the purchase-related funds from NU to grow a local private foundation focused on providing grants aimed at making Nebraska the healthiest state in the U.S. and improving how health care is delivered and carried out.
NU leadership is facing questions of its own internally, Gold wrote in an email to UNMC faculty, staff and students on Sunday afternoon. Gold announced a campus forum set for noon Tuesday at UNMC’s Truhlsen Events Center.
Gold shared a frequently asked questions document that seeks to emphasize the university does not intend to change how Nebraska Medicine is managed. The document argues Nebraska Medicine was already run by its owners. It says Nebraska Medicine employees will not become state employees.
“When [Clarkson] began to consider resigning its position in Nebraska Medicine, it approached the Board of Regents to see if the University of Nebraska would be interested in sole-member governance,” Gold wrote. “This is a tremendous opportunity for the University of Nebraska Medical Center.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Members of Montana’s Congressional delegation quickly praised President Donald Trump and the military for the capture Saturday of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, characterized by the administration as head of a drug cartel.
U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, one of three military veterans who are members of the all-Republican delegation, said on social media that Trump acted within his powers to take “decisive military action” against an illegitimate “narco-terrorist dictator.”
“America should not be viewed as conquerer, but rather as a liberator of freedom for the (Venezuelan) people,” Zinke said in a social media post. “With the help of the United States, I am confident they will now be able to use their resources to build a better and more prosperous future.”
Trump announced on Saturday the United States would “run the country” until “a proper transition can take place.”
Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, also was captured, and they both will face a U.S. indictment on narco-terrorism and conspiracy charges levied in 2020, States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C., bureau reported.
Many elected Democrats condemned the strike and said it superseded Congress’ authority to declare war, but in posts on social media, Montana’s delegation defended the action.
“Maduro was an illegitimate dictator and narco-terror kingpin with American blood on his hands,” said U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, who, like Zinke, also served as a U.S. Navy SEAL. “The American people and the Western hemisphere are safer as a result of this operation. Thank you to our brave military and @potus.”
U.S. Air Force veteran and Rep. Troy Downing said the action shows the United States will protect its people.
“Venezuela is a fake narco-state and Nicolas Maduro was a complicit narco operator, both of which posed a direct threat to the health and safety of the American people,” Downing said. “This morning’s targeted operation put the world on notice that the United States will respond with force to criminals and adversaries threatening the safety and welfare of Americans. Peace through strength is the mission.”
States Newsroom’s D.C. bureau said the U.S. and many other countries determined Maduro’s reelection in 2024 was illegitimate.
Trump also has said the operation related to securing oil.
U.S. Sen Steve Daines, the most senior member of the Montana delegation, praised the effort.
“I commend @POTUS and our brave military and law enforcement for helping bring indicted narco-terrorist Maduro to justice today,” Daines said in a post Saturday. “The world is safer thanks to peace through strength.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1174-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-04 17:57:47.873601

(Photo courtesy of office of U.S Rep Gab Amo)The year is new, but the argument is the same: The Trump administration has no constitutional authority to halt work on a major offshore wind project nearing completion south of Rhode Island’s coastline.
Hundreds of pages of legal filings submitted in federal court on Jan. 1 and 2 by the Revolution Wind developers reprise many of the same arguments already invoked in its August lawsuit against federal regulators. 
The 65-turbine project was already 80% complete when the Trump administration unexpectedly ordered work to stop on Aug. 22, citing national security issues. A month of anguish ensued, with local officials, labor leaders and environmental advocates, along with the companies behind the $5 billion project, decrying the unconstitutional overstep by federal regulators. A federal judge in D.C. stepped in, forcing the Trump administration to back off in a Sept. 22 order. Unlike other litigation between states and companies and the federal government, the order was never appealed.
The rocky seas seemed to calm. Laborers resumed work, and the developers said they were still on schedule to begin providing power to Rhode Island and Connecticut by mid-2026. Offshore installation was scheduled to be completed in mid-February, according to an affidavit from Paul Murphy, senior engineering procurement and construction director for the project. 
Then, three days before Christmas, a new edict from the Trump administration ordered work to stop again on Revolution Wind and four other offshore wind projects along the Atlantic coast. The second, 90-day pause again rested on national security concerns, despite the rigorous review already dubbed complete by the same federal energy agencies years before.
Orsted A/S, the Danish renewable energy giant co-developing Revolution Wind, initially offered a veiled response to the second stop work order. But the hundreds of pages filed in D.C. federal court in the first two days of the year reveal a more forceful fight.
“The Second Stop Work Order is arbitrary and capricious: It is wholly conclusory, internally inconsistent, and overbroad,” states one of the new legal filings, submitted on Jan. 1. “The Second Stop Work Order ignores that the [Department of] Interior has stated plainly that the Project does not interfere with national security. It also ignores Revolution Wind’s obvious and substantial actions and billions of dollars of investment made in reliance.”
Since work resumed in mid-September, developers have finished installing the foundations that anchor the turbines to the sea floor, along with 58 of the 65 turbines, and “substantial completion” of the underwater cables that will connect the wind-powered electricity to the regional grid, according to court filings. Developers now estimate the project is 87% completed — up from 80% in mid-August.
With every day the pause continues, the losses pile up. The companies estimate they are losing $1.44 million a day on already inked contracts with specialty vessels meant to carry heavy equipment and workers out to sea. If the pause is not lifted by Jan. 12, there is a “very high risk” the vessels will no longer be available and the remaining turbines will not be installed by the mandated Jan. 15, 2027 deadline to supply power to Rhode Island, the court filings state.
The development companies are seeking a second preliminary injunction to stop the Trump administration from suspending work on the project, and have also asked to speed up the deliberations.
Royce C. Lamberth, senior judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, agreed to the second request. His Jan. 2 order gives the Department of Justice attorneys representing the federal administration until Thursday, Jan. 8, to submit a response. An in-person hearing in Lamberth’s D.C. courtroom is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Monday, Jan. 12, according to the court docket.

What’s at stake in R.I.
Beyond the $6 billion loss projected by project developers if the project is canceled or left incomplete are the consequences for Rhode Island and Connecticut. On Friday, state and congressional leaders, labor organizers and environmental advocates organized a press conference and rally in downtown Providence to demonstrate their support for the project.
“Rhode Island has built national leadership in offshore wind by doing the hard work and delivering real results,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement following the event. “These projects are essential to keeping energy affordable, creating long-term jobs, strengthening our economy, and meeting our climate goals. We remain committed to an energy future that works for Rhode Island’s workers, families, and businesses.”
More than 2,000 workers, many of them union laborers, have staked their careers on the burgeoning offshore wind industry, aided by specialty training programs including at the Community College of Rhode Island. Since the second stop work order was issued, 200 workers were put on standby for off- and onshore work, according to an affidavit from Melanie Gearon, head of permitting for the project. 
“Just days before the holidays, this administration chose to put thousands of skilled construction workers in limbo – again,” said Michael F. Sabitoni, general secretary-treasurer of the local chapter of the Laborers’ International Union of North America and president of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council. “These are men and women who were counting on this work to support their families and keep food on the table. Offshore wind means union jobs, strong wages, and real economic security. Pulling the plug at the end of the year is reckless and deeply unfair to working families.”

The Ocean State’s ambitious decarbonization mandate, reaching net-zero by 2050, also hinges upon the project’s completion and power for up to 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut. Even states without direct contracts to buy power from the project stand to benefit from a regional electric grid better shielded from the seasonal fluctuations in natural gas prices and availability.
“Stopping these projects ignores both climate science and public support for these projects, and it delays the clean energy transition our communities are counting on,” said Jeff Migneault, executive director of Climate Action Rhode Island. 
The press conference and rally also featured remarks from U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo.
The states’ stakes in the project were the focus of a second federal lawsuit filed by Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general in August. The AGs case was originally filed in Rhode Island federal court, but transferred to D.C. in December, less than two weeks before the second stop work order. No new submissions have been filed in the AGs court case since the latest move by the Trump administration to halt the project, though Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said previously that his office was reviewing the suspension order.
A second Orsted project, Sunrise Wind, under construction off the coast of Long Island, New York, was also subject to the December stop work order. Orsted said in a statement on Jan. 1 that it is still evaluating options for this project, including possible legal proceedings. 
Also affected: Vineyard Wind 1, south of Martha’s Vineyard, Empire Wind 1 off New York’s coastline and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. Developers for Empire Wind and the Virginia project have also filed separate federal lawsuits against the Trump administration for their projects.

Vermont’s congressional delegation condemned the U.S. military’s attack on Venezuela over the weekend that led to the capture of the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, and Vermont Democrats U.S. Sen. Peter Welch and U.S. Rep Becca Balint, all labeled Maduro a brutal authoritarian but said President Donald Trump’s attacks on the South American county exceeded his constitutional authority. 
“Trump’s attack on Venezuela will make the United States and the world less safe. This brazen violation of international law gives a green light to any nation on earth that may wish to attack another country to seize their resources or change their governments,” Sanders said in a statement. 
U.S. forces entered the Venezuelan capital of Caracas overnight Friday into Saturday, and more than 100 U.S. aircraft helped neutralize the country’s air defenses, the New York Times reported. More than 40 people were killed, according to Venezuelan authorities, though Trump said there were no Americans killed in the attack. 
American troops captured both Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, later transporting them out of the country, according to news reports. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro would face charges in the U.S. of narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy, among other charges. 
Trump said Saturday that the U.S. would “run” Venezuela while a transfer of power took place. The details of that plan were not immediately clear, though many of Trump’s comments focused on growing the Venezuelan oil industry.  
Vermont’s top federal lawmakers wasted little time in condemning the military escalation. They had similarly criticized the staging of Vermont Air National Guard members in the Caribbean to support the military buildup against Venezuela. 
“President Trump’s hunger for a regime change war makes it clear he doesn’t care about how this unauthorized and illegal action could cause further chaos and suffering in Venezuela. Has he learned nothing from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya?” Welch said in a statement Saturday. “This could lead us into another forever war, risking the lives of U.S. service members and hurting the economy.”
Balint, in her own statement, said the U.S. had made “these horrible mistakes before.”
“Americans do not want another war,” she said.

Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a “significant” factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt’s son signed in August 2024.

Once the nation’s largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.
The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.
When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.
As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.
Nellie Betancourt, shown in a photo with her husband, Gabe, had planned a trip to Las Vegas before she fractured her hip at a Genesis HealthCare rehabilitation center — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. “When she went into that place, I said, ‘Well, she’s going to be taken care of for a few more days and I’ll take her home,’” Gabe says. (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)
“It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,” said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt’s family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.
Gabe Betancourt holds an old photograph of his wife, Nellie, that he keeps in his wallet. “I carry her with me everywhere I go,” he says. (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)
Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions about individual personal injury cases. The statement said Genesis remained “focused on delivering high-quality, compassionate care to our patients and residents without disruption” during bankruptcy.
One lawsuit Genesis settled for nearly $1 million alleged nursing home managers ignored repeated warnings about a male resident’s behavior before he sexually assaulted a female Alzheimer’s patient, according to court records. In a case the company resolved for $500,000, a Genesis nursing home was accused of delaying the hospitalization of a resident who had vomited brown mucus. He died of a bowel obstruction. Genesis has paid nothing for either settlement, according to bankruptcy claims.
Creditors, including families of the deceased, are expected to salvage a fraction of what they were promised, if anything. On Dec. 10, the company’s owners were scheduled to seek approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas to sell its nursing homes and other assets to its largest investor, a private equity firm. In court papers, lawyers for residents and other creditors say the complex plan will prevent them from pursuing Genesis’ new ownership and other companies they blame for the company’s collapse.
John Anthony, a bankruptcy attorney representing 340 personal injury claims against Genesis, said, “They never had any intention to honor these deals.”

Low ratings and fines

During years of financial turmoil, Genesis has frequently struggled to provide top-notch care, federal records show. Using its five-star system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated 58% of homes affiliated with Genesis as below average or much below average. CMS has fined Genesis homes $10 million for violating federal health standards over the past three years.
In 2022, Connecticut health regulators shuttered a Genesis home after two deaths and multiple violations. The company closed another Connecticut nursing home this year after residents twice were evacuated over safety concerns.
In its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis said it cared for about 15,000 residents in 165 nursing homes and 10 assisted living facilities in 18 states. They are centered in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Alabama, Maryland, and North Carolina, according to the bankruptcy filing.

The company said it owed $709 million in secured debt to lenders and the IRS. Under bankruptcy rules, those debts, backed by Genesis collateral, take precedence over the $1.6 billion in unsecured debt Genesis said it owes. Unsecured creditors include a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia for unpaid provider taxes; and former residents and their families who sued.

Dangers in memory care

Sandia Ridge Center, a Genesis home in Albuquerque, was repeatedly faulted by health regulators for not preventing sexual misbehavior in its memory care unit. In November 2021, CMS cited the home for lacking enough nurses to prevent sexual abuse among residents. An inspection report the following August identified more inappropriate sexual contact. Police were called to investigate sexual assault allegations in February and March of 2023, police reports show; neither resulted in criminal charges.
Then in April 2023, a 61-year-old male resident with alcohol-related dementia sexually assaulted a female resident with Alzheimer’s in the dining room, according to a police report and an inspection report. When the resident screamed for him to stop and that he was hurting her, he responded “shut up bitch I know you like this,” according to a lawsuit brought on behalf of the woman, identified in court papers as R.S.
Sandia Ridge management had been aware of the male resident’s behavioral issues for months, according to employee depositions in the case. Police had investigated a prior sexual assault allegation against him the previous year without bringing charges. In one deposition, a former activities assistant testified he hit her and twice pushed her into a bathroom while announcing, “I want to have sex with you.” When she reported him to a senior Genesis manager, she said in the deposition, the manager put his finger over his lips and said, “Shhh.”
The activities worker testified that R.S. used to happily sing along with Elvis Presley songs. After the assault, the worker said, R.S. “don’t sing anymore.”
Inspectors cited the home for failing to protect R.S. The same report said the home didn’t provide a therapist for another female resident who was being sexually harassed. Medicare fined Sandia Ridge Center $91,247. Genesis denied liability but settled R.S.’ lawsuit for $925,000 in May, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“We just felt we have to hold them accountable,” R.S.’ daughter said in an interview, speaking on the condition that she and her mother not be identified, because of the nature of the assault. “Maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m naive, but the only way to do that is to sue someone, right?”
Genesis has not paid any of the settlement, according to the family’s claim filing.

Growth and debt

Genesis’ downfall can be traced to 2007, when affiliates of two private equity firms acquired the company in a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout, taking on substantial debt, according to its bankruptcy filing. Private equity also has been involved in other health care bankruptcies, including those of the HCR ManorCare nursing home chain, the prison health care contractor Corizon Health, and two for-profit hospital systems, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings.
In 2011, Genesis raised $2.4 billion by transferring substantially all its nursing home buildings and other real estate to Welltower, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, according to Genesis’ bankruptcy filing. Genesis then rented the buildings back from Welltower, which made leasing costs a significant expense.
Genesis went on a nationwide buying spree. At its peak in 2016, it had grown to more than 500 nursing homes. In a court declaration, Louis Robichaux IV, a consultant overseeing Genesis’ bankruptcy restructuring, wrote that as the company expanded, it became harder to manage and “mired in corporate inefficiencies.” Robichaux wrote that Genesis’ financial woes were exacerbated by rapidly increasing labor costs and lawsuits, including some predating the covid pandemic.
Starting in 2021, Genesis avoided bankruptcy after receiving $100 million in loans from a private equity firm founded by Joel Landau, the owner of a Brooklyn-based nursing home chain, according to Robichaux’s filing.
But Genesis continued to teeter on the edge of insolvency. In audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 submitted to a California oversight agency, management and auditors said rent and debt obligations raised “substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
In a court filing, a committee appointed by the U.S. Trustee’s Office to represent the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy accused Landau and Welltower of orchestrating a covert plan that allowed Welltower to keep getting its rents while Landau could run the company and “siphon value to himself.” The committee alleged their efforts forced the company into insolvency while “staffing levels and patient care declined precipitously.” Landau and Welltower did not respond to requests for comment.

Drawn-out lawsuits

Erin Pearson sued Genesis over the death of her father, James Sanderson, a retired mining company executive who died in 2018 after spending less than a month at Bear Canyon Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. In the memory care unit, Sanderson fell repeatedly, suffered medication errors made by nursing home staff, and developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis, according to the lawsuit, filed in 2019. Pearson’s lawyers said he was not hospitalized until eight days after nurses noticed he was vomiting brown mucus.

After the judge rejected Genesis’ request to force Pearson into arbitration, Genesis appealed. It took 2½ years before an appeals court affirmed the original decision to let the case go forward in court, records show.
This past May, more than five years after suing, Pearson reached a $500,000 settlement, with the first payment required by November, according to a copy of the agreement. Nothing was paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“It was so drawn out and for so long,” Pearson said in an interview, calling Genesis’ bankruptcy “despicable.”

Payouts postponed

Jennifer Foote, an Albuquerque attorney who represents clients in multiple lawsuits against Genesis, including Pearson’s, said the company frequently filed appeals. “They did not usually win them on these issues,” she said, “and our sense was that they were doing it as a delay tactic.”
Genesis started using installment payments around 2018, said Dusti Harvey, Foote’s law partner. “The payments wouldn’t start for several months out,” Harvey said. Foote said Genesis’ lawyers often wanted to time the payments to start the month the trial in the case was scheduled to occur.

Families had to wait even when comparatively small amounts of money were involved, settlement agreements show. Genesis’ settlement agreements also included a confidentiality clause prohibiting discussion of the incidents.
Genesis agreed to pay $42,000 in a November 2024 settlement, but the first payment was not due until nine months later. It was not paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
A $250,000 settlement signed in October 2023 did not start paying out until the following September. When Genesis declared bankruptcy — 21 months after the case was resolved — it still owed $100,000, according to the family’s claim.

‘We never found out the truth’

Settling cases allowed Genesis to avoid the expense and publicity of a trial, at which details of how its nursing homes functioned might have been revealed. In October 2020, Margarett Johnson, a retired school bus driver, fell out of her wheelchair at a Genesis nursing home in Waldorf, Maryland, fracturing her jawbone, nose, and neck, according to a lawsuit brought by her family. Johnson was sent to a trauma center and placed on a ventilator. She died three months later, at age 76, from ventilator-associated pneumonia, the lawsuit said.
“It looked like she was hit by a truck,” Angelina Harley, one of her daughters, said in an interview. “I knew my mom was not going to come home. I knew the Lord was not going to punish her more.”
Genesis HealthCare still owes $112,500 from a $950,000 settlement over the death of Margarett Johnson after an accident in a Maryland nursing home, according to a bankruptcy claim. She is seen here with her brother William Tolson. (Angela Swann)
The company denied negligence and blamed the accident on Johnson’s jacket getting tangled in the wheel of her wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Harley and her sister Angela Swann were dubious.
“We never found out the truth,” Harley said. “They wanted to settle out of court.”
The company denied liability but agreed to a $950,000 settlement in October 2024. It never paid the final $112,500 installment, according to a letter Johnson’s five children sent to the bankruptcy judge.
“If you settle out of court, you know doggone well you did something wrong,” Harley said.

Maddening judges

By summer 2025, judges in some civil cases had run out of patience.
Alma Brown, a retired day care manager and accordion teacher living in a Genesis nursing home in Clovis, New Mexico, suffered falls, infections, bedsores, and other neglect that hastened her death in 2023, according to her estate’s lawsuit. In Santa Fe District Court, Judge Kathleen McGarry Ellenwood castigated Genesis after it failed to pay $2 million of the $3 million settlement to Brown’s estate or explain the delay.
Genesis “obviously benefited by not having to go to trial,” McGarry Ellenwood said in one hearing, according to a court transcript. “They assure me that they’re not trying to renege on their contract, but it certainly seems like they haven’t lived up to what the bargain was.”
Genesis declared bankruptcy the day McGarry Ellenwood announced she would impose more than $100,000 in fines, plus $10,000 more each day until the settlement was paid.
In Pennsylvania, Greg Hunt petitioned a judge to punish Genesis after it stopped payments of the $3.5 million settlement after the death of his mother, Nancy, the resident with the gangrenous foot. She had spent eight months in 2019 at Brandywine Hall, a Genesis facility in West Chester that was later sold and renamed.
In a filing with the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Genesis admitted it was in arrears but asked the judge for more time, citing “unforeseen and exigent financial challenges.” Genesis said care for patients at its nursing homes would suffer if it had to pay immediately.
Unswayed, Judge Richard Haaz in June ordered Genesis to pay up, along with punitive interest. But the bankruptcy court stayed that order. Genesis still owes $1.4 million of the $2 million it was supposed to pay, according to Hunt’s claim. (The rest of the $3.5 million settlement is supposed to be paid by an insurer in January 2026.) Ian Norris, Hunt’s lawyer, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement.
Court records indicate Genesis lawyers never disclosed in either case that it was preparing to declare bankruptcy.

‘Bankruptcy as a tool’

In the first nine months of 2025, 10 other senior living companies with liabilities over $10 million entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Gibbins Advisors, a consulting firm.
Hamid Rafatjoo, a bankruptcy lawyer representing nursing homes who is not involved in the Genesis bankruptcy case, said filings may increase as the industry has become costlier to run and class action lawsuits have become a fixture.
“Nursing homes get sued all the time for everything,” Rafatjoo said. “A lot of operators wait too long to use bankruptcy as a tool.”
On Dec. 1, Genesis announced the results of its auction, saying it had elected to sell its assets to a private equity firm controlled by Landau. In a court filing, Anthony, the attorney for the personal injury claimants, alleged the auction was stacked in Landau’s favor despite an “objectively better and higher competing bid” from another private equity investor that would have provided more money to creditors. Genesis said in its statement that Landau’s group had increased its bid during the auction.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other senators last month asked the U.S. Trustee’s Office to intervene in the case, out of concern that “individuals who already own or control Genesis are trying to sell it to themselves, wiping away legal and other creditor debts in the process.” Lawyers representing those in charge of the auction did not respond to a request for comment.
Families of former Genesis residents said they fear the capacity to purge lawsuits through bankruptcy emboldens nursing home owners who provide deficient care.
“They can file bankruptcy again,” said Gabe Betancourt, whose wife, Nellie, died after her stay at Uptown Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. “And we’re the ones that will pay for it, with our memories, our lives.”
“It’s almost two years now,” Gabe Betancourt says of the death of his wife, Nellie. “When you sleep with somebody for 67 years and you stretch your arm, she’s there. There’s no way I will ever forget her.” (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Refugee resettlement fell sharply in South Dakota during the last federal fiscal year, and no refugees have arrived in the state during the past 11 months, according to the agency that manages the program.
A new report from Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota says 149 refugees resettled in the state during the 2025 fiscal year that ended in September, down from 391 in 2024. Nationally, refugee arrivals fell from 100,034 to 38,102.


Lutheran Social Services has overseen refugee resettlement in the state for the past 25 years and works alongside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Department of State. Rebecca Kiesow-Knudsen is the group’s president and CEO.
“We work with those federal partners to provide assistance to arrivals,” she said. “From the day the door to the plane opens, we are trying to work with that individual or that family to make sure that they are successful in their new community.”
Lutheran Social Services helps refugees find employment, housing and education. It also provides cultural education programming, English language training and legal services.
Refugees are people who flee their country to escape war, natural disaster, or persecution.
“Those refugee populations, if you look over the course of history, are always based on where the conflicts are in the international community,” Kiesow-Knudsen said. “It always shifts based on global conflict.”
The president decides how many refugees the nation accepts. President Joe Biden established the admissions cap for fiscal year 2025 at 125,000 refugees.
President Donald Trump set the lowest admissions cap in U.S. history for the current fiscal year at 7,500, and said those admission will be allocated primarily to white South Africans of European descent, who are known as Afrikaners.
That’s why Kiesow-Knudsen doesn’t expect to see many new refugee arrivals to the state any time soon.
“If there’s a case that is approved that has a connection to South Dakota, we might see an arrival,” she said.


Many of the new arrivals to South Dakota between October 2024 and September 2025 are Somalian or Congolese. Millions of people from countries in central and east Africa have been displaced due to conflict, violence and environmental disasters.
Those displacement factors are just one part of how different populations come to resettle in South Dakota. The resettlement program has historically been a family reunification effort. The first piece of information the federal government looks for is family ties, according to Kiesow-Knudsen.
“They’re always looking for ways that they can help people be the most successful in integrating into the country,” she said. “What we know is that people are more successful if they’re close in proximity to your family members.”

Americans woke up on Jan. 3, 2025, to blaring headlines: “US CAPTURES MADURO, TRUMP SAYS,” declared The New York Times, using all capital letters. The U.S. had mounted an overnight military raid in Venezuela that immediately raised questions of procedure and legality. Prime among them was what role Congress had – or should have had – in the operation.
Politics editor Naomi Schalit interviewed political scientist Sarah Burns, author of the book “The Politics of War Powers” and an expert at Rochester Institute of Technology on the historical struggle between Congress and U.S. presidents over who has the power to authorize military action.
Is this a war?
I wouldn’t call it a war. This is regime change, and whether or not it has a positive impact on the United States, whether or not it has a positive impact on Venezuela, I think the likelihood is very low for both of those things being true.
How does Congress see its role in terms of military action initiated by the United States?
Congress has been, in my view, incredibly supine. But that’s not just my word. Having said that, it is true that Congress – in the House, predominantly – tried to pass a war powers act recently, saying that President Donald Trump was not allowed to do any action against Venezuela, and that failed on very close votes.

So you see some effort on the part of Congress to assert itself in the realm of war. But it failed predominantly on party lines, with Democrats saying we really don’t want to go into Venezuela. We really don’t want to have this action. Republicans predominantly were supporting the president and whatever it happens to be that he would like to do. Moderate Republicans and Republicans who are in less safe districts were and are more likely to at least stand up a little bit to the president, but there’s a very small number of them.
So there may be an institutional role for Congress, a constitutional role, a role that has been confirmed by legal opinion, but politics takes over in Congress when it comes to asserting its power in this realm?
That’s a perfect way of putting it. They have a legal, constitutional, one might even say moral, responsibility to assert themselves as a branch, right? This is from Federalist 51 where James Madison says “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.” So it should be that as a branch, they assert themselves against the president and say, “We have a role here.”
In the 1940s, presidential scholar Edward Corwin said that in the realm of foreign policy, it is an invitation for Congress and the president to struggle. So it should be that Congress and the president are struggling against each other to assert, “I’m in charge.” “No, I’m in charge.” “No, I’m in charge,” in an effort to create a balance between the two branches and between the two things that each of the branches does well. What you want from Congress is slow deliberation and a variety of opinions. What you want from the president is energy and dispatch.
So certainly, if we have an attack like 9/11, you would want the president to be able to act quickly. And you know, conversely, in situations like the questions around what the U.S. is doing in Venezuela, you want slow deliberation because there is no emergency that requires energy and dispatch and speed. So the president shouldn’t be entirely in the driver’s seat here, and Congress should very much be trying very hard to restrain him.
What power does Congress have to restrain him?
They have to pass legislation. They aren’t particularly well suited right now to passing legislation, so effectively there is not a very clear way for them to restrain the president.
One of the things that members of Congress have attempted to do several times, with very little positive impact, is go to the courts and say, “Can you restrain the president?” And political scientist Jasmine Farrier has written that the courts have regularly said to members of Congress: “You have the power to stop the president, and you are ineffective at that. And so if you want to stop the president, you shouldn’t turn to us. You should work together to create legislation that would restrain the president.”
What would such legislation do? Cut off money for troops? Is it finger-wagging, or is it something really concrete?
There are a few different tiers. Joint resolutions are finger-wagging. They just say, “Bad, Mr. President, don’t do that.” But they have no effect in law.
The War Powers Resolution, first passed in 1973, is a legitimate way of trying to restrain the president. Congress intended to say to presidents, “You cannot start a war and continue a war without our authorization.” But what they said instead was “You could have a small war or a short war – of 60 to 90 days – without our authorization, and then you have to tell us about it.” That just sort of said to presidents the opposite of what they intended. So President Barack Obama took advantage of that with the military engagement in Libya, as well as Trump in his first administration.
This is not a partisan issue. It’s not Republican presidents who do it. It’s not Democratic presidents who do it. It’s every president since the War Powers Resolution was passed, and the only time that Congress has drawn down troops or drawn down money was the Vietnam War.
Other than that disastrous war, we have not seen Congress willing to put themselves on the politically negative side, which is taking money away from the troops. Because if you take away money right now, they’re going to be harmed.
What is the War Powers Resolution?
The War Powers Resolution from 1973, also known as the War Powers Act, was Congress – during the Vietnam War – saying definitively to President Richard Nixon, “You have overstepped your bounds.” They had explicitly said in law, you cannot go into Cambodia. And Nixon went into Cambodia.
So that was their way of trying to reassert themselves very aggressively; as I mentioned before, it didn’t work effectively. It worked insofar as presidents don’t unilaterally start wars that are large scale, the way that World War II was large scale. But they do have these smaller actions at varying levels.
Then we get to 9/11 and we see the 2001 authorization for the use of military force, and the 2002 authorization for the use of military force. The 2001 law authorized going after anyone in al-Qaida and associated with 9/11. The 2002 authorization was directly related to Iraq, saying “There is a problem with Iraq, we have to do something.” Both of them were extremely vague and broad, and that’s why we’ve seen four presidents, including Trump, using the 2001 and 2002 authorizations to carry out all sorts of operations that had very little to do with Saddam Hussein or al-Qaida.
In 2021, senators Mike Lee, Bernie Sanders and Chris Murphy collectively got together and tried to create a national security document that would restrain presidential unilateralism. It was a good effort on the part of members of Congress from a variety of different ideological views to attempt to restrain the president. It did not even sort-of pass – it barely got out on the floor.
Since that time, we haven’t seen a lot of efforts from members of Congress. They haven’t really reasserted themselves since the war in Korea, which began in 1950. It’s very clear that ambition is no longer checking ambition the way that it was meant to by the founders.
When you woke up this morning and saw the news, what was your first thought?
Here we go again. This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. Lots of presidents have made this error, which is that they think if you do this smaller-scale action, you are going to get a positive result for the nation, for the region, for international stability. And very rarely is that the case.

Delbert Hosemann, halfway through what may be their final terms, are not lame ducks yet, but they might need to prove their relevance.","Gov. Tate Reeves and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann may not be lame ducks, but perhaps they could be described as limping ducks going into the 2026 legislative session that begins Tuesday.
Reeves and Hosemann, two of Mississippi’s most prominent politicians, could be nearing the end of long political careers where they have exercised significant influence. Reeves is in his sixth four-year term in statewide office, while Hosemann is in his fifth.
The 2026 session starts the second half of what could be their final four-year term.
Hosemann, 78, presides over the Senate and generally wields substantial power in the Capitol. He has in the past said he is considering a campaign for governor in 2027. But it is hard to believe he will enter the race if billionaire businessman Tommy Duff runs, as he is signaling he will do.
Term limits will prohibit Reeves from running again for governor, though he is only 51.
Lame duck refers to a politician who loses some clout because his term in office is ending. Generally speaking, the closer that prominent politicians, such as governor or lieutenant governor, get to the end of a final term, the less clout they enjoy, especially in the legislative process where power is often the key to getting things done.
Granted, Reeves and Hosemann, who have both been mainstays in Mississippi politics for going on a generation, might not be lame ducks yet, but a slight limp might be detectable. They might need to prove their relevance.
House Speaker Jason White, the third person in the triumvirate that sets the legislative agenda, most likely does not face similar issues.
White is in his first term as speaker, and, regardless, the office of speaker of the Mississippi House is not term-limited.
The fact that White does not face a lame duck situation puts him in a stronger position on what most likely will be the primary issues of the 2026 session, such as whether to expand the opportunities to provide public funds to private schools.
White is a staunch supporter of providing public funds to private schools, as is Reeves for that matter.
Hosemann has been less enthusiastic, but at times he has appeared to try to compromise on key issues instead of taking strong positions in opposition to White and the governor.
The demand by White and Reeves to phase out the income tax is an example where Hosemann was not as enamored with the proposal. Still, it could be argued that during the 2025 session the lieutenant governor essentially capitulated to the wishes of the speaker and of the governor to phase out the income tax.
Many believe Hosemann has been willing to compromise to ensure on some issues, like tax cuts, he would not be harmed in a Republican primary should he run for governor. In general terms, it is believed there are more voters in the Republican primary who favor cutting taxes and providing public funds to private schools.
But perhaps the data is not certain on the issue of school choice. When vouchers have been on the ballot in other states, even conservative states, they have been rejected. At the same time in the 2024 election where Kentucky voters were awarding pro-voucher Donald Trump a higher percentage of the vote than he received in Mississippi, they rejected a voucher proposal.
So, maybe being against providing public funds to private schools would not hurt Hosemann in a Republican primary.
And if Hosemann is ending his political career, he could have nothing to lose by using his influence to block the school choice proposals in the Senate.
Of course, the key then would be for Hosemann to withstand the woes of being a lame duck or at least a limping duck and prove that he still walks strong.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/01134620/3X0A6396.jpg,,,2026-01-04 07:11:40.487766

“We're coming back to the basic hierarchy of needs here,” said Rep. Theresa Wood, who chairs the House Committee on Human Services.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Facing federal funding cuts and potentially faltering tax revenues ahead of this week’s legislative session, Vermont lawmakers say decisions over food and heating assistance programs serving their most vulnerable constituents will be particularly difficult.
“We’re coming back to the basic hierarchy of needs here,” said Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, who chairs the House Committee on Human Services.
Food aid is among her highest priorities, Wood said. But both 3SquaresVT, Vermont’s version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the state’s charitable food system have been significantly impacted by federal cuts in recent months.
In 2025, 3SquaresVT incorporated a host of tightened restrictions following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July. Work requirements have been expanded, a number of categories of noncitizens have been excluded from the program, and new financial burdens have been placed on individual states. 
Vermont will be responsible for more than $8 million in new administrative costs, with millions more in possible penalties under a new accuracy enforcement system. Should the administration make errors according to the program’s rules just 1% more frequently than it did last year, the state could be required to contribute over $7 million to the cost of benefits next year.
Meanwhile, support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has dried up for local food providers, causing layoffs and reductions in service across the state.
“The federal government’s lack of human compassion is just beyond belief,” said Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, of the fallout from July’s federal funding law.
Lyons, who chairs the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare, agreed that nutrition assistance is an essential issue going into the session.
“We need to provide food — we need to ensure that SNAP continues,” she said.
The Vermont Foodbank has requested an allocation of $5 million from the Legislature to fund its farm-focused Vermonters Feeding Vermonters program and generally support its network of services.
“What we are seeing is this continued need for support beyond what philanthropy is able to do,” said Carrie Stahler, the Foodbank’s government and public affairs officer.
Stahler said 3SquaresVT has never been available to everyone in the state who needs help with food. But after thousands more Vermonters lost access to the program this fall or became subject to new requirements in order to be eligible, the nutrition assistance system is more important than ever.
Wood said she expects the Vermont Department for Children and Families, which administers 3SquaresVT, to include the program’s new state-level costs in its budget later this month. While she supports full funding for 3SquaresVT, the Foodbank’s request is one of a number of similar pleas to her committee.
“They’re not all going to be able to be met,” she said, adding that her committee is “going to be careful in doing our due diligence.”
Lyons expressed a desire to redirect or generate more funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, or LIHEAP, which President Donald Trump’s administration has indicated it wants to eliminate. The state’s Public Utility Commission recommended that the Legislature increase funding for heating assistance in an energy cost study last month to shore up the state’s crisis fuel service, and to prepare for potential federal cuts to the program.
The commission suggested raising the existing fuel tax slightly to partially cover the measure, which Lyons said she supports. But Wood urged caution on increasing funds for programs like LIHEAP, saying that this year, there likely won’t be room in the budget.
“We have many things to balance,” she said. “We have to be strategic.”
Housing, a major priority for Wood’s committee, continues to demand attention and funding. In addition to ongoing disagreement over the state’s motel program, Vermont’s housing authorities requested $18 million this fall to fund the state’s Section 8 voucher program after federal cuts left a number of organizations across the state facing shortfalls.
And health care, particularly in a moment where Vermonters face skyrocketing premiums and an increasing state cost burden, will be near the top of Wood’s agenda too.
Sen. Andrew Perchlik, D/P-Washington, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that last year’s buffer against federal cuts would potentially be a difficult model to replicate this year. One-time allocations in general, he said, could be in short supply, including to individual organizations like the Vermont Foodbank. 
Tax revenue slumps in recent months are a concern for lawmakers, Perchlik said. Though nothing is set in stone, he continued, it seems unlikely that the Legislature will have the same scale of tax surplus to use at its discretion, particularly in light of Gov. Phil Scott’s desire to buy down property taxes.
“It’s not clear we’ll have any of that money,” Perchlik said. “It’s definitely going to be more difficult.”

Amelia Cunningham is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s journalism internship for Bradford Journal Opinion.
CORINTH — At the end of a long, wood-lined road in Corinth, Kathy Chapman’s studio stands nestled among the trees. The modest workspace — with panoramic views of the surrounding forest — serves as a quiet refuge from the outside world for the stained-glass artist.
Inside, a wood-fired stove keeps the workshop at a comfortable temperature even with snow outside. The studio’s walls are filled with art of different mediums, including a large array of stained glass projects. 
Chapman is a stained-glass artist and painter, originally from Brooklyn, New York. She grew up spending her summers at Lake Morey and then relocated to Vermont in 1984, after graduating from college. 
Chapman has always considered herself an artist, but she began working in stained glass restoration about 30 years ago. Along with restorations, she also makes acrylic paintings and custom stained-glass windows, available by commission. 
For Chapman, starting a new painting is the best part of the creative process. She described the feeling as “pure excitement.” 
“Something always happens,” she said. “Even if it’s terrible, you turn it around, put it upside down, and keep going until something speaks to you.”
Chapman prioritizes creativity over perfection, embracing a process that often leaves her paintings feeling deliberately “in progress.” This culminates in a corner of her studio she affectionately calls “painting heaven,” where unfinished paintings are lovingly stacked. 
“Sometimes you just get tired of something and want to move on,” she said. “Later, when I’m in a different headspace, I’ll pull one out, turn it around, and start again.” 
While painting gives Chapman a sense of creative freedom, stained glass forces her to slow down and really think about each piece. 
“Stained glass is a real process art,” she said. “You’ve got to make a map, you want to make sure everything is the best it can be before you assemble it.”

This contrast is evident in Chapman’s studio. 
On her worktable, pieces of a soon-to-be church window sit carefully arranged. For restorations, there is no space for “figuring it out.” Once a piece is cut and fired, it cannot be changed. 
Chapman didn’t originally set out to be a stained glass artist. About 30 years ago, a friend and local stained glass artist, Greg Gorman, needed help removing a large rose window from the upper level of a church for restoration. Chapman offered to help.
“It was a total restoration,” she said. “We took it apart piece by piece, and I just loved it.” 
At the time, there were very few people in the region doing large-scale stained glass restorations, a gap that fostered a strong working relationship between Gorman and Chapman. 
For about a decade, Chapman worked out of Gorman’s studio in Lyme, practicing and perfecting her craft. Gorman saw something special in her work. 
“I’m a big fan of hers,” he said. “Her stained glass and painting definitely feed each other. You can always tell it’s the same person.” 
In 2002, Chapman started working out of her own private studio, which greatly influenced her work. The solitude of her studio reshaped her creative process, allowing her to fully immerse herself in her art.
Chapman has lived happily in Vermont since her early 20s. The quiet, nature, and tranquility have all become essential parts of her practice. 
“I live a quiet life,” she says. “It’s easy to be alone out here. I have friends who rescue me from myself when I need it, but mostly I’m very happy being home.” 
Her quiet routines allow her the room to create art as she wishes. Her lifestyle and way of living are an intrinsic part of the art she creates. 
Although Chapman works in isolation, her restorations live in places that are the exact opposite. Chapman’s “bread and butter,” as she puts it, is doing restoration projects for local churches and common spaces, places that are key meeting points for the community. Churches in the area reach out to Chapman when their centuries-old windows need to be cleaned, repainted, and rebuilt. 
These projects are often long and slow. Chapman just finished her fourth year working on a project for the Waterbury United Church of Christ. By next spring, she will have completed the fifth and final window for the church, marking five years spent on the project. 
“For me, that feels like an accomplishment,” she said, “because then [the windows] are good for another hundred years.” 
Chapman’s quiet, solitary life is essential to her craft, but her friendships, she says, are just as important to her practice. 
Amy Peberdy, a fellow artist and longtime friend of Chapman, occasionally helps out in her studio. 
“There’s a real humanity in [Chapman’s art],” Peberdy said. “Mostly what her artwork is saying to the world is to just relax and try to get along.” 
This throughline isn’t always literal, but its tone is consistent through the quirky, slightly medieval, heavily painted art she creates. Chapman’s art is a reflection of the life she lives. A life filled with quiet beauty and art. 
“There’s a story in all of it,” said Chapman. “Even if people don’t see it, it’s there.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The fate of one lawmaker’s service in the Nebraska Legislature will likely be decided by yet-to-be-released evidence legislative leaders have said demonstrates a “pattern of behavior” warranting his expulsion.
The Legislature’s Executive Board, essentially its human resources department, unanimously recommended Dec. 13 that freshman State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst be expelled “in light of a demonstrated pattern of behavior … and not in response to a single isolated incident.” 
Discussion and a vote are expected early in the 2026 session, which begins Wednesday. The committee has not yet detailed the alleged “pattern.” McKeon, who denies wrongdoing, has made clear he has no intention of resigning.
A legislative staffer has accused McKeon of making “inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” according to a Nebraska State Patrol report that a spokesman relayed.

The Nebraska Examiner reached out to McKeon’s 48 legislative colleagues in December. Of them, 11 said they supported or leaned in favor of expelling McKeon. Another 14 said they were undecided, most because they wanted to see what evidence the Exec Board had access to first.
Seven senators declined to comment, and 11 more did not return calls or messages seeking comment. 
Part of the struggle, some senators said, is the novelty of an expulsion vote, a rare legislative process that left many lawmakers saying they need to understand how it works and the possible ramifications.










You’re not a statesman. That’s a boor. That’s a 13 year old in a locker room, and he can’t seem to get it through his head that you can’t behave like that.


– State Sen. Kathleen Kauth


Expulsion requires at least 33 votes under the Nebraska Constitution. If successful, it would be the first in state history. In that case, Nebraska would hold a special election in November for the final two years of McKeon’s term. 
McKeon represents central Nebraska’s Legislative District 41 — Boone, Buffalo, Greeley, Hall, Howard, Sherman, Valley and Wheeler Counties. 
McKeon has said he thinks he has the legislative votes to stay, “but time will tell.” He was elected in 2024 with 52% of the vote.
Workplace behavior
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha said she called McKeon the night the news of his criminal citation came in late October. She said she wanted to hear his side of what happened at an end-of-session party last May. She said McKeon’s story changed “within just a couple of minutes,” remarks Kauth described as a “lot of projecting, a lot of ‘I’m being a victim.’”
“Then I flat out asked him: Did you touch her?” Kauth recalled. “He said, ‘No.’ Five seconds later, he said, ‘Well, maybe I touched her shoulder.’ Five more seconds, he said, ‘Well, maybe I touched her back.’”
Immediately after, Kauth said, she told McKeon: “Dan, you need to resign.” 
Kauth is chair of the Legislature’s Business and Labor Committee, which oversees state labor laws, a committee on which McKeon sits.

State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, addressing McKeon’s situation broadly, said he’s seen “consistent and persistent behavior” in the Legislature and a workplace generally that is “incredibly problematic.” 
He said normalization of “abhorrent” sexual harassment and inappropriate jokes, including in the halls of the Nebraska State Capitol, is “gross and frustrating,” adding, “We all need to do better.”
“We as senators all need to do better to hold each other accountable, to hold folks accountable, when we hear those jokes, hear those things, because they’re not funny, and they are inappropriate,” Dungan said at a pre-session Lincoln-area event.
‘A statesman’
McKeon’s attorney, Perry Pirsch, has said the senator’s actions were not sexually charged and noted McKeon has apologized and taken ownership of what they called a “joke.” Pirsch and McKeon, a former wrestling coach, have described the touch as a “pat on the back,” which McKeon said was “like a coach would do.”
The lawmaker from Amherst said he got his “marching orders” from the Executive Board and did everything they required him to do, including moving his office and attending sensitivity training.
McKeon rolls out character defenders amid groping allegation, calls to resign

The legislative staffer’s attorney, Kathleen Neary, has noted that her client is preparing a civil lawsuit against the Amherst lawmaker. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, and multiple state senators have said McKeon should resign. 
McKeon initially tried to plead “no contest” to a misdemeanor disturbing the peace charge in Lancaster County, a plea to accept the punishment but not admit guilt. But shortly after the Exec Board recommended expulsion, he filed to plead not guilty and decided to fight.
McKeon “categorically rejects” the committee’s claim and last week described the push for his removal as a “political game.”
“I think we need a breath of fresh air in Lincoln … that’s what I was trying to bring to the table,” McKeon said Dec. 30 at a small news conference in Cairo, Nebraska. “Somebody that’s a statesman is in there, and they don’t like it.” 
‘Bare minimum standards’
State Sens. Carolyn Bosn and Jason Prokop, both of Lincoln, said at the same mid-December event as Dungan that it’s a privilege to serve in the Legislature and that lawmakers have duties and standards to uphold. 
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. Dec. 18, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
They said those responsibilities include respecting staff and the institution.
“When those bare minimum standards cannot be followed, I think it sets a precedent. I think it’s disrespectful to each other, to the institution, and I think that creates a real problem,” Bosn said.
Said Prokop: “The Nebraska Legislature is just an amazing representation of the people of Nebraska, and we have to do all we can to make sure that we are maintaining that strong reputation. I’m also supportive of removing those that don’t live up to that expectation.”
‘Altar of political expediency and correctness’
Pirsch, McKeon’s attorney, said in a Friday statement that any legislator who would vote to expel a colleague based on a “disputed factual narrative” and a charge of “only” disturbing the peace is “setting a dangerous precedent.”
“If a contested disturbing the peace [charge] is the new standard of conduct for legislators, all our representatives are at risk for wrongful expulsion,” Pirsch said.










I think we need a breath of fresh air in Lincoln … that’s what I was trying to bring to the table. Somebody that’s a statesman is in there, and they don’t like it.


– State Sen. Dan McKeon


NU Regent O’Connor resigning, effective Jan. 9, in wake of DUI allegation, possible impeachment

Pirsch said he can appreciate the Exec Board’s “desire” to advance the incident “for political purposes” but that McKeon’s district shouldn’t lose voice because of “a bad pun and a pat on the back.”
Pillen would appoint a successor for McKeon’s district through the end of the year if he resigns or is removed from office.
“I am confident there are enough senators of sufficient intellect not to sacrifice the legitimacy of the body on the altar of political expediency and correctness,” Pirsch said. “Senator McKeon looks forward to putting the distraction behind him and moving forward with the legitimate business of the State of Nebraska and the constituents of LD 41.”
‘You can’t behave like that’
Kauth and others say the allegation from a staffer is only part and not all of what concerns them. State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, for instance, said that had McKeon faced just a “he said, she said” allegation, he’d be more inclined to support a letter of reprimand or censure, short of expulsion. 
State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln. Jan. 28, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
But Holdcroft said his understanding is that more has happened, so he’s leaning in favor based on what he’s heard, but he hasn’t seen full details, so he said it’s “tough” to comment.
Kauth was the first to publicly describe a pattern of “inappropriate” comments by McKeon, including comments she said were “sexually laced,” “double entendres” or “totally off base.” She said she’s interrupted some of his comments in the past, including one she said McKeon made in Israel last fall in front of lawmakers from around the country.
There’s a line, Kauth said of the moment in Israel, yet McKeon “just leaped right over it.” She said some “jokes” might be funny in a locker room, “but we’re not in a locker room.”
Kauth said she could not recall the exact incident in Israel, saying his remarks occur “so frequently” it’s hard to remember each.
“His response is always, ‘I’m just joking,’” Kauth said. “You’re not a statesman. That’s a boor. That’s a 13 year old in a locker room, and he can’t seem to get it through his head that you can’t behave like that. Then you behave like that to a subordinate, to a staffer who is in the building, that is wholly inappropriate.”

McKeon, in a Dec. 17 statement, said he would try to watch future comments, “but I might still occasionally have a bad joke slip out, and those who are eggshells should avoid me, not engage me in conversation.”

Lawmakers could have faced a second historic vote in 2026: the possible impeachment and ouster of University of Nebraska Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha, a Democrat, who faces a felony charge for allegedly driving drunk in May 2025 and seriously injuring another. 
She announced her resignation after the Examiner had started asking lawmakers their thoughts on McKeon and O’Connor.
Kauth has said she was ready to begin impeachment proceedings, but O’Connor’s last day is Friday. Pillen will appoint O’Connor’s successor, and a special election will be held this year.
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil noted that McKeon faces a misdemeanor charge not “even remotely as serious” as the felony charge O’Connor faces. The Nebraska Constitution bars convicted felons from holding public office.
Murman said he would oppose expulsion if it were based on just the misdemeanor allegation. So, Murman said he needs to understand what evidence supports an alleged “pattern of behavior.”
Fear for the ‘political minority’
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, who declined to speak with the Examiner regarding O’Connor or McKeon, said at the Lincoln-area pre-session event that it would be “reckless” to prejudge a situation without a public hearing or a fuller understanding.
State Sens. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and Ben Hansen of Blair. April 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Now entering her 12th year as a lawmaker, Conrad said she fears legislative processes, including impeachment or expulsion, could be “weaponized” against a political minority. 
She said she doesn’t trust the “good judgment” of a majority of lawmakers.
“I think it’s incumbent upon all of us, if we believe in fair play, that we do extend a presumption of innocence and due process, even to the accused in very unsavory and untenable situations,” Conrad said Dec. 18. “Because otherwise, a political mob can run roughshod over the will of the voters and be weaponized against a political minority.”
McKeon has said expelling him would hurt the “will of the voters” who elected him.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said she wants the process to play out but “certainly would welcome him [McKeon] resigning.” 
She said the conversation distracts from other issues, including executive branch proposals and additional budget cuts that she said could hurt Nebraskans with developmental or intellectual disabilities.
“There’s a lot of bad people doing bad things to people,” Cavanaugh said at the time.

State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, a progressive who is the Legislature’s lone registered nonpartisan, offered a different take on what should happen in 2026.
Said Hunt: “I agree that we should go into the new year with a clean slate, and the best thing for the future of Nebraskans and for integrity of our institutions would be for everyone in the Legislature to resign, and the board of regents and the governor and the attorney general.”
Exec Board’s recommendation
Lawmakers said they expect the Executive Board’s details to come to light in the coming weeks as McKeon plans to fight. Many suggested it will get worse for McKeon if he doesn’t resign. McKeon, a former sports official, has suggested the opposite and said his colleagues don’t have all the facts.
State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Jana Hughes of Seward based their support or leaning support, respectively, partially on the Exec Board’s unanimous recommendation. Both noted that those representatives, appointed by their legislative peers, are privy to more information.
“I think he [McKeon] needs to step down,” said Hughes. “I’m hoping he will do that before we actually have to do an LR [legislative resolution] and have a hearing and then have a vote.”










I think it's incumbent upon all of us, if we believe in fair play, that we do extend a presumption of innocence and due process, even to the accused in very unsavory and untenable situations.

Of the nine voting members on the Exec Board, six said they would vote the same if and when expulsion comes to the floor, including Speaker of the Legislature John Arch, who sets the legislative calendar. One committee member could not be reached to confirm their position. 
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, Exec Board chair, said he advanced the recommendation because McKeon deserves “his day in legislative court.” He is one of two Exec Board members who said they would keep an open mind. Hansen says he wants to hear from the full Legislature first.
State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte added in a text: “Will need to see what the future brings, nothing certain. Keeping an open mind.”
‘We’re all very disappointed’
Kauth said lawmakers need to be role models, including in every action and speech.
“We should know better, especially [because] we’re the ones making the laws,” Kauth said. “If we choose not to follow those laws, that is absolutely inexcusable.”

State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a former member of the Exec Board and former chair of the Business and Labor Committee, said people “have to have faith in certain groups” and said he assumes his former committee did its diligent work, including with the advice of legal counsel. 
He said he still wants to hear all the facts.
“I think it goes without saying, we’re all very disappointed that this is something that we have to deal with. We shouldn’t have to deal with these things,” Riepe said. “It’s supposed to be a ladies’ and gentlemen’s club, and people need to behave and respond and act accordingly.”

Leveraging a “housing crisis” to scrap environmental protection or other community values makes no sense at all.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Michael Long: Streamlining housing permits shouldn’t sideline the public.","Dear Editor,
The permitting and appeals process for housing and other development in Vermont should be streamlined. Legal challenges can be lengthy, expensive and onerous, and delay is often the central — and winning — strategy. But projects can be challenged, successfully or not, only by parties with substantial funding and sustained commitment. That reality leaves much of the public on the sidelines, even though public policy should serve the public interest first.
From that perspective, expediting disputes makes sense. What does not make sense is leveraging a “housing crisis” to discard environmental protections or other community values. For every worthy project ultimately derailed by appeals under the current system, there may be a deeply flawed project that proceeds unchallenged. Developers with the resources to raise millions and the sophistication to tap tax dollars or credits are rarely stymied by the permit process. More often, they benefit from a judicial and political environment that is more accommodating than it should be.
The Burlington Square Mall redevelopment illustrates the risk. When the project first surfaced, City Hall effectively transformed its planning department into an advocate and accessory for the developer, abandoning its role as a guide and regulator in the public interest. The result was a prolonged pit, lasting social and economic harm, and a development delayed far longer than necessary.
Reforming the regulatory system to facilitate housing development is a worthy goal. But sidelining the public — and the public interest — in the name of a housing crisis is not.

Olympian Ben Ogden “just might be on the verge of taking American cross-country skiing where it hasn’t been before,” the New York Times recently reported. His hometown of Landgrove, population 177, knows how he got there.

University of Vermont graduate Ben Ogden — a two-time NCAA Nordic champion, 2022 Olympian and 2023’s fastest young male World Cup sprinter — “just might be on the verge of taking American cross-country skiing where it hasn’t been before,” the New York Times recently reported.
“He’s never really seen a race where he doesn’t want to burn from the beginning,” the Times wrote of Ogden’s “full-gas-from-the-start style” and “caution-to-the-wind fearlessness.”
But while the media is focusing on the skier’s future ahead of next month’s 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy, longtimers in the 25-year-old’s hometown of Landgrove, population 177, are pointing to his family’s pioneering past.
A century ago, the athlete’s great-grandfather, Samuel Robinson Ogden, was a young New Jersey visitor when he happened upon the Bennington County hamlet’s once desolate central village just before the 1929 stock market crash.
“The whole aspect was sad and dispiriting,” the man now called “Big Sam” went on to write in a memoir. “But I had some experience at fixing over old houses, and I could see possibilities.”

Buying 15 buildings for $4,500, Sam relocated his family to Landgrove and restored the properties. Upon his death a half-century later in 1985, the 88-year-old was remembered as a championing Town Meeting moderator, state House representative, author and columnist, supporter of the fledgling ski industry and a founder of such institutions as the Vermont Symphony Orchestra.
“The consequences of his work can be seen all over contemporary Vermont, though his significance lies as much on what he represented as what he did,” present-day historian Paul Searls has written. “He embodied the paradoxes and conundrums of a state struggling to reconcile the contradictory goals of embracing the modern world while trying to preserve what was best about Vermont tradition.”
Ben knows his great-grandfather through Searls’ book, “Repeopling Vermont: The Paradox of Development in the Twentieth Century.”
“On the one hand, I think it’s kind of cool,” the Olympian, taking a break for an interview, says of his ancestor’s tale of resuscitating a once ailing town.
On the other, Ben isn’t a newcomer like Sam. The self-described “native” views his environs with a different eye.
“I grew up seeing a lot of second homes, which was a confusing thing,” Ben says of a community where 60% of residences are part-time properties. “It’s sort of a waste that there are all these nice houses where Vermonters could live.”
And so the skier — striving, like the state, to push forward without careening off course — faces the same question his great-grandfather posed in a 1963 Vermont planning report: “How are we to get along in the modern world without sacrificing the values and assets we treasure most dearly?”
‘A bundle of contradictions’ 
Sam, born just after the first modern Olympics in 1896, grew up amid the dawn of the automobile and airplane, only to ship off during college to serve in World War I. Awarded France’s Croix de Guerre for heroism, he returned home at age 22 to his father’s insurance and real estate firm. But amid the progress and prosperity of the Roaring ’20s, he yearned for something simpler.
“I felt an intense revulsion for the life we had been living in the city,” Sam went on to write in one of more than half-dozen books he released between 1942 and 1978. “I scorned the rut that we all were in, the absence of real joy, the futility of boredom-inspired cocktail parties. I swore that we were but pawns in the uncreative game known as ‘keeping up with the Joneses.’”
That’s when Sam discovered Landgrove, founded in 1780 but at risk of disincorporation before he settled there in the spring of 1930. With few other residents other than his wife, Mamie, he became a jack of all trades: Blacksmith, selectboard member, justice of the peace, overseer of the poor and, in his most documented role, self-contrarian.
Sam Ogden (second in back row) joins other state officials in a Burlington Free Press photo of April 4, 1940.
A proponent of preservation, Sam fought road plans for a Green Mountain Parkway in the 1930s and, after serving in World War II, pushed to prohibit billboards in the 1940s — two decades before the state adopted a 1968 ban.
“Country living seems to me to erect bulwarks against the mistakes and follies of the age,” the man who helped create the Vermont Natural Resources Council wrote in 1946.
Then again, Sam promoted tourism by helping found Vermont Life magazine and fostered the now billion-dollar ski industry by aiding in the installation of the first rope tow at the Bromley ski area in 1938 and the first chair lift at what’s now the Stowe Mountain Resort in 1940.
Sam acknowledged his dueling dualities.
“The winter season has become the liveliest season of all, and prosperity and increased tax revenues have made the lot of the remote towns and their citizens seem to be much more satisfactory,” he wrote in a 1967 newspaper column. “But there are times when doubts creep into my mind, and, mind you, this is the mind of one who has played some part in the development of winter sports in Vermont.”

Searls, a professor at Vermont State University, points out more paradoxes in his “Repeopling Vermont” book. It chronicles Sam’s connections with both the “most significant efforts to simultaneously preserve yet improve Vermont” and “essentially all of the state’s most important figures,” starting with governors from George Aiken in the 1930s to Philip Hoff in the 1960s.
“Ogden cherished small-town democracy, but he acted on a statewide scale to see decisions ever more determined by centralized bureaucracies,” Searls writes. “He wanted to protect the landscape built by state residents, but encouraged and enabled its change, much for the use of outsiders. He was enamored with the people he first found in Landgrove, yet shaped the town in a way that made it so those people were progressively scarce.”
That said, the historian extends Sam more credit than blame.
“There are no villains in this story, least of all Sam Ogden, who devoted himself to the good of the state and the town he loved,” Searls writes. “Anyone who was that much of a bundle of contradictions deserves association with a state defined by its ongoing struggle to find balance between contradictory impulses.”
That challenge, the historian says, is held in Vermont’s motto: Freedom and Unity.
‘Getting to the top’
Sam had children, one of them Samuel III, who had children, one of them John, who had children, one of them Ben.
Like his great-grandfather, Ben’s a paradox. Each winter he travels the world to blaze trails on skis. Come spring, summer and fall, he roots himself in his hometown, where he learned his sport from his father.
John Ogden, a Middlebury College racer, raised Ben and siblings Katharine and Charlotte as he coached a local youth league named after friend and fellow Vermonter Bill Koch, the first American man to win a Nordic Olympic medal.
John saw his son win a first-ever U.S. men’s youth medal (silver in the team relay) at the 2018 World Junior Ski Championships, a gold in the same event in 2019, a slot at the 2022 Olympics and, finally, the World Cup’s 2023 green bib award for fastest male Nordic skier under age 23.
John did so as he battled cancer for a decade before his death in 2023 at age 56.

“In lieu of flowers, John’s request was that everyone spend a little extra time outside, be it on foot, on a bike, or on skis, in his honor,” his family wrote in his obituary.
Plowing ahead amid adversity can be painful, but Ben has plenty of practice. A member of Stratton’s SMS T2 elite training team, he prepares physically and mentally to push forward no matter what.
“It can be really hard to keep your eye on the prize, so I think about the next section of the race instead of dwelling on the whole thing,” the skier says of overcoming midcourse obstacles. “If I’m on a big hill, I think about getting to the top. After that, I might get a bit of a break and can think about the next thing.”
Following his own advice, Ben returned to World Cup racing the winter after his father’s death and landed on the podium for the first time. He punctuated his third-place finish in the skate-sprint with a celebratory backflip.
‘My great discovery’
Ben’s ability to rise above runs back generations. After Sam’s wife of 51 years died suddenly on Christmas 1971, the family patriarch fell into depression and attempted to take his life.
“It was in the hospital that I made my great discovery,” Sam wrote in a subsequent New York Times column in 1973. “I discovered that all the values which my unbearable grief had twisted into a pattern of evil could be set aright once I looked at them through Mamie’s eyes; and this, by the grace of God, I managed to do. Now I resolved to live with as much joy as I could accomplish, doing the things that I knew she would want me to do.”
Sam lived a dozen more years before his death at Bennington’s Vermont Veterans’ Home in 1985.
“I hope,” he wrote in his last book in 1978, “that the denizens of Landgrove will hang on; nay, more than that, will, in fact, construct a community whose brightness will shed light on other places, a light which may be ever increasing, infectious and contagious, for if this world is to be saved, this is the sort of thing which will have to happen more and more frequently.”

Travel to Landgrove today and you won’t see many gathering spots along the main dirt road, save the 1874 Farmers and Mechanics Hall turned municipal office. But there you’ll learn the town consistently reports the highest voter turnout in the state (87.97% in 2024, topped only by Andover’s 88.65% and Ripton’s 88.36%).
Interest in Landgrove’s current favorite son is equally high, and not just because seemingly everyone is a descendant of Big Sam or knows Ben’s mother, Andrea, the town’s treasurer, assistant clerk and trustee of public funds.
Andrea is one of many with a sense of humor when talking about Ben. She’s happy, for example, to spur him to recount how he wore “wind briefs” underwear during his first major 50K race, only to learn how freezing cold and breathable fabric can lead to, in his words, “two hours of horrendous discomfort.”
U.S. and SMS T2 teammate Jessie Diggins, the most decorated American cross-country skier in history, adds that she offers support by gilding Ogden’s mustache (so signature, it’s part of his YouTube channel logo) with red and blue glitter.
When home, Ben unwinds by rebuilding a 1973 Land Rover he completely dismantled years ago. 
“It started as a little project,” he says, “that has really spiraled out of control.”
A 2022 UVM engineering graduate with master’s credits, Ben says his “pipe dream” is to someday work for a company like South Burlington’s Beta Technologies.
“Vermont is not a great place to start a corporation that gigantic,” he says, “but they’re just doing it because they believe in the state and the people and the culture, and that, to me, is incredibly inspiring.”
The feeling is hereditary. Back in 1967, Sam chronicled life in a book of poems titled “Vermont’s Year.” It opens with a verse about navigating January snow:
… Each advance that now I make
Is but a single pace,
The next unmade, unknown:
Each step my ultimate …
Three generations later, his great-grandson is forging on.

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Building a maximum-security, 3,000-bed prison was supposed to be a crowning achievement for Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders as she touts her bonafides as a law-and-order Republican.
Debate over the project is instead casting a shadow on this year’s primary elections and legislative session, with a special election this week in the Senate district where the project is planned.
That election kicks off what’s already expected to be a busy year for Arkansas politics and government, where Democrats hope to make inroads. It could also test just how deep President Donald Trump’s support reverberates in what’s been friendly territory for him.
Here’s a look at some of the biggest stories that will be shaping the year:
Franklin County prison blues
Sanders has shown no signs of backing down from the Franklin County prison site, citing the need to ease the backlog of state prisoners in local jails. But local leaders have said they were blindsided by the plans and that they don’t believe there’s infrastructure for such a facility.
Tuesday’s special legislative primaries could provide an early look at how much local backlash to the prison project could mobilize voters.
Five candidates are vying for the Republican nomination to fill the remaining term of the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who was an outspoken critic of the prison project. All five GOP hopefuls and an independent candidate running for the seat in March oppose Franklin County being the prison site.
At least two more opponents of the prison plan — Sens. Bryan King and Ron Caldwell — also will be fending off challenges in the March primary.
The elections lead into this year’s fiscal session, where another fight could be on the way over funding for moving forward with the prison’s construction. The big question is whether it will face another legislative roadblock.
Keeping it fiscal
The prison isn’t the only uncertainty about this year’s legislative session, which is intended to focus on budget issues.
Just a day after the March primary, lawmakers launch their pre-session budget hearings that could indicate how much of a strain Trump’s cuts may create.
It’s also unknown whether Sanders, who has called for eliminating the states’ income tax, will push for another cut or wait. 
Democrats’ bumpy inroads
This year’s election will be the latest bid by Democrats to prove they can make inroads in a firmly red state.
The party is trying to cut into Republicans’ supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature. The GOP right now can easily pass most appropriations bills without needing a single vote from Democrats.
But the party is also hoping to prove competitive in some of the top races, though it remains a longshot.
The top of the ticket is Hallie Shoffner, the farmer and Democrat who’s trying to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton. Shoffner faces an uphill battle against Cotton as she hammers him over the impact Trump’s tariffs have on farmers.
The Trump factor
The impact of Trump’s policy changes from his tariffs to the Medicaid cuts included in the “Big Beautiful Bill” will also come into starker terms.
That’s especially true with the premium hikes that took effect in the new year following lawmakers’ inability to extend Obamacare subsidies that would have lessened the burden.
Arkansas is a state that Trump won easily each time he ran for president, and the state’s GOP officials have shown little sign of distancing themselves from him. But 2026 could offer a new test on just how solid that support for Trump will remain.
Setting the stage for ’28, ’30
This year could provide some sign of whether Sanders and Cotton are laying the groundwork for 2028 even as they fend off challenges in the midterms. 
With regular appearances on Fox News and a State of the Union rebuttal under her belt, Sanders has been maintaining her national profile ever since taking office. Cotton remains a staunch ally of Trump who also kept his media appearances busy.
The future of three-term Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman could shake up Arkansas politics if he opts against seeking another term. 
But the year also provides some indication of what races remain on the minds of the state’s other top officials.

Sen. Doug McCrory, House Speaker Matt Ritter, Mayor Arunan Arulampalam and Hartford City Council President Shirley Surgeon were all in attendance, as was Sonserae Cicero, the director of a Hartford nonprofit who had just signed a $475,000 contract to help run the new economic development initiative. 
The Democratic leaders said the program, which was launched in partnership with another nonprofit called Upper Albany Main Street, would serve as a lifeline for small minority-owned businesses in Hartford’s north end by providing them with training and up to $15,000 in grant money. 
“These dollars will not only pave the path for new businesses to grow and thrive; it will ensure that our merchants have the support, technology and resources to stick around for years to come,” Surgeon, the council president, said. 
Fast forward a year, however, and everything has changed. 
Cicero’s contract with the city has been cancelled, the entire program is on hold and the roughly two dozen small businesses that signed up for training are left questioning whether they will receive any of the grant money that was promised. 
All of the hopes that state and local officials had for the program quickly fell apart in August after it became apparent that a federal grand jury was examining the relationship between Cicero and McCrory and investigating several of Cicero’s businesses, which operate under different versions of the name SHEBA.

The small businesses that signed up for the program, meanwhile, have become collateral damage in the ongoing criminal probe. 
Several entrepreneurs who completed the small business program this fall said they were still waiting to learn when they will receive their $15,000 grants.
Tahara Chapman, the owner of a company called High Maintenance, a boutique clothing and hair shop along Albany Avenue, said she did everything that was asked of her during the program. 
She attended courses led by Upper Albany Main Street about how to use Excel and Powerpoint. She created a business plan with SHEBA. And she ended the program by presenting that plan during a business “pitch” competition.  
But since then, Chapman said, she’s been left in the dark. 
“I don’t know what’s going on in the background, but I did what I was supposed to do,” she said. 
Merice Bryan, who is trying to start her own health care business called Best Practices Home Care, said she is in the same position — left to wonder when, or if, the grant money will materialize. 
“I worked very hard and spent a lot of hours going through the program, and I am counting on that money to build my business,” Bryan said. 
How the SHEBA contract fell apart 
How Cicero’s nonprofit ended up winning — and abruptly losing — the nearly half-million-dollar contract in Hartford is a complicated tale that stretches back more than three years.

Cicero did not respond to repeated emails, phone calls and text messages for this story. And McCrory has repeatedly declined to comment on the ongoing federal investigation. 
But the Connecticut Mirror retraced the decisions that led to Hartford awarding the lucrative contract to SHEBA by combing through thousands of records that were seized by the FBI, interviewing officials who appropriated the federal funds and talking with several of the business owners that were supposed to benefit from that money. 
The story that emerged from that reporting involves a defunct state agency, McCrory redirecting money behind the scenes, concerns about Cicero “double dipping” into public funds and a last-minute plan to finally provide aid to the small businesses in Hartford. 
But it all starts in 2022 in the state legislature, where lawmakers were busy divvying up hundreds of millions of dollars in federal pandemic relief money. 
A flood of federal money
That year, state legislators had the unenviable task of deciding how to split up Connecticut’s $20 billion state budget while spending an additional $1.7 billion in federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, which was passed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Gov. Ned Lamont and legislators from around the state submitted proposals for how to spend the additional money, and in May 2022, they passed a bill distributing the federal aid. 
Seventy million dollars was allocated to the governor’s workforce strategies. The state’s hospitality industry received $30 million. Another $10 million was budgeted for financial assistance to nursing homes. And a large number of smaller projects favored by state lawmakers were also bankrolled. 
Among those smaller allocations was $2 million for CT Next, a quasi-public agency that was created in 2015 to foster startup businesses in Connecticut. 
The bill didn’t specify how CT Next was supposed to use the money, but emails obtained by the CT Mirror show lawmakers, including Ritter, the House Speaker, earmarked the money for the Upper Albany Merchant’s Association, which operates under a nonprofit called Upper Albany Main Street. 
Ritter told the CT Mirror that the $2 million was meant to provide sorely needed financial assistance to small businesses in the predominantly Black community along Albany Avenue, which had struggled through the first two years of the pandemic. 
After the money was budgeted for CT Next, Ritter said, he was not involved in the discussions about how to structure the small business program. And, for a time, he heard very little about the $2 million that he helped to appropriate. 
That was until June 2023, when the speaker’s office began to receive complaints that the businesses along Albany Avenue had still not received the financial support that was promised.

Redirecting the funds
At that point, Marilyn Risi, who was the executive director of Upper Albany Main Street in 2023, contacted Ritter to inform him that her request for the federal money had been held up by state officials after more than a year of waiting.  
“The $2 million that you and Senator McCrory allocated for Upper Albany through CT Next was denied,” Marilyn Risi told Ritter in an email.  
“Could you let us know where that funding is and if it will become available?” she added. 
Risi’s email, which was forwarded to state officials by Ritter’s staff, set off a months-long conversation within several Connecticut agencies about what was prohibiting the state from releasing the money. 
Staff at the Department of Economic and Community Development, which was helping CT Next put together a plan for the federal funds, assured everyone that the money would be paid out as lawmakers intended. But in several other emails, DECD employees explained that there were a couple issues that were holding things up. 
The first problem was that CT Next initially planned to use the money to provide loans to the small businesses, which was considered a high-risk activity for the federal funds. 
And the other issue was that CT Next wanted to subgrant a large portion of the $2 million to other nonprofits, one of which was SHEBA. 
Records show that the leaders of CT Next’s board voted to award part of the $2 million to Cicero’s business shortly after the legislature appropriated the money in 2022, and by May 2023, CT Next’s executive director Onyeka Obiocha told state officials that McCrory authorized CT Next to allocate $350,000 of that money to SHEBA. 
“Senator McCrory is aware of and approved of the use of funds,” he wrote. 
Obiocha declined to comment for this story, and he referred any questions about CT Next’s intended use of the federal money to DECD. 
McCrory told the CT Mirror during a brief phone conversation in November that he had never heard of CT Next. 
But according to Risi, it was McCrory who introduced her to the staff at CT Next and proposed a partnership between SHEBA and Upper Albany Main Street. 
She said McCrory showed up at one of Upper Albany Main Street’s monthly meetings with Cicero to pitch the plan for the small business program. 
“Senator McCrory brought Sonserae Cicero to one of our meetings and stated we were going to be working with CT Next,” Risi told the CT Mirror in an interview. “We were supposed to contact small businesses that would be receiving loans and grants, provided that they would participate in seminars that (Cicero) was going to provide.”
Risi said she questioned, at the time, why Upper Albany Main Street needed to partner with Cicero on the small business training. And she pointed out that her organization already had an established relationship with the University of Hartford, which paired up college students with local businesses to help them with loan applications, creating business plans and budgeting.
But McCrory made it clear, Risi said, that Upper Albany Main Street would need to work with Cicero if they wanted to obtain the grant funding from the state.
Double-dipping?
The decision to subgrant part of the federal funds to SHEBA became a sticking point once state officials recognized that Cicero was already being paid $300,000 for the same type of work through another small business program, which McCrory also helped to approve. 
That state-run program, which was overseen by the staff at DECD through its Minority Business Initiative, required small businesses to go through SHEBA’s so-called “accelerator” program before they could apply for a forgivable loan of up to $50,000. 
The fact that Cicero would be paid to provide the same type of training through multiple taxpayer-funded programs, DECD officials explained, could lead people to question the state’s decision to award her more money. 
“They received state funding to perform the exact same work that was outlined in the CT Next proposal,” Rhonda Olisky, an employee at DECD, told other state officials in July 2023. “I believe Onyeka was unaware of that funding, however, he did agree with us that we all want to avoid any appearance of ‘double-dipping.’” 
Throughout the summer and into the fall of 2023, Ritter’s office continued to contact state officials to try to get answers about why the money for small businesses along Albany Avenue had yet to arrive.
But according to Ritter, nobody informed him or his staff about McCrory and Obiocha’s plans to shift hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding to SHEBA and another nonprofit.  
“Our office took the lead in getting this program set up, but in terms of any involvement in sub grant recipients, my office had no involvement in that, nor any knowledge of any of those conversations” Ritter said. 
In the end, none of the federal money ever made it through CT Next and out to the merchants along Albany Avenue. 
Jim Watson, DECD’s spokesperson, said that is because CT Next’s director and staff never finalized an application for the money.
In an email, Olinsky, who raised the concerns about double dipping, said she asked Obiocha to revise CT Next’s plan for the funds during a conversation in July 2023. But she said she never heard anything back from him.
State leaders officially shut down CT Next the following year and folded the quasi-public agency’s remaining operations into DECD.

A last-minute pitch
With CT Next gone and all of its employees laid off, Ritter said he and his staff had to find another way to get the federal money to the convenience stores, barber shops and other businesses along Albany Avenue. 
But as state legislators returned to Hartford in 2024, there was very little time left to formulate that new plan. 
The rules for the pandemic relief funding required the state to have contracts in place for all of the federal money by the end of 2024. Otherwise, it would be forced to return the unallocated funds to Washington, D.C. 
So as the time ticked down on another legislative session, Ritter said he and other lawmakers tapped the city of Hartford to come up with a way to spend roughly $1.7 million. 
The legislature officially allocated the federal funds to the city in May 2024. And Arulampalam, who had just taken over as Hartford’s mayor earlier that year, said he received a call from state officials shortly after that asking him to draft a proposal for how to distribute the money. 
Arulampalam, who was new to public office, said the opportunity to secure $1.7 million for one of the poorest areas of the city was too good of an opportunity to pass up. 
“We knew the money was going to go away. We didn’t know the history of the other attempts” to distribute the money, Arulampalm said. 
Arulampalam said it was Surgeon, Hartford’s council president, who ultimately brought forward a proposal for how to use the money. 
“We trusted Shirley and had reason to trust Shirley because she is part of that Upper Albany neighborhood. She knows that neighborhood and the businesses really well,” Arulampalam said. 
Hartford’s plan
As it turned out, Surgeon’s proposal closely mirrored the plan that was previously pitched by CT Next and approved by McCrory. 
Upper Albany Main Street would receive $475,000 from the city to teach small business owners how to use technology and computer programs. SHEBA would get another $475,000 for taking the businesses through an 8-week class that included training and one-on-one business coaching. And the rest of the money would fund the $15,000 grants for roughly 50 qualifying small businesses along Albany Avenue.  
Surgeon told the CT Mirror she did not speak to McCrory about how to allocate the $1.7 million that the legislature gave to the city and said she was unaware that Cicero had been in line to receive $350,000 when the money was earmarked for CT Next. 
Surgeon, who has appeared as a guest on Cicero’s podcast, said she encouraged the city to hire Cicero because her nonprofit was based on Albany Avenue and because she had prior experience providing small business training to minority-owned companies. 
The goal of the program, Surgeon said, was to make sure the small business along Albany Avenue could keep their doors open. 
“I live here,” Surgeon said. “I want to make sure the businesses survive.”

Arulampalam said the city ran its normal checks before the contract with SHEBA was finalized in October 2024, but he said state officials, who also reviewed the city’s proposal, never informed him of their earlier reservations about SHEBA being paid for similar services through multiple programs. 
Watson, DECD’s spokesman, said that is because state officials no longer had any concerns at that point about SHEBA being paid from multiple sources of taxpayer money. 
“Having done due diligence in vetting and attempting to contract the previous CTNext award, DECD staff was aware that the work proposed by the City of Hartford with the new ARPA allocation was not ‘double dipping,’ as it had a different scope and programmatic focus than the other SHEBA grant with DECD,” Watson said. 
Pausing the program
All of the vetting that was done in 2024 did not prevent the city from freezing the small business program earlier this year, however.
Arulampalam told the CT Mirror that his administration cut off the city’s contract with SHEBA in late August as a direct result of the grand jury investigation and several subpoenas, which ordered the state to turn over any records detailing a “personal or non-professional relationship” between McCrory and Cicero. 
By that point, 26 small business owners had already signed up for the digital literacy courses offered by Upper Albany Main Street. And six of those entrepreneurs had also gone through SHEBA’s portion of the training program in order to qualify for a $15,000 grant. 
Hartford officials said they chose not to cancel the city’s contract with Upper Albany Main Street. But that didn’t really matter. 
With SHEBA terminated, they said, the entire small business program had to be paused, while invoices and other records were sent to the state for review.  
DECD officials confirmed last month that they were analyzing that information, and they said the agency also requested additional documentation. 
According to Hartford officials, Cicero billed the city for roughly $72,000 before the program was officially halted. 
But DECD said all of those expenditures will need to be scrutinized before any of that money can be paid out. 
The same goes for the grants that the businesses along Albany Avenue have been waiting on for more than three years.

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)The deal to lure the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line to Kansas, announced by Gov. Laura Kelly with glee just a few days before Christmas, may represent the largest public subsidy in the history of American professional sports.
Is it a wise investment?
No, but it follows a recent Kansas trend of abandoning caution and reaching for shiny objects. Photos of Kelly clutching a Chiefs jersey were reminiscent of her plunking down $15 to place the first legalized sports bet in 2022. Sports betting came to Kansas following a lavishly obscene campaign by lobbyists to woo lawmakers, as documented by The New York Times. Kelly bet on the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl. They did, six months later, and Kelly donated her $165 winnings to charity.
She’d better hope that luck holds.
That Kansas has given its official blessing to sports and gambling – and has now committed billions of dollars of public debt to build a stadium where you can watch football while gambling on your phone – would have scandalized earlier generations of Sunflower State leaders. It should still scandalize us today, but we have become so inured to the soft sins that it feels like we are living in a Phillip K. Dick version of the reality we once knew.
Just as “The Man in the High Castle” is set in an alternate timeline where the Allies don’t win World War II, today’s Kansas is at once familiar and alien. Dorothy is still here, but she’s feeding slot machines at the local casino. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em have mortgaged the farm to build a stadium for the Wamego Munchkins. The Tin Man is assembling a nuclear reactor in his time off from the battery plant, and the Cowardly Lion is working for ICE. The Scarecrow? He burned up a long time ago in a grass fire out west. About the only vice still prohibited in this version of Kansas is marijuana, which will still get you thrown in the cooler if you’re caught by the Winkie Guards coming back from the Emerald City on I-70.
Okay, I’m sorry for not referring to the correct Wamego High School mascot. But I just couldn’t. They are the “Red Raiders.” While we’re on the subject, the Kansas City Chiefs will tell you that their name is an homage to former Kansas City, Missouri, mayor H. Roe Bartle, who was instrumental in bringing the team from Dallas in 1963. This is one of those “yes, but” explanations; Bartle did have the nickname “Chief,” but it wasn’t because of his municipal experience. Bartle had a long association with the Boy Scouts of America, in which he claimed to have been inducted into an Arapaho tribe and used the name, “Chief Lone Bear.” It should be noted that the Kansas City Chiefs now prohibit headdresses and face paint on game day and took instruction from a Native American working group on cultural sensitivity.
The Chiefs began as the Dallas Texans in 1959, owned by Lamar Hunt, and the team was a charter member of the American Football League. In 1966, the NFL and the AFL merged, and that year’s championship game between the two leagues was called the “Super Bowl” by Hunt.
Hunt’s brothers, Nelson and Herbert, tried to corner the world’s silver market in 1980. They failed and lost a billion dollars (about $4 billion in today’s money) in the process. But a consortium of U.S. banks bailed them out and, after various lawsuits and a Chapter 11 reorganization, the family fortune remained more or less intact. The Hunt family, whose net worth was valued at $25 billion by Forbes magazine, also owns one of Kansas City’s strangest features, SubTropolis, the world’s largest underground office complex carved out of the limestone bluffs north of the Missouri River.
Lamar Hunt died in 2006, aged 74. His son Clark was appointed chair of the Kansas City Chiefs.
It was Clark Hunt who appeared with Gov. Kelly on Dec. 22, announcing the Chiefs would move to a new stadium across the state line by 2031. Since 1972, the Chiefs’ home has been Arrowhead Stadium, part of the Truman Sports Complex. It includes Kaufmann Stadium, home of the Royals baseball team. The facilities are near the I-70 and 435 interchange in Kansas City, Missouri.
Although the location for the Kansas stadium has not been revealed, it’s expected to be near the Legends outlet mall in Kansas City, Kansas. That would place it just 23 miles from Arrowhead, perhaps the shortest relocation in NFL history.
Kansas had tried for years to poach the Chiefs from Missouri, and officials finally achieved the goal by offering to finance most of a $4 billion project for a new stadium, training complex, and team headquarters. Under the state’s STAR bond program, no public vote was needed, just the agreement of Kansas lawmakers and the billionaire Hunt family.
The deal blows up a 2019 border wars truce that prevented Missouri and Kansas from attempting to steal businesses from the other side of the state line in the Kansas City metro area. Kelly has denied breaking the truce, saying sports teams are different than corporations. The deal also follows a 2024 special election in which Jackson County, Missouri, voters soundly rejected a 3/8 cent sales tax to renovate stadiums for the Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals.
Kansas has used STAR bonds – for Sales Tax and Revenue – for a number of projects already, but none of the magnitude called for in the Chiefs agreement. The bonds allow state or local governments to develop projects to enhance Kansas tourism and economic development while paying off the project through sales tax revenue for the area served. In preparation for the Chiefs deal, Kansas lawmakers voted to remove the STAR bond prohibition on paying for more than 50% of a project and extended the repayment period from 20 years to 30. While there will be no referendum for state voters on whether the project is a good idea, local municipalities would have to vote to increase local sales taxes to help pay for the deal.
Past developments have ranged from the Kansas Speedway in Wyandotte County to the Flint Hills Discovery Center at Manhattan. Most projects have been successful, but two – an $83 million bond for the Schlitterbahn Water Park in Kansas City and $10 million bond for the Heartland Motorsports Park at Topeka – have failed. Both are now closed.
The deal offered the Chiefs is likely the largest public subsidy in the history of professional sports, according to reporting by the Kansas City Star. With debt service and facility maintenance, the deal may top $6 billion, with the state on the hook for 60% of that amount. The bond district could include much of Wyandotte and Johnson counties, including the city of Olathe, although boundaries and sales tax amounts have not yet been set.
Kelly, who said the Chiefs announcement was the biggest and most historic of her tenure, has defended the deal by saying it will bring more jobs and economic opportunity to Kansas and help define the state as receptive to business. She also claimed the deal would be paid for by revenue generated by the project, and not with “new taxes.” But it’s difficult to see how Kansas is anything but a chump in handing the Hunt family, which has more than enough money to build its own stadium, the keys to a $3 billion state-of-the-art domed facility in Wyandotte County and s $1 billion headquarters and a training camp in Johnson County. How does creating a massive sales tax district, encompassing much of the Kansas City, Kansas, metro area, amount to anything except new taxes?
At least Missourians got to vote on the sales tax.
Kansans had no such opportunity.
“The growth argument is nonsense because the economic impact from stadiums is mostly an illusion,” according to a recent Washington Post editorial. “When people are at the stadium, it’s a happening place with lots of activity. But there are only eight or nine NFL home games per year.” NFL stadiums spend most of the time empty, the Post noted, and they serve about as many customers in a year as a single American grocery store.
I couldn’t help but wince when I read the analogy to a grocery store. Holy Knute Rockne, no wonder Kansas showered the Hunt family with money. Our lawmakers are known for their fondness for any scheme including real or imagined grocery stores.
Seriously, the comparison to the Beneficient saga of a “pawn shop for the rich” in Hesston is a good one. In both cases, you had somebody who doesn’t need the money receiving concessions they don’t deserve for something hidden behind a curtain.
The Chiefs deal is further proof that Kansas government, on both sides of the lopsided aisle, serves the rich at the expense of everybody else. What kind of sales tax will be required to service the debt on a $4 billion stadium and accessories package? More than working families can bear. The cheapest seats at the beginning of the 2025 season were $160. Those living in the special district who could never afford to attend a Chiefs game must still buy staples and put gas in the car. Any sales tax increase will hit them harder than anyone else, because it is the most regressive of taxes. The argument that the bond district will generate enough revenue to pay for itself is disturbingly similar to some of the trickle-down rhetoric that came from Sam Brownback and company during his failed tax “experiment.”
Putting aside for a moment the question of whether it’s wise to give a $4 billion subsidy to a franchise owned by a single wealthy family, consider what else Kansas could fund with that kind of dough. My list would include libraries, art museums, history centers, concert halls, elementary schools, public parks, community health centers and homes for the unhoused.
Unrealistic?
Perhaps. But no more unrealistic than relocating a sports franchise 23 miles from its traditional location and expecting an economic miracle. Instead, what you get is economic sleight-of-hand where dollars spent on one side of an arbitrary line are now spent on the other. This might be good for a while, but once you’ve ignited an economic war you may lose something of greater value later. Think United Parcel Service or the Amazon Fulfillment Center, which combined employ more than 5,000. There are no signs that either is considering moving now, but with the truce broken and the state’s integrity shot, anything could happen.
There is also the issue that some longtime Chiefs fans are angry.
Rudi Keller, writing for the Missouri Independent, swears he will never root for the Chiefs again.
“The Kansas Chiefs are dead to me,” Keller declared.
Keller noted that after a spectacular run – and winning the Super Bowl in 2020, 2023, and 2024 – the team’s luck seems to have changed this year. They won’t even make it to the playoffs.
Some diehard Chiefs fans expressed concern over the move at a tailgater before the last home game of the season, according to KMBC television. In addition to losing the tradition of the Chiefs at Arrowhead, some questioned whether they would be able to afford tickets at a new venue.
The new Kansas stadium would seat 10,000 fewer fans than Arrowhead, according to the 33-page agreement, which might indicate more expensive seating. The Chiefs will also have the right to keep 100% of the proceeds, after paying a relatively paltry $7 million annually in rent to the state. It will also hold naming rights to the facility – and the ability to sell those rights to a third party. My guess is the Chiefs won’t take the high road and christen it the Eisenhower Sports Complex.
What Kansas gets from the deal are bragging rights – and most of the debt.
Despite the certainty with which Kelly announced the move, the deal is not yet final. Scattered throughout that 33-page document are conditions that have to be met before the move begins, including the acquisition by the Chiefs of the stadium site and NFL approval by Oct. 31.
Let’s all hope for a Halloween reprieve.

If you’ve ever wondered who’s actually in charge when your train is late, your ticket doesn’t scan, and parking enforcement is already writing you up, congratulations, you’ve stumbled upon the mysteries of Connecticut rail governance.



You may not realize it, but a single train ride on commuter rail in our state may be touched by seven or more different agencies, each responsible for a different part of your ride.
The railroad tracks: Fortunately, the State of Connecticut owns the railroad tracks, signals, power lines and right-of-way from Greenwich to New Haven, the largest section of the Northeast Corridor that is not owned by Amtrak.  That gives us more control of ‘our’ trains.  But Amtrak owns the tracks, etc. north of New Haven to Massachusetts (aka The Hartford Line) and east of New Haven (Shore Line East) to New London.
The stations: Here’s where it gets more confusing.  Most train stations in the state are owned by the Connecticut Department of Transportation but a few are owned by the towns and cities where they are located.  In some cases the town owns the station but it sits on CDOT-owned land. 
As for who is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the stations, it’s usually the owner, but CDOT contracts with third parties to run big stations like Stamford, New Haven, Hartford and Bridgeport.  Remember this when you’re slip-sliding on the platform waiting for your train.
Station parking: Parking at the stations is ultimately controlled by CDOT as they own most of the parking lots.  At the big stations with parking structures (Stamford and New Haven, for example) CDOT hires third parties to run the show.  In the smaller towns, where CDOT owns the land, they may lease it to the towns to operate.
The cost of parking is often determined by the local authorities, in most cases the towns or agents of CDOT.  On CDOT-owned land the parking is available to all, regardless of where you live.  In town-owned lots, rates and even access can be limited to local residents.
Commuter rail may be regional, but parking policy seems aggressively parochial.
The train cars: On the New Haven line, CDOT owns about half of the railcars with Metro-North (MTA) owning the rest.  On Shore Line East and The Hartford Line, CDOT owns the cars except those operated with Amtrak equipment.
Train operations: CDOT hires Metro-North to run the trains on the New Haven line and branches.  The two agencies work under an “operating agreement” the size of a Manhattan phone book and just as readable.  On Shore Line East the trains are run by Amtrak and on The Hartford Line some trains are run by Amtrak and others by a CDOT contractor, TransitAmerica.
Schedules: CDOT tells Metro-North the level of service they want and then works with that agency on how to deliver it (given financial constraints in their state budget).  On Shore Line East and The Hartford Line it’s a similar deal, but this time working with Amtrak.
The fares: CDOT sets commuter fares for trains in our state, not Metro-North or Amtrak.  The fares usually increase in lockstep: the latest MTA fare hike in New York soon to be matched by July’s CDOT fare increase.
How does all this work out for you, the rider?  How can a single train trip be touched by so many state and local agencies, towns and city departments?
The short answer is… it does work, sort of.  But it leaves passengers confused when it doesn’t.  If you get a parking ticket at the station, do you think Metro-North is to blame?  If your train is running late or over-crowded, who do you call?
Ours is an imperfect system, a relic of decades of bi-state compromises, overlapping authorities, and well-meaning bureaucrats and operators doing their best inside a structure that practically guarantees confusion.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0213_SR_CTRail_233-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-04 04:56:46.126991

When President Trump bombed and invaded Venezuela, kidnapped the Venezuelan president and installed a new government to “run” the country, all without the the consent of Congress and in violation of our Constitution, he crossed his own Rubicon.
The post Trump crosses the Rubicon. ‘The die is cast.’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Alea Iacta Est
Julius Caesar, fresh from his victories in Gaul, led his legion back into Roman territory contrary to the Roman law dictating that no commander could lead armed troops into Rome without the Senate’s approval. Caesar did it anyway.

Opinion

When Caesar’s horse stepped a forefoot into the Rubicon River, the northern border of Rome, one of his lieutenants is quoted by the historian Seutonius as saying, “Alea Iacta Est” — “The die is cast.”
Rome would never be the same again. The Roman Republic would erupt in civil war, and ultimately be replaced by the Roman Empire. Caesar would not live to see it. He was, instead, assassinated on the floor of the Senate for his hubris.
The long, slow decline of Rome would follow, and a cautionary tale against unchecked ambition would be chiseled in stone. The history of the Western world became neatly divided between before the Rubicon and after.
When President Trump bombed and invaded Venezuela, kidnapped the Venezuelan president and left Americans to “run” the country, all without the consent of Congress and in violation of our Constitution, he crossed his own Rubicon. The die has been cast, and nothing in America will ever be the same.
Make no mistake, President Maduro was a slimy bastard and Venezuela has been a screwed-up country for quite some time. But changing that situation was never the job of the United States, but rather that of the Venezuelan people.
I am reminded of Ed Abbey’s suggestion regarding uncontrolled immigration at our southern border. Abbey, the author of many left-leaning books on the environment, advised that every refugee from the southern hemisphere, who is escaping despotism in their own country, should be met at the border, given a machine gun and a week’s worth of food, and told to go back home and start their own goddam revolution.
Policing politics in other countries has never been the job of the United States, although we have seldom passed up a chance to do precisely that. Our misguided attempt to “run” South Viet Nam cost us nearly 60,000 American lives and almost tore our country apart. History repeats itself to our detriment.
What will be the eventual butcher’s bill in Venezuela?
Nobody is willing to count that cost, not even Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon who posted on X that the Venezuelan people “now have a chance to be free.” Everyone is too caught up in the machismo and patriotic fervor of the moment, waving flags and shouting “USA, USA.” After all, nothing says patriotism more than kicking the shit out of a third-rate country. Gordon’s recent expression of support and justification for Trump’s crossing of his own Rubicon made my skin crawl.
Every American soldier who bleeds if we get mired in Venezuela, will bleed directly onto Gordon’s hands, and on the hands of everyone who follows Trump across that fateful river.
And that is not to mention the damage done to the United States and our reputation as a beacon of hope in the world. We risk — if we are not already — being perceived as nothing more than a purveyor gunboat democracy.
What, too, of the damage to ourselves, as we cheer loudly for American imperialism instead of self-rule in the rest of the world, while we watch the sacred institutions of our Constitution sacrificed on the altar of poll numbers and deflection from the Epstein files?
Viewed in a certain light, the responsibility for the downfall of Rome should rest on the legion that followed him across the Rubicon. Had those troops simply said to themselves, “This is bullshit,” obeyed the law and stayed on their side of the river, Caesar would have bluffed and blustered and spouted off without anyone behind him to back him up. And the history of the world would be different.
That is the choice confronting us all. Do we follow Caesar, or do we obey the law? 
Perhaps the die is not yet cast.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The Charles County Democratic Central Committee chose Yonelle Moore Lee on Saturday to fill the vacant District 27A seat in the House, setting up a conflict with Prince George’s County Democrats who backed a different candidate Tuesday.
The conflict means that Gov. Wes Moore (D) will make the choice between Moore Lee and Darrell Odom Sr., the Prince George’s County nominee, to represent the district that straddles the two counties.
Moore Lee, 50, chair of the county’s school board, won the support of 12 of the 14 central committee members present at Saturday morning’s roughly two-hour meeting.
“Your trust in me really means a lot. I will not let you down,” Moore Lee, 50, said after the vote. “I’m not sure what the next steps may be and what will happen, but either way, I’m very, very proud.”
What happens next is Gov. Wes Moore (D) must make a decision.
The governor has 15 days to choose between Moore Lee and Darrell Odom Sr., once the names are forwarded to him, but the 2026 General Assembly is set to convene sooner than that, on Jan. 14.
The seat became vacant after Kevin Harris was sworn in last month as state senator for District 27, that includes portions of Charles, Calvert and Prince George’s counties. Harris replaced former Democratic Sen. Michael Jackson, who left to become superintendent of Maryland State Police.

Harris attended Saturday’s special public hearing in Charles County and spoke on behalf of Odom, 71, a member of the Prince George’s Democratic Central Committee who received one vote.
Lamont Tyler Bunyon, who runs an optometry practice in Prince George’s, also received a vote from the Charles County Democrats, as he did at the Prince George’s meeting.
As at Tuesday night’s meeting in Prince George’s, Harris was among a few elected officials to speak on behalf of a candidate Saturday.
Reuben Collins II, president of the Charles County Board of Commissioners, and Del. Debra Davis (D-Charles) both spoke on behalf of Moore Lee.
“As chairperson of the Board of Education, she leads one of the most complex public institutions in our region overseeing a $529 million budget and serving over 28,000 students,” Davis said. “She has proven her ability to lead in high-stakes environments, build consensus across diverse viewpoints and deliver outcomes that matter to families. That’s real governing experience.”
Each candidate was asked several questions that included their plans to support the central committee as a “valued” partner. They all agreed.
They differed slightly when asked what legislation or policy areas they would be most prepared to immediately work on.
Although each candidate mentioned education as a priority, Moore Lee specifically touched upon the multibillion-dollar Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
“We have made a promise and a commitment to a world class education with the Blueprint. It’s supposed to be fully implemented by 2030, that is something that’s very important to me,” she said.
Bunyon said a main priority for him would be health care, especially with his work as an optometrist. He noted how several friends died in their 50s.

“We have to do a better job arguing for better health care, advocacy [and] awareness resources, because it’s a lot of preventable things that can be done,” he said. “I hate to say that I’m going to run there and try to be a doctor to folks, but I’m supposed to because I’m trained to do it.”
Odom said public safety “is a strong suit” for him, with a specific focus on juvenile justice reform, domestic violence and emergency response and prevention. Besides his 31 years of service in the Army and Coast Guard, he also worked as an acting fire chief in Prince George’s.
The nearly two-hour meeting did have a little humor when Charles County committee Vice Chair Elaine Hardee asked Odom how he would define ethical leadership and model it as a delegate.
In a previous question, Odom summarized ethics in public service.
“Should I say ditto on that?” Odom said to several laughs in the room.
In the meantime, the Prince George’s Central Committee has scheduled another public hearing Monday to select someone a replacement for Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s). The former House majority whip, who has represented District 24 since 2017, announced more than two weeks ago he’s stepping down to work as the director of government relations at the University of Maryland, his alma mater.
Lewis’ last day will be the same day as the central committee meeting.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Members of the Kansas congressional delegation denounced Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as a dictator and urged President Donald Trump to explain to Congress use of U.S. airstrikes and deployment of troops to seize Maduro for prosecution in the United States.
Several in the federal delegation said it was important for Congress to fulfill its oversight role after Trump unilaterally ordered capture of a foreign leader in conjunction with a U.S. indictment for alleged drug and weapon trafficking. In the months before the assault Saturday, Trump had ordered sinking of small vessels in waters off Venezuela to interdict illegal drug trafficking and had directed the seizure of oil tankers.
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican, said he anticipated briefings on “future efforts in Venezuela” when the Senate returned next week to Washington, D.C.
“I commend the U.S. forces and intelligence community for a successful mission with the capture of Nicolas Maduro,” Moran said. “An illegitimate dictator and narcotrafficker, Maduro will face justice on American soil.”
The delegation’s lone Democrat, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, said Maduro was a “brutal dictator who has harmed the Venezuelan people.” She went further than her GOP peers in terms of demanding an accounting from the Trump administration.
“Launching overnight strikes without congressional authorization or a clear explanation puts U.S. troops in danger and risks further escalation. The American people deserve answers,” she said.
U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt, a Republican serving the 2nd District of eastern Kansas, said execution of the arrest warrant for Maduro, and his spouse, was a military and law enforcement achievement.
He said he expected a detailed briefing on the operation “in the coming days” and concluded “Congress must carefully monitor the path forward and always put America First.”
“There is no doubt Maduro’s regime supported the drug trade poisoning Americans in our communities, welcomed American adversaries from around the world into our hemisphere and contributed to the deadly chaos at our southern border in recent years,” Schmidt said. “Bringing him to justice will make our Kansas communities safer. As with any great change, much hard work and uncertainty now lies ahead.”
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican, said Trump promised to secure the U.S. borders and cut off “threats to us and our families at the source.” He also said “Venezuela ignored the call to stop trafficking lethal drugs into America.”
“Our communities and children are safer at home because of bold leadership like this, and I’m proud to stand with him,” Marshall said.
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican representing the Wichita region, said the United States was a “safer country” following military action to “protect the American people from the rampant and deadly narcoterrorism enabled by and carried out by the illegitimate Maduro dictatorship.” He said he looked forward to justice prevailing in U.S. courts.
Colin McRoberts, a Democratic candidate for the 1st District seat held by GOP U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, said he believed the United States’ strike on Venezuela involved “acts of war against a sovereign nation.” Mann didn’t respond to a request for comment.
McRoberts said it was hypocrisy for Trump to embrace an indictment of Maduro on weapons and drug charges after pardoning a former Honduran president for comparable offenses.
On Dec. 1, Trump pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez. He was convicted in March 2024 on drug trafficking and weapons charges and was serving a 45-year prison term.
“A jury convicted Hernandez of those charges. Donald Trump pardoned him. This attack on Venezuela was not about drugs,” McRoberts said. “We know that Congress has the constitutional authority and duty to get to the bottom of this — to demand and require real answers from the administration, instead of propaganda and lies.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jerry-Moran-ku-med-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-03 18:57:42.849565

Nearly a hundred people came together in downtown Raleigh Saturday to voice their opposition to the Trump administration’s removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and apparent subsequent takeover of the South American country. 
The “emergency protest,” organized by Code Pink, the Party for Socialism and Liberation and several Democratic groups, took place in Moore Square Saturday afternoon. 
In an hour-long news conference earlier Saturday, President Donald Trump called Maduro a “narcoterrorist” and said Maduro and his wife would be tried on criminal charges in the U.S. justice system.
Trump said, “we’re gonna run the country” of Venezuela until a “judicious” transfer of power can be orchestrated. Trump also said U.S. oil companies would go into Venezuela to rebuild the country’s petroleum infrastructure, tap the nation’s vast oil reserves and sell the oil to other countries.  
North Carolina Republicans took to social media and the airwaves to praise the president’s actions as a victory for law and order. 
“President Trump’s bold actions have kept his promise to stop drug traffickers and save American lives,” said N.C. GOP spokesman Matt Mercer. “Capturing narcoterrorist Nicolas Maduro protects Americans and makes the world a safer place.” 
But protesters Saturday afternoon said they think the U.S. takeover of Venezuela will destabilize governments throughout the region, and most said they think Venezuela’s oil was the primary aim of Trump’s action. 
“Venezuela has one of the largest oil reserves in the entire world,” Alex Trejo with the Party for Socialism and Liberation told NC Newsline. “The real aim of the U.S. intervening in Venezuela is for the oil and not for this ‘democratic process’ that they’re trying to disguise it as.” 
Karen Still protests in Raleigh, Jan. 3, 2026. (Photo by Laura Leslie/NC Newsline)
Trejo conceded that Maduro was not democratically elected, but said it violated international law for the U.S. to go in and remove him. “It’s the Venezuelan people’s right to go through that democratic process themselves,” he said.  
Nikolai Kutsch with the N.C. State College Democrats said Trump’s actions contradict his 2024 campaign promises to avoid involving the U.S. in wars in other countries. 
“We don’t go in and run another country, and certainly not without congressional approval. This is completely outside of his bounds of power,” Kutsch said. “It is a lie, and it is not going to end well, I think.” 
Karen Still, a U.S. military veteran, held a sign likening Trump’s action in Venezuela to Russia’s attempt to take over Ukraine.
“What he is doing in Venezuela is equal to what Putin is doing. It’s aggression,” Still said. “There’s no good reason for it, and he’s putting America’s security and American lives and service members in jeopardy.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4128-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-03 17:57:27.206193

1. Did Sen. Daines consider signing onto the statement, and if so, why did he decline?
2. What is Sen. Daines’ stance on the war between Ukraine and Russia?
3. Does Sen. Daines support the U.S.-backed plan that would have a truce if Ukraine cedes territory?
4. Should America take a harder stance against Putin’s regime, or should we embrace closer ties as President Trump has?

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Supporters of two citizen initiatives, one focused on parental rights and another on barring transgender athletes from girls’ sports, moved closer Friday to getting those measures before the Washington state Legislature, and potentially voters.
The political committee Let’s Go Washington turned in signatures in support of the initiatives on Friday at the secretary of state’s office in Tumwater.
Let’s Go Washington said supporters collected 416,201 signatures on petitions for IL26-001. This initiative would repeal changes that legislators made this year to an earlier Let’s Go Washington initiative that codified rights for parents of public school children.
The other initiative, IL26-638, seeks to block transgender girls from competing in girls’ sports. Backers gathered 445,187 signatures for that measure, Let’s Go Washington said.
Initiative sponsors were advised to turn in at least 386,000 signatures. Friday was the deadline for gathering the signatures.
Both measures are initiatives to the Legislature, meaning they would go before lawmakers for consideration in the session that begins Jan. 12. The secretary of state’s office will now verify the submitted signatures to confirm the initiatives can move forward.
“This is not a partisan issue, this is a common sense issue,” said Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager who leads Let’s Go Washington. He said that about half of those who’d signed the initiative petitions were independents or Democrats. “This has broad support.”
Critics of the latest Let’s Go Washington initiatives say they pose safety risks for vulnerable students, including LGBTQ+ students and those seeking mental health support at school.
“Let’s Go Washington is playing political games with the lives of vulnerable trans and queer kids,” said Sophia Lee, a board member with the Gender Justice League.
“While most parents are loving and supportive, the reality is not all kids are safe at home, and need to turn to a trusted teacher or school counselor for help,” Lee added.
Lee’s statement was issued by WA Families for Freedom, a group opposed to the initiatives that has support from Service Employees International Union 775, the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and the Washington Education Association, which is the state’s largest union representing public school employees.
Lawmakers have three paths they can take if the submitted signatures are verified.
They can approve the initiatives, making them law. They can reject the initiatives, sending them to the ballot for voters to decide in November’s election. Or they could pass an alternative to the proposed initiatives, and both versions would go to the ballot.
Also on Friday, Washington state Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, canceled an appointment that he’d made to turn in signatures for an initiative to the Legislature that called for proof of citizenship to be required for voter registration in Washington state.
Walsh said he planned to refile the measure as an initiative to the people and would attempt to get it qualified for the November ballot.
The secretary of state’s office said Friday it would likely take three to four weeks to review the signatures for the Let’s Go Washington initiatives. In the meantime, the office will provide the Legislature with a “provisional certification” to make lawmakers aware of the initiatives.
Assuming that the signatures in support of the initiatives are verified, it will mark the third consecutive year that the Legislature will grapple with issues surrounding parental rights, transgender students and diversity, equity and inclusion in schools.
IL26-001, the initiative focused on parental rights, would roll back changes to state law made during the 2025 legislative session by House Bill 1296.
That bill made revisions to Initiative 2081, the so-called parents’ bill of rights, which lawmakers approved in 2024. Initiative 2081, backed by Let’s Go Washington, established certain rights for the parents of public school students under age 18.
Among the changes in House Bill 1296 was to remove a guarantee for parents to be able to access student medical records. Republicans criticized the Democratic-backed rewrite of Initiative 2081 as undermining the initiative.
Rep. Monica Stonier, the lead sponsor of House Bill 1296, said her understanding is that IL26-001 would not affect key aspects of the law, such as guaranteeing students a school environment free of discrimination, harassment and bullying.
She said it was still too early to say how Democrats, who hold majorities in the House and Senate, might handle the initiative if it does end up before the Legislature.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/unnamed-2-scaled-e1728001712821-1024x597.jpg,,,2026-01-03 15:56:32.924395

(Photo by Tom Brenner/Getty Images)Saturday’s news that the United States has captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and will run the country during a transition is being met with mixed emotions by North Carolina’s elected officials.
U.S. Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican, said in a statement Saturday that President Trump’s decisive action to capture Maduro and bring him to justice is monumental and will save American lives from the drugs brought to our shores.

“Maduro was an illegitimate dictator who has long been wanted in the U.S. on charges of narco-terrorism, corruption, & drug trafficking,” Budd shared on the social media platform X.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-02) said Trump’s military operation was carried out without regard for the U.S. Constitution and without considering the long-term consequences for U.S. security.
“To be clear, Maduro is a despot who stole elections, imprisoned his political opponents, and trampled on the rights and dignity of his people. But the Trump administration cannot unilaterally impose regime change and push the United States to the brink of war. This action endangers our citizens and democracy around the world,” Ross said in a statement.
Ross also criticized the administration for failing to consult with Congress ahead of the military action.

“Using military force to remove a foreign head of state unquestionably requires congressional authorization. Trump ignored that requirement, once again thumbing his nose at our Constitution and Congress. At a minimum, Congress must be fully and transparently briefed and then take appropriate action,” Ross said.
Budd said the actions were within the president’s authority, and praised those responsible for Maduro’s capture.
“God bless our Special Operations Forces who carried out this daring mission, the Air Force, all those with our armed forces & intelligence community who provided support,” said Budd, who serves on the Senate Armed Services committee.
During Saturday’s press briefing, Trump said that the United States will run Venezuela during the transition, and he did not rule out the involvement of American troops.
“We’re not afraid of boots on the ground.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, whose district includes Fort Bragg, praised the arrest of Maduro.
“Accountability finally came. Parents in our community can rest easier knowing a major peddler of fentanyl is off the streets. I’m grateful for the heroes who carried out this mission and praying for their safe return home,” said Hudson on social media. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis (NC-01) praised the operation, but also expressed a desire for more information about what comes in the weeks ahead.
“Protecting American families and ending narcotics trafficking are essential to our national security,” said Davis, a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. “The use of military force demands accountability and transparency, and Congress must be kept fully informed to ensure proper oversight. I expect continued briefings as the situation in Venezuela evolves.”
Protests were planned for downtown Raleigh and other cities on Saturday afternoon.
Mickey Brigham, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, called the military action a war for oil.
“Venezuela has the largest reserves of oil in the world, and the U.S. government is using military aggression to try to steal that wealth,” Brigham said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2251091316-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-03 15:56:32.924395

Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured and flown out of the country after months of stepped-up pressure by Washington. President Donald Trump insisted the U.S. government would run the country at least temporarily and was already doing so.
“If we’re starting another endless war, with no clear national security strategy or need, count me out,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement. “Maduro is a cruel criminal dictator, but President Trump has never sought approval from Congress for war as the Constitution requires — and our military deserves. … The American people deserve — and Congress should demand — facts and clarity.”
U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, also condemned the action.
“Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, but I have seen no evidence that his presidency poses a threat that would justify military action without Congressional authorization, nor have I heard a strategy for the day after and how we will prevent Venezuela from descending into chaos,” said Himes, ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in a statement. “The administration must immediately brief Congress on its plan.”
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, also raised questions about the legality of the move.
“President Trump’s claim that today’s unauthorized, unilateral military strike in Venezuela is a ‘law enforcement’ action against indicted drug trafficker Maduro rings hollow after the president just pardoned a convicted drug dealer, the former president of Honduras, who was serving a 45-year sentence in U.S. prison, 34 days ago,” Courtney said.
On the social media platform X, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., questioned Trump’s motives.
“He is starting an illegal war with Venezuela that Americans didn’t ask for,” he wrote. “This is about satisfying Trump’s vanity, making good on the long standing neocon grudge against Maduro, enriching Trump’s oil industry backers, and distracting voters from Epstein and rising costs.”

President Trump thinks he is above the law. He steals from taxpayers. He thumbs his nose at the law.And now, he is starting an illegal war with Venezuela that Americans didn’t ask for and has nothing to do with our security.  How does going to war in South America help…— Chris Murphy  (@ChrisMurphyCT) January 3, 2026

State Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said the move was “unpopular and illegal.”
“President Trump never laid out the need or the plan to the American people or Congress before attacking a sovereign nation and putting the lives of the men and women of our military at risk,” Duff said in a statement. “This is an unpopular and illegal attack motivated by the vanity of a president focused on TV ratings instead of exploding prices here at home.”
Trump brushed off criticism from U.S. Democratic lawmakers that he did not seek permission from Congress ahead of time and that the strike was illegal. He called his Democratic critics “weak, stupid people” and blamed his political opponents for inflation in the U.S.
He said the operation in Venezuela was “really genius.”
“All they do is complain,” he said of the Democrats.
“They should say, ‘Great job.’ They shouldn’t say, ‘Oh Gee, maybe it’s not constitutional.’ You know, the same old stuff that we’ve been hearing for years and years and years,” Trump said.
The stunning, lightning-fast American military action, which plucked a nation’s sitting leader from office, echoed the U.S. invasion of Panama that led to the surrender and seizure of its leader, Manuel Antonio Noriega, in 1990 — exactly 36 years ago Saturday.
The United Nations said it was “deeply alarmed” by the U.S. strikes and reported detention of Maduro. It expressed concern that the escalation was a violation of international law.
“These developments constitute a dangerous precedent,” Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said in a statement. Dujarric said the U.N. worried about the larger implications for Latin America and the Caribbean and called on “all actors in Venezuela” to respect human rights and the rule of law.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26003525929670-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-03 13:57:05.923743
